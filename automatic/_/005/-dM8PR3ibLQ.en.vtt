worked best for stretching my ears where
does<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.410> crescent<00:02:32.040> like<00:02:32.370> earrings<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.480> like

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
does a crescent like earrings so like

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.190 
does a crescent like earrings so like
almost<00:02:34.200> like<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.470> horseshoe<00:02:34.950> shape<00:02:35.430> type<00:02:35.790> I

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
almost like a horseshoe shape type I

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:44.559 
almost like a horseshoe shape type I
might<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.440> some<00:02:37.650> right<00:02:37.830> here<00:02:38.040> actually<00:02:38.810> well

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.360 

this<00:02:45.569> is<00:02:45.600> amiss<00:02:46.080> like<00:02:46.319> the<00:02:46.500> crescents<00:02:47.160> but

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
this is amiss like the crescents but

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.550 
this is amiss like the crescents but
they<00:02:47.519> didn't<00:02:47.880> they<00:02:48.120> don't<00:02:48.330> have<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:49.230> spikes

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
they didn't they don't have the spikes

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.140 
they didn't they don't have the spikes
they're<00:02:50.130> just<00:02:50.160> pointed<00:02:50.970> ends<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:52.910> found<00:02:53.910> it

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
they're just pointed ends and I found it

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
they're just pointed ends and I found it
easiest<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.110> slide<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:56.610> acrylic<00:02:57.450> earrings

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
easiest to slide in the acrylic earrings

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.640 
easiest to slide in the acrylic earrings
are<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.190> little<00:03:00.060> bit<00:03:00.239> harder<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.780> slide<00:03:01.200> in<00:03:01.440> than

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
are a little bit harder to slide in than

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.680 
are a little bit harder to slide in than
the<00:03:01.799> metal<00:03:02.160> ones<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.910> metal<00:03:03.209> ones<00:03:03.420> usually

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
the metal ones the metal ones usually

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.650 
the metal ones the metal ones usually
slide<00:03:04.320> in<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.680> lot<00:03:04.890> easier<00:03:05.130> um<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:09.060> reason<00:03:09.269> I

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
slide in a lot easier um the reason I

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.080 
slide in a lot easier um the reason I
like<00:03:09.900> crescents<00:03:10.470> best<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.980> cuz<00:03:11.250> i<00:03:11.400> don't<00:03:11.880> i

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
like crescents best is cuz i don't i

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.210 
like crescents best is cuz i don't i
don't<00:03:12.150> i'm<00:03:12.810> not<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:13.140> fan<00:03:13.470> of<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.769> tapers

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
don't i'm not a fan of the tapers

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.150 
don't i'm not a fan of the tapers
because<00:03:14.760> if<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.060> notice<00:03:15.480> bigger<00:03:16.470> skinny<00:03:16.950> and

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
because if you notice bigger skinny and

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.210 
because if you notice bigger skinny and
like<00:03:17.430> although<00:03:18.000> you're<00:03:18.540> slowly<00:03:18.900> like<00:03:19.350> working

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
like although you're slowly like working

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.900 
like although you're slowly like working
up<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.730> jump<00:03:21.030> it's<00:03:21.239> still<00:03:21.540> like<00:03:21.750> a

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
up to the jump it's still like a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.069 
up to the jump it's still like a
significant<00:03:23.910> jump<00:03:23.970> i<00:03:24.540> don't<00:03:24.840> know<00:03:24.900> i<00:03:24.930> just

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
significant jump i don't know i just

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.470 
significant jump i don't know i just
felt<00:03:25.470> like<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.769> crescents<00:03:26.370> split<00:03:26.760> in<00:03:26.910> easier

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
felt like the crescents split in easier

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.250 
felt like the crescents split in easier
um<00:03:28.290> i<00:03:31.640> don't<00:03:32.640> suggest<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.660> whole<00:03:33.840> flares

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
um i don't suggest the whole flares

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.030 
um i don't suggest the whole flares
double<00:03:35.010> flares<00:03:35.310> are<00:03:35.820> like<00:03:36.829> where<00:03:37.829> they're

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
double flares are like where they're

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.920 
double flares are like where they're
bigger<00:03:38.370> on<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.790> ends<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.269> skinnier<00:03:39.720> in<00:03:39.750> the

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
bigger on the ends and skinnier in the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.080 
bigger on the ends and skinnier in the
middle<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.290> reason<00:03:40.620> i<00:03:40.709> don't<00:03:40.769> suggest<00:03:41.489> this

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
middle the reason i don't suggest this

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.110 
middle the reason i don't suggest this
is<00:03:42.540> because<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.680> flares<00:03:44.160> are<00:03:44.549> normally

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
is because the flares are normally

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.300 
is because the flares are normally
bigger<00:03:45.480> than<00:03:45.959> besides<00:03:46.560> you're<00:03:46.769> trying<00:03:47.070> to

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
bigger than besides you're trying to

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.510 
bigger than besides you're trying to
jump<00:03:47.579> to

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
jump to

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.820 
jump to
and<00:03:48.850> it<00:03:49.540> hurts<00:03:49.750> like<00:03:49.900> hell<00:03:50.230> if<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.560> try<00:03:50.770> and

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
and it hurts like hell if you try and

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.330 
and it hurts like hell if you try and
use<00:03:51.070> players<00:03:52.050> single<00:03:53.050> players<00:03:53.290> are<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.560> cause

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
use players single players are a cause

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.070 
use players single players are a cause

to be at for a while so yeah um um if
you<00:04:12.550> like<00:04:12.580> tunnels<00:04:13.240> like<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.690> have<00:04:13.990> these<00:04:14.800> are

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
you like tunnels like I have these are

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.170 
you like tunnels like I have these are
all<00:04:15.250> ticket<00:04:15.670> out<00:04:15.820> for<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.770> it's<00:04:17.770> my<00:04:18.670> tunnels

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
all ticket out for you it's my tunnels

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.950 
all ticket out for you it's my tunnels
are<00:04:19.570> actually<00:04:20.340> double<00:04:21.340> flares<00:04:21.790> but<00:04:22.540> the

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
are actually double flares but the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.010 
are actually double flares but the
reason<00:04:23.140> they're<00:04:23.650> so<00:04:24.100> easy<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.670> get<00:04:24.940> in<00:04:25.180> is<00:04:25.450> cuz

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
reason they're so easy to get in is cuz

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.610 
reason they're so easy to get in is cuz
they're<00:04:26.920> silicon<00:04:27.700> so<00:04:28.120> they're<00:04:28.360> squishy<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.290> I

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
they're silicon so they're squishy and I

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.550 
they're silicon so they're squishy and I
can<00:04:29.950> just<00:04:30.450> roll<00:04:31.450> it<00:04:31.690> up<00:04:33.390> so<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.630> so<00:04:35.080> like<00:04:35.380> the

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
can just roll it up so it so like the

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.740 
can just roll it up so it so like the
flare<00:04:35.890> isn't<00:04:36.280> even<00:04:36.490> in<00:04:36.640> the<00:04:36.670> way<00:04:36.970> and<00:04:37.210> just<00:04:37.390> put

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
flare isn't even in the way and just put

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.980 
flare isn't even in the way and just put
it<00:04:37.780> in<00:04:37.960> my<00:04:38.110> ear<00:04:38.320> see<00:04:38.680> my<00:04:38.890> lovely<00:04:39.280> ho<00:04:39.990> sniffing

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
it in my ear see my lovely ho sniffing

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.020 
it in my ear see my lovely ho sniffing
pretty<00:04:41.260> ain't<00:04:41.470> it<00:04:41.850> but<00:04:42.850> yeah<00:04:43.650> I'm<00:04:44.730> pretty<00:04:45.730> sure

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
pretty ain't it but yeah I'm pretty sure

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.740 
pretty ain't it but yeah I'm pretty sure
I'm<00:04:46.270> done<00:04:46.540> stretching<00:04:46.990> my<00:04:47.320> ears<00:04:47.350> because<00:04:48.750> once

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
I'm done stretching my ears because once

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.570 
I'm done stretching my ears because once
you<00:04:49.960> start<00:04:50.320> getting<00:04:50.500> into<00:04:50.770> double<00:04:51.340> zero

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
you start getting into double zero

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.910 
you start getting into double zero
that's<00:04:52.030> when<00:04:52.390> your<00:04:52.660> ears<00:04:52.900> will<00:04:53.320> not<00:04:53.590> go<00:04:53.890> back

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
that's when your ears will not go back

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.180 
that's when your ears will not go back
um<00:04:55.320> they<00:04:56.320> say<00:04:56.680> for<00:04:57.220> two<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.790> your<00:04:58.450> ears<00:04:58.720> will

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
um they say for two to your ears will

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.800
