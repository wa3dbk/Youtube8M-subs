00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.420
i'm kelsey mays from cars.com kia
redesign the sedona for 2006 and in the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.389
intervening years it's evolved to
produce a little more power as well as

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.650
an entry-level short wheel base model
this is the long-wheelbase to donate TX

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.010
it's a higher of two trim levels there's
also a very similar model in the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.570
entourage from Hyundai cabin quality is
typical for a minivan which means the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.560
emphasis on durability not necessarily
quality and as such dashboard plastics

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.800
and kinda dull and the center controls
don't really have the premium damping

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.579
quality you get a honda odyssey or
nissan quest usability those much more

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.510
competitive

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.160
there are two separate glove departments
plenty of cup holders lower compartments

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.989
down here the center tray here collapses
to leave pass through you can throw a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.890
personal laptop bag down here but there
isn't is an actual center console

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.390
compartment here to hold stuff some
other minivans offer that the power

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.120
seats have adjustments along the door
that's probably the best location for

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.260
these that's easier than climbing around
the crevices down by your side

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.680
unfortunately they don't go that far
back and so if you're much taller than

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.650
six feet you'll probably find the
driver's seat has to be all the way back

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.790
and you can even use some more room at
that point the steering wheel tilts but

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.150
doesn't telescope wheels in the honda
odyssey $YEAR toyota sienna both

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.869
telescope there are power adjustable
pedals so that helps the situation a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.590
little bit again they're optional

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.490
most nicely equipped minivans offer
power sliding doors and the power

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.090
tailgate so does the sedona one
convenient feature is that this allows

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.960
you to deactivate the motors themselves
so they still work from the key fob but

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.460
now kids want to run up and fling these
things open for themselves the motors

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.630
won't resist them

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.369
that's a nice feature to have the second
row as captains chairs adult-friendly

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.670
room back here if you don't want to use
the center aisle to get back

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.420
there's a convenient fold and tumble
feature that kind of gives you a pass

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.060
through here not as flexible as some of
the others we've seen the lettuce if the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.360
seats moved up then try to do this

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.670
there just isn't that much room back
here even worse is if the armrests are

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.930
down in the seat just gets completely
stuck

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.930
so it would be nice to see a little more
flexibility with this there grows like

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.230
most that means that the cushions are
thin and pretty low to the ground kids

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.480
won't mind it back here and they
actually get their own controls for the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.190
power third quarter windows

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.040
that's pretty rare in a minivan the
third row bulbs into the floor it's

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.370
pretty easy you can do this with
practically with one hand this is a

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.660
pretty typical minivan feature it folds
in a 60-40 split so if you need to throw

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.739
more cargo back here but still want to
put a kid back you could do that the

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.359
second row folds down the seats are also
removable or they tumbled forward hook

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.519
into the b-pillar not as convenient as
the quests fold to the floor seats or

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.910
the stone go seats in $YEAR chrysler
town and country but pretty competitive

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.530
with the rest of the segment maximum
cargo volume in the long-wheelbase model

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.069
is just over a hundred forty cubic feet
that beats most crossovers and its

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.669
competitive with the minivan segment his
example isn't the quietest for the most

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:09.889
luxurious or the fastest of the group

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.700
it is however one of the cheapest the
sedona starts in the low twenties and

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.299
even a fully-loaded model barely tops
thirty-two thousand dollars for that

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.030
sort of money you are going to get a
navigation system or a backup camera

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.180
that you will some of the competitors
but you will save thousands over a

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.810
well-equipped sienna or odyssey
considering car shoppers and minivans

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.739
are like Packers fans and brett favre
value might be the best way to keep some

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:31.110
of the more

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.620
