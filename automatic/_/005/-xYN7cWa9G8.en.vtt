00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello hello hello everyone 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.770
 This is a review of textures and warmup resources. 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.320
 the screen today we have is very very 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.950
 Unusual resource pack called 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.210
 titanfall he is no longer associated with 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.750
 change some blocks and of sv. 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.630
 namely set to change all 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.910
 types of weapons and of course the main part 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.880
 I'll show you the main part a little later. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.149
 Now let's see and exactly what 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.730
 Here we have changed 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.770
 the main thing in inventory of course is stewed 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.440
 mushrooms don't understand why you probably 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.989
 something not like these stewed here 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.329
 mushrooms then we have a sound like that 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.969
 unusual kind of sniper rifle that 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.430
 whether the arrow itself looks like a bullet 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.610
 but as we see it flies out as usual 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.730
 arrows further us goes iron sword we 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.050
 can they defend themselves like this without a butt 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.609
 type cold and so they fight on 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.729
 goes wooden sword 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:11.450
 what's strange is a stone pistol here 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.680
 this diamond and gold of you already 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.680
 put the very last place to the ears 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.299
 more interesting book as we see synthol 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.479
 titanfall all right 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.970
 apparently and even playing on the eksbox but i 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.650
 This did not meet more like shadows 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.329
 be transformers 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.689
 well let's all make sure that we are 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:40.500
 this is not just a resource pack as you can see 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.930
 The picture has not changed, although I was expecting 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.360
 Satva we have a resource pack unusual and 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.119
 we already have such a room 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.479
 soon we will meet more often 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.540
 and more often he has it even with us 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.060
 not done the same fast and 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.780
 let's finish everything all great mushrooms 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.640
 gone can also show potions here 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.640
 so go to zero bubble near 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.179
 and and and we still have a very interesting look 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.989
 the books on the last page 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:17.170
 for well how interesting they are just a little bit 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.480
 changed color as we see from such 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.790
 pink 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.549
 On such more blue well and let's 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:30.370
 let's get down to the main thing as you can see 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:32.620
 us chests there all sorts of nonsense 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.530
 devices for the game minecraft 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.250
 also where we have and T-shirts 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.170
 but from the outside they have not changed but 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.620
 from the inside from the inside to changed so 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.760
 Open the chest and what we see here this 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.540
 the power of this 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.120
 and the interest here is kvass is just about the past i 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.920
 I say these are respacks for 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.120
 what is expected to be seen soon 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.700
 cool all the same yes more 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.540
 Agree like transformer notes 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.730
 I didn't play this game instantly there either 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.860
 we have with transformers with it all 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.790
 tied up in the chest of the tender we have the same 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.500
 as soon as we see it is shortened together 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.930
 simple one-time what super we 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.190
 the same as in the ender goes further 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.340

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.650

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.880

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.200

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.170

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.349
 oh and you and you look at the pictures then not 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:40.930

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:42.700
 some kind of uniqueness workbench but 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.190
 agree so will play much 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.310
 In short so set the resource show 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.530
 nothing really changes well yes 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.400
 Inventory a little blue 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.590
 marked 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.500
