00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:14.499 
at the nokia n97 actually this is a

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:15.989 
at the nokia n97 actually this is a
second<00:00:14.980> look<00:00:15.099> since<00:00:15.429> we<00:00:15.549> first<00:00:15.820> saw<00:00:15.940> the

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:15.999 
second look since we first saw the

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.510 
second look since we first saw the
smartphone<00:00:16.570> at<00:00:16.750> CES<00:00:17.350> and<00:00:17.680> we've<00:00:18.040> been<00:00:18.220> waiting

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
smartphone at CES and we've been waiting

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.910 
smartphone at CES and we've been waiting
ever<00:00:18.670> since<00:00:18.910> then<00:00:19.360> for<00:00:19.720> the<00:00:19.810> 97<00:00:20.590> to<00:00:20.650> come<00:00:20.800> out

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
ever since then for the 97 to come out

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.400 
ever since then for the 97 to come out
now<00:00:21.760> that<00:00:21.940> I<00:00:21.970> have<00:00:22.240> it<00:00:22.270> I'm<00:00:22.630> actually<00:00:23.020> a<00:00:23.260> little

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
now that I have it I'm actually a little

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.830 
now that I have it I'm actually a little
disappointed<00:00:23.880> I'll<00:00:24.880> start<00:00:25.180> with<00:00:25.330> the<00:00:25.450> design

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
disappointed I'll start with the design

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.720 
disappointed I'll start with the design
first<00:00:26.200> the<00:00:26.680> good<00:00:26.860> news<00:00:27.010> is<00:00:27.040> that<00:00:27.250> Nokia

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
first the good news is that Nokia

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.520 
first the good news is that Nokia
finally<00:00:28.030> added<00:00:28.330> a<00:00:28.420> touch<00:00:28.660> screen<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:29.200> its<00:00:29.320> end

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530 
finally added a touch screen to its end

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.069 
finally added a touch screen to its end
series<00:00:29.890> of<00:00:30.010> smartphones<00:00:30.520> so<00:00:31.180> that<00:00:31.330> n97<00:00:31.840> is

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
series of smartphones so that n97 is

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.419 
series of smartphones so that n97 is
easier<00:00:32.379> to<00:00:32.529> navigate<00:00:32.679> than<00:00:33.129> some<00:00:33.280> of<00:00:33.370> the

00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:33.429 
easier to navigate than some of the

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:35.910 
easier to navigate than some of the
older<00:00:33.730> models<00:00:33.879> like<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.300> n95<00:00:34.719> it's<00:00:35.440> nice<00:00:35.710> and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
older models like the n95 it's nice and

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.430 
older models like the n95 it's nice and
large<00:00:36.070> at<00:00:36.339> 3.5<00:00:36.999> inches<00:00:37.480> and<00:00:37.749> colors<00:00:38.019> and<00:00:38.050> text

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
large at 3.5 inches and colors and text

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.110 
large at 3.5 inches and colors and text
are<00:00:38.530> bright<00:00:38.769> and<00:00:38.800> clear<00:00:39.339> but<00:00:39.909> when<00:00:40.030> you

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
are bright and clear but when you

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.700 
are bright and clear but when you
compare<00:00:40.269> it<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.600> other<00:00:40.659> models<00:00:41.140> like<00:00:41.530> the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
compare it to other models like the

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.299 
compare it to other models like the
iPhone<00:00:42.129> and<00:00:42.370> palm<00:00:42.609> pre<00:00:43.030> it's<00:00:43.629> not<00:00:43.809> as<00:00:43.989> sharp

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
iPhone and palm pre it's not as sharp

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.040 
iPhone and palm pre it's not as sharp
also<00:00:45.309> the<00:00:45.429> n97<00:00:45.909> uses<00:00:46.359> a<00:00:46.390> resistive

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
also the n97 uses a resistive

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.689 
also the n97 uses a resistive
touchscreen<00:00:47.559> instead<00:00:47.890> of<00:00:47.980> a<00:00:48.100> capacitive

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
touchscreen instead of a capacitive

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.639 
touchscreen instead of a capacitive
touchscreen<00:00:49.210> so<00:00:49.420> it's<00:00:49.569> not<00:00:49.719> as<00:00:49.899> sensitive<00:00:50.230> to

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
touchscreen so it's not as sensitive to

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.290 
touchscreen so it's not as sensitive to
the<00:00:51.039> touch<00:00:51.219> and<00:00:51.280> you<00:00:51.550> have<00:00:51.640> to<00:00:51.760> use<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.059> stylus

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
the touch and you have to use the stylus

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.899 
the touch and you have to use the stylus
for<00:00:52.690> more<00:00:52.870> accuracy<00:00:53.579> also<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.699> touch

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
for more accuracy also the touch

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.880 
for more accuracy also the touch
interface<00:00:55.089> isn't<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.809> greatest<00:00:55.899> on<00:00:56.289> the<00:00:56.379> n97

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
interface isn't the greatest on the n97

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.549 
interface isn't the greatest on the n97
some<00:00:57.640> of<00:00:57.729> the<00:00:57.789> menu<00:00:58.149> items<00:00:58.479> require<00:00:58.809> one<00:00:59.260> tap

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
some of the menu items require one tap

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.739 
some of the menu items require one tap
to<00:01:00.039> launch<00:01:00.309> while<00:01:00.550> others<00:01:00.850> require<00:01:01.059> two<00:01:01.510> taps

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
to launch while others require two taps

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.350 
to launch while others require two taps
so<00:01:02.469> it<00:01:02.530> is<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.620> little<00:01:02.920> confusing<00:01:03.360> and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
so it is a little confusing and

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.120 
so it is a little confusing and
scrolling<00:01:04.780> through<00:01:05.079> long<00:01:05.259> list<00:01:05.530> isn't<00:01:05.740> part

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
scrolling through long list isn't part

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.590 
scrolling through long list isn't part
of<00:01:06.189> smooth<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.729> I<00:01:06.880> definitely<00:01:07.270> miss<00:01:07.570> the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
of smooth and I definitely miss the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.840 
of smooth and I definitely miss the
multi<00:01:08.350> touch<00:01:08.500> capabilities<00:01:09.159> of<00:01:09.189> the<00:01:09.399> palm<00:01:09.610> pre

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
multi touch capabilities of the palm pre

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.990 
multi touch capabilities of the palm pre
and<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:10.270> iphone<00:01:10.750> when<00:01:10.990> viewing<00:01:11.259> web<00:01:11.500> pages

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
and the iphone when viewing web pages

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.030 
and the iphone when viewing web pages
the<00:01:13.000> n97<00:01:13.540> does<00:01:13.869> have<00:01:14.079> a<00:01:14.110> nice<00:01:14.290> slider<00:01:14.500> design

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
the n97 does have a nice slider design

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.399 
the n97 does have a nice slider design
though<00:01:15.659> pushing<00:01:16.659> this<00:01:16.750> screen<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.289> right

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
though pushing this screen to the right

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.440 
though pushing this screen to the right
exposes<00:01:18.070> a<00:01:18.130> full<00:01:18.340> qwerty<00:01:18.549> keyboard<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.299> as

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
exposes a full qwerty keyboard and as

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.899 
exposes a full qwerty keyboard and as
you<00:01:19.570> can<00:01:19.719> see<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:20.560> screen<00:01:20.829> tilts<00:01:21.159> at<00:01:21.399> an<00:01:21.520> angle

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
you can see the screen tilts at an angle

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.520 
you can see the screen tilts at an angle
so<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.090> makes<00:01:22.299> it<00:01:22.390> easier<00:01:22.689> to<00:01:22.719> see<00:01:22.960> pages<00:01:23.259> when

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
so it makes it easier to see pages when

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.170 
so it makes it easier to see pages when
you<00:01:23.649> have<00:01:23.829> the<00:01:23.979> phone<00:01:24.100> sitting<00:01:24.369> on<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.549> table<00:01:24.759> or

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
you have the phone sitting on a table or

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.420 
you have the phone sitting on a table or
when<00:01:25.329> you're<00:01:25.479> typing<00:01:25.869> messages<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:27.189> slider

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
when you're typing messages the slider

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.980 
when you're typing messages the slider
mechanism<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:28.180> smoother<00:01:28.509> than<00:01:28.539> some<00:01:28.840> of<00:01:28.930> the

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
mechanism is smoother than some of the

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.630 
mechanism is smoother than some of the
other<00:01:29.140> smartphones<00:01:29.770> I've<00:01:29.920> tested<00:01:30.340> like<00:01:30.520> the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
other smartphones I've tested like the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.020 
other smartphones I've tested like the
HTC<00:01:31.000> touch<00:01:31.359> pro2<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.979> far<00:01:33.189> as<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.369> keyboard<00:01:33.820> I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
HTC touch pro2 as far as the keyboard I

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.760 
HTC touch pro2 as far as the keyboard I
have<00:01:34.149> some<00:01:34.299> mixed<00:01:34.570> feelings<00:01:34.719> about<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.469> the

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
have some mixed feelings about it the

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.679 
have some mixed feelings about it the
buttons<00:01:36.070> are<00:01:36.189> our<00:01:36.520> nice<00:01:36.850> size<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.479> there's<00:01:37.630> a

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
buttons are our nice size and there's a

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.120 
buttons are our nice size and there's a
good<00:01:37.810> amount<00:01:37.960> of<00:01:38.200> spacing<00:01:38.619> between<00:01:38.770> them

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
good amount of spacing between them

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.609 
good amount of spacing between them
they're<00:01:40.000> also<00:01:40.180> really<00:01:40.509> easy<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:41.020> press<00:01:41.289> and

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
they're also really easy to press and

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.020 
they're also really easy to press and
I'd<00:01:41.710> say<00:01:41.920> it's<00:01:42.070> one<00:01:42.219> of<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.399> best<00:01:42.549> keyboards

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
I'd say it's one of the best keyboards
