I've already said ma processing the

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.490 
I've already said ma processing the
hardness<00:00:41.400> is<00:00:42.510> by<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.570> way<00:00:43.780> it<00:00:43.840> depends<00:00:44.320> on<00:00:44.440> the

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
hardness is by the way it depends on the

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.950 
hardness is by the way it depends on the

and<00:02:04.990> because<00:02:05.830> it's<00:02:06.010> a<00:02:06.100> rose<00:02:06.370> I'm<00:02:06.730> gonna<00:02:07.600> make

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
and because it's a rose I'm gonna make

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.499 
and because it's a rose I'm gonna make
the<00:02:08.440> lightness<00:02:08.890> I'm<00:02:09.220> gonna<00:02:09.940> reduce<00:02:10.300> the

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
the lightness I'm gonna reduce the

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.800 
the lightness I'm gonna reduce the
lateness<00:02:10.930> so<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.560> looks<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:12.160> gives<00:02:12.460> the<00:02:12.810> velvet

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
lateness so it looks it gives the velvet

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:23.000 
lateness so it looks it gives the velvet
fill<00:02:14.170> or<00:02:15.150> look

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.630
