00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 we want to share the treatment that 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.690
 you are doing for the management of 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.280
 the fly so you can tell us what the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.580
 process of fumigation and what is 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.580
 fumigating 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.460
 how many handling this treatment 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.310
 concept 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.660
 and how have you seen the control of the fly 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.660
 that the truth 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.730
 the purchase it offers when we 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.760
 completing 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.770
 tell us hugo please how is how is 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.980
 the process 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.690
 here we are preparing to locate everything 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.210
 this we are working with 5 liters is 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.210
 enough to get in this area 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.560
 if you have the average on the lid if 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.600
 we apply the pseudo oriol for 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.650
 odor control and fly 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.650
 in stables 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:17.700
 and that's how many aplicas is for the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.700
 5 liters are 20 cents when I 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.650
 and before how was the fly population 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.520
 in arriving 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.740
 stable is relatively new but 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.570
 we worked there did not apply these 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.800
 micro what we will do is a quantity of not 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.970
 it has an end 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.970
 this is very good control 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.640
 yes 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.549
 ending 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:02.360
 if this is so, no animal there are people to 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.620
 pick up went to composure 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.620
 there is no smell 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:16.130
 we can not see here usually already 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.660
 stop in the in the meshes if there is no 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.210
 really fly as well as see and pass in 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:29.120
 350 cows 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:31.760
 day the first floods arrive in 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.660
 counts and sprays and then comes the other 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.660
 afternoon session 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.500
 is applied throughout the barn I'm going to 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.890
 make the application 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.170
 they proceed to pick up and this is the last 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.680
 batch manure is collected after 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.680
 last batch 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.010
 here we can see the compostera 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.570
 they have been going down on the tractor 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.570
 then problem 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.440
 i 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.270
 and we can see 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.270
