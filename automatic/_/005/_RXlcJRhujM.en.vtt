first thing that we're going to do is
we're<00:02:44.810> going<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.490> find<00:02:46.490> an<00:02:46.700> area<00:02:46.880> in<00:02:47.209> which<00:02:47.840> the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
we're going to find an area in which the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.920 
we're going to find an area in which the
animals<00:02:48.740> seem<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:48.980> be<00:02:49.250> in<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.480> seemed<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.810> be

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
animals seem to be in it seemed to be

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.780 
animals seem to be in it seemed to be
fluctuating<00:02:51.470> back<00:02:51.770> and<00:02:51.950> forth<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:52.310> between<00:02:52.640> it

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
fluctuating back and forth in between it

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.250 
fluctuating back and forth in between it
so<00:02:53.450> you're<00:02:53.600> going<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.780> want<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:53.989> look<00:02:54.110> for

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
so you're going to want to look for

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.140 
so you're going to want to look for
ridgelines<00:02:54.680> you're<00:02:55.519> going<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.700> look<00:02:55.820> for<00:02:56.000> food

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
ridgelines you're going to look for food

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.410 
ridgelines you're going to look for food
plots<00:02:56.620> you're<00:02:57.620> going<00:02:57.769> to<00:02:57.830> look<00:02:58.010> for<00:02:58.420> streams

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
plots you're going to look for streams

now<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:31.870> could<00:04:32.110> just<00:04:32.349> leave<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.680> like<00:04:32.830> this

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
now you could just leave it like this

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.899 
now you could just leave it like this
and<00:04:33.840> that's<00:04:34.840> fine<00:04:36.090> but<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:38.139> contrast<00:04:38.849> is<00:04:39.849> a

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
and that's fine but the contrast is a

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.369 
and that's fine but the contrast is a
little<00:04:40.180> bit<00:04:40.300> better<00:04:40.419> if<00:04:40.629> you<00:04:40.719> add<00:04:40.870> some<00:04:40.900> sand

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
little bit better if you add some sand

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:50.650 
little bit better if you add some sand
to<00:04:42.180> ash<00:04:43.180> yes<00:04:43.449> it<00:04:43.629> I<00:04:43.749> brush<00:04:43.990> them<00:04:44.020> out

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:05:25.790 

we're<00:04:51.260> just<00:04:51.470> going<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.650> add<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:52.040> it

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.500 

I<00:07:02.430> have<00:07:03.060> a<00:07:03.090> stream<00:07:03.560> that's<00:07:04.560> behind<00:07:04.919> I<00:07:05.330> have<00:07:06.330> the
