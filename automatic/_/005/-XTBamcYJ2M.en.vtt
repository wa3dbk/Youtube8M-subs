00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the most important thing is the artist

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.960 
the most important thing is the artist
using<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> brush<00:01:26.220> rather<00:01:26.430> than<00:01:26.700> whether<00:01:26.880> or

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
using the brush rather than whether or

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.490 
using the brush rather than whether or
not<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.240> rabbit<00:01:27.479> hair<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.869> goat<00:01:28.080> hair<00:01:28.110> in

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
not it's rabbit hair of goat hair in

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.819 
not it's rabbit hair of goat hair in
your<00:01:28.590> brush<00:01:29.150> that<00:01:30.150> said<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.200> think<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
your brush that said I do think that

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.010 
your brush that said I do think that
shape<00:01:32.280> isn't<00:01:32.670> very<00:01:32.850> important<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.479> brushes<00:01:33.930> in

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
shape isn't very important on brushes in

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.899 
shape isn't very important on brushes in
the<00:01:34.110> type<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.290> effects<00:01:34.650> you're<00:01:34.799> going<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:35.369> so

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
the type of effects you're going for so

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:36.980 
the type of effects you're going for so
we're<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.180> cover<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> three<00:01:36.810> main

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
we're going to cover like the three main

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.749 
we're going to cover like the three main
types<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.350> brushes<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.920> specialty<00:01:38.400> brush

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
types of brushes and a specialty brush

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.850 
types of brushes and a specialty brush
the<00:01:39.329> first<00:01:39.570> are<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.170> simply<00:01:40.409> called<00:01:40.590> round

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the first are just simply called round

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.920 
the first are just simply called round
rounded<00:01:41.490> brushes<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.390> very<00:01:42.540> simple

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
rounded brushes and this is very simple

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.569 
rounded brushes and this is very simple
they're<00:01:43.409> round<00:01:43.740> they<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.340> know<00:01:44.460> they

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
they're round they have a you know they

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.460 
they're round they have a you know they
make<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> circular<00:01:45.420> shape<00:01:45.630> at<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> top<00:01:45.960> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
make a circular shape at the top and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.050 
make a circular shape at the top and
these<00:01:47.189> are<00:01:47.310> really<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:47.610> good<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.030> like

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
these are really really good for like

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.789 
these are really really good for like
more<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.329> smoothing<00:01:48.960> edges<00:01:49.409> now<00:01:49.590> when<00:01:49.710> you

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
more like smoothing edges now when you

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.319 
more like smoothing edges now when you
want<00:01:49.920> really<00:01:50.100> really<00:01:50.399> harsh<00:01:50.670> tones<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.210> these

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
want really really harsh tones and these

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.149 
want really really harsh tones and these
come<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> variety<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:52.110> sizes<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:53.009> smaller

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
come in a variety of sizes the smaller

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.440 
come in a variety of sizes the smaller
ones<00:01:53.549> will<00:01:53.670> tend<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> little<00:01:54.090> more<00:01:54.329> of

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
ones will tend to have a little more of

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.359 
ones will tend to have a little more of
a<00:01:54.540> point<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.990> them<00:01:55.140> which<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.680> better<00:01:56.189> for

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
a point to them which is better for

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.780 
a point to them which is better for
detail<00:01:56.700> work<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.990> next<00:01:58.229> brush<00:01:58.439> are<00:01:58.790> flats

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
detail work the next brush are flats

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.819 
detail work the next brush are flats
this<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.750> because<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.200> flat<00:02:01.409> top

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
this is this because it's a flat top

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.560 
this is this because it's a flat top
right<00:02:02.159> across<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.759> side<00:02:03.180> there<00:02:03.360> you've<00:02:03.450> got<00:02:03.479> a

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
right across the side there you've got a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.270 
right across the side there you've got a
90<00:02:03.840> degree<00:02:03.990> angles<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.500> each<00:02:04.619> side<00:02:04.920> there

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
90 degree angles on each side there

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.010 
90 degree angles on each side there
these<00:02:05.759> are<00:02:05.939> really<00:02:06.180> good<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:06.450> especially

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
these are really good for especially

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.680 
these are really good for especially
being<00:02:07.170> your<00:02:07.320> more<00:02:07.469> forceful<00:02:08.239> brush<00:02:09.239> strokes

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
being your more forceful brush strokes

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.180 
being your more forceful brush strokes
they're<00:02:10.229> also<00:02:10.440> really<00:02:10.679> good<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:11.009> kind<00:02:11.069> of

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
they're also really good for kind of

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.930 
they're also really good for kind of
wedging<00:02:11.610> or<00:02:11.730> dragging<00:02:12.230> color<00:02:13.230> around<00:02:13.530> you

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
wedging or dragging color around you

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.270 
wedging or dragging color around you
Hasaan<00:02:14.710> definitely<00:02:15.710> a<00:02:15.740> little<00:02:15.830> more<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.130> like

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
Hasaan definitely a little more of like

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.670 
Hasaan definitely a little more of like
kind<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.460> of<00:02:16.610> course<00:02:17.200> sort<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.260> sending<00:02:18.500> in<00:02:18.620> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
kind of of course sort of sending in the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.220 
kind of of course sort of sending in the
infantry<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.280> brushes<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.750> next<00:02:20.990> one<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.200> a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
infantry of brushes the next one is a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.020 
infantry of brushes the next one is a
filbert<00:02:21.530> which<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.280> some<00:02:22.460> ways<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:22.730> kind<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:22.940> a

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
filbert which in some ways is kind of a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.820 
filbert which in some ways is kind of a
hybrid<00:02:23.210> between<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.720> round<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.530> flat

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
hybrid between the round and the flat

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.560 
hybrid between the round and the flat
meaning<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.850> it's<00:02:26.030> still<00:02:26.210> still<00:02:26.540> pretty

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
meaning that it's still still pretty

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.500 
meaning that it's still still pretty
flat<00:02:27.290> like<00:02:27.950> like<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.640> flat<00:02:28.820> brush<00:02:29.030> here<00:02:29.330> it's

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
flat like like the flat brush here it's

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.380 
flat like like the flat brush here it's
not<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.750> know<00:02:29.870> super<00:02:30.200> thick<00:02:31.000> but<00:02:32.000> at<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.210> same

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
not you know super thick but at the same

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.960 
not you know super thick but at the same
time<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:33.530> doesn't<00:02:33.830> have<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.130> square<00:02:34.430> top<00:02:34.700> it

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
time it doesn't have the square top it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.610 
time it doesn't have the square top it
has<00:02:35.270> a<00:02:35.300> little<00:02:35.450> more<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.750> tapered<00:02:35.960> slightly

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
has a little more of a tapered slightly

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.590 
has a little more of a tapered slightly
rounded<00:02:37.220> edge<00:02:37.430> kind<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.790> more<00:02:37.910> 45<00:02:38.330> degree

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
rounded edge kind of more 45 degree

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.330 
rounded edge kind of more 45 degree
angles<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.380> again<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:40.010> can<00:02:40.130> get<00:02:40.220> these

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
angles and again you can get these

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.100 
angles and again you can get these
brushes<00:02:40.640> in<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:40.910> variety<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.300> sizes<00:02:41.600> generally
