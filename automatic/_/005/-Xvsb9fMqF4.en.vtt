especially when I'm doing my fly cam
videos<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.100> really<00:00:23.519> needed<00:00:23.939> something<00:00:24.210> which

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
videos I really needed something which

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.990 
videos I really needed something which
is<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> wide-angle<00:00:25.109> lens<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.849> is

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
is a wide-angle lens and this one is

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.150 
is a wide-angle lens and this one is
pretty<00:00:27.300> much<00:00:27.769> wide-angle<00:00:28.769> lens<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.039> I'm

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
pretty much wide-angle lens that I'm

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.830 
pretty much wide-angle lens that I'm
looking<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.820> which<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.240> 20<00:00:30.660> millimeter

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
looking for which is the 20 millimeter

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.560 
looking for which is the 20 millimeter
f1<00:00:31.470> pointer<00:00:31.769> as<00:00:31.890> well<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.430> think<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.420> will

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
f1 pointer as well and I think this will

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.810

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
nice case now I also went ahead and did

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.460 
nice case now I also went ahead and did
a<00:01:25.920> 30<00:01:26.250> millimeter<00:01:26.630> lens<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.869> purchased

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
a 30 millimeter lens that I purchased

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.620 
a 30 millimeter lens that I purchased
before<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.549> I'll<00:01:29.670> put<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> link<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
before so I'll put the link for the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.440 
before so I'll put the link for the
video<00:01:30.780> down<00:01:31.140> below<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.250> also<00:01:32.400> came<00:01:32.850> with

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450

video down below and it also came with
the<00:01:33.540> same<00:01:33.780> case<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.470> guys<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.829> see<00:01:35.130> here

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the same case as you guys can see here

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.700 
the same case as you guys can see here
so<00:01:36.060> let's<00:01:36.869> go<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.380> open<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:39.200> there<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.530> it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
so let's go and open this there we go it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.670 
so let's go and open this there we go it
is<00:01:40.829> actually<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.250> pretty<00:01:41.640> heavy<00:01:42.119> lens<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.500> let's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
is actually a pretty heavy lens so let's

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.090 
is actually a pretty heavy lens so let's
go<00:01:43.829> ahead<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.070> take<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.579> off<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:46.009> here<00:01:47.009> is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
go ahead and take this off so here is

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.340 
go ahead and take this off so here is
the<00:01:47.250> actual<00:01:47.700> lens<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.869> actually<00:01:49.020> has<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the actual lens and it actually has a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.920 
the actual lens and it actually has a
really<00:01:49.740> good<00:01:50.070> weight<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.060> I'd<00:01:51.750> done

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
really good weight to this and I'd done

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.770 
really good weight to this and I'd done
say<00:01:52.110> Sigma<00:01:52.500> right<00:01:52.649> here<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.509> does<00:01:54.630> have

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
say Sigma right here and so it does have

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.719 
say Sigma right here and so it does have
this<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.140> nice<00:01:55.350> lens<00:01:55.770> right<00:01:56.070> there<00:01:56.280> guys

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
this really nice lens right there guys

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.060 
this really nice lens right there guys
now<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> really<00:01:57.930> wide<00:01:58.409> angle<00:01:58.829> lens

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
now this is a really wide angle lens

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.740 
now this is a really wide angle lens
especially<00:01:59.640> when<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.820> go<00:02:00.000> ahead<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.270> do<00:02:00.360> my<00:02:00.390> fly

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
especially when I go ahead and do my fly

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.780 
especially when I go ahead and do my fly
cam<00:02:01.079> videos<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.159> think<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.460> should<00:02:02.610> also

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790

get<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.329> lens<00:02:03.659> hood<00:02:04.100> yes<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.430> do<00:02:05.610> get<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> lens
