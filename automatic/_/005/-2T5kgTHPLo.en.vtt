00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
carbonic acid and that acid breaks down

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.330 
carbonic acid and that acid breaks down
the<00:01:24.130> cells<00:01:24.400> they<00:01:24.850> cause<00:01:25.150> like<00:01:25.900> like<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:27.100> think

CMOS almost also known as Irish moss
one<00:02:05.690> of<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.870> same<00:02:06.110> now<00:02:06.830> this<00:02:07.220> is<00:02:07.400> excellent

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
one of the same now this is excellent

one of the same now this is excellent
in<00:02:08.590> Ireland<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:10.100> people<00:02:10.520> were<00:02:11.300> starving<00:02:11.780> and

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
in Ireland the people were starving and

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.880 
in Ireland the people were starving and
have<00:02:13.250> nothing<00:02:13.880> absolutely<00:02:14.420> nothing<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:15.110> I

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
have nothing absolutely nothing and I

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.830 
have nothing absolutely nothing and I
guess<00:02:16.070> maybe<00:02:16.280> probably<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:17.150> was<00:02:17.330> wrong<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.540> don't

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
guess maybe probably I was wrong I don't

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.770 
guess maybe probably I was wrong I don't
know<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:18.470> Irish<00:02:18.950> moss<00:02:19.190> has<00:02:19.910> all<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.540> minerals

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
know but Irish moss has all the minerals

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.900 
know but Irish moss has all the minerals
so<00:02:21.500> these<00:02:21.830> people<00:02:22.040> were<00:02:22.190> starving<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.760> all

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
so these people were starving that all

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.270 
so these people were starving that all
they<00:02:23.030> had<00:02:23.210> was<00:02:23.390> Irish<00:02:23.780> moss<00:02:23.990> when<00:02:24.290> they<00:02:24.440> when

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
they had was Irish moss when they when

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.030 
they had was Irish moss when they when
when<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.850> all<00:02:26.090> ended<00:02:26.630> with<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.020> phantom<00:02:27.890> that

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
when it all ended with the phantom that

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.560 
when it all ended with the phantom that
they<00:02:28.190> were<00:02:28.250> going<00:02:28.550> through<00:02:28.610> this<00:02:29.210> is<00:02:29.390> what

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
they were going through this is what

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.360 
they were going through this is what
saved<00:02:29.900> their<00:02:30.140> life<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:31.760> will<00:02:32.030> neutralize

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
saved their life it will neutralize

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.240 
saved their life it will neutralize
radiation<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.580> feeds<00:02:34.940> all<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.720> cells<00:02:36.050> all<00:02:36.980> in
