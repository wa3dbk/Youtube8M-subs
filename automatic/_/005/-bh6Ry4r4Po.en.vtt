what the recovery slider does is it

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.030 
what the recovery slider does is it

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
allows us to recover highlights where we

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.770 
allows us to recover highlights where we
may<00:02:06.189> have<00:02:06.310> lost<00:02:06.549> some<00:02:06.729> detail<00:02:07.270> in<00:02:07.299> that<00:02:07.540> area

all<00:02:08.200> right<00:02:08.560> well<00:02:08.739> what<00:02:08.890> about<00:02:08.979> fill<00:02:09.489> light<00:02:09.729> can

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
all right well what about fill light can

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.819 
all right well what about fill light can
kind<00:02:10.299> of<00:02:10.359> think<00:02:10.419> of<00:02:10.659> this<00:02:10.810> like<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:11.079> fill<00:02:11.560> card

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
kind of think of this like a fill card

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.039 
kind of think of this like a fill card
bouncing<00:02:12.579> bright<00:02:12.879> light<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.629> it's<00:02:13.749> going<00:02:13.959> to

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
bouncing bright light and it's going to

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.140 
bouncing bright light and it's going to
affect<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.859> three<00:02:15.129> quarter<00:02:15.489> tones

some of the other tones but you can see

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.460 
some of the other tones but you can see
that<00:02:17.829> it's<00:02:17.950> targeting<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.879> area<00:02:19.269> now<00:02:19.959> our

and again I can brighten those up or
darken<00:02:36.579> them<00:02:36.730> now<00:02:37.209> each<00:02:37.510> slider<00:02:37.959> will<00:02:38.379> almost

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
darken them now each slider will almost

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.610 
darken them now each slider will almost
always<00:02:39.060> affect<00:02:40.060> other<00:02:40.299> areas<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:41.049> image<00:02:41.409> you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
can start to see how these are focusing

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.460 
can start to see how these are focusing
in<00:02:44.530> on<00:02:44.739> specific<00:02:45.239> aspects<00:02:46.239> of<00:02:46.450> our<00:02:47.049> image

help us target or affect different areas

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.339 
help us target or affect different areas
of<00:03:09.220> our<00:03:09.519> image<00:03:09.879> well<00:03:10.329> now<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.629> we<00:03:10.720> understand

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
of our image well now that we understand

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.379 
of our image well now that we understand
a<00:03:11.500> little<00:03:11.739> bit<00:03:11.980> about<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.609> camera<00:03:12.939> interface

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
a little bit about the camera interface

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.839 
a little bit about the camera interface
in<00:03:13.930> about<00:03:14.680> some<00:03:14.889> of<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.069> basic<00:03:15.430> controls

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
in about some of the basic controls

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.059 
in about some of the basic controls
let's<00:03:16.659> go<00:03:16.840> ahead<00:03:17.079> and<00:03:17.230> take<00:03:17.379> a<00:03:17.439> look<00:03:17.709> at<00:03:17.859> how<00:03:18.010> we

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
let's go ahead and take a look at how we

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.430 
let's go ahead and take a look at how we
can<00:03:18.340> use<00:03:18.639> these<00:03:18.819> controls<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.569> we'll<00:03:20.049> do<00:03:20.230> that

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
can use these controls and we'll do that

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.310 
can use these controls and we'll do that
in<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.799> next<00:03:20.919> few<00:03:21.160> movies
