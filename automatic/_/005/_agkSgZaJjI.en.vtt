a<00:00:04.220> lot<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.370> research<00:00:05.640> say<00:00:05.879> that<00:00:06.089> kids<00:00:06.330> are

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
a lot of research say that kids are

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.480 
a lot of research say that kids are
looking<00:00:07.109> for<00:00:07.319> more<00:00:07.859> than<00:00:08.040> just<00:00:08.099> an<00:00:08.429> education

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
looking for more than just an education

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.180 
looking for more than just an education
that<00:00:09.480> they<00:00:09.630> want<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.840> find<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.170> purpose<00:00:10.559> that

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
that they want to find a purpose that

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.370 
that they want to find a purpose that
they<00:00:11.940> want<00:00:12.150> more<00:00:12.360> than<00:00:12.570> just<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.960> make<00:00:13.110> money

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
they want more than just to make money

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.129 
they want more than just to make money
but<00:00:13.590> they<00:00:13.769> want<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.009> figure<00:00:14.190> out<00:00:14.960> what<00:00:15.960> their

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
but they want to figure out what their

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.990 
but they want to figure out what their
life<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.410> going<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.890> do<00:00:17.100> what<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.520> what<00:00:17.880> they're

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
life is going to do what is what they're

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.980 
life is going to do what is what they're
going<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.150> do<00:00:18.240> with<00:00:18.359> their<00:00:18.539> life<00:00:18.660> what<00:00:18.869> their

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
going to do with their life what their

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.439 
going to do with their life what their
life<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.170> going<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.529> mean<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:21.000> think<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
life is going to mean and so I think the

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.029 
life is going to mean and so I think the
primary<00:00:21.750> benefit<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.500> coming<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> place

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
primary benefit of coming to a place

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.650 
primary benefit of coming to a place
like<00:00:23.460> Grand<00:00:23.609> Canyon<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.390> you're<00:00:24.539> going

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
like Grand Canyon is that you're going

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.210 
like Grand Canyon is that you're going
to<00:00:24.750> be<00:00:24.900> with<00:00:25.109> other<00:00:25.529> kids<00:00:25.680> who<00:00:26.070> are

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
to be with other kids who are

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.830 
to be with other kids who are
like-minded<00:00:26.430> you're<00:00:27.240> going<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.539> be<00:00:27.660> with

leave<00:00:45.390> here<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.750> lot<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.050> Direction<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.649> lot

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
leave here with a lot of Direction a lot

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.010 
leave here with a lot of Direction a lot
of<00:00:47.460> enthusiasm<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:48.360> doing<00:00:48.510> something

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
of enthusiasm for doing something

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.400 
of enthusiasm for doing something
significant<00:00:52.129> there<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> very<00:00:53.850> close-knit

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
significant there is a very close-knit

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.270 
significant there is a very close-knit
community<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:56.510> envelops<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.780> place<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:59.070> I

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
community that envelops this place and I

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.799 
community that envelops this place and I
think<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.699> partly<00:01:00.030> because<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
think it's partly because of the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.290 
think it's partly because of the
Christian<00:01:01.199> mission<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.789> lot<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.879> kids<00:01:03.059> come

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
Christian mission a lot of kids come

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.939 
Christian mission a lot of kids come
here<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.140> helps<00:01:04.379> bind<00:01:04.680> people

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
here for that that helps bind people

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.280 
here for that that helps bind people
together<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.670> think<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
together I think it's because of the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.399 
together I think it's because of the
tightness<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.549> mission<00:01:09.030> people<00:01:09.810> know<00:01:10.200> why

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
tightness of the mission people know why

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.960 
tightness of the mission people know why
they<00:01:10.650> come<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.640> find<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
they come here and it's to find a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.550 
they come here and it's to find a
purpose<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.750> certainly<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.439> be

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
purpose and it's certainly to be

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.920 
purpose and it's certainly to be
educated<00:01:14.100> mr.<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> very<00:01:15.119> very<00:01:15.360> good

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
educated mr. this is a very very good

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.230 
educated mr. this is a very very good
educational<00:01:16.740> institution<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.909> more

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
educational institution but it's more

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.960 
educational institution but it's more
than<00:01:18.420> there<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:19.619> about<00:01:19.860> people<00:01:20.430> finding

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
than there it's about people finding

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.390 
than there it's about people finding
their<00:01:21.030> purpose<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.900> think<00:01:22.280> you<00:01:23.280> know

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
their purpose and I think you know

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.399 
their purpose and I think you know
people<00:01:23.700> develop<00:01:24.570> an<00:01:24.659> interest<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.080> each<00:01:25.200> other

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
people develop an interest in each other
