00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
going to make me more well-rounded in

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.790 
going to make me more well-rounded in
the<00:02:39.670> long<00:02:40.090> term<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:40.840> right<00:02:41.050> now<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.320> sky<00:02:41.770> is

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
the long term so right now the sky is

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.140 
the long term so right now the sky is
the<00:02:41.980> limit<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:43.830> would<00:02:44.830> never<00:02:45.400> be<00:02:45.610> anyplace<00:02:45.760> else
