00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.830
 see bookshelf speakers from 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.640
 mission that have a quality relationship 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.860
 very very interesting price between 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.540
 the other from I think they have recently 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.090
 changed the bearer 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.980
 now they are imported from audio 4 that 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.690
 a very serious Milan company that 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.490
 let's say he always had distribution 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:01:01.370
 of important brands see here quad iron 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:05.089
 and whatever else has taken these now 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.360
 speakers here and here to start let's say with 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.149
 these these products also did 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:16.729
 of the promotions that I will now go to 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:20.090
 say talking 2014 start 2015 then 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:26.030
 let's talk about the mx series as you see 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:28.570
 This is the smallest and that a mxs 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.940
 two-way speaker as you can see 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:37.690
 small that can go 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:41.210
 well let 's say the back of the 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:45.200
 rai channels or even small teheran channels 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:52.869
 implants ni maybe studioli mounts a v 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:59.170
 100 mm feral and 25 mm twitter 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:02:03.409
 rear reflex reflex and connections 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.000
 let's say singles hiring way here's though 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.130
 they are pretty because there are also i 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.040
 mats that if you want to pull them tell us 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.040
 there is also space for bananas 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.420
 then we pass and this and sorry so 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.910
 I also go ahead with the price of 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.770
 price list would be saying 98 euros 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.930
 couple of course also have the 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.710
 cover after here I'll show you how 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.170
 the covers are designed and they are 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.890
 discounted to today we say late 2014 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.950
 the pair is starting now at 150 euros 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:43.400
 which seems to me a great price for the 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.840
 product that we pass to mx1 are not 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.470
 also high downloads were awarded 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.050
 five as mig by these mount a 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:03:01.190
 buffet a little larger by storm 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:03:03.890
 130 mm and a tweet and 25 mm diamond see 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.700
 the peculiarity of these speakers is 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.560
 the fact of having the winter below is a 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.230
 different at the end in sound 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:20.510
 changes very little behind we always find 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:23.810
 the reflex neck and even that 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.230
 we also have the wiring must be said 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.290
 in the packs we find a sponge 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.020
 if we want we have too many booms or if 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.760
 we want to put them on the back wall 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:41.380
 for example in a home theater system 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.150
 there is a sponge that we can use 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.100
 this too has the coverage that it is 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.010
 particular slips when poor 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:55.360
 let us see themes and this coast of 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:59.270
 price list 272 euros discounted 180 euros 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.709
 then this is the biggest in a let's say 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:08.390
 of the bookshelf series the mx2 that mounts 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:11.780
 a 165 mm woofer and more and more ground 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.170
 from 25 mm 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.799
 yes here these are already 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.810
 speakers that are fine even for one 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.490
 let's say medium-sized room 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.000
 while these are good for a small room 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.220
 small these may be fine 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.500
 also for a life size the v fair 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:36.580
 as I said it is from 165 down to 52 a 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.970
 fair 20,000 ok and sensitivity that not 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:44.320
 I've told you we're around 85 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:47.830
 for this 86 for this here and 87 for 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:54.700
 this is average sensitivity holds 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:56.380
 let's say power from 25 up to 75 100 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.810
 watts and without any problem 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:04.770
 here I show you this too 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:07.510
 behind the reflex that is always placed here 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.280
 to wine this too 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:13.419
 the price I would say is very much 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.080
 competitive because they cost 336 euros 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.890
 list 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.910
 I manage to sell for 210 euros 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.220
 couple 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:28.090
 I would say that I will show you less than this 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:29.590
 one thing as said this is this 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.760
 sponge that I told you is coming 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:37.150
 provided in the cassation la 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.070
 cover here you see inserted and it is a lot 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.400
 pretty diffuser really shows up 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:45.550
 very, very well there are two essences 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.100
 this all black or always with 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.820
 front panel equal to this and the 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:58.169
 finish there was the side 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:06:02.140
 we come then take on company mission 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:04.300
 who has worked for a lot of time doing 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.970
 spread from a lot of time to a whole 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.690
 series from these that are the most 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:14.320
 small up to the speaker of 20 50 thousand 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:19.960
 in short, the sound is really important 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:24.310
 we always say not too bright 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:27.070
 calm ok however it is well detailed and 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:31.129
 especially very very centered me 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:32.809
 I explain it doesn't have the colored bass that 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:37.699
 all widespread willing above all of 

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:40.009
 this one of these series here and there is small 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:42.769
 as dimensions that as entry level 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:48.669
 let's call them so they try to do the 

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:52.129
 colored round diffuser a little let's say 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:53.839
 I can't say a fiano here are these 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:58.239
 no these are rather loudspeakers 

00:06:53.839 --> 00:07:02.539
 linear ok that sound like engraving 

00:06:58.239 --> 00:07:04.729
 it is therefore very much in my opinion 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:08.779
 pleasant correct 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:12.289
 if you want they are speaker that sounds like 

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:15.740
 of without disclosing these I see them to you 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:17.869
 I really really hope I don't 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:21.490
 having bored you too much from a greeting 

00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:21.490
 davide of audi constructions
