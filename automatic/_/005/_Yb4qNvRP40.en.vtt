00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.399
 the motorcycle with national is one of the 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.740
 motor sports that most fans have 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.330
 carried each of their careers here 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.349
 on the track the pot in alajuela slipped 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.900
 on the ninth date of the season 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.179
 last year where pilots 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.829
 Roberto Castillo Zamora define the 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.829
 title of the category mx1 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.230
 a lot of public was made 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.879
 present on the track the hole in alajuela 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.339
 to witness the last day of the 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.989
 year without doubt the duel between johan 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:53.780
 mora and roberto castro for the title of 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.219
 the mx1 generated a lot of expectation this 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.320
 between the public and the pilots themselves 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.210
 national as the hole came as 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.789
 leader of the championship dwells with advantage of 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.920
 just 4 points the only option of 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.390
 Castro to overcome it was to beat him in 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.869
 the three hits scheduled during the end 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.869
 of week 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.249
 and so it happened the three races of the 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.499
 date of the won roberto case one after 

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:19.869
 another in the same way your departures 

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:21.579
 they were almost perfect and took advantage of 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.719
 It was very difficult to recover for johan 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:24.719
 cute on all three occasions 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.880
 Late last checkered flag 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.220
 beat castro was crowned as champion 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.080
 national snatching the title that by 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.070
 two consecutive years he had kept the 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.070
 santana onion 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.520
 I knew I could achieve it I had a lot of faith 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.110
 in me in my work in the team that 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.560
 poses for the for the season 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.160
 because with few things we managed to make a 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.160
 very big thing 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.360
 justly happy the truth and 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.130
 just say a pretty championship 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.710
 fought is very good for us as 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.150
 runners and that I reflected from coming to 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.660
 dispute a championship in the final in the 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.380
 last hit I feel it's pretty good 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.450
 for motocross 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.920
 now it is time to take a break and 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.470
 start the preseason already for what 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.970
 it's next year that I feel that after 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.740
 of this championship that has been so 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.220
 strong we have a good foundation for 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.220
 continue 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.620
 in the mx2 category the winner of the 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.350
 day was Ricardo Chacón of the team 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.940
 honda however the title of this 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.300
 class was in the hands of the pilot of ktm 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.150
 moving red the happy truth of his 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.640
 championship and legally no no that's what 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.950
 that expects truth since we mean we have 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.840
 some small problems and the truth what 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.120
 show track burn not so much in the 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.920
 average as they did and in the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.290
 category of veterans two pilots 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.120

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.590

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.760
 category finished unbeaten in the 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.510
 season 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.970

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.500

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.890
