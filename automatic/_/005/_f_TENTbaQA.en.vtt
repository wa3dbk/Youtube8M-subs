00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hi, I'm Daniel Hernandez, from training my 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.109
 dotcom dog in this video I'm going to 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.970
 reveal how to train your puppy to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.460
 that not dead this is one of the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.950
 really important aspects in the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.690
 basic training of your puppy that 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.340
 will avoid endangering our 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.230
 physical integrity and that of all 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.840
 people who enter our house 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.360
 It is essential that your puppy has a 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.820
 soft mouth I want to say that when 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.740
 play do not hurt this we will achieve 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.290
 with a very simple technique that you can 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.030
 put into practice immediately during 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.940
 the period of primary socialization 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.220
 that goes from 3 weeks to 4 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.320
 months of life the puppies learn to 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.750
 control the strength of your bite to 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.329
 through a process called inhibition 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.129
 of the bite this teaching the 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.739
 they acquire interacting with the mother and 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.170
 with his little brothers when the bite of 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.050
 a puppy is too strong and the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.260
 chilla bitten puppy comes the mother and 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.000
 corrects the aggressor 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.699
 this is one of the teachings that 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.159
 produces in the canine species by 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.689
 from the mother towards the puppies and between 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.390
 themselves through games of 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.070
 fight and hunt and that allows them 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.500
 learn that they must yield when the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.509
 intensity of said bite goes beyond 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.539
 of tolerable limits for a game 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.880
 healthy this inhibition of the bite should 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.180
 control and reinforce in the puppy 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.640
 by the owner 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.860
 Your puppy must learn from when 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.590
 comes to your house that your teeth can 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.660
 hurt and that this is not good or accepted 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.640
 and that this will be a rule of coexistence 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.640
 which must strictly respect 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.600
 throughout his life he must learn to 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.369
 control or inhibit your bite 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.009
 the puppies are genetically 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.840
 conditioned to bite everything with 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.420
 what they come in contact with in order to 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.290
 investigate learn and have fun 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.580
 A dog that does not control his bite is 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.860
 potentially dangerous because at the time 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.530
 biting can cause injuries that go 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.630
 from bruises or scrapes to wounds 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.360
 series when during the game 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.520
 one dog bites another causes pain 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.830
 dog that feels measured has several 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.900
 ways to let the attacker know that 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.810
 has overreached and that is not 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.260
 allowed the attacked puppy emits a 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.440
 Sharp squeak indicating his pain 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.200
 immediately 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.060
 the aggressor dog stops biting because it 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.530
 he just realized that it caused pain to his 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.360
 partner 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.390
 so next time your puppy 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.970
 I bite you scream down or loud and sharp 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.590
 of pain that makes a moan like that 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.959
 it produces you when something really does 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.360
 it hurts if you do it right you will see how it is 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.430
 will quickly stop biting you in that 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.840
 Exact moment you should congratulate him and 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.300
 continue playing 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.040
 if he bites you again he screams again and 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.260
 again congratulate you if you stop doing 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.390
 of course you often have to 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.950
 resort to an additional step and that 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.290
 It also has to do with behavior 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.480
 natural of dogs when a puppy 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.489
 is reached from the game of another half is given 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.130
 turn and it goes away immediately is to say 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:05.770
 end the game we remove 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.050
 If your puppy insists on biting you should 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.730
 imitate this behavior you have to 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.120
 immediately remove your toy or 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.650
 favorite entertainment your presence 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.460
 Finish the game for about 3 to 5 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.900
 minutes 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.330
 turn your back and ignore what 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.190
 You absolutely must not push it or 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.530
 hit him you just have to get up 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.780
 leave the room the place where you 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.100
 find and close the door retire 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.740
 a room a place where you 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.630
 puppy can not enter after about 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.480
 minutes of calm returns to play with him 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.010
 as if nothing had happened a puppy 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.960
 who has correctly learned the 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.080
 inhibition of the bite is said to 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.790
 have a soft mouth this one has on the face 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.160
 I just explained is one of the most 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.780
 important to know how to train 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.180
