00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
good model of thorn for after we can do

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.889 
good model of thorn for after we can do
some<00:01:53.549> stuff<00:01:53.759> obviously<00:01:54.270> we've<00:01:54.600> got<00:01:54.689> all<00:01:54.780> that

lucky I'm actually a professor in
quantities<00:02:43.750> or<00:02:43.959> anything<00:02:44.200> but<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.950> that's

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
quantities or anything but that that's

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.830 
quantities or anything but that that's
gonna<00:02:45.370> be<00:02:45.550> an<00:02:45.610> amazing<00:02:45.819> ones<00:02:46.180> half<00:02:46.390> but<00:02:46.569> we<00:02:46.600> can

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
gonna be an amazing ones half but we can

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.300 
gonna be an amazing ones half but we can
make<00:02:46.959> some<00:02:47.140> really<00:02:47.319> cool<00:02:47.560> traps<00:02:47.860> with<00:02:48.040> quantum

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
make some really cool traps with quantum

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.640 
make some really cool traps with quantum
physics<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:49.330> stuff<00:02:49.569> like<00:02:49.690> that

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
physics and stuff like that

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.590

then<00:02:51.069> there's<00:02:51.310> gonna<00:02:51.459> be<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:52.090> twilite<00:02:52.420> force

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
then there's gonna be the twilite force

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.940 
then there's gonna be the twilite force
in<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.870> here<00:02:53.019> you<00:02:53.110> can<00:02:53.170> see<00:02:53.440> that's<00:02:53.650> gonna<00:02:53.860> be

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
in it here you can see that's gonna be

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.590 
in it here you can see that's gonna be
that's<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.250> great<00:02:54.489> mod<00:02:54.730> there's<00:02:55.299> loads<00:02:55.480> of
