00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.930
 Good morning shows you the work that is 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:12.990
 been made to the district house of 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:17.220
 already for the work hydraulics course e 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.150
 the ancient laboratory motto of 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.119
 thermohydraulic and this is a model that 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.029
 I had the prisoners made relatively 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.650
 to the operation of the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.250
 electrical control equipment 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.870
 for lighting controls 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.170
 we represented a model of one 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.629
 house with an electric field of 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.730
 rough lighting characterized 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.530
 between a main painting and then the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.899
 operation of all the shots you in 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.660
 anti via command points that yes 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.570
 differentiate between combined switches 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.260
 of authors and commutators we can 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.930
 see the entrance that is characterized 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.010
 seasoned a diverter then points to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.430
 length are controlled either 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.119
 at the entrance is at the exit of the room 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.990
 the inmates have enriched it 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.939
 through some details some 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.640
 details such as the furniture the 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.900
 parquet 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.729
 paintings on the walls and equipped walls 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.720
 etc. from the living room entrance 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.909
 living room leads to the hallway which 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.520
 colleague are a day against a night 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.100
 commitment based on the eyepiece switch 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.880
 simple access to the two rooms from 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.450
 read a nice little boy with a 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.300
 switch asked unipolar yes 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.220
 also access to the other and bedroom 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.619
 where there is a diverter so as to 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.070
 control the light both at the entrance and 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:02:04.280
 from the bedside table the bathroom with the switch 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:06.710
 of polar and then a study where he was 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.630
 there is a switch inserted 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.180
 appliance two control points for two 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.330
 light and different points connected between 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.880
 them by a bridge and then a 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.100
 system called commutator this is the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.150
 time did the boys times this 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.040
 module 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.620
 to which the compliments clearly go 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.850
 they were supported by mine 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.070
 supervision is this 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.250
 complete is the work you spun it was 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.250
 done
