so<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.160> topic<00:00:53.430> while<00:00:53.940> we're<00:00:54.149> here<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:55.500> see

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
so on the topic while we're here you see

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.450 
so on the topic while we're here you see
the<00:00:56.039> dice<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.640> order<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:58.739> text<00:00:59.039> basically

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the dice in order to the text basically

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.580 
the dice in order to the text basically
a<00:00:59.489> board<00:00:59.760> game<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.109> every<00:01:01.410> 10

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.590 
a board game and I think like every 10
minutes<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> new<00:01:02.309> die<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.449> can

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
minutes you get a new die and you can

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.090 
minutes you get a new die and you can
roll<00:01:03.809> again<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.589> either<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.860> new

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
roll again and you get either a new

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.880 
roll again and you get either a new
quest<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.790> new<00:01:06.270> coins<00:01:06.600> by<00:01:07.470> coins<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.770> mean

killing<00:01:26.939> here<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.299> killed<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.630> some

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
killing here I just killed for some

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.929 
killing here I just killed for some
reason<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.799> don't<00:01:28.920> even<00:01:29.009> know<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.759> lag

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
reason I don't even know and the lag

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.460 
reason I don't even know and the lag
spike<00:01:30.240> was<00:01:30.390> because<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:31.020> haven't<00:01:31.200> loaded

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
spike was because I haven't loaded

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.950 
spike was because I haven't loaded
maplestory<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.250> like<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> whole<00:01:32.640> day<00:01:32.850> so

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
maplestory for like the whole day so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.330 
maplestory for like the whole day so
your<00:01:33.960> first<00:01:34.140> load<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.619> always<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.130> east

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
your first load is always the like east

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.539 
your first load is always the like east
one<00:01:35.900> but<00:01:36.900> anyways<00:01:37.200> um<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.040> when<00:01:38.280> it

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
one but anyways um this is when it

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.670 
one but anyways um this is when it
starts<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> go<00:01:39.060> more<00:01:39.329> story<00:01:39.869> based<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.530> not

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
starts to go more story based but not

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.719 
starts to go more story based but not
heavily<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.729> story<00:01:42.299> based<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:43.729> your

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
heavily is a story based so your

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.090 
heavily is a story based so your
character<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.659> walks<00:01:45.990> because<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.950> like

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
character just walks because it's like

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.179 
character just walks because it's like
oh<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.369> foggy<00:01:48.020> let's<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.259> walk<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.890> then

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
oh it's foggy let's just walk and then

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.160 
oh it's foggy let's just walk and then
they<00:01:50.490> fall<00:01:51.119> into<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.200> hole<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.960> this<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
they fall into a hole and this is the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.840 
they fall into a hole and this is the
way<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> Alice<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.799> Wonderland<00:01:55.860> stuff<00:01:56.520> starts

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.910 
way the Alice in Wonderland stuff starts
to<00:01:56.969> kick<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.600> mean<00:01:58.259> basically<00:01:58.590> fall<00:01:58.740> down<00:01:58.890> a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
to kick in I mean basically fall down a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.350 
to kick in I mean basically fall down a
hole<00:01:59.009> which<00:01:59.490> makes<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.820> transporting

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
hole which makes it transporting

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.959 
hole which makes it transporting
something<00:02:00.659> else<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.369> something<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.610> find<00:02:02.759> very
