I'm<00:00:41.370> using<00:00:41.730> two<00:00:42.060> types<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.570> transparency

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
I'm using two types of transparency

I'm using two types of transparency
sheets<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.010> both<00:00:44.910> are<00:00:45.120> archival
