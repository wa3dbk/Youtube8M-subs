00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.030
 is the worst abuse says ok who you speak 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.650
 welcome milk is one more 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.070
 episode in which our way coach 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.410
 glad we are in December and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.170
 lacking same six games to begin 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.330
 the winter transfer market 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.330
 therefore I want you to distribute the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.029
 games for two episodes in principle 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.699
 should be two episodes with three 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.800
 games to get there quickly because 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.340
 is more concerned with transfers 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.340
 Go to you your suggestions 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.200
 we build a team and I think 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.989
 in the end this is what gives the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.090
 joke this series but until then we have several 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.440
 games for the championship and also for 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.570
 connect europe that is not important 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.030
 forget that we have here today the contract 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.129
 It's going to be god, it's even done. 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.500
 able to score the first goal very 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.989
 I started the game lately, I do not know if you 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.670
 have stopped have arisen very early 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.680
 I think it is already making a 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.830
 typical feature here in our way 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.659
 who was but is it a funny thing, huh? 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.010
 this is a good way to start 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.930
 games there concluded 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.820
 our team tried to get to the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.250
 goal from the draw very quickly we had 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.170
 a very good response from us 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.860
 several opportunities and took the test 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.020
 Very well and Kawele will say the same and it's 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.970
 very quickly frosted until 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.650
 finally went there and meet me at the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.750
 world nobody passing by jackson 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.450
 martinez and this ends up getting 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.979
 make patu impact of the goal awaits 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.470
 male sex 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.619
 the advanced who has been on the rise in these 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.509
 last episodes I had some 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.090
 tempinhos unable to score goals but 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.189
 now it's back its always being like 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.079
 I was at the beginning of the championship 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.720
 then try to respond to our 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.640
 world tied today with growth only 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.110
 that this one ended up fitting easily 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.040
 in beto's hands 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.200
 in the answer you give her here is to have a 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.060
 good participation and in the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.430
 counterattack with a cross to 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.840
 Jacques loved jackson martinez'm already 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.149
 here was very good 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.909
 jeff martinez support jackson 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.459
 when it will finally hunt 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:17.340
 our suggestions for by nickname 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.730
 jack martinez you were to send so many 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.470
 suggestions was to call it nezinho nor 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.810
 I was using none but what's 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.689
 on the outside here my god the fred already a 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.180
 also wants to join the party from 11 to 85 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.290
 minutes ended up closing the 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.810
 highlighter 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.030
 great pass and marking it is a 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.700
 player pretty slab get imi 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.670
 I will not let the competition 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.879
 I even tried to call and 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.920
 make you a blow niggas beat people 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.170
 but if you do not risk it and even decide 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.989
 party that is apparent tutorial 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.090
 always facing and even facing 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.430
 no joke people we are here to mark 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.689
 goals at the time were cute not 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.750
 Now matter what matters is that 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:02.849
 we have here our first game of this 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.650
 episode for the championship and this is a 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.889
 very very important game will be 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.810
 against psv and a team we are 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.329
 almost to catch up on our rating 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.970
 so we already won this game 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.609
 for terms to create a 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.959
 comfortable stitch distance and was 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.299
 that's what we tried 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.129
 make a good start the goalkeeper god 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.319
 and I'm going up on these two 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.079
 the 1st shots but after the seven 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.260
 minutes jackson martinez on hour h no 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:34.139
 right place at the right place at the right time 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.329
 If you say rock, it does not matter 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.909
 kept in that 17 minutes and managed to 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.579
 seize the load was going to make the first 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.139
 goal for the home team he was 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.209
 quite pleased because the 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.400
 have been deemed to be quite 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.659
 important for our team but they 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.760
 they will not stand by 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.919
 crusaders and this year was quite 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.849
 similar to the real madrid borussia de 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.359
 dortmund 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.099
 the game that took place in Madrid because 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.440
 have had several 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.970
 chance and risk of being thrown out 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.340
 much better than we 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.989
 they had a good exchange. 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.799
 see that in this big exchange 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.930
 ball 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.790
 I just missed the finish I 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.859
 simply could not hit a 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.680
 in our team like to avail es 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.760
 went there and plays for jackson martinez this 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.340
 by jackson 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.130
 the super man who in this team a 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.830
 superhero number 16 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.480
 and the agent started asking 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.220
 but weakened jacques martin 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.740
 to solve the question what he calls ronaldo 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.600
 who is here on our team because the 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.430
 marlon from anywhere 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.950
 cassado after brown also want 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.710
 also that it was her your 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.080
 ball until the Brazilian therefore show 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.810
 ball is an option that fits 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.820
 perfectly in this bid and the error 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.770
 give the analog by doing something 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.660
 pretty corner kick 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.420
 for example by shaking the ball 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.960
 then Cabral once again believes in a 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.460
 ball show was two 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.500
 opportunities for the most 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.790
 Brazilian subscribers also 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.100
 Portuguese also wants to discriminate 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.660
 no one is a good result but then 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.420
 follows bad news 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.370
 muse has a turn your party and goes 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.520
 stay out for three months 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.370
 therefore it is likely that the 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.170
 is right there at the door. 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.990
 because I do not want to do it at first 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.450
 with which the neighborhood wants to stay in place 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.250
 because he is a player and now that 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.110
 We're talking about it. He's a player. 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.330
 in the neighborhood who is a player who wants 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.600
 quite new and what I wanted to do was 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.730
 send it on state loan is to 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.590
 loan and thus evolve holding one 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.750
 more soft spot team my team more 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.700
 field ministries break after 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.340
 next season if you stay with the twente 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.950
 I arrive here in great shape and 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.200
 to be used in our team 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.970
 and who knows if I can not even 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.910
 give a place where jacques martin nelzow 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.680
 muse is all in the way it will go 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.930
 Evolve is not in a while coming 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.370
 the time usually generate enough volume 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.980
 in the way that the old 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.120
 so come on let's hope that 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.880
 so be it 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.340
 I in the winter market that is to buy 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.200
 an advanced not to limp just to 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.110
 replace because then when you use 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.570
 return reason he's going back to eleven 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.490
 because he is a player who 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.590
 that is irreplaceable has great 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.260
 speed is quite bit so 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.020
 may already start leaving suggestions of 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.189
 advanced they are so cheap in 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.050
 maximum 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:33.300
 ten million euros in the ideal price 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.030
 would be if not advance 5 million euros 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.889
 because I have here 10 million euros 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.360
 of my budget transfers and creates 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:41.759
 still save to buy a guard 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.279
 networks a player who could replace 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:45.810
 umar al a defla enem because he is the 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:48.120
 only player whenever the people of 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.270
 morning on the field and who knows maybe a 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.879
 defense because we have the stage in 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:57.419
 someone get the defense right and I 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:59.400
 base precision is the left tfc and wait 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:01.590
 than the games that even the games that 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.050
 all the teams have a long long 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.029
 championship is that the games that the 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.469
 People have to always run badly there. 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:09.479
 always one or two games over the 

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:11.219
 when you run out and this 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.779
 It turned out to be a god that is the 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:14.819
 championship ranking 

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:17.419
 we are in fourth place with 32 points 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:20.430
 finally succeeded in building a 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:22.139
 strong leadership in relation to the 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.150
 sick we are at three points gave six 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:26.069
 people plant charles son 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.050
 I think I would only leave the team with 25 

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:30.180
 subscribe to more than 10 councilors 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.779
 cover 3 and closed the 3 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.779
 alison
