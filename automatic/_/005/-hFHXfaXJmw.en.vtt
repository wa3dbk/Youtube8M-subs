 however, the artist made an ordinary tape 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.909
 masterpieces of world cinema for 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.759
 affected

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.260
 poetic cinema 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.170
 however, Kharkiv film experts are confident he 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.830
 beyond these bastards 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.620
