00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
but this is it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.880 
but this is it
I've<00:01:21.689> used<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.110> couple<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.409> times<00:01:22.680> already

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
yourself a knife surgical steel for the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.390 
yourself a knife surgical steel for the
blade<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.040> then<00:02:23.670> poly<00:02:24.570> propylene<00:02:25.560> propylene

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
blade and then poly propylene propylene

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.850 
blade and then poly propylene propylene
yeah<00:02:26.970> for<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.320> body<00:02:29.870> fits<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.140> big<00:02:31.320> ham<00:02:31.590> hock

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
yeah for the body fits in a big ham hock

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.370 
yeah for the body fits in a big ham hock
like<00:02:32.160> mine<00:02:32.460> has<00:02:32.820> like<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> threaded<00:02:33.930> area<00:02:34.080> on

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
like mine has like a threaded area on

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.410 
like mine has like a threaded area on
the<00:02:34.590> top<00:02:34.830> here<00:02:35.840> before<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.930> have<00:02:37.260> your<00:02:37.440> thumb

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
the top here before you have your thumb

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.600 
the top here before you have your thumb
now<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.480> newer<00:02:39.930> version<00:02:40.440> has<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.710> lock<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.550> it

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
now the newer version has a lock on it

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.000 
now the newer version has a lock on it
so<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.150> when<00:02:42.390> it's<00:02:42.570> folded<00:02:43.440> up<00:02:43.530> like<00:02:43.770> this

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
so that when it's folded up like this

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.620 
so that when it's folded up like this
it's<00:02:44.640> locked<00:02:45.120> together<00:02:45.360> this<00:02:46.200> could<00:02:46.530> pop<00:02:47.280> open

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
it's locked together this could pop open

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.720 
it's locked together this could pop open
so<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.750> have<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.080> be<00:02:49.200> somewhat<00:02:49.740> careful<00:02:49.980> just

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
so you have to be somewhat careful just

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.010 
so you have to be somewhat careful just
like<00:02:50.880> any<00:02:51.060> other<00:02:51.240> tool<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:51.720> got<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.930> be

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
like any other tool you got to be

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.050 
like any other tool you got to be
careful<00:02:52.440> when<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.710> use<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:55.670> there<00:02:56.670> we<00:02:56.760> go

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
careful when you use it there we go

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.830 
careful when you use it there we go
and<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.920> puts<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.190> back<00:02:59.370> together<00:02:59.550> so<00:03:00.090> let's

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
and it puts it back together so let's

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.740 
and it puts it back together so let's
just<00:03:01.110> see<00:03:01.820> here's<00:03:02.820> jute<00:03:03.300> jute<00:03:04.230> twine<00:03:05.750> cuts

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
just see here's jute jute twine cuts

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.490 
just see here's jute jute twine cuts
right<00:03:06.930> through<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:07.410> like<00:03:07.650> nothing<00:03:09.500> here's

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
right through that like nothing here's

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.530 
right through that like nothing here's
some<00:03:10.830> nylon<00:03:11.340> cord<00:03:13.910> cuts<00:03:14.910> right<00:03:15.090> through<00:03:15.150> it

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
some nylon cord cuts right through it

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.930 
some nylon cord cuts right through it
and<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.560> has<00:03:16.710> been<00:03:16.920> used<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.310> couple<00:03:17.520> of<00:03:17.670> times

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
and this has been used a couple of times

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.630 
and this has been used a couple of times
so<00:03:18.780> it's<00:03:19.290> not<00:03:19.440> like<00:03:19.680> it's<00:03:19.860> just<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.130> brand<00:03:20.430> new

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
so it's not like it's just a brand new

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.510 
so it's not like it's just a brand new
blade<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:22.280> think<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.400> said<00:03:24.860> it's<00:03:25.860> sharp<00:03:26.250> enough
