00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
the first step is open the hood and take

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.300 
the first step is open the hood and take
these<00:00:14.309> two<00:00:14.370> covers<00:00:14.820> off<00:00:15.770> you<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:16.920> easily<00:00:17.039> take

these two covers off you can easily take

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.390 
these two covers off you can easily take
these<00:00:17.460> covers<00:00:17.760> off<00:00:17.910> by<00:00:19.010> unlatching<00:00:20.010> them<00:00:20.130> from

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
these hinges and both of these are

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.730 
these hinges and both of these are
connected<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.609> like<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.289> first<00:00:25.529> let's

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
connected just like that so first let's

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.710 
connected just like that so first let's
take<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.340> off<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.359> then<00:00:29.510> take<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.660> one

where<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:18.620> is<00:02:18.680> your<00:02:18.950> filter<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.570> this<00:02:20.570> is

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
where this is your filter and this is

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:33.730 
where this is your filter and this is

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.820 

you<00:02:34.340> can<00:02:34.490> see<00:02:34.670> how<00:02:34.790> dirty<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:35.600> is<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.710> is

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
you can see how dirty it is so it is

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.650 
you can see how dirty it is so it is
recommended<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:37.760> change<00:02:38.120> your<00:02:38.330> filter

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
recommended that you change your filter

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.140 
recommended that you change your filter
at<00:02:38.900> least<00:02:39.140> every<00:02:39.500> year<00:02:39.740> or<00:02:40.130> every<00:02:40.310> 20,000

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
at least every year or every 20,000

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:58.660 
at least every year or every 20,000
miles<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:55.310> this<00:02:55.700> is<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:55.880> new<00:02:56.090> filter<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:57.670> you

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
miles so this is a new filter and you

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.330 
miles so this is a new filter and you
can<00:02:58.850> see<00:02:59.740> see<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:00.920> difference<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.190> is

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
can see see the difference so this is

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.640 
can see see the difference so this is
why<00:03:04.460> you<00:03:04.520> should<00:03:04.940> change<00:03:05.120> your<00:03:05.360> filter<00:03:05.690> and

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
why you should change your filter and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.130 
why you should change your filter and
you<00:03:06.800> will<00:03:06.920> see<00:03:07.360> improvement<00:03:08.360> in<00:03:08.540> the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
you will see improvement in the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.580 
you will see improvement in the
performance<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.800> your<00:03:09.830> car<00:03:10.160> your<00:03:10.370> gas<00:03:10.610> mileage

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
you will see there's two raised sides of

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.250 
you will see there's two raised sides of
this<00:03:18.350> filter<00:03:18.620> these<00:03:19.430> are<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.850> ones<00:03:20.260> which

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
will be pointing outside make sure it

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.960 
will be pointing outside make sure it
sets<00:03:32.540> in<00:03:32.750> perfectly<00:03:33.350> there's<00:03:34.190> no<00:03:34.430> gaps<00:03:34.670> no
