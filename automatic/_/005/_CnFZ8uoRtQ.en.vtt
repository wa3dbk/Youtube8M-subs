won the 2010 design of the Year award
for<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.720> actually<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.350> USB

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
for this so this is actually a USB

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.150 
for this so this is actually a USB
charger<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:25.230> as<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:25.830> see<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
charger so as you can see it's a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.429 
charger so as you can see it's a
incredibly<00:00:26.699> flat<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.359> UK<00:00:27.630> plug<00:00:27.960> I'll<00:00:28.170> show

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
incredibly flat the UK plug I'll show

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.810 
incredibly flat the UK plug I'll show
you<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.619> equipment<00:00:28.890> before<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.400> font<00:00:29.609> this

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
just so you get an idea so it's not so

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.049 
just so you get an idea so it's not so
much<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.650> profile<00:00:32.340> that's<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.669> important

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
much that profile that's the important

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:33.380 
much that profile that's the important
thing

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390

it's<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.290> profile<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.219> no<00:00:35.399> fatter<00:00:35.700> than

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
it's that profile so it's no fatter than

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.770 
it's that profile so it's no fatter than
the<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.260> proud<00:00:37.590> warm<00:00:37.950> white<00:00:38.489> part<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.540> and

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
reading hazard etc and this is what's

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.170 
reading hazard etc and this is what's
been<00:00:53.129> from<00:00:53.399> with<00:00:53.699> UK<00:00:54.000> plugs<00:00:54.379> this<00:00:55.699> design<00:00:56.699> unit

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
been from with UK plugs this design unit

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.389 
been from with UK plugs this design unit

gets around that by neatly having

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.360 
gets around that by neatly having
twisting<00:01:00.680> pins<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.980> I'm<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.250> quickly

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
it really is as simple as one kind of

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.940 
it really is as simple as one kind of
pretty<00:02:21.630> plug<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:21.990> in<00:02:22.080> backwards<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.560> I've<00:02:22.800> got

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
pretty plug it in backwards and I've got

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.830 
pretty plug it in backwards and I've got
that<00:02:23.100> right<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.090> exactly<00:02:24.480> as<00:02:24.690> you'd

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
that right so it's exactly as you'd

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.800 
that right so it's exactly as you'd
expect<00:02:25.260> decent<00:02:25.680> phone<00:02:25.920> brick<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.450> works

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
expect decent phone brick and it works

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.290 
expect decent phone brick and it works
with<00:02:28.050> all<00:02:28.170> your<00:02:28.350> normal<00:02:28.530> units<00:02:29.180> imma<00:02:30.180> show

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
with all your normal units imma show

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.790 
with all your normal units imma show
that<00:02:30.480> motion<00:02:30.600> just<00:02:30.960> once<00:02:31.140> more<00:02:31.320> until<00:02:31.530> they

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
that motion just once more until they

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.540 
that motion just once more until they
bleed<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.220> Bonnie

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.020 
bleed on Bonnie
so<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.510> just<00:02:33.690> unfold<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.410> it's<00:02:35.100> independent

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
so you just unfold it it's independent

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.490 
so you just unfold it it's independent
but<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.390> at<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> same<00:02:36.960> time<00:02:37.020> or<00:02:37.350> not

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
but you can it at the same time or not

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.220 
but you can it at the same time or not
and<00:02:38.130> twist<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:39.000> really<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.480> as<00:02:39.630> simple<00:02:39.660> as<00:02:39.990> that

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and twist it really is as simple as that

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.470 
and twist it really is as simple as that
you<00:02:41.220> can<00:02:41.460> twist<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.940> wrong<00:02:42.060> way<00:02:42.120> because

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
you can twist this the wrong way because

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.320 
you can twist this the wrong way because

first<00:03:35.940> option<00:03:36.180> you're<00:03:36.480> gonna<00:03:36.570> get<00:03:36.810> there

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
first option you're gonna get there

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.990 
first option you're gonna get there
hopefully<00:03:37.320> gonna<00:03:37.770> be<00:03:37.890> bringing<00:03:38.220> out<00:03:38.460> a<00:03:38.640> power

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
hopefully gonna be bringing out a power

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.270 
hopefully gonna be bringing out a power
cord<00:03:39.330> option<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:39.930> when<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.320> need<00:03:40.560> perhaps<00:03:41.040> a

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
cord option so when you need perhaps a

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.620 
cord option so when you need perhaps a
figure<00:03:41.820> 8

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
figure 8

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.350 
figure 8
power<00:03:43.080> lead<00:03:43.290> there<00:03:44.040> bring<00:03:44.430> out<00:03:44.550> an<00:03:44.670> option<00:03:44.910> the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
power lead there bring out an option the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.600 
power lead there bring out an option the
first<00:03:45.390> design<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.320> they<00:03:46.710> did<00:03:46.950> in<00:03:47.130> 2000<00:03:47.520> line

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
first design that they did in 2000 line

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.640 
first design that they did in 2000 line
actually<00:03:47.820> had<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.150> lead<00:03:48.360> attach<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.380> actually

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
actually had a lead attach is actually

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.170 
actually had a lead attach is actually
more<00:03:49.770> of<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:49.860> power<00:03:50.070> lead<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.520> I'd<00:03:50.700> like<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:51.030> see

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
more of a power lead and I'd like to see

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.030 
more of a power lead and I'd like to see
how<00:03:51.300> they<00:03:51.450> they<00:03:51.930> do<00:03:51.990> the<00:03:52.350> fuse<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.800> unit

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
how they they do the fuse to unit

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.930 
how they they do the fuse to unit
because<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.430> will<00:03:53.520> then<00:03:53.670> have<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.880> be

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
because that will then have to be

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.970 
because that will then have to be
consumed<00:03:54.240> a<00:03:54.300> fuse<00:03:54.510> unit<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.050> think<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.740> makes<00:03:55.860> a

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
consumed a fuse unit I think it makes a

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.410 
consumed a fuse unit I think it makes a
lot<00:03:56.130> of<00:03:56.160> sense<00:03:56.370> we're<00:03:56.550> gonna<00:03:56.670> USB<00:03:57.030> adapter

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
lot of sense we're gonna USB adapter

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.170 
lot of sense we're gonna USB adapter
because<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:58.260> very<00:03:59.250> much<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.580> sexiness<00:03:59.970> of

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
because the very much the sexiness of

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.550 
because the very much the sexiness of
this<00:04:00.360> is<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.720> fact<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:01.050> can<00:04:01.170> go<00:04:01.290> in<00:04:01.470> your

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
this is the fact you can go in your

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.800 
this is the fact you can go in your
pocket<00:04:01.860> in<00:04:02.010> your<00:04:02.130> case<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.550> it's<00:04:03.540> with<00:04:03.720> you

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
pocket in your case and it's with you

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.230 
pocket in your case and it's with you
all<00:04:03.960> the<00:04:04.110> time<00:04:04.350> okay<00:04:04.830> fantastic<00:04:05.240> well

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240
