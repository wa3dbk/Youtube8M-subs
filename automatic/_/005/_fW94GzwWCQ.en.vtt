00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
megabit it's 20 megabit downstream so

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.540 
megabit it's 20 megabit downstream so
over<00:01:50.939> 3G<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.990> why<00:01:52.860> pay<00:01:53.100> bt<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:54.000> a

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.390 

a<00:01:56.640> three<00:01:57.240> or<00:01:57.270> four<00:01:57.630> megabit<00:01:58.290> connection

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
a three or four megabit connection

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.060 
a three or four megabit connection
anyway<00:01:59.400> right<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.750> connect<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.350> see

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
anyway right so you connect to that see

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.290 
anyway right so you connect to that see
our<00:02:02.160> key<00:02:02.340> devices<00:02:04.400> and<00:02:05.400> then<00:02:05.580> that<00:02:05.730> connects

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
our key devices and then that connects

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.660 
our key devices and then that connects
and<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.860> go<00:02:08.310> into<00:02:09.740> -<00:02:10.740> command<00:02:11.220> which

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and then you go into - command which

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:23.020 
and then you go into - command which
I've<00:02:11.910> already<00:02:12.150> open

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:33.650 

look<00:02:23.660> for<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:23.990> open<00:02:24.080> its<00:02:24.380> connection

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.380 

all<00:02:34.260> right<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:35.280> then<00:02:35.610> there's<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.060> number<00:02:36.180> of

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
all right and then there's a number of

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.090 
all right and then there's a number of
basic<00:02:36.900> options<00:02:39.440> I've<00:02:40.440> only<00:02:40.740> really<00:02:40.980> just

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
basic options I've only really just

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.610 
basic options I've only really just
installed<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:42.950> now<00:02:43.950> I've<00:02:45.020> made<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.080> very<00:02:46.320> basic

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
installed it now I've made a very basic

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.530 
installed it now I've made a very basic
kind<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.130> standard<00:02:47.580> but<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:48.000> can<00:02:48.390> go<00:02:48.510> to

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
kind of standard but you can go to

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.920 
kind of standard but you can go to
dashboards<00:02:53.420> actually<00:02:54.420> better<00:02:54.600> than<00:02:54.780> these

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
dashboards actually better than these

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.170 
dashboards actually better than these
lights<00:02:57.800> so<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.830> go<00:02:59.130> into<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> dashboard<00:02:59.910> that

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
lights so you go into a dashboard that

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.460 
lights so you go into a dashboard that
shows<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.690> everything<00:03:01.470> air<00:03:01.710> your<00:03:01.860> rpm<00:03:02.400> and

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
shows you everything air your rpm and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
shows you everything air your rpm and
you<00:03:04.470> can<00:03:04.710> tap<00:03:05.280> on<00:03:05.690> these<00:03:06.690> gauges<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:08.370> will

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
you can tap on these gauges and it will

I<00:03:42.560> haven't<00:03:43.370> actually<00:03:43.460> probably<00:03:43.880> set<00:03:44.210> this<00:03:44.300> up

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
I haven't actually probably set this up

I haven't actually probably set this up
yet<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:44.840> put<00:03:45.200> in<00:03:45.290> your<00:03:45.440> horsepower<00:03:46.340> in<00:03:46.460> your

yet you put in your horsepower in your
engine<00:03:46.940> size<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.450> somehow<00:03:47.720> calculates<00:03:48.380> it

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
engine size it somehow calculates it

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.230 
engine size it somehow calculates it
properly<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:49.640> then<00:03:49.790> you've<00:03:49.880> got<00:03:50.000> all<00:03:50.090> these

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240

yeah<00:03:58.040> shift<00:03:58.670> I'm<00:03:59.270> done<00:03:59.750> that<00:03:59.930> yet<00:04:00.110> I<00:04:00.290> will<00:04:00.560> do

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
yeah shift I'm done that yet I will do

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.550 
yeah shift I'm done that yet I will do
that<00:04:00.890> then<00:04:03.310> again<00:04:04.750> Philip<00:04:05.750> procedure<00:04:06.140> so

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
that then again Philip procedure so

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.700

there's a couple of mods on this vehicle
so<00:04:47.950> certain<00:04:48.730> things<00:04:48.910> will<00:04:49.060> show<00:04:49.240> up<00:04:49.360> as<00:04:49.560> not

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.720 

I'll<00:05:16.440> see<00:05:16.620> that's<00:05:18.110> yeah<00:05:19.430> you<00:05:20.430> know<00:05:20.550> what<00:05:20.639> I'm

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
I'll see that's yeah you know what I'm

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.280 
I'll see that's yeah you know what I'm
saying<00:05:21.860> so<00:05:22.860> it's<00:05:23.280> a<00:05:23.370> pretty<00:05:23.550> good<00:05:24.229> it's<00:05:25.229> a

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
saying so it's a pretty good it's a

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.400 
saying so it's a pretty good it's a
pretty<00:05:25.470> good<00:05:25.650> art<00:05:26.479> I'm<00:05:27.479> not<00:05:27.690> entirely<00:05:27.990> sure<00:05:28.139> it

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
pretty good art I'm not entirely sure it

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.310 
pretty good art I'm not entirely sure it
is<00:05:28.500> worth<00:05:28.710> $34.99<00:05:29.699> I<00:05:30.090> think<00:05:30.479> I<00:05:33.020> think<00:05:34.020> it<00:05:34.139> could

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
is worth $34.99 I think I think it could

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
is worth $34.99 I think I think it could
be<00:05:34.350> a<00:05:34.500> little<00:05:34.949> bit<00:05:35.160> cheaper<00:05:35.780> if<00:05:36.780> it<00:05:36.960> was<00:05:37.340> $24.99

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
be a little bit cheaper if it was $24.99

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.159 
be a little bit cheaper if it was $24.99
shortened<00:05:38.820> a<00:05:38.970> lot<00:05:39.510> more<00:05:39.720> people<00:05:39.780> would<00:05:40.199> buy<00:05:40.410> it

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
shortened a lot more people would buy it

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.120 
shortened a lot more people would buy it
when<00:05:43.169> it<00:05:43.260> comes<00:05:43.410> down<00:05:43.560> to<00:05:43.620> it's<00:05:43.860> actually<00:05:44.100> a

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
when it comes down to it's actually a

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.760 
when it comes down to it's actually a
very<00:05:44.250> basic<00:05:44.520> product<00:05:45.120> but<00:05:45.389> it<00:05:46.020> does<00:05:46.320> it<00:05:46.590> is

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
very basic product but it does it is

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.190 
very basic product but it does it is
quite<00:05:47.040> nice<00:05:47.250> to<00:05:47.490> have<00:05:47.639> it<00:05:47.760> on<00:05:47.910> your<00:05:48.150> iPad<00:05:48.870> and
