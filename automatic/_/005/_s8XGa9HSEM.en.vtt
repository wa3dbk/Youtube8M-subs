here<00:01:31.850> as<00:01:32.740> recording<00:01:33.740> music<00:01:34.070> can<00:01:34.220> result<00:01:34.460> in

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
here as recording music can result in

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.300 
here as recording music can result in
lots<00:01:34.909> of<00:01:35.090> large<00:01:35.360> files<00:01:35.720> size<00:01:36.560> as<00:01:36.799> an<00:01:36.890> important
