00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
god they're so perfect I was going to

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.370 
god they're so perfect I was going to
get<00:02:46.470> floral<00:02:47.070> at<00:02:47.400> first<00:02:47.700> but<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.480> decided<00:02:49.020> not<00:02:49.320> to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
get floral at first but I decided not to

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.440 
get floral at first but I decided not to
because<00:02:49.860> floral<00:02:50.760> doesn't<00:02:51.030> really<00:02:51.180> match

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
because floral doesn't really match

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.710 
because floral doesn't really match
everything<00:02:51.890> mostly<00:02:52.890> if<00:02:53.160> it's<00:02:53.400> like<00:02:53.720> yellow

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
everything mostly if it's like yellow

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.250 
everything mostly if it's like yellow
floral<00:02:55.170> or<00:02:55.530> purple<00:02:56.010> floral<00:02:56.250> or<00:02:57.000> blue<00:02:57.300> then<00:02:58.230> I

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
floral or purple floral or blue then I

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.690 
floral or purple floral or blue then I
thought<00:02:58.620> about<00:02:58.650> getting<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.250> ones<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.580> are

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.350 
thought about getting the ones that are
black<00:02:59.850> with<00:03:00.570> like<00:03:01.560> starting<00:03:02.130> right<00:03:02.310> here<00:03:02.760> the
