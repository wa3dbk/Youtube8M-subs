then someone decided to put controls
it's<00:01:23.170> an<00:01:23.320> awesome<00:01:23.500> place

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:39.080 

and<00:01:30.800> I<00:01:31.070> we<00:01:31.250> fix<00:01:31.460> that<00:01:32.380> now<00:01:33.380> we<00:01:33.440> can<00:01:33.650> go

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.640 

and<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.810> got<00:01:39.990> enough

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:56.160

really really cool thing about the
experiences<00:02:29.620> we've<00:02:30.400> designed<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.820> be<00:02:30.880> very

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
experiences we've designed it to be very

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.290 
experiences we've designed it to be very
low<00:02:31.330> latency<00:02:31.780> see<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:33.640> really<00:02:33.880> get<00:02:34.060> a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
low latency see you really get a

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.100 
low latency see you really get a
responsive<00:02:36.240> experience<00:02:37.290> when<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:40.080> when<00:02:41.080> you

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
responsive experience when you when you

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.190 
responsive experience when you when you
hit<00:02:41.230> your<00:02:41.350> fire<00:02:41.560> button<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:42.460> game<00:02:42.640> response

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
hit your fire button the game response

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.870 
hit your fire button the game response
and<00:02:44.200> that's<00:02:44.350> due<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.710> part<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.100> our<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.850> our

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
and that's due to part to our to our

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.520 
and that's due to part to our to our
geforce<00:02:46.390> technology<00:02:46.960> that's<00:02:47.230> doing<00:02:47.500> the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
geforce technology that's doing the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:03:03.770 
geforce technology that's doing the
streaming

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.270 

so<00:03:04.780> this<00:03:04.930> feature<00:03:05.140> is<00:03:05.260> going<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.680> release

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
so this feature is going to release

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.880 
so this feature is going to release
initially<00:03:06.880> as<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.720> beta<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:08.410> what<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.620> beta<00:03:08.770> is

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
initially as a beta and what the beta is

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:09.720 
initially as a beta and what the beta is
going<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.070> mean<00:03:09.190> is<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.340> we're<00:03:09.520> going<00:03:09.640> to

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
going to mean is that we're going to

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.290 
going to mean is that we're going to
have<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:11.070> certain<00:03:12.070> select<00:03:12.760> set<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.090> games

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
have a certain select set of games

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.180 
have a certain select set of games
they're<00:03:14.140> zoomed<00:03:14.320> out<00:03:14.440> around<00:03:14.920> the
