 the purpose of this ratio they have their secret 

00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:04.780
 about air transport guillermo bernal 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.500
 during our space profiles 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.520
 port that is built in Quito could present operational limitations of 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.389
 according to the technical studies carried out by the authorities 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.389
 airports in our country 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.970
 Quito airport operate efficiently 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.779
 It is necessary that you comply with conditions that guarantee procedures of 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.519
 precision 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.800
 roma 2 internationally in the pressure procedure is mandatory 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.280
 that are 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.280
 and based on that 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.880
 where is the track 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.880
 the distance to the one that is there 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.590
 the tÃ©lam approach 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.740
 the airplane until arriving at the head of track but at a distance prudencial 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.450
 the official questioned the procedure for landing the 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.450
 Dovecotes proposed by corpaq 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.410
 in that procedure 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.700
 reds are indicated daily 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.130
 You will see that it does not comply with international regulations 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.700
 the international 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.800
 it will be a separation 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.190
 2 points 5 miles of your escape on foot Lima 22 points 5 miles of security 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.040
 high school 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.200
 being so 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 I from lateral separation 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.660
 less than a thousand feet apart is to say if the mountain is here 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.190
 above and apart that separates the comfortable option 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.650
 at 5 'looked to another side 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.650
 that does not compensate part therefore 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.380
 there is a lot of talk about the cases that are only left to ensure primary ie two 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.590
 points and with them the Bernal captain also explains the alternatives 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.680
 solution it this is a procedure that is called non-precision 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.700
 thirty meetings in 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.150
 rock but to culture 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.030
 it is likely would approximate 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.369
 that's where the red line that used national mention inside is 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.069
 is what makes it not a procedure and precision therefore 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.299
 a procedure for dengue 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.499
 weights means that you must 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:16.739
 away from 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.229
 there is a bit more attitude to be able 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.299
 the track that enters the head javier 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.099
