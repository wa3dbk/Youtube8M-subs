00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:34.649
 Your new iscac the car you washed 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:45.719
 driver on the other side of there I will not 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:49.079
 sing my coffee just to tell you, I do not 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:01:04.610
 I'm a Flemish car but only the beast. 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:01:08.180
 from paulo pita to me in the big tape 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.180
 difficult meadow 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:17.310
 we are tracking the bush 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.740
 to live while it does not exist I want 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.650
 show recording some images to 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.420
 to stay in those people who do not 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.180
 to know the journey is a kind of 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.700
 a bad one made of wood 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.010
 he serves to grind the wheat he was 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.780
 used for Emilio will make it was 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:45.060
 Prefect of wood is the wooden tripod 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.550
 work in caxias 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.140
 Of course I already had here 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:55.230
 I do not know how old you are very old. 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.280
 This young woman is so much wood with the sieve. 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.650
 very hard 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.560
 they are two parties to participate in them 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:06.180
 low and the top part is movable 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.680
 It's hard here, you do not put a million 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.160
 arises the river 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.060
 The material you want to die here was 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.480
 a cable 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.440
 so the cable was here as it broke 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.420
 for example find this stick to do the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.700
 to rotate was to top part 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.030
 now the serve the serve from above 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.030
 of the hour 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.180
 so it 's hard here you put the 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.180
 who is going to die 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.650
 the slot to where you look you undock 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.650
 She take it from there. 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:02.400
 hope it is not used for this is 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:07.010
 which makes grinding are are blades of 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:14.820
 iron not just sharp to die 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:17.870
 it fits the error because the 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.870
 bass that is fixed 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.330
 Also these blades to be of iron will 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.040
 to grind corn or wheat 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:33.700
 or whatever it is that was 8 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.390
 here is the axis that you think she finds 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.080
 huh 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.960
 exactly Sunday is coming in here 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.320
 according to the rotating movement that 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.330
 dying and goes to the numbered and 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.540
 As she turns, she's going to do 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.060
 centrifugal force to acquire the product 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:58.120
 therefore falls for what the 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:01.270
 police will tell you almost 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.510
 imperceptible and you put your thigh in 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.170
 down to collect the material 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.170
 already ground 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.060
 over there 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.060
 because one thing the person has to 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.290
 remember that a Jordanian is not a motor 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.570
 electric 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.669
 so it's no use second full of corn 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.770
 here he wanted to spin very fast 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.990
 it is a handmade piece made in 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.790
 idol wood and it's no use 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.650
 want to fill the maize mouth here like 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.750
 I've seen some nephews - doing 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.669
 thinking that the electric motor 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.160
 fill your mouth nor does it turn too fast 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.320
 It does not have to be in the morning with patience. 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.510
 and putting Brazil never the square 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.510
 typical of the plays in the line of risk 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.680
 of course I worked on the internet that is 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.750
 personal may as I am filming with 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.740
 one hand has to stop to put the 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:18.320
 rubbish here but I played it with one hand 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.800
 while running with the other and when the 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.800
 Brazil 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:06.310
 macu live 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.890
 Then there's the jordan mill 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.130
 today I say Slav is not like the same 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:15.040
 because Iranian personnel also used 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.990
 too much old thing was what it was 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.870
 very common here in the open 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.690
 river of the neighborhood formerly among others 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:26.440
 communities also Polish and Ukrainian 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:35.640
 today I know only this guide 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:35.640
 from my grandmother who goes from a single hug
