00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:13.000
 Hello everyone she is a stand you've felt proposed to that dating the last 10 years 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.000
 Then I would like to run the engine 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.290
 I would like to steam the engine 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.640
 I think that the enduring before acting is very well 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.530
 Then next 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.530
 I would like to check the air conditioner 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.780
 Lower the temperature to the bottom 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.180
 Yes I will open the book full of wind 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:08.270
 Yes, very cold air comes out of the air conditioner too 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:12.350
 There is a very strong wind too, so I think I'm worried about anything 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:16.970
 It is smell of pet when we put on air-conditioner or smell of cigarette 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.240
 After that I do not have a particular place to be worried about the smell, such as the fragrance of the person who was Rashi riding earlier 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.800
 I hope you feel relieved 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:29.250
 May I continue to see you here? 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.250
 Here is a genuine dvd navigation 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:46.000
 You have a lung function and you have a cd and a dvd video. 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.000
 I think that I think we very more convenient of there because we have to be played, 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:55.270
 May I continue to look at the back? 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.630
 It is this car It is with sliding door on both sides 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.180
 The left sliding door can be opened and closed automatically 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.310
 It becomes a per side bar 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.310
 So I really want to open it 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.450
 It is in this way 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:28.930
 Even from the driver's seat, you can freely open and close the brain with a single button, so get on and off 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:33.120
 Also I think that I think we very useful when it is the Toka 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.120
 I would appreciate your favor those who consider
