as<00:01:06.440> they<00:01:07.440> drilled<00:01:07.800> those<00:01:07.950> holes<00:01:08.750> they'll<00:01:09.750> not

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
as they drilled those holes they'll not

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.200 
as they drilled those holes they'll not
only<00:01:10.350> cause<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> lot<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.860> damage<00:01:11.100> they'll<00:01:12.000> cause

attention and try to locate whether
there<00:01:22.350> might<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.530> some<00:01:22.979> nests<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.520> are<00:01:23.880> being

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
there might be some nests that are being

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.399 
there might be some nests that are being
creative<00:01:25.819> in<00:01:26.819> this<00:01:27.000> situation<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.750> let<00:01:28.319> her

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
creative in this situation I let her

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.880 
creative in this situation I let her
drill<00:01:28.830> for<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> little<00:01:29.340> bit<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.740> then<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> took

drill for a little bit and then I took

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.639 
drill for a little bit and then I took
care<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> hole<00:01:32.670> with<00:01:33.000> some<00:01:33.210> dry<00:01:33.570> own<00:01:33.720> and

to go ahead and seal this hole up but if
you've<00:01:40.680> got<00:01:40.710> carpenter<00:01:41.340> bees<00:01:41.490> working<00:01:41.759> on

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
you've got carpenter bees working on

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.340 
you've got carpenter bees working on
your<00:01:42.149> house<00:01:42.439> they<00:01:43.439> will<00:01:43.469> most<00:01:44.040> definitely

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
cause some damage and their chambers can

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.870 
cause some damage and their chambers can
can<00:01:50.490> go<00:01:50.670> for<00:01:51.060> three<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.869> six<00:01:52.110> inches<00:01:52.880> sometimes

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
can go for three to six inches sometimes

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.889 
can go for three to six inches sometimes
a<00:01:54.060> foot<00:01:54.299> or<00:01:54.420> more<00:01:54.890> it's<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:56.100> uncommon<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.729> see

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
a foot or more it's not uncommon to see

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.749 
a foot or more it's not uncommon to see
several<00:01:57.899> nests<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:59.130> they<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.729> a

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
several nests because they have a

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.630 
several nests because they have a
tendency<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.420> return<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:02.009> areas<00:02:02.460> where

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
tendency to return to areas where

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.109 
tendency to return to areas where
they've<00:02:02.820> created<00:02:03.090> nests<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:03.960> past<00:02:04.289> and

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
they've created nests in the past and

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.719 
they've created nests in the past and
whether<00:02:06.119> it's<00:02:06.560> their<00:02:07.560> own<00:02:07.590> pheromones<00:02:08.369> or

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
whether it's their own pheromones or

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.270 
whether it's their own pheromones or
just<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.869> wood<00:02:10.049> itself<00:02:10.410> that's<00:02:10.709> attracting

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
just the wood itself that's attracting

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.900 
just the wood itself that's attracting
them<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.579> it's<00:02:11.880> really<00:02:13.700> probably<00:02:14.700> a

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
them it's it's really probably a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.750 
them it's it's really probably a
combination<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.660> few<00:02:15.900> things<00:02:16.489> so<00:02:17.489> if<00:02:17.640> you've

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
combination of a few things so if you've

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.420 
combination of a few things so if you've
got<00:02:17.940> them<00:02:18.180> active<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.690> one<00:02:18.840> location<00:02:19.430> give

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
got them active in one location give

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.340 
got them active in one location give
those<00:02:20.579> holes<00:02:20.880> good<00:02:21.299> dusting<00:02:21.720> with<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.019> drying

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
those holes good dusting with the drying

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.690 
those holes good dusting with the drying
and<00:02:23.630> then<00:02:24.630> go<00:02:24.840> over<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.230> entire<00:02:25.410> area<00:02:25.980> with<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
and then go over the entire area with a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.449 
and then go over the entire area with a
little<00:02:27.660> cypermethrin<00:02:28.079> feel<00:02:29.070> look<00:02:29.190> carefully

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
little cypermethrin feel look carefully

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.690 
little cypermethrin feel look carefully
you'll<00:02:29.850> see<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.870> case<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.950> wood<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.430> is

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
you'll see in this case the wood is is
