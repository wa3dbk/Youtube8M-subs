00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
easy I'd say even easier than the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.690

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
are a few air bubbles on the screen I

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.389 
are a few air bubbles on the screen I
didn't<00:00:51.989> actually<00:00:52.140> take<00:00:52.469> long<00:00:52.680> install<00:00:53.250> it

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
didn't actually take long install it

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.910 
didn't actually take long install it
took<00:00:53.610> me<00:00:53.699> about<00:00:53.879> 20-30<00:00:54.780> seconds<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.530> press

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
took me about 20-30 seconds and press

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.369 
took me about 20-30 seconds and press
most<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.430> air<00:00:56.520> bubbles<00:00:56.820> out<00:00:56.940> easily<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
most of the air bubbles out easily and I

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.920 
most of the air bubbles out easily and I
just<00:00:58.620> thought<00:00:58.829> I'd<00:00:59.280> keep<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.609> few<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.719> small

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
just thought I'd keep a few of the small

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.360 
just thought I'd keep a few of the small
ones<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.620> stress<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> fact<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.250> you
