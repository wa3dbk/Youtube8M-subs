more precise and sound reproduction

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.040 
more precise and sound reproduction
became<00:00:37.920> truer<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.690> closer<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
became truer and closer to the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.630 
became truer and closer to the
intentions<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.829> musician<00:00:41.340> i<00:00:43.520> wanted<00:00:44.520> to

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.000 
intentions of the musician i wanted to
listen<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.940> both<00:00:45.120> versions<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.589> study<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
listen to both versions and to study the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.069 
listen to both versions and to study the
differences<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.179> i<00:00:48.210> began<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.839> project

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
differences and so i began this project

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.959
