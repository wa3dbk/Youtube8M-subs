another piece of material that you'll
get<00:03:48.239> from<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.600> woods<00:03:48.950> possibly<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:49.980> bug<00:03:50.220> or<00:03:50.340> two

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
get from the woods possibly a bug or two

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.059

mind<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.079> at<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.290> time<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.620> year<00:03:52.650> they're

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
mind you at this time of year they're

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.610 
mind you at this time of year they're
less<00:03:53.310> they're<00:03:53.760> not<00:03:54.209> even<00:03:54.870> plagued<00:03:55.109> with<00:03:55.260> bugs

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
less they're not even plagued with bugs
