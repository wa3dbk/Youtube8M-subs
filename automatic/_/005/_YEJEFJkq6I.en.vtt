the<00:01:36.900> game<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.259> oh<00:01:37.470> god<00:01:37.729> overpowered<00:01:38.729> how<00:01:38.939> do

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
the game is oh god overpowered how do

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
the game is oh god overpowered how do
you<00:01:39.210> manage<00:01:39.420> something<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you manage something like that then the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.440 
you manage something like that then the
other<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.579> know<00:01:41.759> thing<00:01:41.970> people<00:01:42.180> might<00:01:42.420> think

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
other you know thing people might think

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.289 
other you know thing people might think
is<00:01:42.869> all<00:01:43.170> very<00:01:43.380> slow<00:01:43.799> very<00:01:43.829> boring<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.520> play<00:01:44.549> but

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
is all very slow very boring to play but

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.300 
is all very slow very boring to play but
they<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.570> balanced<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.770> well<00:01:47.040> from

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
they have balanced this so so well from

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.700 
they have balanced this so so well from
playing<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> game<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.020> mechs<00:01:49.470> they

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
playing the game in the the mechs they

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.649 
playing the game in the the mechs they
are<00:01:49.920> powerful<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.210> know<00:01:51.270> they<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.570> be

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
are powerful and you know they can be

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.600 
are powerful and you know they can be
very<00:01:51.689> easily<00:01:51.930> taken<00:01:52.470> out<00:01:52.590> by<00:01:52.740> other<00:01:53.040> mechs<00:01:53.460> you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
very easily taken out by other mechs you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.700 
very easily taken out by other mechs you
know<00:01:53.729> different<00:01:54.210> classes<00:01:54.570> set<00:01:54.750> up<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.290> pilots

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
know different classes set up the pilots

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.830 
know different classes set up the pilots
just<00:01:55.860> because<00:01:56.130> they're<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.399> agile<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.479> really

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
just because they're so agile can really

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.749 
just because they're so agile can really
get<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.200> top<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.740> mechs<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.670> know

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
get on top of the mechs and you know

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.580 
get on top of the mechs and you know
potentially<00:02:00.270> take<00:02:00.450> them<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.719> as<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.380> saw

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
potentially take them out as you saw

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.620 
potentially take them out as you saw
then<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.399> know<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.670> really<00:02:02.850> plays<00:02:03.210> out<00:02:03.360> very

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
then you know it really plays out very

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.330 
then you know it really plays out very
balanced<00:02:03.960> obviously<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.469> scale<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
balanced obviously the scale of the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.490 
balanced obviously the scale of the
mechs<00:02:05.579> means<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.450> they<00:02:06.570> can't<00:02:06.810> access<00:02:07.079> you

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
mechs means that they can't access you

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.380 
mechs means that they can't access you
know<00:02:07.619> certain<00:02:07.979> areas<00:02:08.399> you've<00:02:08.819> got<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.030> pilots

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
know certain areas you've got the pilots

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.910 
know certain areas you've got the pilots
you<00:02:09.509> can<00:02:09.690> run<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:09.989> between<00:02:10.110> streets<00:02:10.739> and

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
you can run in between streets and

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.650 
you can run in between streets and
buildings<00:02:11.039> jump<00:02:11.550> off<00:02:11.730> building

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
buildings jump off building

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.140 
buildings jump off building
you<00:02:13.290> know<00:02:13.440> very<00:02:13.920> much<00:02:14.070> more<00:02:14.310> agile<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.000> that's

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
you know very much more agile but that's

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.910 
you know very much more agile but that's
not<00:02:15.300> say<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.600> Titans<00:02:15.960> aren't<00:02:16.260> agile<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.830> know

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
not say the Titans aren't agile you know

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.620 
not say the Titans aren't agile you know
you've<00:02:17.070> got<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.190> sprint<00:02:17.520> ability<00:02:18.030> when<00:02:18.480> you're

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
you've got a sprint ability when you're

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.690 
you've got a sprint ability when you're
in<00:02:18.780> them<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.170> use<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> force<00:02:19.890> field<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.310> you

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
in them you can use a force field to you

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.390 
in them you can use a force field to you
know<00:02:20.870> suck<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.050> enemy<00:02:22.380> fire<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.950> deflect<00:02:23.280> it

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
know suck up enemy fire and deflect it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.800 
know suck up enemy fire and deflect it
back<00:02:23.580> at<00:02:23.760> them<00:02:23.940> they've<00:02:24.120> got<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.300> smoke<00:02:24.630> they

back at them they've got a smoke they

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.570 
back at them they've got a smoke they
can<00:02:24.960> put<00:02:25.110> down<00:02:25.140> they<00:02:25.800> have<00:02:25.980> shoulder<00:02:26.400> based

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
can put down they have shoulder based

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.520 
can put down they have shoulder based
rockets<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.360> there's<00:02:27.990> loads<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.230> different

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
rockets and there's loads of different

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.930 
rockets and there's loads of different
ways<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.680> play<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.190> reason<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.670> love

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
playing as the max of the Titans is

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.610

because<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.910> feel<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.330> has<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.660> halo<00:02:34.080> feel<00:02:34.320> to

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
because I feel it has that halo feel to

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.620

of that battle and you can kill your

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.780 
of that battle and you can kill your
opponent<00:02:52.620> here<00:02:52.770> you're<00:02:52.920> seeing<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.370> force

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
opponent here you're seeing the force

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.700 
opponent here you're seeing the force
field<00:02:54.000> ability<00:02:54.330> being<00:02:54.660> used<00:02:54.870> there<00:02:55.140> so<00:02:55.560> just

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
field ability being used there so just

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.920 
field ability being used there so just
completely<00:02:56.070> destroy<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:56.820> Titan<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:57.750> that's

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
completely destroy that Titan so that's

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.360 
completely destroy that Titan so that's
one<00:02:58.050> of<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.200> things<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.500> love<00:02:58.710> about<00:02:58.740> Halo<00:02:59.250> is

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
one of the things I love about Halo is

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.980 
one of the things I love about Halo is
the<00:02:59.490> fact<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.030> can<00:03:00.270> you<00:03:00.630> know<00:03:00.750> with<00:03:00.960> a

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
the fact that you can you know with a

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.540 
the fact that you can you know with a
pure<00:03:01.410> amount<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.770> skill<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.160> battles<00:03:02.460> are

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
pure amount of skill the battles are

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.370 
pure amount of skill the battles are
longer<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:02.940> means<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.230> can

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
longer and it means that you can you can

massive damage with those we've got
three<00:05:13.820> different<00:05:13.940> this<00:05:14.510> is<00:05:14.690> I<00:05:14.930> believe<00:05:15.110> a

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
three different this is I believe a

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.010 
three different this is I believe a
Titan<00:05:16.190> weapon<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:16.790> how<00:05:17.390> the<00:05:17.450> Titans<00:05:17.900> actually

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
Titan weapon and how the Titans actually

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.440 
Titan weapon and how the Titans actually
work<00:05:18.380> is<00:05:18.710> almost<00:05:19.070> like<00:05:19.730> a<00:05:19.790> kill<00:05:20.120> streak<00:05:20.330> you

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
work is almost like a kill streak you

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.360 
work is almost like a kill streak you
get<00:05:20.600> a<00:05:20.630> Titan<00:05:21.020> every<00:05:21.350> two<00:05:21.530> minutes<00:05:21.890> and<00:05:22.130> it

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
get a Titan every two minutes and it

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.520 
get a Titan every two minutes and it
will<00:05:22.460> repair<00:05:22.850> every<00:05:23.150> two<00:05:23.330> minutes<00:05:23.660> however<00:05:24.260> as

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
will repair every two minutes however as

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.409 
will repair every two minutes however as
you<00:05:24.710> get<00:05:24.890> more<00:05:25.100> kills<00:05:25.310> as<00:05:25.550> you<00:05:25.669> get<00:05:25.820> more<00:05:26.000> score

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
you get more kills as you get more score

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.480 
you get more kills as you get more score
you<00:05:27.080> start<00:05:27.410> building<00:05:27.740> up<00:05:27.830> towards<00:05:28.280> getting

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
you start building up towards getting

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.310 
you start building up towards getting
you<00:05:28.880> know<00:05:28.970> your<00:05:29.270> next<00:05:29.510> Titan<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.050> you<00:05:30.110> can<00:05:30.200> get

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
you know your next Titan and you can get

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.930 
you know your next Titan and you can get
it<00:05:30.410> earlier<00:05:30.770> than<00:05:31.340> you<00:05:31.520> would<00:05:31.669> have<00:05:31.730> done

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
it earlier than you would have done

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.630 
it earlier than you would have done
otherwise<00:05:32.150> and<00:05:33.190> you've<00:05:34.190> got<00:05:34.310> these<00:05:34.430> three

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
otherwise and you've got these three

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.460 
otherwise and you've got these three
different<00:05:34.790> types<00:05:35.150> of<00:05:35.390> unit<00:05:35.660> to<00:05:35.900> prioritize

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
different types of unit to prioritize

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.770 
different types of unit to prioritize
against<00:05:37.370> targeting<00:05:37.790> you<00:05:37.910> can<00:05:38.030> go<00:05:38.210> and<00:05:38.540> you

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
against targeting you can go and you

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.690 
against targeting you can go and you
know<00:05:38.870> tear<00:05:39.230> up<00:05:39.440> loads<00:05:39.710> of<00:05:39.890> grunts<00:05:40.520> in<00:05:40.610> the

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
know tear up loads of grunts in the

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
difficult to take down and you can

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.180 
difficult to take down and you can
pretty<00:05:44.660> much<00:05:44.750> farm<00:05:45.169> on<00:05:45.350> them<00:05:45.530> and<00:05:45.950> it<00:05:46.160> just

pretty much farm on them and it just

pretty much farm on them and it just

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
means that with the AI in the game it's

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.870 
means that with the AI in the game it's
another<00:05:48.590> really<00:05:48.950> unique<00:05:49.130> aspect<00:05:49.400> that<00:05:49.790> you
