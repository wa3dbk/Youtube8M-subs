00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.900
 mounted by osasuna a team where martín domínguez put the drops of 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.429
 quality 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:27.529

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:45.409
 we see the play again 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.670
 like shaq eagle the ball when almost goal was already scored in the pld.

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.099
 turret is going backwards 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.909
 the referee did not point anything 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.259
 there was still time for other opportunities the throw-in from 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:53.259
 bustingorri eagle and the launch of urban 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:59.859
