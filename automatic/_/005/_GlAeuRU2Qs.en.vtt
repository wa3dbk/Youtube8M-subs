and slide okay so now let me explain a
little<00:04:10.600> bit<00:04:10.840> on<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.200> hand<00:04:11.440> movements<00:04:11.920> because

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
little bit on the hand movements because

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.970 
little bit on the hand movements because
as<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:12.910> know<00:04:13.030> it<00:04:13.150> looks<00:04:13.420> better<00:04:13.799> if<00:04:14.799> the

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
as you know it looks better if the

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.130 
as you know it looks better if the
dancers<00:04:15.430> use<00:04:15.670> their<00:04:15.850> whole<00:04:16.060> body<00:04:16.330> to<00:04:16.959> move

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
dancers use their whole body to move

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.099 
dancers use their whole body to move
instead<00:04:17.560> of<00:04:17.680> just<00:04:17.919> footwork<00:04:18.760> right<00:04:19.359> so<00:04:19.630> I

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
instead of just footwork right so I

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.730 
instead of just footwork right so I
would<00:04:20.890> like<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.280> teach<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.060> a<00:04:22.410> move<00:04:23.410> that<00:04:23.620> we

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
would like to teach you a move that we

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.219 
would like to teach you a move that we
call<00:04:23.979> Kavi<00:04:24.310> okay<00:04:24.880> so<00:04:25.390> when<00:04:25.570> you<00:04:25.690> do<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:25.930> point

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
call Kavi okay so when you do the point

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.670 
call Kavi okay so when you do the point
point<00:04:26.680> step<00:04:26.979> you<00:04:27.640> could<00:04:27.789> actually<00:04:28.500> raise<00:04:29.500> your

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
point step you could actually raise your

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.930 
point step you could actually raise your
elbows<00:04:30.070> your<00:04:30.370> 2l

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
elbows your 2l

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.240 
elbows your 2l
and<00:04:31.240> go<00:04:31.480> point<00:04:32.230> step<00:04:32.860> points<00:04:33.810> so<00:04:34.810> you<00:04:34.840> actually

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
and go point step points so you actually

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.750 
and go point step points so you actually
can<00:04:36.250> can<00:04:37.150> have<00:04:37.720> a<00:04:37.780> diagonal<00:04:38.230> move<00:04:38.650> light<00:04:38.860> point

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
can can have a diagonal move light point

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.260 
can can have a diagonal move light point
step<00:04:40.330> points<00:04:41.290> step<00:04:41.590> turn<00:04:42.280> turn

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
step points step turn turn

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.100 
step points step turn turn
points<00:04:43.990> cap<00:04:44.290> point<00:04:44.920> step<00:04:45.460> turn<00:04:46.150> turn<00:04:46.720> and

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
points cap point step turn turn and

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.250 
points cap point step turn turn and
slide<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:48.340> slide<00:04:48.940> all<00:04:49.330> right<00:04:49.540> so<00:04:50.080> you<00:04:50.140> can

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
slide and slide all right so you can

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.790 
slide and slide all right so you can
really<00:04:50.620> fly<00:04:51.400> in<00:04:51.430> those<00:04:51.790> last<00:04:52.090> two<00:04:52.840> steps<00:04:53.110> all

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
really fly in those last two steps all

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.380 
really fly in those last two steps all
right<00:04:54.250> so<00:04:54.430> let's<00:04:54.820> try<00:04:55.000> it<00:04:55.060> with<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.360> music

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:04.700 
right so let's try it with the music
okay<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:03.610> important<00:05:04.000> thing<00:05:04.150> about<00:05:04.240> this

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
okay the important thing about this

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.950 
okay the important thing about this

down<00:05:37.189> the<00:05:37.340> temple<00:05:41.289> so<00:05:42.289> the<00:05:42.560> good<00:05:42.710> thing<00:05:42.740> about

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
down the temple so the good thing about

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.270 
down the temple so the good thing about
this<00:05:43.250> computer<00:05:43.610> is<00:05:43.819> I<00:05:43.939> can<00:05:44.150> play<00:05:44.780> it<00:05:44.840> slower<00:05:45.349> so

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
this computer is I can play it slower so

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.589 
this computer is I can play it slower so
that<00:05:46.310> we<00:05:46.490> can<00:05:46.639> only<00:05:46.819> follow

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.499 

okay<00:05:50.289> maybe<00:05:51.099> a<00:05:51.279> little<00:05:51.429> bit<00:05:51.639> too<00:05:51.909> slow<00:05:52.210> but

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:52.509 
okay maybe a little bit too slow but

00:05:52.509 --> 00:06:40.200 
okay maybe a little bit too slow but
it's<00:05:53.050> for<00:05:53.259> learning<00:05:53.589> purposes<00:05:54.039> again

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:46.149
