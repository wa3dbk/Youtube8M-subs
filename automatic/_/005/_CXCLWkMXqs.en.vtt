00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:51.939 
how exciting it might be that they were

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
the first humans to fly ever because if

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.369 
the first humans to fly ever because if
they<00:02:54.760> flew<00:02:55.000> too<00:02:55.209> low<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.689> close<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.169> water

they flew too low and close to the water
the<00:02:57.069> feathers<00:02:57.430> would<00:02:57.579> get<00:02:57.730> wet<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.150> they

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
the feathers would get wet and they

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.440 
the feathers would get wet and they
crash<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.159> possibly<00:03:00.159> die<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:00.879> if<00:03:01.060> they<00:03:01.209> flew

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
crash and possibly die and if they flew

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.349 
crash and possibly die and if they flew
too<00:03:01.629> high<00:03:01.739> then<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:03.370> Sun<00:03:03.579> would<00:03:03.790> melt<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.180> wax

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
too high then the Sun would melt the wax

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.830 
too high then the Sun would melt the wax
and<00:03:04.870> they<00:03:05.799> would<00:03:06.040> crash<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:06.510> definitely<00:03:07.510> die

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
and they would crash and definitely die

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.839 
and they would crash and definitely die
but<00:03:08.349> Icarus<00:03:08.769> who<00:03:08.980> was<00:03:09.159> a<00:03:09.189> teenager<00:03:09.669> with

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
but Icarus who was a teenager with

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.240 
but Icarus who was a teenager with
attitude<00:03:10.329> was<00:03:10.569> too<00:03:10.810> cool<00:03:11.079> for<00:03:11.109> that<00:03:11.319> and<00:03:11.650> so<00:03:12.040> he

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
attitude was too cool for that and so he

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.580 
attitude was too cool for that and so he
decided<00:03:12.579> it<00:03:12.819> would<00:03:12.939> be<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.090> great<00:03:13.389> idea<00:03:13.569> to<00:03:13.810> fly

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
decided it would be a great idea to fly

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.939 
decided it would be a great idea to fly
