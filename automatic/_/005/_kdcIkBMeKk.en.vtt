00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
i think you can't even pick up some

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.789 
i think you can't even pick up some
things<00:04:07.420> you<00:04:08.110> know<00:04:08.200> you<00:04:08.260> maybe<00:04:08.440> you<00:04:08.560> can<00:04:08.650> pick

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
things you know you maybe you can pick

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.430 
things you know you maybe you can pick
up<00:04:08.890> the<00:04:08.980> cadence<00:04:09.400> they<00:04:10.060> need<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.330> pick<00:04:10.540> up<00:04:10.569> it's

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
up the cadence they need to pick up it's

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.380 
up the cadence they need to pick up it's
a<00:04:11.560> hard<00:04:11.769> count<00:04:11.980> or<00:04:12.160> not<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:12.580> pick<00:04:12.849> up<00:04:13.000> smoothie

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
a hard count or not and pick up smoothie

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.789 
a hard count or not and pick up smoothie
some<00:04:13.569> audibles<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:14.290> know<00:04:14.380> you<00:04:14.470> don't<00:04:14.560> want<00:04:14.739> to

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
some audibles you know you don't want to

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.349 
some audibles you know you don't want to
overthink<00:04:15.040> it<00:04:15.370> obviously<00:04:15.820> but<00:04:16.030> there's<00:04:16.239> some

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
overthink it obviously but there's some

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.870 
overthink it obviously but there's some
things<00:04:16.390> you<00:04:16.660> can<00:04:16.930> learn<00:04:17.079> so<00:04:17.890> hopefully<00:04:18.760> they

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
things you can learn so hopefully they

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.270 
things you can learn so hopefully they
watch<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.320> some<00:04:20.320> of<00:04:20.410> them<00:04:20.500> have<00:04:20.620> tutoring<00:04:20.950> so

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
watch it some of them have tutoring so

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.440 
watch it some of them have tutoring so
that<00:04:21.609> takes<00:04:21.760> precedence<00:04:24.419> alright<00:04:25.440> thanks
