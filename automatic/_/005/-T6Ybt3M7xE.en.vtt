movement<00:00:10.440> I'd<00:00:10.830> lead<00:00:11.130> with<00:00:11.250> two<00:00:11.400> examples<00:00:11.519> I

again from a different position though I
haven't<00:00:46.630> figured<00:00:46.960> out<00:00:47.020> how<00:00:47.140> to<00:00:47.170> do<00:00:47.410> this<00:00:47.590> with

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
haven't figured out how to do this with

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.170 
haven't figured out how to do this with
laterally<00:00:48.220> stacked<00:00:48.490> hands<00:00:48.730> as<00:00:48.850> opposed<00:00:49.120> to

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
vertically stacked hands it doesn't feel

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.980 
vertically stacked hands it doesn't feel
quite<00:00:51.280> right<00:00:51.370> now<00:00:52.330> this<00:00:52.480> next<00:00:52.540> one<00:00:52.840> is

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
quite right now this next one is

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.050 
quite right now this next one is
slightly<00:00:53.290> different<00:00:53.680> I'm<00:00:54.280> going<00:00:54.640> to<00:00:54.700> start<00:00:54.970> in

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
slightly different I'm going to start in

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.360 
slightly different I'm going to start in
a<00:00:55.120> high<00:00:55.300> side<00:00:55.630> position<00:00:55.960> meaning<00:00:56.890> my<00:00:57.160> high

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
a high side position meaning my high

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.340 
a high side position meaning my high
foot<00:00:57.730> is<00:00:57.850> on<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.000> same<00:00:58.300> side<00:00:58.330> as<00:00:58.720> my<00:00:58.840> dominant

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
foot is on the same side as my dominant

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.800 
foot is on the same side as my dominant
hand<00:00:59.380> I<00:00:59.860> make<00:01:00.250> a<00:01:00.280> move<00:01:00.550> I'm<00:01:00.820> going<00:01:01.030> to<00:01:01.150> take<00:01:01.630> my

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
hand I make a move I'm going to take my

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.810 
hand I make a move I'm going to take my
hand<00:01:02.110> push<00:01:02.590> it<00:01:02.710> against<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.010> wall<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:03.610> then

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
hand push it against the wall and then

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.760 
hand push it against the wall and then
against<00:01:04.120> my<00:01:04.270> stomach<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:04.930> then<00:01:05.320> bring<00:01:05.619> my

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
against my stomach and then bring my

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.620 
against my stomach and then bring my
foot<00:01:06.040> up<00:01:06.190> my<00:01:06.729> lower<00:01:07.000> foot<00:01:08.940> this<00:01:09.940> next<00:01:10.330> one's<00:01:10.510> a

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
foot up my lower foot this next one's a

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.420 
foot up my lower foot this next one's a
little<00:01:10.720> bit<00:01:10.930> more<00:01:10.960> goofy<00:01:11.470> never<00:01:11.920> try<00:01:12.190> to<00:01:12.220> get

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
little bit more goofy never try to get

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.160 
little bit more goofy never try to get
your<00:01:12.550> foot<00:01:12.760> up<00:01:12.910> really<00:01:13.720> really<00:01:13.990> really<00:01:14.470> high

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.460 

and<00:01:19.390> then<00:01:20.390> I<00:01:20.510> almost<00:01:20.870> pull<00:01:21.020> off<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.260> wall<00:01:21.440> nice

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
and then I almost pull off the wall nice

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.700 
and then I almost pull off the wall nice
okay<00:01:24.470> I<00:01:24.500> make<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.070> move<00:01:25.690> push<00:01:26.690> my<00:01:26.840> foot<00:01:27.050> up<00:01:27.200> I'm

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
okay I make the move push my foot up I'm

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.950 
okay I make the move push my foot up I'm
good<00:01:27.950> right<00:01:28.369> let's<00:01:29.150> try<00:01:29.300> this<00:01:29.360> differently

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
good right let's try this differently

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.670 
good right let's try this differently
how<00:01:30.920> about<00:01:31.250> a<00:01:31.280> knee<00:01:32.170> only<00:01:33.170> problem<00:01:33.500> with<00:01:33.590> the

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
how about a knee only problem with the

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.600 
how about a knee only problem with the
knees<00:01:34.030> you<00:01:35.030> can't<00:01:35.300> really<00:01:35.660> bend<00:01:36.610> anything

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
knees you can't really bend anything

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.880 
knees you can't really bend anything
within<00:01:37.759> that<00:01:37.970> upper<00:01:38.210> part<00:01:38.390> of<00:01:38.479> your<00:01:38.600> leg

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
within that upper part of your leg

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.170 
within that upper part of your leg
however<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.100> can't<00:01:40.340> get<00:01:40.550> out<00:01:40.670> of<00:01:40.790> it<00:01:40.909> in<00:01:41.090> a

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
however you can't get out of it in a

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.790 
however you can't get out of it in a
kind<00:01:41.390> of<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.540> graceful<00:01:42.050> way<00:01:42.200> this<00:01:42.470> is<00:01:42.590> assuming

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
kind of a graceful way this is assuming

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.100 
kind of a graceful way this is assuming
the<00:01:42.979> foot<00:01:43.250> is<00:01:43.369> big<00:01:43.580> enough<00:01:43.900> but<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:44.990> know<00:01:45.080> a

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
the foot is big enough but you know a

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.600 
the foot is big enough but you know a
little<00:01:45.470> bit<00:01:45.560> more<00:01:45.619> practice<00:01:46.100> maybe<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.400> can

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
little bit more practice maybe I can

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.010 
little bit more practice maybe I can
execute<00:01:46.909> this<00:01:47.150> a<00:01:47.210> little<00:01:47.390> bit<00:01:47.570> better<00:01:47.750> on

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
execute this a little bit better on

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.590 
execute this a little bit better on
