00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.380
 hello to all and lease no case I hope 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.890
 that you're fine in any case me that 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.390
 go nickel 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.700
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.990
 new video on gta his cane lane where 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.369
 I will show you how to get in 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.260
 in the tequila that's right behind 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.330
 me the famous bar that we already saw 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.560
 in the story mode and also so 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.970
 after the first robbery 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.250
 we see ourselves having a drink with our 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.680
 teammates so this famous bar is just 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.880
 here next to the apartment 400 miles I 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.829
 you put a little point on the radar 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.360
 hop there so I'm going to show you how 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.550
 get into this doc bar is just 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.140
 behind me here is the tequila there without 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.800
 so be in a mission or in a 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.539
 activity 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.129
 so let's go first we go 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.620
 having to go behind this building 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.859
 to be able to escalate is mounted on the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.420
 roof 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.789
 you'll see that glitch that's when 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.019
 even fast enough fairly simple and with 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.879
 this method you can go back to 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.100
 inside any building 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.690
 if we could already go back into the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.879
 story mode or in a mission if the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.320
 textures and let's say that's it 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.240
 gone to watch I go up on the roof 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.620
 here I will give you a little landmark 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.870
 look, I fired bullets already 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.159
 before on the floor here look at it 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.320
 small features so a small line 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.630
 two titles and a space a small dash 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.460
 a space and two titles and we are going 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.140
 having to position themselves between the two 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.720
 titles and and the little recap right here 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.070
 hop there just look here there once 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.670
 that you are here you take out your 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.560
 phone 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.570
 we go into inactivity and you take 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.550
 so the activity of gerald martin 2 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.710
 simeone no matter who you launch it 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.000
 watch download as soon as we go 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.860
 to arrive in the reception of the mission 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.270
 so just here you leave the most 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.220
 quickly possible you press the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.990
 round key and you validate there we go 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.160
 have a small load time is 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.170
 so as soon as we go as soon as we go 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.640
 to reappear in online mode we will 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.530
 find in the tequila the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.120
 look hop there I find myself in the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.880
 building one in veil breach actually this 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.500
 bar and there we have inside so only 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.600
 little negative point we will say is that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.250
 is this building when we do it 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.170
 off mission is not textures and so 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.270
 not like the way we had seen 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.590
 mass banana we were going inside 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.360
 everything was there the lights the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.580
 bottles the bar the dance floor and 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.039
 the lights while here look at it 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.959
 nothing in everything is black that's cool 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.160
 to know that can be nice to bring back 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.590
 your buddies inside maybe doing 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.670
 even an activity in there but we do not 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.410
 see nothing so it's still pretty 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.459
 pity I 'll do a little trick 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.540
 places you'll see there when 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.490
 not bad parts not bad 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.540
 of staircase frankly to make a 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.340
 little one rubbing it could be 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.600
 really stylish unfortunately in 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.290
 all doors can not be 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.670
 opened 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.989
 but we can see a lot of parts 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.730
 hamon said we could not see 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.709
 during the story mode or even 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.200
 during the small kinematics of the first 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.609
 koral turnaround finished and so that's 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.689
 come to the end this video I hope that 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.250
 this little guide I will have liked you 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.150
 as I told you so with this 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.409
 method you can go back to 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.390
 inside any building 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.790
 michael's house the house of 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.980
 franklin the bar so the tequila has it 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.689
 a lot of buildings where we could already 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.890
 have set foot in story mode or 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.230
 in a mission or something like 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.639
 that what can be really nice and 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.000
 so here I am I wanted it is on these 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.739
 imagery 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.030
 do not hesitate to drop a little thumb 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.720
 blue if the video you liked it will make me 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.760
 really happy 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.090
