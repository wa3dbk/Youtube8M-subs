00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:08.370
 Is no Hello man of leisure 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.050
 This time using the items I got last time 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.030
 We will make electrical products 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:19.450
 However , there is no power just because you have a high 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.850
 Power generation will be explained later 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.240
 Let's get started 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.289
 This room is made of led blocks 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:33.189
 It is bright 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.189
 Well, first of all, we will make materials to make machinery 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:44.040
 How is it made first 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:48.060
 There will also be the machine of material a cable that conduct electricity 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:55.050
 You can make the same cable without one act by arranging three copper 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:57.450
 This sunscreenless cable is not used for the material, and it is related when it passes electricity, so I coat it with rubber 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.579
 It must have 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:05.350
 Now you can have time in September the same cable 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:10.720
 The rubber is required in a large amount in the early stage because there are many places for this 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:15.509
 Or make the following material use it if there is also possible to use it as it is 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.509
 Demand for large quantities is required because the very high 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:27.020
 Well next time I will make the next item using copper wire 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.020
 Using the same line and Akaishi and smelting iron 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:39.970
 electronic circuit can create electronic circuit 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.970
 This is also a material of the same most of the mechanical equipment and the same war 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:53.140
 I also need to pay for this, so I will make some 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:58.840
 I need a lot of ships to make this 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:03.000
 So it is hard to mine copper and plant rubber trees in the early stage 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.000
 Let's go make a mechanical device 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.480
 Hmm 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:14.410
 Or will be taken out it is a little material is not enough 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.150
 It is an explanatory video and it is good 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:25.750
 It is rare to use refined iron as it is before that 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:33.100
 Basically, smelting iron blocks are also used to craft toy machine blocks in this way 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:38.370
 It is also useful when managing a large amount of refined iron because it can be reduced to 8 refined irons 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.370
 Or basic is one per machine one 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:52.710
 Let's take some stuff 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:58.100
 Yes we are ready to make machine equipment 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.100
 It is not a machine at first but as a convenient device 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:09.940
 It is iron furnace which we used in animation before 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:13.830
 It is the refining speed of 1.25 times of ordinary stone stove 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.830
 Let's put something in for a trial 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.420
 Let's bake a cobble stone 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.980
 It's a bit confusing, but the end was the same even though it was delayed 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.630
 I guess it was early 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.180
 Well next time 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.959
 p 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.959
 dee 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.520
 10 minutes 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.379
 Buch N 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.840
 I went with the machine block electronic circuit cobblestone flint 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:12.540
 Is the name Slater Kana crusher 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:15.450
 The main application is the opportunity to grind the item is to make the achievement a powder of the backseat powder is a achievement and 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.609
 In the same way, you can refine one on one 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:23.579
 The amount of ingots obtained is twice as much 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.579
 Work speed is slow, but let's endure 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.560
 Next is the two eyes of opportunity 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.639
 Eh using the machine block electronic circuit grilled stone 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:51.770
 Compressor is an item that compresses an item 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:51.770
 There is not a lot of turn in the early stage The main application is nuclear power related 

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:03.119
 Well then the third one is 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.590
 First of all I think this was anything with a five wood 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:20.450
 The correct answer is a tree tap. Using four tree taps , a machine block and an electronic circuit 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.289
 Aix is a tractor or Naa extractor 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:37.559
 Main use is to take out rubber from sap 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:42.979
 If you use this 1 rubber reference from this sap 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:42.979
 You can generate a rubber child from raw wood 1 U-Rubber 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.560
 next 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:58.919
 Shin Tezuka road made a little while ago 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:02.210
 Makoto Tezuka door start to further strengthen 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.210
 With electronic circuits 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.120
 You do 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:18.879
 electronic 4 Nasu Electric Cooker 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.680
 Iron furnace is 1.125 times the burning speed 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:35.580
 It is about these five types to use in the early stage 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:39.449
 However, since none of them operate without electricity, it is necessary to generate electricity 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.379
 I'm going to be next time 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.379
 I was upset
