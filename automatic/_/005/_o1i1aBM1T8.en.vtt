basically you just it overheats so you
have<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> wait<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.750> recharge<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.829> it's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
have to wait for it to recharge but it's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.530 
have to wait for it to recharge but it's
a<00:01:50.159> lot<00:01:50.340> more<00:01:50.369> accurate<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.180> does<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> lot

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
a lot more accurate and it does a lot

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.969 
a lot more accurate and it does a lot
more<00:01:51.600> damage<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.350> think<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.740> would<00:01:52.950> be

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
more damage and I think this would be

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.450 
more damage and I think this would be
absolutely<00:01:53.460> incredible<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.710> I<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:56.310> do

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
absolutely incredible and I really do

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.429 
absolutely incredible and I really do

really<00:02:22.430> work<00:02:23.060> like<00:02:23.269> it<00:02:23.810> really<00:02:24.049> does<00:02:24.440> just<00:02:24.680> fit

Spitfire<00:03:37.940> sort<00:03:38.299> of<00:03:38.419> like<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.690> flag<00:03:39.079> on<00:03:39.319> the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
Spitfire sort of like a flag on the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.240 
Spitfire sort of like a flag on the
firebird<00:03:40.609> saw<00:03:40.940> like<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.239> little<00:03:41.629> gas<00:03:42.260> mask<00:03:42.590> the

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
firebird saw like a little gas mask the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.159 
firebird saw like a little gas mask the
air<00:03:43.430> raid<00:03:43.669> and<00:03:43.849> nice<00:03:44.000> little<00:03:44.269> head<00:03:44.419> gear<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:45.079> I

air raid and nice little head gear and I

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.530 
air raid and nice little head gear and I
think<00:03:45.410> this<00:03:45.500> is<00:03:45.739> absolutely<00:03:46.669> incredible<00:03:46.940> and

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
think this is absolutely incredible and

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.750 
think this is absolutely incredible and
I<00:03:47.989> don't<00:03:48.319> know<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.530> just<00:03:48.560> looks<00:03:48.919> really<00:03:49.129> cool<00:03:49.519> I

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
I don't know it just looks really cool I

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.869 
I don't know it just looks really cool I
also<00:03:50.090> love<00:03:50.359> the<00:03:50.780> fact<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:51.079> people<00:03:51.980> who<00:03:52.549> make

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
also love the fact that people who make

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.210 
also love the fact that people who make
items<00:03:53.209> have<00:03:53.660> been<00:03:53.949> manipulating<00:03:54.949> source

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
items have been manipulating source

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.349 
items have been manipulating source
filmmaker<00:03:55.519> to<00:03:56.419> make<00:03:56.750> really<00:03:57.349> cool-looking

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
filmmaker to make really cool-looking

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.449 
filmmaker to make really cool-looking
versions<00:03:59.359> of<00:03:59.510> like<00:04:00.349> the<00:04:00.530> weapons<00:04:00.949> in<00:04:01.190> game<00:04:01.430> I

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
versions of like the weapons in game I

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.189 
versions of like the weapons in game I
think<00:04:01.669> that's<00:04:02.030> absolutely<00:04:02.180> incredible<00:04:02.989> and

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:03.199 
think that's absolutely incredible and

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.020 
think that's absolutely incredible and
as<00:04:03.560> a<00:04:03.590> as<00:04:03.889> I've<00:04:04.129> said<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.519> I'll<00:04:04.639> probably<00:04:04.790> see

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
as a as I've said and I'll probably see

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.939 
as a as I've said and I'll probably see
it's<00:04:05.180> quite<00:04:05.269> a<00:04:05.359> bit<00:04:05.569> the<00:04:05.930> talent<00:04:06.440> that<00:04:06.650> goes

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:06.949 
it's quite a bit the talent that goes

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.490 
it's quite a bit the talent that goes

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
i guess i don't know i like this i do

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.800 
i guess i don't know i like this i do
really<00:04:35.580> think<00:04:35.760> that<00:04:36.120> this<00:04:36.210> should<00:04:36.420> be<00:04:36.540> added

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
really think that this should be added

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.750 
really think that this should be added
and<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.470> really<00:04:37.710> just<00:04:37.860> sort<00:04:38.040> of<00:04:38.100> fit<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.520> theme

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
and it really just sort of fit the theme

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.570 
and it really just sort of fit the theme
of<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:39.300> heavy<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:39.750> i<00:04:39.840> enjoy<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:40.560> there<00:04:41.520> are

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
of the heavy and i enjoy it there are

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.220 
of the heavy and i enjoy it there are
videos<00:04:41.910> of<00:04:41.940> all<00:04:42.390> these<00:04:42.570> if<00:04:42.840> people<00:04:43.110> actually

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
videos of all these if people actually

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.190 
videos of all these if people actually
want<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.650> watch<00:04:44.010> these<00:04:44.450> this<00:04:45.450> is<00:04:45.630> his<00:04:45.840> mouth

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
want to watch these this is his mouth

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.870 
want to watch these this is his mouth
mouth<00:04:46.890> moving<00:04:48.260> that<00:04:49.260> that's<00:04:49.740> quite<00:04:50.070> cool<00:04:50.250> so

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
mouth moving that that's quite cool so

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.110 
mouth moving that that's quite cool so
last<00:04:51.300> but<00:04:51.480> not<00:04:51.810> least<00:04:51.870> is<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.350> odd<00:04:52.830> job<00:04:53.550> this

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
last but not least is the odd job this

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.340 
last but not least is the odd job this
is<00:04:54.360> a<00:04:54.420> hut<00:04:55.050> for<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.470> scout<00:04:56.810> the<00:04:57.810> only<00:04:58.230> way

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
is a hut for the scout the only way

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.110 
is a hut for the scout the only way
valve<00:04:58.560> or<00:04:58.710> other<00:04:58.920> weapon<00:04:59.100> is<00:04:59.460> if<00:04:59.610> we<00:04:59.760> make<00:04:59.940> them

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
valve or other weapon is if we make them

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.240 
valve or other weapon is if we make them
think<00:05:00.360> it<00:05:00.540> too<00:05:00.690> hot<00:05:00.870> so<00:05:01.500> that<00:05:01.890> makes<00:05:02.130> sense

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
think it too hot so that makes sense

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.300 
think it too hot so that makes sense
it's<00:05:02.640> a<00:05:02.820> flying<00:05:03.570> guillotine<00:05:03.900> esque<00:05:04.530> throwable

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
it's a flying guillotine esque throwable

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.170 
it's a flying guillotine esque throwable
so<00:05:05.760> it's<00:05:05.880> not<00:05:06.000> hot<00:05:06.950> okay<00:05:07.950> then<00:05:08.130> so<00:05:08.670> I<00:05:08.700> guess

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
so it's not hot okay then so I guess

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.480 
so it's not hot okay then so I guess
it's<00:05:09.210> stalled<00:05:09.660> like<00:05:09.810> a<00:05:09.840> hut<00:05:10.080> that<00:05:10.680> you<00:05:11.040> throw

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
it's stalled like a hut that you throw

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.730 
it's stalled like a hut that you throw
salt<00:05:12.060> like<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:12.360> flying<00:05:12.570> guillotine<00:05:12.810> but<00:05:13.440> not

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
salt like the flying guillotine but not

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.570 
salt like the flying guillotine but not
I<00:05:14.520> did<00:05:15.060> see<00:05:15.210> this<00:05:15.390> quite<00:05:16.130> not<00:05:17.130> quite<00:05:17.160> a<00:05:17.370> while

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
I did see this quite not quite a while

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.790 
I did see this quite not quite a while
ago<00:05:17.790> like<00:05:18.000> a<00:05:18.030> couple<00:05:18.150> of<00:05:18.450> weeks<00:05:18.540> ago<00:05:18.750> on<00:05:19.110> reddit

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
ago like a couple of weeks ago on reddit

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.980 
ago like a couple of weeks ago on reddit
it<00:05:20.220> does<00:05:20.430> look<00:05:20.460> quite<00:05:20.790> cool<00:05:21.030> I<00:05:21.270> do<00:05:21.330> think<00:05:21.870> that

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
it does look quite cool I do think that

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.740 
it does look quite cool I do think that
this<00:05:22.530> should<00:05:22.800> be<00:05:22.920> added<00:05:23.190> like<00:05:23.400> I<00:05:23.670> know<00:05:24.480> it's

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
this should be added like I know it's

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.990 
this should be added like I know it's
similar<00:05:24.960> to<00:05:25.140> the<00:05:25.320> flying<00:05:25.560> guillotine<00:05:25.830> but<00:05:26.760> I

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
similar to the flying guillotine but I

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.820 
similar to the flying guillotine but I
mean<00:05:27.300> they've<00:05:27.630> added<00:05:27.930> one<00:05:28.170> cleaver<00:05:28.530> they've
