00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.899
 what a beautiful book cover 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:05.899
 Not 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.750
 yes I had already threatened and here 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.330
 she is now the second episode of 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.949
 book cover and title fails and me leg 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.260
 Let's start with an absolute one 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.789
 icing and this 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.590
 beautiful copy of what is 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.269
 kindly recommended by lena 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.859
 if you do not have lenas block yet 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.279
 knows of course, is the bottom of the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.630
 infobox links but in any case 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.030
 cursed and sewn up means the good 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.550
 book what a little bit very pink and 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:43.230
 bizarre because what do you see there 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:45.270
 sees horse-hoofs pink so that with it 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.829
 cursing here is calling with such 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.480
 or with a proprietor never something like that 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.420
 it's very clear to him 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.829
 but what does it have to nourish with that 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.850
 outlook I might want it 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.350
 do not know and maybe we can 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.480
 All very grateful that only the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:04.019
 hooves of the horse sees the imagination 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.600
 anyway, why do publishers do something like that 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.740
 think it is already very much 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.250
 meaningful that this book since 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.380
 So first june is available since 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.810
 over three months and there are none 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.759
 only reviews on amazon there 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.229
 probably just no 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.659
 only man bought this book 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.810
 I had my wish to have the shelf 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.400
 have stood 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.439
 I do not think so whoever 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.720
 it was responsible that this cover so 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.119
 he has appeared before that 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.630
 look at it or just have it out 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.420
 provided a wrong picture printed 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.130
 The responsible designer thought so have 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.380
 I just have to go to the folder 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.159
 the picture just in the print folder 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.840
 pull and fruit out of mine 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.549
 private use does not stop 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.000
 well we come up from wooden 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.100
 stick or he hooves on feet 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.840
 John Green is an incredible one 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.759
 talented author like us almost all 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.969
 At least everyone knows the chance and him 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.220
 have read and done it and I have 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.929
 so far unfortunately only fate 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.830
 is read on this traitor but me 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.570
 plans 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.670
 others at some point in my shelf 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.950
 to be able to and one of these 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.640
 Books in German means something like 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.820
 alaska the english cat is very 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.260
 simple and very pretty 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:36.030
 I rather like simple cover but 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:38.610
 historical that is a disaster 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.570
 Look at it today that a huge 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.150
 long funny feet on it and a 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.300
 pool of cut in Pisa 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.900
 is and the authors title and this 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.540
 a wii is tiny alaska for 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.070
 It's huge if you can not do it at all 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.570
 know what the book is about then 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.959
 you sit there first alaska feet 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.720
 swimming pool 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.640
 that does not fit or like me 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.890
 the only one in snow at alaska and 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.150
 cold and desolate and I have none 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.700
 I know what's going on around here and it's crawling 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.440
 real or something I think does not know 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.050
 but in any case this has me 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.300
 Cover incredibly confused and a like 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.570
 Alaska is a girl like Alaska 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.480
 is cold and what does that have with her 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.519
 feet she has cold feet women have 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.170
 always cold feet that will be it 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.030
 is a story about a boy 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.030
 the stupidly a girl gets off the 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.290
 that always has cold feet and more 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.550
 is pretty boring and 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.440
 probably the book is about it 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.070
 as he is going on so something like that again 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.690
 such as this one movie is like going 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.630
 I break it off in 10 days just the other way around 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.940
 So how is he going to get rid of the girl? 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.130
 the cold feet I have no idea 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.540
 but it sounds scary shit though 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.910
 you just try the story too 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:04:00.830
 interpret based on the book and the 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.830
 titles and no also prefer to publish 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.480
 Next time not so but which one 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.910
 The problem maybe with feet 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.150
 not necessarily run-in 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.520
 people I do not know but this 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.530
 book fascinates me i already have 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.380
 so much good is part of it 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.180
 the story is said to be incredible 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.870
 black-humored and and somehow great 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.480
 be awesome no question but this book 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.030
 cover a woman at 1000 degrees 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:36.360
 and then this old wrinkled woman 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:38.820
 which somehow if you women too hot 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.970
 tells us the book cover quite clearly 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.600
 if you get karl lagerfeld falls to me 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.760
 not a 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.320
 I really want that in one too 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.360
 Special place in the shelf may have 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.200
 maybe a place of patricide and 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.620
 other family pleasures one 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:59.310
 run in woman with a flute in hand 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:03.330
 is good and comes before you now 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.040
 nightmares hardly gets heat to an animal 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.810
 the book cover is not better than will 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:18.600
 you probably a bit 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:21.600
 traumatize already good name but 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.120
 john irving distribute glass of norway 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.150
 us us here is called that god's work 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.950
 and devil's contribution and whole 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.330
 many other pretty cool books 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.540
 I have not read all yet but 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.850
 absolutely must read and well 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.190
 This book cover is actually it can 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.770
 nothing for it is probably the issue to 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.900
 film that was filmed before I have 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.850
 no idea how many thousand years yes 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:50.130
 and this book cover has now been added to the 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:52.290
 movie adapted and disturbing or me 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.479
 my there is a funny naked baby 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.580
 something as easy as it looks and 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:05.729
 falls from the sky and priced 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:10.960
 that is not friendly 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:13.940
 Ideally I think 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.460
 No anyway, I have set before you today 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.340
 my four ugliest book covers the 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.260
 i could show and we could find 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.200
 tell if you have read before 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.240
 or if you do not have these books 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.670
 even touching in the bookstore 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.110
 and which one she would buy 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.600
 would you really go to the shelf 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.190
 So I think if I do it 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.760
 happened to have one of these books 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:41.930
 I would hide it somewhere behind 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.490
 other books the beautiful help 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.790
 I would also read in the tram 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.110
 a protection in the spectrum I mean 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.070
 Seriously what do the people think of you 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:55.780
 if you see me reading a book and 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:57.890
 case of the baby shows gas 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.410
 No, I could my way is I'm 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.570
 I tired of hanging somehow stating any 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.980
 case is that with my sundays 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.210
 video I hope you have one more 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.920
 nice week a nice weekend 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.960
 well, here I see us we have 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.960
 but again without completing
