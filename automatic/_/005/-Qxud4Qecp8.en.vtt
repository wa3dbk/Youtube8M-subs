00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.410
 to almost 380,000 km from the earth very close 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.630
 already from the lunar surface of the apollo 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.320
 discovered other lights that flew 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.320
 information 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.550
 according to a red blackbird those lights 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.550
 they seemed to wait for apollo 11 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.470
 They were very bright and they flew in 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.470
 perfect training 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.390
 shortly after they moved away to great 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.850
 speed disappearing towards 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.940
 surface of the moon 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.970
 the astronauts were right that 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.220
 It seemed like a welcome but the most 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.220
 spectacular was about to arrive 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.760
 armstrong and aldrin descended 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.729
 finally his collins mate 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.970
 remained in lunar orbit 110 km from 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.970
 height 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.200
 and also 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.440
 and nothing more 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.580
 now 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.560
 to 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.470
 for poor countries 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.780
 in the dance floor 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.890
 for commitment 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.890
 we have 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.509
 of parents 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.240
 before 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.970
 the word why 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.750
 ah 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.750
 why 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.310
 really 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.200
 do not 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.200
 Oh 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.269
 parts 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.000
 good 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.830
 and shortly after that historic moon landing 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.430
 amstrong aldrin returned to 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.940
 startle the heart rate it 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.420
 shot up to 150 and 160 beats per 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.000
 minute 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.400
 the words of amstrong run over 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.330
 they perplexed the technicians of 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.330
 fair 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
 Y 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.030
 on the other side of the existing crater to little 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.709
 more than 60 meters of life had 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.989
 appeared some ships and some beings 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.720
 disk-shaped objects and 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:57.000
 perfectly aligned on the ground 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.270
 and next to them several very tall beings 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.709
 with white suits and tight when 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.260
 the astronauts obeying the 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.600
 insistent Houston orders treated 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.410
 of filming objects and series 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.410
 they disappeared 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.200
 but then 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.810
 when hollow 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:31.470
 and the culminating moment came 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.630
 true live of apollo 11 the secret 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.160
 reason that prompted the military to 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.790
 conquer the moon 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.790
 A) Yes
