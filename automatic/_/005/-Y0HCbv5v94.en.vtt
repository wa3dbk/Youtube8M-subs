00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 friends i am simon new muscle 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.500
 make a statement at rage perna one wonders how 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.450
 it is possible that a human being like that 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.250
 can build incredible muscles and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.320
 I think from my point of view 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.240
 Musculature of rich sees the energy 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.949
 very different from that of arnold 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.529
 schwarzenegger or from a draw 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.840
 coleman at best times but rihanna 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.670
 just looks more flexible voluminous 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.160
 out and the whole has a reason 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.410
 and switch the perner he admits that he 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.269
 anabolic steroids also used what in 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.130
 his physical form just plain 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.989
 is that he uses such things there 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.610
 I think it's honest because it always is 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.170
 there are still some people who know 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.670
 not at all modest and believe the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.210
 is an accurate somehow possible 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.980
 can 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.930
 after so many years more complete 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.620
 bullshit course used anabolic 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.300
 steroids 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.280
 but he admits it too and think so 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.379
 i just open and very honest 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.390
 on the other side he uses with 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.610
 safety something else what 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.110
 Give them those fleshy muscles 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.079
 and that is about 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.030
 Symptoms of this symbol is an oil that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.399
 is not an anabolic but a very 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.409
 special oil what in the muscles to 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.530
 example in the biceps is injected 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.939
 So with a syringe in the muscles 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.790
 is brought in and this oil 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.280
 becomes capped with the muscle fibers 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.369
 with the muscles 1 and takes care of it 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.450
 that one has bigger muscles this oil 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.040
 does not make sure that the muscles 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.509
 somehow bring more power or 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.369
 that they somehow get stronger or 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.170
 something quite the opposite 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.540
 This oil really only provides for it 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.130
 that you can get more muscles 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.210
 agility even the power can 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.090
 suffer from it 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.100
 it's just about bigger muscles 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.390
 and I suspect that he is this 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.909
 symbol under medical supervision 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.869
 probably from a doctor or from 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.340
 a pseudo doctor of one 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.829
 beauty surgeons or before 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.270
 always and let it inject there 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.009
 Of course, some cases 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.110
 they also became known in the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.909
 greg valentino that you can do that too 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.700
 can do myself is in my view 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.299
 the best thing you can do but totally 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.950
 Honestly 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.630
 Of course you are straight now 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.850
 what this beauty surgery land 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.130
 As well as much that is said to 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.689
 can be put muscle implants 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.520
 Implants probably at 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.770
 schwarzenegger been there but just 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.720
 Muscles, so to speak 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.730
 Spray on the eastern side and then see the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.610
 muscles are not clear and defined 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.160
 but rather meaty and even 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.840
 voluminous and that is at the bridge 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.180
 piano in my view the case 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.040
 in plain language it means these big and 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.900
 fleshy muscles are not just that 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.000
 result of anabolic steroids or a 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.430
 extreme mass phase where you every evening 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.410
 Ben &amp; Jerry's is this one 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.260
 hard-working muscles are the result 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.599
 that this oil symbol is still extra 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.640
 into which muscle is injected and thereby 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.829
 the muscles just bigger than diligent 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.750
 and also appear voluminous 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.209
 Of course, from my point of view, it completely leaves 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.040
 clearly not recommended I advise nobody 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.260
 to use anabolic steroids I advise 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.209
 no one to this symbol maybe 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.980
 It's like that in ten or fifteen years with us 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.870
 that it is a very normal part of 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.730
 Beauty surgery is it now 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.890
 very reserved because you too 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.480
 I know something different than an implant 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.519
 lets take out again sells 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.560
 this oil with the muscles and it 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.140
 irretrievably on all times with 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.400
 Musculature fused together 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.739
 and can not be there anymore 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.450
 rausholen what I developed there then that 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.920
 No one can tell you because no one knows how 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.930
 that develops if that is 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.209
 someday ignited or you know it 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.799
 not one can not say anything about it 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.450
 There are no good and long-term studies 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.280
 I am also very happy that 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.630
 sinto do not live well either 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.250
 is available and not often 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.400
 is used because of such things 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.930
 of course I advise you from all clear 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.459
 See you in the next video many 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.459
 greetings from your simon
