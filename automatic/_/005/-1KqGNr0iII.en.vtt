a leather boot so one of the benefits of
manmade<00:01:05.489> materials<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.240> find<00:01:06.510> they<00:01:06.750> are

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
manmade materials is I find they are

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.200 
manmade materials is I find they are
more<00:01:07.350> water<00:01:07.650> resistant<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.520> generally

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
more water resistant and just generally

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.500 
more water resistant and just generally
don't<00:01:09.540> wear<00:01:10.200> wear<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.590> tear<00:01:10.830> or<00:01:11.280> sure<00:01:11.510> so

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
think about that bless you do when it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.399 
think about that bless you do when it
comes<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> boot<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.780> okay<00:01:16.259> this

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.199 
jeans okay
just<00:02:21.100> cuz<00:02:21.250> they<00:02:21.370> would<00:02:21.520> fit<00:02:21.730> right<00:02:21.880> you<00:02:22.030> don't

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
just cuz they would fit right you don't

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.970 
just cuz they would fit right you don't
want<00:02:22.360> them<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.780> go<00:02:22.900> over<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.350> boot<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.560> could

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
want them to go over the boot you could

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.110 
want them to go over the boot you could
wear<00:02:24.160> them<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.430> way<00:02:24.580> but<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:24.820> think<00:02:25.030> it's

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
wear them that way but I think it's

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.000 
wear them that way but I think it's
great<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.450> show<00:02:25.660> off<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.320> little<00:02:26.530> extra

great to show off just that little extra

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.040 
great to show off just that little extra
height<00:02:27.160> on<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.209> doesn't<00:02:28.450> look<00:02:28.510> like<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.720> shoe

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050
