I'm mark Bell the inventor of the

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.420 
I'm mark Bell the inventor of the
slingshot<00:00:06.020> and<00:00:06.200> this<00:00:06.470> is<00:00:06.680> a<00:00:06.710> new<00:00:06.890> product<00:00:07.220> from

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:07.430 
slingshot and this is a new product from

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.520 
slingshot and this is a new product from
how<00:00:07.609> much<00:00:07.760> you<00:00:07.910> bench<00:00:08.090> dotnet<00:00:08.690> called

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
how much you bench dotnet called

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.520 
how much you bench dotnet called
the<00:00:09.800> full<00:00:10.040> bore<00:00:10.370> slingshot<00:00:11.300> as<00:00:11.930> you<00:00:12.170> can<00:00:12.290> see

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
the full bore slingshot as you can see

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.020 
the full bore slingshot as you can see
one<00:00:12.800> of<00:00:12.830> the<00:00:12.950> differences<00:00:13.310> right<00:00:13.550> off<00:00:13.730> the<00:00:13.850> bat

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
one of the differences right off the bat

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.870 
one of the differences right off the bat
is<00:00:14.330> that<00:00:14.870> it's<00:00:15.050> yellow<00:00:15.470> as<00:00:15.830> opposed<00:00:16.430> to<00:00:16.640> red

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
is that it's yellow as opposed to red

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.079 
is that it's yellow as opposed to red
but<00:00:17.660> also<00:00:17.840> it<00:00:18.080> has<00:00:18.260> an<00:00:18.439> angled<00:00:18.890> arm<00:00:19.189> an<00:00:19.460> angled

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:20.089 
but also it has an angled arm an angled

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.480 
but also it has an angled arm an angled
sleeve<00:00:20.419> and<00:00:20.919> that<00:00:21.919> is<00:00:22.070> going<00:00:22.189> to<00:00:22.249> give<00:00:22.369> you<00:00:22.460> a

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
sleeve and that is going to give you a

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.159 
sleeve and that is going to give you a
little<00:00:22.609> bit<00:00:22.759> more<00:00:22.970> pop<00:00:23.240> off<00:00:23.539> the<00:00:23.779> bottom<00:00:24.140> of

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
little bit more pop off the bottom of

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.989 
little bit more pop off the bottom of
the<00:00:24.259> lift<00:00:24.529> it's<00:00:25.279> also<00:00:25.429> going<00:00:25.609> to<00:00:25.669> make<00:00:25.820> it<00:00:25.939> a

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:25.999 
the lift it's also going to make it a

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.640 
the lift it's also going to make it a
little<00:00:26.119> bit<00:00:26.269> more<00:00:26.390> idiot-proof<00:00:26.839> because<00:00:27.499> the

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
little bit more idiot-proof because the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.800 
little bit more idiot-proof because the
slingshot<00:00:28.249> is<00:00:28.669> now<00:00:29.119> going<00:00:29.390> to<00:00:29.449> be<00:00:29.539> able<00:00:29.630> to

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
slingshot is now going to be able to

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.390 
slingshot is now going to be able to
come<00:00:29.960> up<00:00:29.989> a<00:00:30.140> little<00:00:30.289> bit<00:00:30.439> higher<00:00:30.679> on<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:31.039> arms

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
come up a little bit higher on the arms

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.000 
come up a little bit higher on the arms
the<00:00:32.180> entire<00:00:32.509> point<00:00:32.899> of<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:33.320> slingshot<00:00:33.829> is

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
the entire point of the slingshot is

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.010 
the entire point of the slingshot is
allow<00:00:34.310> you<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.610> overload<00:00:35.180> to<00:00:35.420> handle<00:00:35.810> more

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
allow you to overload to handle more

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.350 
allow you to overload to handle more
weight<00:00:36.080> to<00:00:36.980> Train<00:00:37.280> through<00:00:37.760> and<00:00:38.060> around

weight to Train through and around
injuries<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:40.610> slingshot<00:00:41.150> is<00:00:41.270> also<00:00:41.750> providing

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
injuries the slingshot is also providing

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.620 
injuries the slingshot is also providing
you<00:00:42.380> with<00:00:42.500> better<00:00:42.890> form<00:00:43.190> as<00:00:43.550> you<00:00:43.940> can<00:00:44.150> see<00:00:44.330> here

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
you with better form as you can see here

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.090 
you with better form as you can see here
whon<00:00:45.320> Leija<00:00:45.800> is<00:00:47.230> tucking<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.320> elbows<00:00:48.680> in<00:00:48.890> ever

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
whon Leija is tucking the elbows in ever

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.330 
whon Leija is tucking the elbows in ever
so<00:00:49.340> gently<00:00:49.660> towards<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:50.780> sides<00:00:51.020> there<00:00:51.440> and

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
so gently towards the sides there and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.530 
so gently towards the sides there and
that's<00:00:52.490> the<00:00:52.640> way<00:00:52.700> a<00:00:52.730> benchpress<00:00:53.060> should<00:00:53.420> be

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
that's the way a benchpress should be

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.110 
that's the way a benchpress should be
done<00:00:53.750> when<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.530> elbows<00:00:54.860> come<00:00:55.100> out<00:00:55.340> your<00:00:55.880> arm

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
done when the elbows come out your arm

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.210 
done when the elbows come out your arm
travels<00:00:56.600> too<00:00:56.810> far<00:00:57.050> past<00:00:57.080> your<00:00:57.590> midline<00:00:57.980> and

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
travels too far past your midline and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.700 
travels too far past your midline and
puts<00:00:58.970> a<00:00:59.150> tremendous<00:00:59.210> amount<00:00:59.990> of<00:01:00.080> stress<00:01:00.410> on

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
puts a tremendous amount of stress on

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.850 
puts a tremendous amount of stress on
the<00:01:01.370> shoulder<00:01:01.790> you<00:01:02.110> can<00:01:03.110> still<00:01:03.380> bench<00:01:03.590> press

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
the shoulder you can still bench press

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.359 
the shoulder you can still bench press
that<00:01:04.100> way<00:01:04.280> in<00:01:04.549> a<00:01:04.670> slingshot<00:01:05.590> but<00:01:06.590> in<00:01:06.799> terms<00:01:07.159> of

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
that way in a slingshot but in terms of

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.130 
that way in a slingshot but in terms of
powerlifting<00:01:08.000> in<00:01:08.120> terms<00:01:08.330> of<00:01:08.510> trying<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:08.960> lift

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
powerlifting in terms of trying to lift

powerlifting in terms of trying to lift
the<00:01:09.290> most<00:01:09.500> amount<00:01:09.740> of<00:01:09.860> weight<00:01:10.070> over<00:01:10.310> a<00:01:10.970> long

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
the most amount of weight over a long

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.360 
the most amount of weight over a long
period<00:01:11.720> of<00:01:11.780> time<00:01:11.870> you're<00:01:12.800> going<00:01:13.010> to<00:01:13.100> want<00:01:13.280> to

period of time you're going to want to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.340 
period of time you're going to want to
drive<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:13.940> elbows<00:01:14.180> inward<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.750> little<00:01:14.780> bit<00:01:15.050> and

drive the elbows inward a little bit and
then<00:01:15.470> flare<00:01:15.770> them<00:01:15.950> outward<00:01:16.430> as<00:01:16.640> you're<00:01:17.420> coming

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
then flare them outward as you're coming

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.380 
then flare them outward as you're coming
up<00:01:17.870> as<00:01:18.409> we<00:01:18.680> say<00:01:18.860> it's<00:01:18.979> super<00:01:19.280> training<00:01:19.580> you're

I<00:02:28.370> recently<00:02:29.210> use<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.540> slingshot<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:30.140> handle<00:02:30.680> a

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
I recently use a slingshot to handle a

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.680 
I recently use a slingshot to handle a
certain<00:02:31.070> weight<00:02:31.250> did<00:02:31.550> about<00:02:31.730> 500<00:02:32.210> pounds<00:02:32.330> and

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
certain weight did about 500 pounds and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.370 
certain weight did about 500 pounds and
then<00:02:33.320> immediately<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.760> next<00:02:34.910> set<00:02:35.210> did<00:02:36.110> 500

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
then immediately the next set did 500

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.020 
then immediately the next set did 500
pounds<00:02:36.950> without<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.340> slingshot<00:02:37.820> that

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
pounds without the slingshot that

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.760 
pounds without the slingshot that
actually<00:02:38.360> felt<00:02:38.540> really<00:02:38.780> really<00:02:39.230> great<00:02:39.530> too

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770

actually felt really really great too
and<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.460> think<00:02:40.700> that<00:02:40.820> might<00:02:41.000> be<00:02:41.030> something<00:02:41.150> I

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.690 
and I think that might be something I
might<00:02:41.690> utilize<00:02:41.900> in<00:02:42.290> my<00:02:42.410> training<00:02:42.830> just<00:02:43.640> to
