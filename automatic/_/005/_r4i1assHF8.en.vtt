00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 there were several overflights in this triangle formed between aguascalientes 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.590
 guadalajara bajío and zacatecas so more or less 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.289
 there were several aircraft of different he 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.289
 linkedin next day 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.879
 detect embassy pilots 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.529
 in the middle of this all this traffic that was in different heights 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.449
 must go down one is a light in decent can very fast 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.219
 that the controller of aguascalientes of touch see front 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.919
 I was waiting for a flight 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:37.360
 at that time everyone is posted where s ss object is as 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:38.240
 is that low 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.880
 and everyone assumes 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.430
 is an aircraft that is falling now will carry the collagen ribbon 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.360
 of all the wines in sight such is it that on earth they moved by the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.739
 series happened with aznar 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.370
 in a street equal salary 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.430
 he 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.980
 he arrived before crashing before 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.480
 it is suspended 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.810
 the driver who wants we should sometimes see it 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.879
 in 8 kg 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.109
 not to explode there is not a Haitian shock said that it did not have 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.500
 but the light according to the parents in favor of the state achieving that we report it 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.490
 kilos 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.659
 those heart problems that affected him and had lights and came 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.600
 a big being no 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.530
 this is a case you have seen a lung and a metallic object not outside the radar 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.100
 I do not expect ever to strengthen with luck of 13 locomotive banking entities 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.330
 donations according to the source 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.030
 yolanda punta del este 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.929
 lopez sense that it is a danger is already a reality that are a danger c 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.470
 same can not represent a successful option 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.810
 we bring some images of every time they are hit I was dead 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.220
 interested 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.820
 so that we understand because the objects in flight represent a danger for the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.480
 planning and how airports do what aberrant strategy that 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.710
 is to train hawk eagles to scare them away because they told me that 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.250
 dangerous of this law 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.510
 a verbal duel through 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.010
 on one of these flights 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.860
 the most critical section is the takeoff because baa with maximum weight operation 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.249
 is not going to paco figurado country to the air but needs its power in order 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:16.269
 any condition that 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.159
 that ss dwindles those characteristics to be able to go to the air a 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.739
 one of them a building with wings to say it somehow 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.890
 he endangers and is very critical is the most critical part of the stretch of 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.699
 flight because an engine stop 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:34.059
 usually the pilot first has to keep the plane in line with 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:36.169
 flight after life to avoid 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.099
 the to his functions and after 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.760
 find a way to solve your problem or return to land 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.689
 all this despite being seconds not then when 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.959
 I have a pilot there is an unidentified object 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.639
 for us and for him 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.820
 that interferes with your flight path 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.190
 they can tell you in a maneuver that you can take it down in a moment 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.670
 dice 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.269
 or yes without agreeing with him possible to cross the trajectory 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.170
 this is 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.469
 very important and is also prohibited in a normal way 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.029
 despite this attack thank you thanks to important names of with 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:13.679
 advantages as a query and texture source 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:16.759
 This book by our friends and colleagues Carlos Guzmán and José 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.479
 salazar 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.409
 you will be with us soon 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.859
 here comes a chronology of the pending encounters of the details 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.100
 in an interview with efe that is because it is also very interesting many of 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.030
 the graceful ones who for the first time
