00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270 
quad core processor running at 3.2 gig
heads<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.780> there's<00:00:51.930> also<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.260> turbo<00:00:52.620> boost<00:00:53.039> now

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
heads and there's also a turbo boost now

heads and there's also a turbo boost now
this<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.610> money<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.879> really<00:00:54.120> good<00:00:54.329> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
this for the money is really good and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.540 
this for the money is really good and
you<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> true<00:00:55.140> quad<00:00:55.410> core<00:00:55.680> which<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.489> be

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you get a true quad core which to be

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.770 
you get a true quad core which to be
honest<00:00:56.730> doesn't<00:00:57.000> consume<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.390> lot<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.600> power

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
honest doesn't consume a lot of power

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.840 
honest doesn't consume a lot of power
for<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> actual<00:00:58.440> power<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:59.129> processor<00:00:59.670> has

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
for the actual power as processor has

from intel very nice and you do get
overclocking<00:01:25.409> capability<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.009> fair<00:01:26.159> enough

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
overclocking capability it's fair enough

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
overclocking capability it's fair enough
we're<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.549> gonna<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.729> overclocking<00:01:27.210> the

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
by default here you know you can plug

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.650 
by default here you know you can plug
them<00:05:23.860> in<00:05:23.979> if<00:05:24.099> you<00:05:24.190> need<00:05:24.460> them<00:05:24.699> and<00:05:24.880> getting<00:05:25.479> it

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
them in if you need them and getting it

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.240 
them in if you need them and getting it
better<00:05:25.840> kill<00:05:26.080> routing<00:05:26.500> but<00:05:26.830> ever<00:05:26.949> the<00:05:27.039> less

better kill routing but ever the less

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.310 
better kill routing but ever the less
this<00:05:27.490> is<00:05:27.669> a<00:05:27.699> good<00:05:28.030> pass<00:05:28.180> apply<00:05:28.479> and<00:05:28.720> 600<00:05:29.199> watts

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
this is a good pass apply and 600 watts

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.219 
this is a good pass apply and 600 watts
yes<00:05:29.560> is<00:05:29.740> enough<00:05:30.039> for<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.760> GPU<00:05:31.210> and<00:05:31.449> cpu<00:05:32.050> with

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
yes is enough for the GPU and cpu with

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.110 
yes is enough for the GPU and cpu with
quite<00:05:32.470> a<00:05:32.500> lot<00:05:32.650> of<00:05:32.740> room<00:05:32.889> there<00:05:32.919> despair<00:05:33.849> so<00:05:34.000> the

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
quite a lot of room there despair so the

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.629 
quite a lot of room there despair so the
fan<00:05:34.270> isn't<00:05:34.449> spinning<00:05:34.810> and<00:05:35.229> it's<00:05:35.620> very<00:05:35.919> fastest

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639
