00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.389 

well<00:00:00.900> I<00:00:01.140> pulled<00:00:01.469> mine<00:00:01.650> back<00:00:01.800> together<00:00:01.949> today

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
well I pulled mine back together today

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.649 
well I pulled mine back together today
so<00:00:02.639> it's<00:00:02.790> really<00:00:02.939> good<00:00:03.149> for<00:00:03.210> an<00:00:03.330> animal<00:00:03.510> tea

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
so it's really good for an animal tea

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.780 
so it's really good for an animal tea
but<00:00:04.020> it<00:00:04.710> needs<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.890> be<00:00:04.980> rolling<00:00:05.279> roaded<00:00:05.580> for

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
but it needs to be rolling roaded for

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.730 
but it needs to be rolling roaded for
that<00:00:06.140> rhizome<00:00:07.140> rate<00:00:07.290> fuel<00:00:07.529> pressure

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
that rhizome rate fuel pressure

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.310 
that rhizome rate fuel pressure
regulator<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.429> mentioned<00:00:08.910> earlier<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.389> just

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
regulator I mentioned earlier I just

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.660 
regulator I mentioned earlier I just
want<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.620> show<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.830> couple<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.160> areas<00:00:11.580> as

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
want to show you a couple of areas as

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.620 
want to show you a couple of areas as
well<00:00:11.790> which<00:00:13.580> are<00:00:14.580> actually<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.299> little<00:00:15.509> bit

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
well which are actually a little bit

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.160 
well which are actually a little bit
more<00:00:15.839> difficult<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.289> do<00:00:17.810> than<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:19.050> by

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
more difficult to do than just by

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.089 
more difficult to do than just by
looking<00:00:19.439> at<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.680> because<00:00:24.740> in<00:00:25.740> particular

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
looking at this because in particular

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.240 
looking at this because in particular
the<00:00:26.880> tea<00:00:27.210> do<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.660> table<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.410> doesn't<00:00:28.830> come

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
the tea do for table it doesn't come

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.490 
the tea do for table it doesn't come
mounted<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.449> direction<00:00:30.660> you'll<00:00:31.230> notice

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
mounted in that direction you'll notice

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.569 
mounted in that direction you'll notice
online<00:00:31.859> there's<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.899> the<00:00:33.899> inlet<00:00:34.579> sections

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
online there's a the inlet sections

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.209 
online there's a the inlet sections
facing<00:00:36.239> forward

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
facing forward

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.459 
facing forward
you've<00:00:38.219> got<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> braided<00:00:38.879> oil<00:00:39.570> feed<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.140> top

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
you've got the braided oil feed on top

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.150 
you've got the braided oil feed on top
now<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.969> actually<00:00:42.770> get<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.890> table

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
now you have to actually get that table

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.790 
now you have to actually get that table
off<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:45.629> something<00:00:45.899> called<00:00:46.050> rotating<00:00:46.680> it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
off and do something called rotating it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.760 
off and do something called rotating it
there's<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.899> in<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.960> middle<00:00:49.320> you've<00:00:49.440> got<00:00:49.620> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
there's a in the middle you've got a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.720 
there's a in the middle you've got a
catch<00:00:50.190> which<00:00:51.030> you'll<00:00:51.149> need<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.360> take<00:00:51.539> off

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
catch which you'll need to take off

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.410 
catch which you'll need to take off
gather<00:00:53.730> off<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:55.610> once<00:00:56.610> below<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> best<00:00:57.270> way

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
gather off and once below the best way

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.330 
gather off and once below the best way
to<00:00:57.449> do<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.870> got<00:00:58.140> was<00:00:58.350> put<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.739> vise<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
to do it I got was put in a vise and

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.060 
to do it I got was put in a vise and
you've<00:00:59.640> got<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.910> actually<00:01:00.239> tap<00:01:00.510> off<00:01:01.070> this

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
you've got to actually tap off this

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.240 
you've got to actually tap off this
housing<00:01:02.609> away<00:01:03.149> from<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.510> section<00:01:04.250> I

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
housing away from this section I

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.700 
housing away from this section I
basically<00:01:06.060> wanna<00:01:06.180> split<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.530> need<00:01:07.650> to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
basically wanna split it now you need to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.590 
basically wanna split it now you need to
do<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.040> both<00:01:08.070> sides

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
do that on both sides

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.710 
do that on both sides
one<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> exhaust<00:01:11.340> side<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.030> also<00:01:12.540> for

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
one for the exhaust side and also for

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.440 
one for the exhaust side and also for
the<00:01:12.780> intake<00:01:13.200> now<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.950> intake<00:01:14.369> side<00:01:14.670> which<00:01:15.299> has

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the intake now the intake side which has

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.240 
the intake now the intake side which has
got<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> impeller<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> which<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.070> this

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
got the impeller in it which is this

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.530 
got the impeller in it which is this
side<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.990> held<00:01:18.990> together<00:01:19.580> as<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.640> big<00:01:20.820> surf<00:01:21.210> clip

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
side is held together as a big surf clip

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.469 
side is held together as a big surf clip
I<00:01:22.159> don't<00:01:23.159> know<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:23.970> it's

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
I don't know if you can see it but it's

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.539 
I don't know if you can see it but it's
actually<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:25.290> you'll<00:01:26.009> need<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> tool<00:01:26.520> to

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
actually in there you'll need a tool to

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.940 
actually in there you'll need a tool to
actually<00:01:26.880> grip<00:01:27.299> onto<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.810> pull<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.860> apart

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
actually grip onto that pull it apart

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.039 
actually grip onto that pull it apart
and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.060> rotate<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.600> together<00:01:30.900> so

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and then you can rotate it together so

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.280 
and then you can rotate it together so
you<00:01:31.140> get<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> intake<00:01:32.369> facing<00:01:32.970> forward<00:01:33.390> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you get the intake facing forward and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.819 
you get the intake facing forward and
you'll<00:01:34.439> want<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.150> oil<00:01:36.150> line<00:01:36.540> coming<00:01:36.960> from<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
you'll want the oil line coming from the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.340 
you'll want the oil line coming from the
top<00:01:38.100> down<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.759> then<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.509> oil<00:01:39.689> will<00:01:40.020> drain<00:01:40.229> out

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
top down and then the oil will drain out

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.060 
top down and then the oil will drain out
the<00:01:40.380> bottom<00:01:40.740> back<00:01:41.189> into<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.579> sump<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.920> once

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the bottom back into the sump so once

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.469 
the bottom back into the sump so once
you've<00:01:44.159> done<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.310> exist<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.030> little<00:01:45.360> bit

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
you've done that exist a little bit

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.749 
you've done that exist a little bit
difficult<00:01:45.659> you've<00:01:45.990> got<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> depends<00:01:46.979> out<00:01:47.100> caked

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
difficult you've got a depends out caked

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.149 
difficult you've got a depends out caked
on<00:01:48.000> your<00:01:48.509> turbo<00:01:48.840> has<00:01:49.020> been<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:50.009> know<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
on your turbo has been so you know you

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.100 
on your turbo has been so you know you
need<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.369> hammer<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.210> bit<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.479> patience<00:01:51.840> but

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
need a hammer and a bit of patience but

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.910 
need a hammer and a bit of patience but
it<00:01:52.229> does<00:01:52.380> come<00:01:52.560> apart<00:01:52.829> eventually<00:01:54.710> also<00:01:55.710> hate

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it does come apart eventually also hate

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.219 
it does come apart eventually also hate
guess<00:01:58.009> actually<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.820> bracket<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.450> off<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> ct-9

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
guess actually the bracket is off a ct-9

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.840 
guess actually the bracket is off a ct-9
and<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.469> had<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.710> read<00:02:01.890> rill<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.579> actually

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
and I had to read rill this to actually

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.010 
and I had to read rill this to actually
make<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.000> fit<00:02:03.240> Latino<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:03.869> bracket<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.549> just

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
make it fit Latino for bracket so I just

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.680 
make it fit Latino for bracket so I just
rebuild<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.550> put<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> hole<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.940> middle<00:02:09.060> you

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
rebuild it put a hole in the middle you

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.330 
rebuild it put a hole in the middle you
see<00:02:09.720> op<00:02:09.959> sealer<00:02:10.200> two<00:02:10.379> holes<00:02:10.590> for<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.860> ct-9

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
see op sealer two holes for the ct-9

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.210 
see op sealer two holes for the ct-9
work

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.610 

and<00:02:15.220> then<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.930> whole<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:17.320> just<00:02:17.470> in<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.590> middle

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
and then the whole is just in the middle

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.700 
and then the whole is just in the middle
then<00:02:17.980> lap<00:02:18.190> two<00:02:18.370> screws<00:02:18.670> on<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:22.080> also<00:02:23.080> I'm

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
then lap two screws on and also I'm

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.060 
then lap two screws on and also I'm
attached<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.580> yet<00:02:24.730> but<00:02:24.940> on<00:02:25.090> mine<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.510> can<00:02:25.630> see

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
attached it yet but on mine you can see

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.230 
attached it yet but on mine you can see
I've<00:02:27.070> actually<00:02:27.310> got<00:02:27.670> them<00:02:27.850> in<00:02:27.970> Darrell<00:02:30.240> the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
I've actually got them in Darrell the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.020 
I've actually got them in Darrell the
bottom<00:02:31.600> I<00:02:31.810> drilled<00:02:32.680> through<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.100> so<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.820> can

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
bottom I drilled through it so you can

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.420 
bottom I drilled through it so you can
mount<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.570> on<00:02:34.720> for<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:36.750> catch<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:39.160> seems<00:02:39.370> a

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
mount it on for the the catch it seems a

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.730 
mount it on for the the catch it seems a
little<00:02:39.490> our<00:02:39.820> circuit<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.450> keep<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:40.720> on<00:02:40.930> and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
little our circuit to keep that on and

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.850 
little our circuit to keep that on and
that<00:02:41.770> will<00:02:41.920> be<00:02:42.040> my<00:02:43.260> adjustable<00:02:44.260> actuator<00:02:44.710> then

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
that will be my adjustable actuator then

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.450 
that will be my adjustable actuator then
so<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.040> can<00:02:45.190> set<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.490> one<00:02:46.000> bar<00:02:49.890> okay<00:02:50.890> my<00:02:51.040> I

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
so I can set that one bar okay my I

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.060 
so I can set that one bar okay my I
think<00:02:51.790> that's<00:02:51.940> it
