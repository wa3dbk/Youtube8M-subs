00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.730 
so it's got a phone input on the top and
on<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.320> top<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.710> there<00:02:31.830> too<00:02:32.100> in<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.700> back<00:02:33.740> you

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
on the top of there too in the back you

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.960 
on the top of there too in the back you
will<00:02:35.010> see<00:02:37.610> that<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.850> has<00:02:40.340> your<00:02:41.340> inputs

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
will see that it has your inputs

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.060 
will see that it has your inputs
that's<00:02:42.300> quarter-inch<00:02:42.900> also<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.470> have<00:02:43.770> on

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
that's quarter-inch also you have on

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.300 
that's quarter-inch also you have on
this<00:02:44.820> side<00:02:45.150> your<00:02:45.570> inputs<00:02:46.020> as<00:02:46.170> well<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.070> can

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
this side your inputs as well so you can

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.940 
this side your inputs as well so you can
put<00:02:48.210> it<00:02:48.330> in<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.810> side<00:02:48.870> or<00:02:49.350> do

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
put it in on this side or do

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.930 
put it in on this side or do
quarter-inch<00:02:50.750> then<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.110> photo<00:02:52.940> inputs

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
quarter-inch then you have photo inputs

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.700 
quarter-inch then you have photo inputs
you<00:02:54.240> can<00:02:54.270> make<00:02:54.570> them<00:02:54.720> line<00:02:54.990> if<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.320> see<00:02:55.350> that

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
you can make them line if you see that

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.960 
you can make them line if you see that
you<00:02:55.860> can<00:02:56.010> see<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.280> right<00:02:56.400> here<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:56.700> could<00:02:56.880> make

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
you can see it right here you could make

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.970 
you can see it right here you could make
them<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.210> wine<00:02:57.420> input<00:02:57.810> or<00:02:58.020> a<00:02:58.050> phono<00:02:58.350> input<00:02:58.740> so

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
them a wine input or a phono input so

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.010 
them a wine input or a phono input so
they<00:02:59.520> also<00:02:59.670> have<00:02:59.850> ground<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.630> can<00:03:00.810> put

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
they also have ground so you can put

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.040 
they also have ground so you can put
your<00:03:01.050> ground<00:03:01.610> loop<00:03:02.610> in<00:03:02.820> there<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:03.990> side

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
your ground loop in there on this side

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.420 
your ground loop in there on this side
these<00:03:04.620> are<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.400> source<00:03:05.960> or<00:03:06.960> you<00:03:07.320> know<00:03:07.500> in<00:03:07.740> fact

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
these are the source or you know in fact

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.720 
these are the source or you know in fact
as<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.670> were<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.660> would<00:03:09.780> hook<00:03:09.900> up<00:03:10.110> like<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:11.070> CD

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
as it were you would hook up like a CD

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.590 
as it were you would hook up like a CD
player<00:03:11.760> or<00:03:12.710> something<00:03:13.710> else<00:03:14.190> maybe<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.450> have

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
player or something else maybe you have

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.060 
player or something else maybe you have
a<00:03:15.740> so<00:03:16.740> let's<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:17.580> say<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.760> have<00:03:18.000> another

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
a so let's just say you have another

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.170 
a so let's just say you have another
computer<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.190> can<00:03:20.310> hook<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.520> up<00:03:20.610> as<00:03:20.760> well

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
computer you can hook it up as well

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.060 
computer you can hook it up as well
it<00:03:21.540> also<00:03:21.690> gives<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:21.990> a<00:03:22.020> quarter<00:03:22.290> inch<00:03:22.500> inputs

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
it also gives you a quarter inch inputs

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.310 
it also gives you a quarter inch inputs
on<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.790> side<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.150> that's<00:03:24.270> where<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.690> where

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
on this side so that's where the where

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.590 
on this side so that's where the where
they<00:03:25.440> come<00:03:25.650> in<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.730> just<00:03:27.090> want<00:03:27.300> to<00:03:27.360> let<00:03:27.450> you

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
know that's what it looks like basically

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.130 
know that's what it looks like basically
a<00:03:30.030> run<00:03:30.300> down<00:03:30.590> real<00:03:31.590> quick<00:03:32.120> quick<00:03:33.140> introduction

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
a run down real quick quick introduction

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.860 
a run down real quick quick introduction
and<00:03:34.320> what<00:03:34.410> you're<00:03:34.620> gonna<00:03:34.740> get<00:03:35.010> it's<00:03:35.640> got<00:03:36.360> on

especially if you are going to be
scratching<00:03:52.500> with<00:03:52.650> this<00:03:52.830> unit<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.250> you're

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
scratching with this unit and you're

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.550 
scratching with this unit and you're
going<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.490> have<00:03:53.640> a<00:03:53.670> lot<00:03:53.820> of<00:03:53.850> base<00:03:54.090> these<00:03:54.870> jog

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
going to have a lot of base these jog

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.699 
going to have a lot of base these jog
wheels<00:03:55.770> are<00:03:55.980> very<00:03:56.010> sensitive<00:03:56.850> so<00:03:57.330> if<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.500> do

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
wheels are very sensitive so if you do

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.580 
wheels are very sensitive so if you do
not<00:03:59.180> do<00:04:00.180> that<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.390> can<00:04:00.660> also<00:04:00.780> change<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.470> in

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
not do that you can also change it in

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.270 
not do that you can also change it in
the<00:04:01.739> in<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.700> configuration<00:04:03.920> when<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:05.040> map<00:04:05.250> it

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
the in the configuration when you map it

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.790 
the in the configuration when you map it
so<00:04:05.910> that's<00:04:06.209> another<00:04:06.480> thing<00:04:07.260> I'm<00:04:07.410> going<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.620> get

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
so that's another thing I'm going to get

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.350 
so that's another thing I'm going to get
into<00:04:08.070> but<00:04:08.220> this<00:04:08.340> isn't<00:04:08.550> a<00:04:08.700> brief<00:04:08.910> summary<00:04:09.150> of

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
into but this isn't a brief summary of

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.130 
into but this isn't a brief summary of
what<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:10.110> get<00:04:10.290> in<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:10.650> box<00:04:11.450> it's<00:04:12.450> just<00:04:13.050> a

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
what you get in this box it's just a

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.250 
what you get in this box it's just a
nice<00:04:13.290> little<00:04:13.440> unit<00:04:13.739> as<00:04:14.520> you<00:04:14.670> can<00:04:14.820> see<00:04:15.030> in<00:04:16.020> my

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
nice little unit as you can see in my

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.250 
nice little unit as you can see in my
