00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
you know Nitto obviously is really I'm

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.240 
you know Nitto obviously is really I'm
really<00:00:55.840> start<00:00:56.320> on<00:00:56.470> the<00:00:56.560> brand<00:00:56.770> and<00:00:57.010> everything

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
really start on the brand and everything

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.600 
really start on the brand and everything
but<00:00:58.030> they've<00:00:58.780> never<00:00:59.020> been<00:00:59.410> like<00:00:59.710> a<00:00:59.920> super<00:01:00.309> top
