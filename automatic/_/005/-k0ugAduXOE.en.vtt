that was the near miss that was also
bang<00:01:39.150> straight<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.780> there's<00:01:39.990> nothing<00:01:40.260> he<00:01:40.350> can

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
bang straight in there's nothing he can

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.560 
bang straight in there's nothing he can
do<00:01:40.620> about<00:01:40.800> it<00:01:40.860> he<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.310> looks<00:01:41.520> up<00:01:41.670> finding<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
do about it he just looks up finding a

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.270 
do about it he just looks up finding a
solution<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.260> racetrack<00:01:43.440> there's<00:01:44.190> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
solution on the racetrack there's a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.760 
solution on the racetrack there's a
motor<00:01:44.550> car<00:01:44.820> what<00:01:45.060> what<00:01:45.330> can<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.770> well

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
motor car what what can you do well

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.550 
motor car what what can you do well
glazy<00:01:47.100> also<00:01:47.700> was<00:01:48.000> part<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.720> car<00:01:48.930> 87

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
