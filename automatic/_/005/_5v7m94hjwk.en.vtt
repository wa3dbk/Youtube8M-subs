00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.579 

okay<00:00:00.329> so<00:00:00.390> the<00:00:00.539> shot<00:00:00.719> of<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.050> staff<00:00:01.380> and

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
okay so the shot of the staff and

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:02.960 
okay so the shot of the staff and
jumping<00:00:01.979> off<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.250> building<00:00:02.370> onto<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.790> car

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
jumping off the building onto the car

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.300 
jumping off the building onto the car
was<00:00:03.750> done<00:00:04.020> with<00:00:04.259> several<00:00:04.560> steps<00:00:04.830> first<00:00:05.160> what

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
was done with several steps first what

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.490 
was done with several steps first what
we<00:00:05.400> did<00:00:05.520> was<00:00:05.670> we<00:00:05.790> motion<00:00:06.210> tracked<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.720> shot<00:00:06.960> we

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
we did was we motion tracked the shot we

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.470 
we did was we motion tracked the shot we
use<00:00:07.710> PF<00:00:08.099> track<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.460> go<00:00:08.519> 3d<00:00:08.790> motion<00:00:09.120> track<00:00:09.300> here

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
use PF track to go 3d motion track here

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.970 
use PF track to go 3d motion track here
and<00:00:09.630> here<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.290> brought<00:00:10.530> into<00:00:10.679> After

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
and here it is brought into After

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.370 
and here it is brought into After
Effects<00:00:11.250> with<00:00:12.090> just<00:00:12.330> two<00:00:12.480> X<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.840> representing

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
Effects with just two X is representing

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.079 
Effects with just two X is representing
two<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.799> exported<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.429> all<00:00:14.519> objects<00:00:14.969> you

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
two of the exported and all objects you

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.250 
two of the exported and all objects you
can<00:00:15.179> see<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.480> they're<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> little<00:00:15.750> bit<00:00:15.929> shaky

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
can see that they're a little bit shaky

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.200 
can see that they're a little bit shaky
it<00:00:16.619> wasn't<00:00:16.920> necessary<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.460> have<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.670> perfectly

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
it wasn't necessary to have it perfectly

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.120 
it wasn't necessary to have it perfectly
stable<00:00:18.570> because<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> most<00:00:19.470> attractive<00:00:19.770> part

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
stable because the most attractive part

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.460 
stable because the most attractive part
of<00:00:20.279> them<00:00:20.430> jumping<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> air<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.140> it's

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
of them jumping is in the air so it's

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.470 
of them jumping is in the air so it's
fairly<00:00:23.250> relative<00:00:23.820> meaning<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.449> don't

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
fairly relative meaning that we don't

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.029 
fairly relative meaning that we don't
have<00:00:24.689> anything<00:00:24.840> sticking<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.890> any

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
have anything sticking on to any

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.400 
have anything sticking on to any
surfaces<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> loose<00:00:28.019> motion

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
surfaces so we can have a loose motion

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.220 
surfaces so we can have a loose motion
track<00:00:28.590> for<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.130> here<00:00:29.550> are<00:00:29.699> exported<00:00:30.300> X's

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
track for that so here are exported X's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.610 
track for that so here are exported X's
out<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:32.040> PF<00:00:32.700> track<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.200> we'll<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.320> ahead<00:00:34.469> and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
out of PF track and we'll go ahead and

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.209 
out of PF track and we'll go ahead and
take<00:00:35.100> those<00:00:35.280> off<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.050> after<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.219> what

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
take those off here and after that what

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.530 
take those off here and after that what
we<00:00:38.340> did<00:00:38.579> was<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.750> had<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.500> shot<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.540> Zack

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
we did was we had this shot here of Zack

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.560 
we did was we had this shot here of Zack
falling<00:00:43.170> from<00:00:43.739> underneath<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.940> had<00:00:45.180> this

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
falling from underneath we had this

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.900 
falling from underneath we had this
plate<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.379> Zack<00:00:47.210> going<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.600> down<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
plate of Zack going up and down and and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
plate of Zack going up and down and and
this<00:00:50.910> was<00:00:51.090> pretty<00:00:51.239> cool<00:00:51.480> because<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.780> actually

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
this was pretty cool because I actually

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.459 
this was pretty cool because I actually
got<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.350> go<00:00:52.500> back<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.190> my<00:00:53.840> 11th<00:00:54.840> grade<00:00:54.899> physics

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
got to go back to my 11th grade physics

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.569 
got to go back to my 11th grade physics
class<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.219> remember<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.910> recall<00:00:57.780> an

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
class and remember and recall an

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.819 
class and remember and recall an
equation<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.030> had<00:01:00.359> gotten<00:01:01.109> for<00:01:01.350> gravity

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
equation that I had gotten for gravity

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.840 
equation that I had gotten for gravity
so<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.160> see<00:01:02.280> here<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.489> he<00:01:02.550> starts<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
so you can see here that he starts to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.310 
so you can see here that he starts to
fall<00:01:03.030> off<00:01:03.210> pretty<00:01:03.420> slow<00:01:03.750> well<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.049> he<00:01:04.110> starts

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
fall off pretty slow well then he starts

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.590 
fall off pretty slow well then he starts
to<00:01:04.379> speed<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> way<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.299> did<00:01:06.450> this

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
to speed up so the way that we did this

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.630 
to speed up so the way that we did this
was<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.350> took<00:01:07.500> our<00:01:07.650> position<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.369> set<00:01:08.549> an

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
was we took our position and we set an

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.160 
was we took our position and we set an
expression<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.240> our<00:01:09.299> position<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:09.869> if

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
expression for our position here so if

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.200 
expression for our position here so if
we<00:01:10.290> double<00:01:10.409> cliff<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.830> hit<00:01:10.979> eat<00:01:11.159> Weiss<00:01:11.430> it's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
we double cliff we hit eat Weiss it's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.250 
we double cliff we hit eat Weiss it's
going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> bring<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.630> our<00:01:12.689> expression

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
going to bring up our expression

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.230 
going to bring up our expression
controls<00:01:13.470> here<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.490> see<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.880> we

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
controls here and you can see that we

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.679 
controls here and you can see that we
have<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.869> Y<00:01:16.409> equation<00:01:16.979> set<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.280> 9.8<00:01:17.850> times

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
have this Y equation set to 9.8 times

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.140 
have this Y equation set to 9.8 times
time<00:01:19.229> times<00:01:19.590> time<00:01:19.830> times<00:01:20.220> 300<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.030> did

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
time times time times 300 so what we did

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.940 
time times time times 300 so what we did
here<00:01:21.390> was<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.869> know<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> expression<00:01:22.860> for

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
here was I know that the expression for

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.820 
here was I know that the expression for
gravity<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.460> 9.8<00:01:23.790> meters<00:01:24.630> per<00:01:24.659> second<00:01:25.380> squared

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
gravity is 9.8 meters per second squared

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.460 
gravity is 9.8 meters per second squared
so<00:01:26.159> basically<00:01:26.970> he's<00:01:27.630> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> fall<00:01:28.200> at<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
so basically he's going to fall at a

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.730 
so basically he's going to fall at a
rate<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.950> 9.8<00:01:29.759> meters<00:01:30.479> every<00:01:30.810> second<00:01:31.470> times

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
rate of 9.8 meters every second times

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.240 
rate of 9.8 meters every second times
the<00:01:32.040> time<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.420> squared<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.770> get<00:01:35.100> x

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the time that we have squared so I get x

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
the time that we have squared so I get x
squared<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:36.060> an<00:01:36.210> expression<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.780> to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
squared we just an expression here to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.319 
squared we just an expression here to
equal<00:01:37.290> time<00:01:37.590> times<00:01:38.400> itself<00:01:38.759> which<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.090> x

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
equal time times itself which is x

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.530 
equal time times itself which is x
squared<00:01:39.659> 9.8<00:01:40.619> meters<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> way<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.030> decided

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
squared 9.8 meters so the way we decided

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.749 
squared 9.8 meters so the way we decided
what<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> meter<00:01:43.049> was<00:01:43.320> was<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.159> estimated<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
what a meter was was I estimated the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.969 
what a meter was was I estimated the
size<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.210> zak<00:01:45.420> which<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.899> roughly<00:01:46.290> 2<00:01:46.590> meters

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
size of zak which is roughly 2 meters

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.109 
size of zak which is roughly 2 meters
and<00:01:47.329> then<00:01:48.329> found<00:01:48.810> out<00:01:49.049> what<00:01:49.200> 9<00:01:49.409> would<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
and then found out what 9 would be and

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.450 
and then found out what 9 would be and
that<00:01:51.119> was<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.960> found<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.259> be<00:01:52.350> about<00:01:52.500> 300<00:01:53.070> pixels

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
that was we found to be about 300 pixels

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.340 
that was we found to be about 300 pixels
so<00:01:53.640> that's<00:01:53.820> what<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.000> times<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.750> by<00:01:54.810> 300<00:01:55.259> pixels

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
so that's what we times it by 300 pixels

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.459 
so that's what we times it by 300 pixels
and<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:56.700> set<00:01:56.909> equal<00:01:57.090> X<00:01:57.719> equal<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.320> its

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and then we set equal X equal to its

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.260 
and then we set equal X equal to its
current<00:01:58.740> position<00:01:58.829> which<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.759> transform

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
current position which is transform

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.880 
current position which is transform
position<00:02:00.390> 0<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.170> don't<00:02:01.350> understand<00:02:01.710> this

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
position 0 if you don't understand this

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.530 
position 0 if you don't understand this
expression<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.579> I've<00:02:02.790> added<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.119> training

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
expression here I've added a training

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.270 
expression here I've added a training
series<00:02:03.810> coming<00:02:04.200> up<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.710> next<00:02:04.860> couple<00:02:05.250> of

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.160 
series coming up in the next couple of
weeks<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:05.729> expressions<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.600> feel<00:02:06.960> free<00:02:07.020> to

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
weeks on expressions so feel free to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.109 
weeks on expressions so feel free to
check<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.649> VFX<00:02:08.250> row<00:02:08.489> calm<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.090> a

check that out on VFX row calm in a

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.210 
check that out on VFX row calm in a
couple<00:02:09.360> weeks<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:10.259> basically<00:02:10.530> almond<00:02:11.009> going

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
couple weeks but basically almond going

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.100 
couple weeks but basically almond going
to<00:02:11.280> here<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:11.879> have<00:02:12.090> this

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
to here is we have this

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.030 
to here is we have this
expression<00:02:13.530> here<00:02:13.890> which<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.450> 9.8<00:02:16.040> m/s^2

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
expression here which is 9.8 m/s^2

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.820 
expression here which is 9.8 m/s^2
that's<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.700> equation<00:02:17.940> here<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:19.380> see<00:02:19.620> in

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
that's the equation here that you see in

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.620 
that's the equation here that you see in
physics<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:20.970> expressions<00:02:21.540> and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
physics but in expressions and

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.500 
physics but in expressions and
after-effects<00:02:22.110> we<00:02:22.350> have<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.830> listed<00:02:23.820> as<00:02:24.180> this

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
after-effects we have it listed as this

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.290 
after-effects we have it listed as this
equation<00:02:25.230> right<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.460> that's<00:02:26.730> how<00:02:26.940> we<00:02:27.000> got

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
equation right here so that's how we got

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.740 
equation right here so that's how we got
the<00:02:27.660> falling<00:02:28.470> speed<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:29.130> zach<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:30.420> if<00:02:30.630> we

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
the falling speed of zach and so if we

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.300 
the falling speed of zach and so if we
scrub<00:02:31.050> through<00:02:31.080> here<00:02:31.470> we<00:02:31.590> can<00:02:31.680> see<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:31.890> he

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
scrub through here we can see that he

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.370 
scrub through here we can see that he
just<00:02:32.490> falls<00:02:32.730> down<00:02:32.850> it's<00:02:33.750> just<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.960> single<00:02:34.230> cop

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
just falls down it's just a single cop

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.770 
just falls down it's just a single cop
of<00:02:34.560> him<00:02:34.710> by<00:02:34.950> himself<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.580> if<00:02:35.700> we<00:02:35.820> look<00:02:36.030> closely

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
of him by himself and if we look closely

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.900 
of him by himself and if we look closely
into<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.620> pretty<00:02:37.830> common<00:02:38.370> see<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.760> it's

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
into that pretty common see that it's

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.110 
into that pretty common see that it's
this<00:02:39.030> footage<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.750> zach<00:02:40.050> falling<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.940> if<00:02:41.940> I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
this footage of zach falling and if I

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.540 
this footage of zach falling and if I
take<00:02:42.330> off<00:02:42.570> my<00:02:42.900> key<00:02:43.500> light<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.950> can<00:02:44.070> see<00:02:44.100> that

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
take off my key light you can see that

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.330 
take off my key light you can see that
we<00:02:45.180> have<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.780> matted<00:02:46.290> out<00:02:46.440> shot<00:02:46.890> underneath

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
we have this matted out shot underneath

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.120 
we have this matted out shot underneath
zach<00:02:47.870> if<00:02:48.870> i<00:02:48.959> take<00:02:49.140> off<00:02:49.260> my<00:02:49.290> mask<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.830> can<00:02:49.950> see

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
zach if i take off my mask you can see

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.229 
zach if i take off my mask you can see
what<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.340> look<00:02:50.459> like<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:50.820> we're<00:02:50.970> underneath

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
what it look like so we're underneath

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.750 
what it look like so we're underneath
him<00:02:51.600> heat<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.500> out<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.950> then<00:02:53.070> Zach<00:02:53.340> went

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
him heat it out and then Zach went

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.550 
him heat it out and then Zach went
through<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.150> later<00:02:54.270> in<00:02:54.510> rotoscoped<00:02:55.050> his<00:02:55.230> foot

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
through it later in rotoscoped his foot

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.590 
through it later in rotoscoped his foot
as<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.130> overlaps<00:02:56.520> in<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:56.910> area<00:02:57.209> right<00:02:57.330> here

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
as it overlaps in this area right here

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.380 
as it overlaps in this area right here
in<00:02:57.690> his<00:02:57.780> hand<00:02:58.050> as<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.380> goes<00:02:58.560> out<00:02:58.709> there<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.940> that

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
in his hand as it goes out there so that

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.320 
in his hand as it goes out there so that
is<00:03:00.930> how<00:03:01.110> we<00:03:01.620> did<00:03:02.520> that<00:03:02.670> portion<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.300> so

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
is how we did that portion of it so

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.210 
is how we did that portion of it so
we're<00:03:03.600> going<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.750> Prensky<00:03:04.320> light<00:03:04.470> back<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.830> as

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
we're going to Prensky light back on as

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.150 
we're going to Prensky light back on as
you<00:03:05.489> started<00:03:05.790> falling<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.709> once<00:03:07.709> he<00:03:07.800> gets<00:03:07.980> to

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
you started falling and once he gets to

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.680 
you started falling and once he gets to
this<00:03:08.340> position<00:03:08.790> right<00:03:08.910> here<00:03:09.150> we<00:03:09.270> can<00:03:09.420> see<00:03:09.570> that

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
this position right here we can see that

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.790 
this position right here we can see that
the<00:03:09.810> perspective<00:03:10.290> changes<00:03:10.709> so<00:03:10.980> kind<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.800> use

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
the perspective changes so kind of a use

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.979 
the perspective changes so kind of a use
of<00:03:13.980> music<00:03:14.250> movie<00:03:14.640> magic<00:03:14.940> here<00:03:15.120> we<00:03:15.270> used<00:03:15.540> some

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
of music movie magic here we used some

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.070 
of music movie magic here we used some
motion<00:03:16.350> blur<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:17.340> hide<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.299> change<00:03:18.660> but<00:03:18.959> if

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
motion blur to hide that change but if

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.810 
motion blur to hide that change but if
we<00:03:19.170> double<00:03:19.440> click<00:03:19.470> in<00:03:19.739> here<00:03:19.769> we<00:03:20.430> can<00:03:20.549> see<00:03:20.580> that

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
we double click in here we can see that

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.930 
we double click in here we can see that
we<00:03:20.940> have<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.299> same<00:03:21.510> shot<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:22.350> him<00:03:23.190> falling<00:03:23.519> and

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
we have the same shot of him falling and

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.080 
we have the same shot of him falling and
we<00:03:24.299> just<00:03:24.510> used<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.170> nice<00:03:26.100> transition<00:03:26.640> here<00:03:26.820> to

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
we just used a nice transition here to

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.000 
we just used a nice transition here to
morph<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.660> into<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:28.110> other<00:03:28.290> shot<00:03:28.530> here<00:03:28.830> and

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
morph it into this other shot here and

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.140 
morph it into this other shot here and
we<00:03:29.100> can<00:03:29.220> see<00:03:29.370> we<00:03:29.489> have<00:03:29.519> them<00:03:29.700> falling<00:03:29.970> from<00:03:30.090> a

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
we can see we have them falling from a

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.370 
we can see we have them falling from a
different<00:03:30.330> perspective<00:03:30.600> because<00:03:30.989> as<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.260> gets

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
different perspective because as it gets

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.380 
different perspective because as it gets
closer<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.680> ground<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.640> perspective<00:03:33.150> on

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
closer to the ground the perspective on

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.390 
closer to the ground the perspective on
his<00:03:33.570> body<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.840> going<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.019> change<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.310> you

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
his body is going to change and so you

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.360 
his body is going to change and so you
can<00:03:35.519> see<00:03:35.640> here<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.239> we<00:03:36.720> had<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:37.290> similar<00:03:38.010> shot

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
can see here that we had a similar shot

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.130 
can see here that we had a similar shot
setup<00:03:38.880> with<00:03:39.630> Zach<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:41.510> we<00:03:42.510> just<00:03:42.690> got<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.930> from

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
setup with Zach and we just got it from

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.860 
setup with Zach and we just got it from
a<00:03:43.170> little<00:03:43.410> bit<00:03:43.530> further<00:03:43.769> back<00:03:44.390> so<00:03:45.390> that's<00:03:45.750> how

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
a little bit further back so that's how

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.990 
a little bit further back so that's how
we<00:03:45.930> got<00:03:46.080> that<00:03:46.230> shot<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.860> now<00:03:47.519> let's<00:03:47.700> go<00:03:47.820> back

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
we got that shot and now let's go back

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.530 
we got that shot and now let's go back
into<00:03:48.209> our<00:03:48.630> main<00:03:48.810> comp<00:03:49.080> here<00:03:49.320> after<00:03:50.010> he<00:03:50.160> falls

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
into our main comp here after he falls

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.479 
into our main comp here after he falls
he<00:03:51.540> hits<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.930> car<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.380> at<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:53.100> point<00:03:53.280> we

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
he hits the car and at that point we

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.930 
he hits the car and at that point we
transitioned<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.209> yet<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.810> third<00:03:55.140> shot<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:56.070> him

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
transitioned to yet a third shot of him

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.940 
transitioned to yet a third shot of him
on<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.660> car<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.290> can<00:03:58.470> see<00:03:58.620> it's<00:03:58.709> not<00:03:58.799> here

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
on the car and you can see it's not here

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.800 
on the car and you can see it's not here
yet<00:03:59.100> we<00:03:59.310> haven't<00:03:59.489> turned<00:03:59.549> it<00:03:59.670> on<00:03:59.760> here<00:04:00.480> we<00:04:00.630> have

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
yet we haven't turned it on here we have

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.880 
yet we haven't turned it on here we have
him<00:04:00.989> on<00:04:01.110> top<00:04:01.350> of<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.530> car

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
him on top of the car

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.100 
him on top of the car
and<00:04:01.980> now<00:04:02.340> for<00:04:02.549> this<00:04:02.670> shot<00:04:02.910> what<00:04:03.120> we<00:04:03.209> did<00:04:03.360> was<00:04:03.540> we

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
and now for this shot what we did was we

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.310 
and now for this shot what we did was we
very<00:04:04.410> simply<00:04:04.920> motion<00:04:05.580> tracked<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:06.600> front<00:04:07.200> of

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
very simply motion tracked the front of

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.470 
very simply motion tracked the front of
the<00:04:07.380> car<00:04:07.590> using<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.100> planar<00:04:08.430> tracker<00:04:08.760> in<00:04:09.060> mocha

I<00:04:09.660> have<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.989> tutorial<00:04:10.170> going<00:04:10.709> click<00:04:10.890> here<00:04:11.190> for

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
I have a tutorial going click here for

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.970 
I have a tutorial going click here for
the<00:04:11.700> link<00:04:12.090> on<00:04:12.329> how<00:04:13.110> to<00:04:13.170> do<00:04:13.350> that<00:04:13.500> but<00:04:13.709> we<00:04:13.829> use

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
the link on how to do that but we use

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.159 
the link on how to do that but we use
very<00:04:14.250> simple<00:04:14.579> motion<00:04:15.209> tracking<00:04:15.540> see<00:04:15.900> here<00:04:16.079> we

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
very simple motion tracking see here we

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.500 
very simple motion tracking see here we
have<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.380> snow<00:04:16.560> object<00:04:17.070> that<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.510> wonderfully

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
have the snow object that is wonderfully

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.289 
have the snow object that is wonderfully
tracking<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.470> car<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.130> we<00:04:20.940> have<00:04:21.120> this

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
tracking the car and we have this

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.710 
tracking the car and we have this
footage<00:04:21.539> of<00:04:21.870> Zach<00:04:22.109> here<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:23.910> we<00:04:24.060> use<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.599> get

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
footage of Zach here that we use to get

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.600 
footage of Zach here that we use to get
that<00:04:24.930> we<00:04:25.169> turn<00:04:25.380> off<00:04:25.530> our<00:04:25.560> key<00:04:25.830> light

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
that we turn off our key light

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.480 
that we turn off our key light
take<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.090> look<00:04:27.300> here<00:04:27.539> we<00:04:28.009> can<00:04:29.009> see<00:04:29.159> that<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.370> was

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
take a look here we can see that I was

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.640 
take a look here we can see that I was
actually<00:04:29.580> there<00:04:29.789> blowing<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.330> fan<00:04:30.599> on<00:04:31.050> him<00:04:31.349> to

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
actually there blowing a fan on him to

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.219 
actually there blowing a fan on him to
make<00:04:32.129> it<00:04:32.550> look<00:04:33.330> as<00:04:33.449> though<00:04:33.479> there<00:04:33.780> was<00:04:33.930> wind

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
make it look as though there was wind

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.249 
make it look as though there was wind
pushing<00:04:34.860> him<00:04:34.979> along<00:04:35.189> and<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:36.210> we<00:04:36.419> just<00:04:36.629> tracked

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
pushing him along and so we just tracked

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.360 
pushing him along and so we just tracked
that<00:04:37.500> plate<00:04:37.800> in<00:04:38.750> very<00:04:39.750> nice<00:04:40.039> so<00:04:41.039> that<00:04:41.219> in<00:04:41.340> a

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
that plate in very nice so that in a

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.800 
that plate in very nice so that in a
couple<00:04:41.550> minutes<00:04:41.639> is<00:04:41.909> how<00:04:42.090> we<00:04:42.150> did<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:42.599> shot

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
couple minutes is how we did the shot

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.140 
couple minutes is how we did the shot
here<00:04:43.139> you<00:04:43.289> can<00:04:43.409> see<00:04:43.590> oh<00:04:43.620> here<00:04:44.069> in<00:04:44.759> see<00:04:44.939> here<00:04:45.090> if

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
here you can see oh here in see here if

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.619 
here you can see oh here in see here if
we<00:04:45.240> leave<00:04:45.449> that<00:04:45.629> chocolate<00:04:45.990> on<00:04:46.080> it<00:04:46.110> actually

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:47.629 
we leave that chocolate on it actually

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:51.110 
we leave that chocolate on it actually
we've<00:04:48.629> got<00:04:48.659> over<00:04:49.650> there<00:04:49.949> and<00:04:50.340> remember<00:04:50.849> this

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
we've got over there and remember this

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.700 
we've got over there and remember this
mask<00:04:51.389> back<00:04:51.930> on<00:04:51.979> and<00:04:53.719> there<00:04:54.719> is<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.349> shot<00:04:55.590> in

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
mask back on and there is the shot in

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.200 
mask back on and there is the shot in
its<00:04:55.830> entirety<00:04:56.099> so<00:04:56.520> that's<00:04:56.669> how<00:04:56.729> we<00:04:56.789> got<00:04:57.000> this

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
its entirety so that's how we got this

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.740 
its entirety so that's how we got this
the<00:04:57.659> jumpin<00:04:58.080> on<00:04:58.139> the<00:04:58.259> car<00:04:58.439> shot
