happening on this map so if you have an
idea<00:02:40.460> fire<00:02:40.670> map<00:02:40.910> then<00:02:41.240> just<00:02:41.660> take<00:02:41.900> some<00:02:42.140> time

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
idea fire map then just take some time

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.470 
idea fire map then just take some time
to<00:02:42.530> refine<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:43.040> idea<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.610> create<00:02:44.240> a<00:02:44.270> few

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
to refine that idea and create a few

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.870 
to refine that idea and create a few
images<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:45.080> show<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.500> sell<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.740> because<00:02:46.070> there

images to show and sell it because there

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.640 
images to show and sell it because there
is<00:02:46.970> an<00:02:47.090> insane<00:02:47.480> amount<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.930> topics<00:02:48.320> in<00:02:48.500> that

to<00:03:25.670> all<00:03:25.910> players<00:03:26.270> on<00:03:26.660> all<00:03:27.050> platforms<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:28.430> this

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
to all players on all platforms so this

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.759 
to all players on all platforms so this
sounds<00:03:29.120> like<00:03:29.420> non<00:03:29.660> premium<00:03:29.900> players<00:03:30.350> will<00:03:30.590> get

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
sounds like non premium players will get

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.650 
sounds like non premium players will get
it<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:31.100> which<00:03:31.340> in<00:03:31.580> my<00:03:31.760> opinion<00:03:31.880> is<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:32.450> right

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
it to which in my opinion is the right

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.540 
it to which in my opinion is the right
thing<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:33.200> do<00:03:33.350> because<00:03:33.560> when<00:03:34.250> i<00:03:34.280> bought

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
thing to do because when i bought

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.060 
thing to do because when i bought
premium<00:03:35.090> then<00:03:35.510> i<00:03:35.660> knew<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.050> i<00:03:36.350> will<00:03:36.620> get<00:03:36.860> a

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
premium then i knew that i will get a

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.580 
premium then i knew that i will get a
season<00:03:37.730> pass<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:38.209> thus<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.140> release<00:03:39.560> of

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
season pass and thus the release of

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.710 
season pass and thus the release of
final<00:03:39.860> stand<00:03:40.280> i<00:03:40.489> received<00:03:40.850> everything<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.600> i

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
final stand i received everything that i

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.350 
final stand i received everything that i
paid<00:03:41.989> for<00:03:42.290> so<00:03:43.040> if<00:03:43.310> this<00:03:43.519> map<00:03:43.730> would<00:03:43.880> be<00:03:44.000> premium

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
paid for so if this map would be premium

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.910 
paid for so if this map would be premium
exclusive<00:03:44.959> then<00:03:45.200> this<00:03:45.410> would<00:03:45.560> be<00:03:45.709> wrong

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
exclusive then this would be wrong

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.560 
exclusive then this would be wrong
because<00:03:46.250> at<00:03:46.700> this<00:03:46.910> point<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.300> want<00:03:47.450> to

after<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.280> other<00:05:05.310> then<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.090> get<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.270> very<00:05:06.510> strong

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
after the other then I get a very strong

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.600 
after the other then I get a very strong
feeling<00:05:07.200> that<00:05:07.230> we<00:05:07.620> will<00:05:07.710> also<00:05:08.040> receive<00:05:08.430> the

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
feeling that we will also receive the

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.880 
feeling that we will also receive the
content<00:05:09.120> one<00:05:09.330> after<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.810> other<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.230> even

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
content one after the other and even

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.810 
content one after the other and even
though<00:05:10.980> there's<00:05:11.190> no<00:05:11.340> official<00:05:11.520> confirmation

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
though there's no official confirmation

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.300 
though there's no official confirmation
for<00:05:12.450> this<00:05:12.570> yet<00:05:12.780> I've<00:05:13.140> been<00:05:13.500> told<00:05:13.680> that<00:05:13.950> my<00:05:14.130> gut

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
for this yet I've been told that my gut

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.120 
for this yet I've been told that my gut
feeling<00:05:14.670> about<00:05:14.760> this<00:05:15.150> is<00:05:15.390> pretty<00:05:15.720> good<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.320> to

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
feeling about this is pretty good and to

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.860 
feeling about this is pretty good and to
be<00:05:17.220> honest<00:05:17.520> I<00:05:17.700> highly<00:05:18.060> preferred<00:05:18.480> when<00:05:18.780> they

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
be honest I highly preferred when they

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.420 
be honest I highly preferred when they
get<00:05:19.020> additional<00:05:19.230> content<00:05:19.890> in<00:05:20.070> smaller<00:05:20.340> doses

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
get additional content in smaller doses

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.940 
get additional content in smaller doses
because<00:05:21.150> it<00:05:21.780> means<00:05:22.020> that<00:05:22.170> we<00:05:22.320> have<00:05:22.560> a<00:05:22.590> steady

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
because it means that we have a steady

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.890 
because it means that we have a steady
stream<00:05:23.280> of<00:05:23.400> content<00:05:23.940> over<00:05:24.420> a<00:05:24.450> longer<00:05:24.750> period

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
stream of content over a longer period

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.470 
stream of content over a longer period
of<00:05:25.380> time<00:05:25.440> rather<00:05:26.280> than<00:05:26.400> receiving<00:05:26.910> everything

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
of time rather than receiving everything

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.530 
of time rather than receiving everything
at<00:05:27.630> once<00:05:27.900> if<00:05:28.350> we<00:05:29.100> get<00:05:29.220> a<00:05:29.280> new<00:05:29.460> map<00:05:29.640> every<00:05:30.030> let's

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
at once if we get a new map every let's

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.360 
at once if we get a new map every let's
say<00:05:30.750> six<00:05:31.080> to<00:05:31.230> eight<00:05:31.380> weeks<00:05:31.410> then<00:05:32.100> there's

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
say six to eight weeks then there's

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.800 
say six to eight weeks then there's
always<00:05:32.700> something<00:05:33.150> that<00:05:33.390> we<00:05:33.540> can<00:05:33.690> look

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
always something that we can look

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.930 
always something that we can look
forward<00:05:34.080> to<00:05:34.410> there's<00:05:35.070> always<00:05:35.490> something<00:05:35.910> new

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
forward to there's always something new

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.080 
forward to there's always something new
on<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.330> horizon<00:05:36.420> if<00:05:37.080> there's<00:05:38.010> just<00:05:38.340> this<00:05:38.520> one

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
on the horizon if there's just this one

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.170 
on the horizon if there's just this one
last<00:05:39.360> DLC<00:05:40.050> then<00:05:40.710> we<00:05:41.160> have<00:05:41.340> to<00:05:41.400> wait<00:05:41.700> for<00:05:41.730> quite

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
last DLC then we have to wait for quite

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.060 
last DLC then we have to wait for quite
some<00:05:42.420> time<00:05:42.450> for<00:05:42.960> the<00:05:43.050> isolate<00:05:43.410> to<00:05:43.560> finish<00:05:43.890> and

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
some time for the isolate to finish and

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.700 
some time for the isolate to finish and
release<00:05:44.370> it<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:44.760> after<00:05:45.690> that<00:05:45.720> that's<00:05:46.500> nothing

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
release it and after that that's nothing

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.130 
release it and after that that's nothing
it<00:05:47.520> is<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:47.790> end<00:05:47.820> of<00:05:48.090> the<00:05:48.270> line<00:05:48.420> for<00:05:48.450> this<00:05:48.870> game

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
it is the end of the line for this game

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.800 
it is the end of the line for this game
so<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.430> situation<00:05:50.610> we<00:05:51.120> have<00:05:51.150> now<00:05:51.510> for

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
so the situation we have now for

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.630 
so the situation we have now for
Battlefield<00:05:52.320> 4<00:05:52.500> reminds<00:05:53.040> me<00:05:53.190> a<00:05:53.220> bit<00:05:53.280> of<00:05:53.430> the

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
Battlefield 4 reminds me a bit of the

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.910 
Battlefield 4 reminds me a bit of the
days<00:05:53.790> of<00:05:53.940> battlefield<00:05:54.420> to<00:05:54.630> whether<00:05:55.230> i<00:05:55.380> simply

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
days of battlefield to whether i simply

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.590 
days of battlefield to whether i simply
bundled<00:05:56.310> a<00:05:56.370> new<00:05:56.580> map<00:05:56.790> with<00:05:57.060> one<00:05:57.360> of<00:05:57.480> the

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
bundled a new map with one of the

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.720 
bundled a new map with one of the
patches<00:05:57.930> they<00:05:58.080> released<00:05:58.380> this<00:05:59.130> way<00:05:59.340> we<00:05:59.520> got

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
patches they released this way we got

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.630 
patches they released this way we got
road<00:05:59.970> to<00:06:00.150> Jalalabad<00:06:00.450> Wake<00:06:01.170> Island<00:06:01.640> 2007

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640

operation blue pearl and highway temper

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.000 
operation blue pearl and highway temper
so<00:06:06.240> I<00:06:06.390> believe<00:06:06.780> that<00:06:06.960> this<00:06:07.080> form<00:06:07.380> of<00:06:07.530> content

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
so I believe that this form of content

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.740 
so I believe that this form of content
creation<00:06:08.310> and<00:06:08.610> distribution<00:06:08.700> will<00:06:09.600> be

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
creation and distribution will be

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.870 
creation and distribution will be
beneficial<00:06:10.170> to<00:06:10.380> the<00:06:10.770> franchise<00:06:11.250> the<00:06:11.490> studio

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
beneficial to the franchise the studio

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.940 
beneficial to the franchise the studio
and<00:06:12.090> the<00:06:12.510> community<00:06:13.050> as<00:06:13.290> it<00:06:13.620> keeps<00:06:13.770> your

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
and the community as it keeps your

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.590 
and the community as it keeps your
interest<00:06:14.130> up<00:06:14.520> over<00:06:14.790> a<00:06:14.820> longer<00:06:15.000> period<00:06:15.090> of<00:06:15.540> time

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
interest up over a longer period of time

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.870 
interest up over a longer period of time
and<00:06:16.050> you<00:06:16.620> feel<00:06:16.800> much<00:06:16.980> more<00:06:17.250> involved<00:06:17.490> in<00:06:17.760> the

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
and you feel much more involved in the

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.210 
and you feel much more involved in the
process<00:06:18.300> of<00:06:18.360> creating<00:06:18.750> this<00:06:18.990> content<00:06:19.260> which

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
process of creating this content which

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.070 
process of creating this content which
also<00:06:20.520> increases<00:06:20.910> the<00:06:21.180> chances<00:06:21.720> that<00:06:21.780> the

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
also increases the chances that the

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.800 
also increases the chances that the
content<00:06:22.530> is<00:06:22.620> actually<00:06:23.280> good<00:06:23.550> it<00:06:24.360> also<00:06:24.570> looks

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
content is actually good it also looks

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.720 
content is actually good it also looks
like<00:06:24.960> this<00:06:25.290> community<00:06:25.860> map<00:06:26.010> is<00:06:26.220> not<00:06:26.250> the<00:06:26.430> last

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730 
like this community map is not the last

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.460 
like this community map is not the last
bit<00:06:27.000> of<00:06:27.030> additional<00:06:27.270> content<00:06:27.990> that<00:06:28.200> we<00:06:28.320> will

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
bit of additional content that we will

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.000 
bit of additional content that we will
get<00:06:28.680> I<00:06:28.890> think<00:06:29.730> or<00:06:29.970> hope<00:06:30.480> that<00:06:31.200> isolate<00:06:31.860> will
