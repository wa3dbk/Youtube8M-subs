this will come out on top of those all

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.089 
this will come out on top of those all
we<00:00:28.769> see<00:00:29.640> here<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.060> size<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.960> still<00:00:31.140> very<00:00:31.320> very

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
we see here the size is still very very

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.930 
we see here the size is still very very
small<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.540> 3<00:00:34.020> inch<00:00:34.200> screen<00:00:34.980> what<00:00:35.820> is

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
small with this 3 inch screen what is

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.610 
small with this 3 inch screen what is
your<00:00:36.059> resolution<00:00:36.149> there<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> solution<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
your resolution there a solution of the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.069 
your resolution there a solution of the
screen<00:00:37.860> i<00:00:37.890> think<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.280> 5<00:00:38.730> pixel<00:00:39.149> x<00:00:39.270> 320<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:42.300> it's

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
screen i think is 5 pixel x 320 and it's

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.049 
screen i think is 5 pixel x 320 and it's
run<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> reality<00:00:44.129> display<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.730> Mobile

resistant mineral glass screen and what

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.080 
resistant mineral glass screen and what
else<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.079> see<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.090> development

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
else you can see here is the development

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.479 
else you can see here is the development
of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> corner<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.840> concept<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.340> you

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
of the corner you I concept so as you

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.209 
of the corner you I concept so as you
recognize<00:00:56.820> from<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.360> previous<00:00:58.140> x10<00:00:58.680> mini<00:00:58.710> and

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
recognize from the previous x10 mini and

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.970 
recognize from the previous x10 mini and
mini<00:00:59.489> pro<00:01:00.140> they<00:01:01.140> had<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.440> corner<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.829> I

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
mini pro they had the corner you I

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.369 
mini pro they had the corner you I
concept<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.629> further<00:01:03.870> developed

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
concept but here it's further developed

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.140 
concept but here it's further developed
so<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> four

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
so that you can have up to four

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.990 
so that you can have up to four
applications<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.990> each<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> corners<00:01:08.000> and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
applications in each of the corners and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.390 
applications in each of the corners and
it's<00:01:09.479> super<00:01:09.960> easy<00:01:10.020> customize<00:01:10.830> them<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.159> just

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it's super easy customize them I just

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.820 
it's super easy customize them I just
take<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:12.360> application<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.619> just

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
take one application like this and just

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.219 
take one application like this and just
drag<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> corner<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.540> then<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.080> it

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
drag it to the corner and then I have it

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.760 
drag it to the corner and then I have it
there<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.549> boy<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.270> very<00:01:18.450> personal<00:01:18.810> page

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
as you see I can also have widgets here

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.710 
as you see I can also have widgets here
in<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.740> middle<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.250> screen<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.729> our

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
in the middle of the screen and our

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.330 
in the middle of the screen and our
vacations<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> middle<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.829> screen<00:01:29.009> so

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
vacations in the middle of the screen so

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.850 
vacations in the middle of the screen so
so<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.000> makes<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.270> look<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.680> one<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
so it makes it look like one of the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.499 
so it makes it look like one of the
bigger<00:01:32.040> smartphones<00:01:32.610> even<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.329> just

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
bigger smartphones even and I can just

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.810 
bigger smartphones even and I can just
take<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:33.960> widget<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.829> drag<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
drag it to the top like this if I don't

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950 
drag it to the top like this if I don't
want<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.430> if<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.210> don't<00:01:39.420> want<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.810> the
