00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:02.029
 Welcome to the show "Dating Game!" 

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:05.008
 Show host, love candy 

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.082
 Hello, welcome to this episode "Dating Game" 

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:10.034
 In this program we can play Cupid or make myself look like a fool (Cupid, stupid, rhyme) 

00:00:10.034 --> 00:00:12.080
 Let’s start, let’s get to know the single guests in this episode. 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.039
 Her description of herself is lively and sweet. 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.005
 Let us welcome passion fruit! 

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:19.022
 Let me talk about the men you have encountered in your life, passion fruit. 

00:00:19.022 --> 00:00:22.035
 The men I have met in my life are very sweet (sweet, can also be understood as very sweet fruits) 

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:24.023
 But sometimes it’s really annoying 

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.072
 So, if you let your real life come true 

00:00:26.072 --> 00:00:29.000
 Will you be brave to make choices? (pick them, you can pick up or choose, probably have the meaning of 捡 捡 )) 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.006
 Well, they just talk about something like this, so it’s annoying 

00:00:33.022 --> 00:00:35.031
 Ok, let's see if we can help you succeed in the media, passion fruit. 

00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:37.091
 First welcome the No. 1 man! 

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.091
 I am talking to girls!! Long live!! 

00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:44.023
呃...嗨, 1st man 

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:45.048
 No. 2 man! 

00:00:46.052 --> 00:00:47.081
 Good morning, passion fruit 

00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:51.013
 I hope that I can understand you better. 

00:00:51.013 --> 00:00:54.040
 Hey, I like your tone, No. 2 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.077
 Finally, the number 3 men 

00:00:56.077 --> 00:00:59.018
 Hey! Hey! Passion fruit! Hey! Passion fruit! 

00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:00.026
 Hey, passion fruit, hey! 

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.077
 Slow...this sound seems to have been heard 

00:01:02.077 --> 00:01:04.090
 Oh, I think you must have made a mistake, passion fruit. 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.071
 Let's start the first question? 

00:01:06.071 --> 00:01:08.015
 Hey, choose me to choose me! 

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:09.063
 No. 3, please, choose me! 

00:01:09.063 --> 00:01:10.075
 No. 1 man 

00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:12.056
 Please 

00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:15.053
 Suppose we go out for a date for the first time. What do you think we should do? 

00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:18.004
 Hey, you are so beautiful. 

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:21.024
 Oh no, I can't do it. Beauty really makes me okay, no. 

00:01:21.024 --> 00:01:24.038
 His voice is like a motorboat in a milkshake. 

00:01:24.038 --> 00:01:25.088
 Did he just say that the motorboat? 

00:01:25.088 --> 00:01:27.004
 Oh, sorry to bother 

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:30.021
 But I believe that the man No. 1 he wants to say is 

00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:32.075
 If the first date can be so beautiful for you 

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:34.057
 It will inevitably be the only "first date" in this life. 

00:01:34.057 --> 00:01:36.001
 Wow by jumping a billion watts (jumping gigawatt is a song, but he should be just incoherent) 

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:37.050
 It’s really beautiful. 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.093
 Hey.. I.. um.. said this seems.. a bit too fast 

00:01:40.093 --> 00:01:43.095
 However, passion fruit, my principle is never to look back 

00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:45.044
 So I can only move forward, right? 

00:01:45.044 --> 00:01:46.092
 Stupid apple 

00:01:46.092 --> 00:01:49.094
 You are all used by red onions to make French toast. 

00:01:49.094 --> 00:01:52.019
 Oh, I seem to feel something again. 

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:55.028
 You have to forgive the incoherence of No. 3 

00:01:55.028 --> 00:01:58.082
 After all, we are all intoxicated by your appearance. 

00:01:58.082 --> 00:02:00.032
 Oh, it’s by God. 

00:02:00.032 --> 00:02:03.004
 It seems that the number 1 can be ignored. 

00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:06.007
 Apple, he is really a big tongue. 

00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:08.004
 Remind men here 

00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:10.061
 Please do not directly reveal each other's identity 

00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:12.033
 I am not a man, I am Liu Ding. 

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:14.083
 Wow, this... scared me. 

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:17.043
 Look, I said that there may be a situation, haha 

00:02:17.043 --> 00:02:19.094
 Can I talk to the super charming French guy? 

00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:21.015
 Super fry (french fry)? 

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:23.075
 Be careful, it may burn to your tongue 

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:25.073
 This is very likely 

00:02:25.073 --> 00:02:28.086
 Question! Hey, ask the question! Come on, ask the question! 

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:30.067
 Oh, I don't think it's necessary. 

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:32.061
 Please, no one asked me questions. 

00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:35.036
 Ok, the third man 

00:02:35.036 --> 00:02:38.040
 Yeah! I won, admit defeat, red onion! 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.024
 I am not an onion, you clown 

00:02:40.024 --> 00:02:41.053
 If we go to date (date)... 

00:02:41.053 --> 00:02:42.088
 But I don't have a calendar yeah (he solved the date as "date") 

00:02:42.088 --> 00:02:44.033
 It’s a date, you idiot! 

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:46.037
 Is when two fruits really like each other 

00:02:46.037 --> 00:02:48.079
 Oh, sorry, but this kind of thing won’t happen. 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.071
 what? 

00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:51.085
 Well, I have found the object I really like. 

00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:53.084
 She is so smart and beautiful and purple 

00:02:53.084 --> 00:02:54.072
 Whenever she sees her 

00:02:54.072 --> 00:02:56.077
 I feel that the deer in the heart is unable to extricate themselves. 

00:02:56.077 --> 00:02:57.074
 I believe you know what my heart is. 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:00.086
 I think I understand, the third man 

00:03:00.086 --> 00:03:02.067
 What really matters is what you want in your heart. 

00:03:02.067 --> 00:03:05.027
 Very good, it seems that I can't master the whole situation now. 

00:03:05.027 --> 00:03:07.045
 And let's lower the wall and see if Passion Fruit can make the right choice. 

00:03:07.045 --> 00:03:10.042
 Is it possible for her to choose the waste behind me? 

00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:12.061
 Obviously I am the best fruit 

00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:14.093
 Wow, I have to go back to play Skyrim (Skyrim, game, Chinese translation "The Elder Scrolls - Skyline") 

00:03:20.057 --> 00:03:22.074
 Oh my god, Liu Ding, are you okay? 

00:03:22.074 --> 00:03:24.053
 Well, poor guy 

00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:26.083
 I think he is really fascinated by you (crush on, fascinated, but crush means crushed, pun) 

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:30.000
 Please don't do this 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.016
 Very good, now we are busy contacting the lawyer 

00:03:32.016 --> 00:03:34.099
 Young people, hurry up and enjoy the date. 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.040
 Come on, Passion fruit also has your seat喔

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.056
 Get him away! Get him away! 

00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:42.074
 Let's go, date! 

00:03:44.074 --> 00:03:47.011
