00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
crabmeat we are going to squeeze some

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.160 
crabmeat we are going to squeeze some
limes<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:55.259> quick<00:01:55.409> tip<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:57.170> place

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
limes and a really quick tip is to place

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.480 
limes and a really quick tip is to place
it<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.560> ground<00:01:58.710> which<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.189> know<00:01:59.250> sounds

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
it on the ground which I know sounds

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.310 
it on the ground which I know sounds
probably<00:01:59.759> gross<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.659> place<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
probably gross but place it on the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.380 
probably gross but place it on the
ground<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.399> roll<00:02:02.939> your<00:02:02.969> foot<00:02:03.329> over

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
ground and you just roll your foot over

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.590 
ground and you just roll your foot over
it<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.579> it<00:02:05.579> should<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.790> easier<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> squeeze

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
it and it should be easier to squeeze

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.900 
it and it should be easier to squeeze
when<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.960> cut<00:02:07.140> them<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.369> now<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.610> we've<00:02:08.729> gone

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
when you cut them so now that we've gone

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.080 
when you cut them so now that we've gone
ahead<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.239> squeezed<00:02:09.989> out<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.709> limes<00:02:11.090> we're

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
ahead and squeezed out the limes we're

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.370 
ahead and squeezed out the limes we're
going<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.420> add

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
going to add

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.670
