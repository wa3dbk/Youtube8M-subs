00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:16.340
 are ethnic and graffiti writers designs from 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.369
 about 22 years old this year in Tuscany 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.489
 original but not so important in 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.699
 how much I had to do from the beginning 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:27.470
 travel and sketch remains the first 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.599
 phase because anyway all the ideas that 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.259
 this also traveling looking out of the 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.419
 window 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.130
 I remember all these things on paper 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.930
 so what leads to development 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.790
 of the other then when I work on canvas 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.920
 Port forward certain ideas which then carry 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.290
 on a wall certain ideas I develop 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.060
 while the sign on the wall brings them back 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.310
 then on canvas so everything is connected not 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.280
 is that they are two different worlds 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.010
 I always worked the spray can 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.649
 working on 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.109
 on the elaboration of the name as like 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.180
 are the basics of graffiti and this 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.969
 however even if today I introduce myself in 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.329
 apparently different is the basis 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.769
 on which I work ie the name is still the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.020
 dissemination of my name 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.899
 as much as possible in every city in each 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:16.470
 event remains a feature for me 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:17.909
 the wall of funds is important 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.580
 large-scale representation of a 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.240
 sketch that I have both on paper I have 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.500
 also reported in a series of canvases and 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.590
 in the serigraphs that you will see in the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.380
 then shows the theme of bonsai which 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.430
 however this tree wraps around 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.200
 urban agglomerations will be present 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.350
 various techniques both on the wall in 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.000
 great his sketch that would be it 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.420
 development on screen printing and drawings 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.360
 like this is a wall I had a little bit in 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.640
 already for a while, even if then 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.560
 development aimed with color but I wanted 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.550
 a vision a little darker than 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.690
 that league object 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.170
 if you see there is also a character 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.000
 however hidden however there is and this is a 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.430
 new topic I'm facing 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.229
 this year also linked to others 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.229
 expositions next words
