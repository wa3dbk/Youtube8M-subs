we<00:00:30.910> need<00:00:31.060> steam<00:00:31.449> and<00:00:32.730> create<00:00:33.730> a<00:00:34.000> new<00:00:34.150> account

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
we need steam and create a new account

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.450 
we need steam and create a new account
don't<00:00:35.110> use<00:00:35.289> the<00:00:35.469> one<00:00:35.590> with<00:00:35.800> your<00:00:35.950> camp<00:00:36.219> so<00:00:36.430> you

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
don't use the one with your camp so you

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.209 
don't use the one with your camp so you
don't<00:00:36.700> get<00:00:36.820> bad<00:00:37.090> or<00:00:37.360> something

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
don't get bad or something

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.750 
don't get bad or something
so<00:00:39.219> don't<00:00:39.640> seem<00:00:40.090> logging<00:00:40.899> as<00:00:41.590> I<00:00:41.829> did<00:00:42.070> I<00:00:42.309> already

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
so don't seem logging as I did I already

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.100 
so don't seem logging as I did I already
did<00:00:42.940> that<00:00:43.059> or<00:00:43.510> I<00:00:43.539> will<00:00:43.750> do<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:43.989> again<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:47.020> the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
did that or I will do it again so the

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.760 
did that or I will do it again so the
first<00:00:47.350> step<00:00:47.559> is<00:00:48.329> logging<00:00:49.329> into<00:00:49.480> steam

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
first step is logging into steam

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.279 
first step is logging into steam
and<00:00:51.129> now<00:00:51.430> it's<00:00:51.670> updating<00:00:52.239> so<00:00:52.840> we'll<00:00:53.050> leave<00:00:53.170> an

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
and now it's updating so we'll leave an

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.430 
and now it's updating so we'll leave an
update<00:00:53.620> and<00:00:53.920> we<00:00:54.519> go<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:54.940> next<00:00:55.570> step<00:00:55.930> until

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
update and we go to the next step until

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.270 
update and we go to the next step until
it's<00:00:56.739> finished

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
it's finished

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.930 
it's finished
so<00:00:58.120> we<00:00:58.269> download<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.870> crack<00:00:59.399> we<00:01:00.399> copy<00:01:00.730> the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
so we download the crack we copy the

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.820 
so we download the crack we copy the
contents<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:04.690> go<00:01:04.960> to<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.260> folder<00:01:05.440> of<00:01:05.680> the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
contents and we go to the folder of the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.740 
contents and we go to the folder of the
game<00:01:05.880> where<00:01:06.880> we<00:01:07.090> have<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.479> salt<00:01:07.869> pro<00:01:08.680> version<00:01:08.950> 15

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
game where we have a salt pro version 15

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.980 
game where we have a salt pro version 15
in<00:01:10.750> my<00:01:10.900> case<00:01:11.140> it's<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:12.400> right<00:01:12.610> here<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.780> you

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
in my case it's it's right here and you

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.380 
in my case it's it's right here and you
just<00:01:17.320> passed<00:01:18.100> everything<00:01:19.090> there<00:01:20.100> replace<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
just passed everything there replace and

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.830 
just passed everything there replace and
the<00:01:22.930> first<00:01:23.200> step<00:01:23.439> now<00:01:23.650> is<00:01:23.680> over<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:25.450> second

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
the first step now is over the second

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.760 
the first step now is over the second
step<00:01:26.020> we<00:01:26.229> need<00:01:26.409> is<00:01:27.189> logging<00:01:28.000> into<00:01:28.150> steam<00:01:28.509> so<00:01:29.470> I

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
step we need is logging into steam so I

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.730 
step we need is logging into steam so I
will<00:01:30.579> pause<00:01:30.820> until<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.960> finished<00:01:32.439> and

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
will pause until the finished and

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.149 
will pause until the finished and
complete<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.310> shorter<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.780> we<00:01:38.020> are<00:01:38.200> back<00:01:38.590> and

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
complete the shorter so we are back and

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.429 
complete the shorter so we are back and
now<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:40.060> steam<00:01:40.329> is<00:01:40.450> ready<00:01:40.720> so<00:01:40.990> I<00:01:41.020> will<00:01:41.229> login

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
now the steam is ready so I will login

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.609 
now the steam is ready so I will login
this<00:01:41.799> is<00:01:41.890> my<00:01:42.040> login<00:01:42.750> credentials<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:44.320> just

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
this is my login credentials you just

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.410 
this is my login credentials you just
log<00:01:44.979> in<00:01:45.159> with<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.369> Google<00:01:45.399> account<00:01:45.640> it's

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
log in with a Google account it's

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.140 
log in with a Google account it's
recommended<00:01:46.960> that<00:01:47.320> you<00:01:47.469> create<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:48.460> here

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
recommended that you create and here

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.560 
recommended that you create and here
login<00:01:49.420> with<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.650> you<00:01:50.800> don't<00:01:50.980> get<00:01:51.070> bad<00:01:51.310> with

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
login with it so you don't get bad with

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.060 
login with it so you don't get bad with
an<00:01:52.570> account<00:01:53.170> they<00:01:53.320> go<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:53.740> already<00:01:53.920> have<00:01:56.070> so

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
an account they go you already have so

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.290 
an account they go you already have so
once<00:01:57.400> you're<00:01:57.640> locked<00:01:57.910> in<00:01:58.510> steam<00:01:59.580> comes<00:02:00.580> the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
once you're locked in steam comes the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:10.580 
once you're locked in steam comes the
part<00:02:01.600> of<00:02:02.410> opening<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.130> game<00:02:03.480> so<00:02:04.480> just<00:02:05.020> open<00:02:05.290> I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.400 

guess<00:02:11.590> it's<00:02:11.950> already<00:02:12.190> open<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:13.510> it's<00:02:13.660> straight

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
guess it's already open so it's straight

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.040 
guess it's already open so it's straight
down<00:02:14.440> first

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.530 

so<00:02:22.650> as<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.890> can<00:02:22.980> see<00:02:23.040> here<00:02:23.460> access<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.270> steam

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
so as you can see here access the steam

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.980 
so as you can see here access the steam
community<00:02:24.720> already<00:02:25.790> appears<00:02:26.790> on<00:02:27.030> probably<00:02:27.450> 15

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
community already appears on probably 15

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.500 
community already appears on probably 15
this<00:02:28.290> means<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.800> steam<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.460> connected<00:02:30.360> to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
this means that steam is connected to

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.360 
this means that steam is connected to
the<00:02:30.630> game<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.620> how<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.860> play<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.250> game

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
the game and this is how I play the game

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.240 
the game and this is how I play the game
for<00:02:32.820> free<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.300> let's<00:02:33.750> see<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:34.620> check<00:02:34.950> if<00:02:35.100> it's

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
for free so let's see and check if it's

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:43.890 
for free so let's see and check if it's
working

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.589 

so<00:02:44.620> now<00:02:44.890> it's<00:02:45.099> establishing<00:02:45.760> communications

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
so now it's establishing communications

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.360 
so now it's establishing communications
it's<00:02:47.110> preferred<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.010> allow<00:02:48.310> the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
it's preferred that you allow the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:03:01.760 
it's preferred that you allow the
firewall<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.299> connect<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.930> game

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.720 

so<00:03:02.430> brace<00:03:03.090> on<00:03:03.300> Kane<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:04.250> by<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.310> way<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.610> would

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
so brace on Kane and by the way it would

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.520 
so brace on Kane and by the way it would
ask<00:03:05.940> you

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
ask you
