00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600

thinking about making the second two
offices<00:01:01.109> or<00:01:02.070> something<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.640> don't<00:01:02.910> know<00:01:04.610> this

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610

one<00:01:05.880> was<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> little<00:01:06.210> tricky<00:01:06.630> because<00:01:07.580> one<00:01:08.580> of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
one was a little tricky because one of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.660 
one was a little tricky because one of
the<00:01:08.729> Boosters<00:01:09.180> well<00:01:10.049> tried<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.890> make<00:01:11.220> booster

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the Boosters well tried to make booster

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.760 
the Boosters well tried to make booster
it's<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:12.930> working<00:01:13.729> but<00:01:14.729> um<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:16.320> wall

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
it's not really working but um the wall

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.240 
it's not really working but um the wall
was<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> way<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:19.770> I'm<00:01:19.830> probably<00:01:20.009> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
was like in the way so I'm probably to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.950 
was like in the way so I'm probably to
make<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> little<00:01:21.090> different<00:01:21.600> also<00:01:21.659> maybe

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
make this a little different also maybe

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960 
make this a little different also maybe
like<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> library<00:01:22.710> resources<00:01:23.520> center<00:01:23.880> at

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
like a library resources center at

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.070 
like a library resources center at
something<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:26.090> again<00:01:27.090> move<00:01:27.509> offices

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
something like that again move offices

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.630 
something like that again move offices
down<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:28.320> i'm<00:01:28.710> probably<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.189> expand

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
down here i'm probably going to expand

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.109 
down here i'm probably going to expand
this<00:01:30.000> somehow<00:01:30.780> connect<00:01:31.259> upstairs<00:01:31.920> I'm<00:01:32.850> not

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
this somehow connect upstairs I'm not

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.399 
this somehow connect upstairs I'm not
sure<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:35.340> come<00:01:35.939> down<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.299> track<00:01:36.570> here<00:01:36.869> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
sure so come down the track here and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.410 
sure so come down the track here and
pull<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.710> way<00:01:39.350> again<00:01:40.350> booster<00:01:41.280> oh<00:01:41.610> by<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
pull this way again booster oh by the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.410 
pull this way again booster oh by the
way<00:01:42.540> if<00:01:42.720> anyone<00:01:42.990> has<00:01:43.110> any<00:01:43.729> boots<00:01:44.729> editorials

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
way if anyone has any boots editorials

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.510 
way if anyone has any boots editorials
or<00:01:45.540> something<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.250> 71<00:01:47.250> I've<00:01:47.399> already
