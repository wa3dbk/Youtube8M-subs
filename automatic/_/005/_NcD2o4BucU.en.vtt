is because I haven't had it yet but the
one<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.130> makes<00:01:17.340> everything<00:01:17.640> slowed<00:01:18.180> down

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
one that makes everything slowed down

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.630 
one that makes everything slowed down
and<00:01:18.630> go<00:01:18.720> crazy<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.290> like<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.470> wave<00:01:19.710> gun<00:01:20.009> you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
and go crazy it's like a wave gun you

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.320 
really want that weapon if you're going
to<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> strategy<00:01:23.220> because<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.670> really<00:01:24.000> is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
to do the strategy because it really is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.929

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
just trying I'm just gonna be doing it

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.930 
just trying I'm just gonna be doing it
to<00:02:37.590> try<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.770> get<00:02:38.010> up<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.310> high<00:02:38.490> i<00:02:38.520> haven't

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
to try to get up that high i haven't

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.310 
to try to get up that high i haven't
decided<00:02:39.210> if<00:02:39.270> I'm<00:02:39.390> gonna<00:02:39.510> try<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.780> run<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.990> train

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
decided if I'm gonna try to run a train

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.200 
decided if I'm gonna try to run a train
somewhere<00:02:40.560> or<00:02:40.980> if<00:02:41.250> I'm<00:02:41.430> going<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.670> try<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:41.940> do

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
somewhere or if I'm going to try to do

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.460 
somewhere or if I'm going to try to do
the<00:02:44.540> strategy<00:02:45.540> like<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.960> one<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.320> only

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
the strategy like this one the only

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.930 
the strategy like this one the only
problem<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:46.860> have<00:02:47.040> against<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:47.460> is<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.790> can

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
problem I have against this is I can

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.840 
problem I have against this is I can
only<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.240> one<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.690> each<00:02:48.810> thing<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:50.430> area

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
only have one of each thing in this area

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.120 
only have one of each thing in this area
so<00:02:51.090> it'd<00:02:51.390> be<00:02:51.420> very<00:02:51.570> hard<00:02:52.050> for<00:02:52.350> me<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.710> do<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.860> solo

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
so it'd be very hard for me to do a solo

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.190 
so it'd be very hard for me to do a solo
strategy<00:02:53.550> camping<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.720> spot<00:02:54.990> like<00:02:55.020> this

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
strategy camping in a spot like this

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.840 
strategy camping in a spot like this
where<00:02:55.620> they<00:02:55.740> can<00:02:55.950> come<00:02:56.250> straight<00:02:56.460> ahead<00:02:56.640> of

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
where they can come straight ahead of

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.180 
where they can come straight ahead of
you<00:02:56.910> unless<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.900> had<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.260> wave<00:02:58.440> gun<00:02:58.740> in<00:02:58.980> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
you unless I had that wave gun in the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.970 
you unless I had that wave gun in the
Raygun<00:02:59.550> Mach<00:02:59.820> 2<00:03:00.060> plus<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.540> third<00:03:01.440> weapon<00:03:01.710> that

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
Raygun Mach 2 plus a third weapon that

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.760 
Raygun Mach 2 plus a third weapon that
would<00:03:02.100> be<00:03:02.220> powerful<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.300> I<00:03:03.510> highly<00:03:04.380> doubt<00:03:04.620> i'll

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
would be powerful so I highly doubt i'll

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.290 
would be powerful so I highly doubt i'll
do<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.040> strategy<00:03:05.490> i'll<00:03:05.610> probably<00:03:05.880> do<00:03:06.060> some

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
do the strategy i'll probably do some

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.760 
do the strategy i'll probably do some
sort<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.630> running<00:03:06.840> gun<00:03:07.110> i<00:03:07.140> haven't<00:03:07.500> decided

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
sort of running gun i haven't decided

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.190 
sort of running gun i haven't decided
where<00:03:08.040> yet<00:03:08.310> i<00:03:08.550> have<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.090> couple<00:03:09.420> locations<00:03:09.750> that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
where yet i have a couple locations that

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.810 
where yet i have a couple locations that
i'm<00:03:10.290> kind<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.650> holding<00:03:10.980> off<00:03:11.130> talking<00:03:11.460> about

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
i'm kind of holding off talking about

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.340 
i'm kind of holding off talking about
for<00:03:12.060> now<00:03:12.210> because<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.660> want<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.900> try<00:03:13.080> them<00:03:13.260> out

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
for now because I want to try them out

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.100 
for now because I want to try them out
first<00:03:13.620> but<00:03:14.030> overall<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.210> think<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.780> I'll<00:03:15.900> be

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
first but overall I think that I'll be

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.350 
first but overall I think that I'll be
able<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.500> at<00:03:16.830> least<00:03:17.070> get<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.370> 20<00:03:17.760> tomorrow<00:03:17.940> on

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
able to at least get to 20 tomorrow on

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.610 
able to at least get to 20 tomorrow on
my<00:03:18.930> second<00:03:19.680> solo<00:03:20.490> attempt<00:03:20.850> but<00:03:21.720> overall<00:03:22.470> the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
my second solo attempt but overall the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.350 
my second solo attempt but overall the

him<00:04:41.300> out<00:04:41.390> to<00:04:41.450> be<00:04:41.570> so<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:43.490> I<00:04:43.820> think<00:04:43.850> even<00:04:44.420> our

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
him out to be so and I think even our

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.210 
him out to be so and I think even our
strategy<00:04:45.110> like<00:04:45.230> this<00:04:45.500> I<00:04:45.650> really<00:04:45.860> wouldn't

want<00:04:46.370> him<00:04:46.550> in<00:04:46.760> here<00:04:47.330> with<00:04:47.510> me<00:04:47.660> because<00:04:47.840> I<00:04:47.870> would

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
want him in here with me because I would

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.410 
want him in here with me because I would
block<00:04:48.320> me<00:04:48.590> up<00:04:48.680> my<00:04:48.950> view<00:04:49.520> of<00:04:49.550> being<00:04:50.000> able<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.270> see
