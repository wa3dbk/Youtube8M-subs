Heisenberg if the spelling mistake was

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.310 
Heisenberg if the spelling mistake was
wasn't<00:00:48.270> enough<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.719> attack<00:00:48.960> him<00:00:49.079> he'd<00:00:49.200> also

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
wasn't enough to attack him he'd also

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.970 
wasn't enough to attack him he'd also
left<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.680> cannon<00:00:50.039> out<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.230> cannon<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.649> right

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
on the edge of the CC radius which means

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.010 
on the edge of the CC radius which means
it's<00:00:55.260> perfect<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.829> luring<00:00:56.070> his<00:00:56.309> CC<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.020> to

good idea to leave their ex post down

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.880 
good idea to leave their ex post down
tell<00:01:12.720> them<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.020> not<00:01:13.080> make<00:01:13.470> sure<00:01:13.650> they<00:01:13.770> don't

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
tell them it's not make sure they don't

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.080 
tell them it's not make sure they don't
do<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.250> because<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.909> lot<00:01:15.000> of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
do that because you just get a lot of

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.899 
do that because you just get a lot of
loot<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> Penta<00:01:17.490> lava<00:01:17.700> lien

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
loot so this is a Penta lava lien

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.520 
loot so this is a Penta lava lien
strategy<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:18.630> I've<00:01:18.840> been<00:01:19.049> looking<00:01:19.320> forward

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:39.740 
in the last video the pups are the
reason<00:03:38.939> you<00:03:38.970> don't<00:03:39.209> need<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.389> take<00:03:39.540> any

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
reason you don't need to take any

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.780 
reason you don't need to take any
minions<00:03:40.109> because<00:03:40.919> they<00:03:41.069> do<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.370> clearing<00:03:41.609> up

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
minions because they do the clearing up

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.580 
minions because they do the clearing up
it's<00:03:42.120> really<00:03:42.419> efficient<00:03:42.870> whoever<00:03:43.199> came<00:03:43.409> up

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
it's really efficient whoever came up

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.259 
it's really efficient whoever came up
with<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:44.099> Penta<00:03:44.370> lavaloon<00:03:44.699> strategy<00:03:45.209> so

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
with the Penta lavaloon strategy so

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.780 
with the Penta lavaloon strategy so
clever<00:03:45.540> person<00:03:45.720> because<00:03:46.709> basically<00:03:46.949> the<00:03:47.549> five

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
clever person because basically the five

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.550 
clever person because basically the five
hounds<00:03:48.359> will<00:03:48.509> shield<00:03:48.810> your<00:03:48.989> balloons<00:03:49.290> for

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
hounds will shield your balloons for

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.770 
hounds will shield your balloons for
long<00:03:49.709> enough<00:03:49.949> and<00:03:50.359> then<00:03:51.359> they're<00:03:51.479> meant<00:03:51.719> to

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
long enough and then they're meant to

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.009 
long enough and then they're meant to
die<00:03:52.310> in<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.489> one<00:03:53.669> it<00:03:54.180> almost<00:03:54.599> went<00:03:54.750> too<00:03:54.989> well

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
die in this one it almost went too well

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.899 
die in this one it almost went too well
actually<00:03:55.319> I<00:03:55.530> ended<00:03:55.769> up<00:03:55.859> with<00:03:56.009> that<00:03:56.159> one<00:03:56.430> you

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
actually I ended up with that one you

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.300 
actually I ended up with that one you
know<00:03:56.969> one<00:03:57.479> hand<00:03:57.719> just<00:03:57.930> down<00:03:58.109> there<00:03:58.259> if<00:03:58.709> he<00:03:59.009> died

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
know one hand just down there if he died

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.499 
know one hand just down there if he died
I'd<00:03:59.579> have<00:03:59.609> got<00:03:59.819> through<00:03:59.969> the<00:04:00.060> base<00:04:00.209> quicker

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:00.509 
I'd have got through the base quicker

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.679 
I'd have got through the base quicker
actually<00:04:02.060> but<00:04:03.060> we've<00:04:03.180> still<00:04:03.359> got<00:04:03.509> I<00:04:03.540> mean

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
actually but we've still got I mean

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:04.849 
actually but we've still got I mean
there's<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> ton<00:04:04.049> of<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.199> army<00:04:04.379> left<00:04:04.530> but<00:04:04.739> so

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
there's a ton of the army left but so

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.529 
there's a ton of the army left but so
the<00:04:04.949> five<00:04:05.129> hounds<00:04:05.489> are<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.939> tanks<00:04:06.180> which

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:06.539 
the five hounds are the tanks which

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:08.240 
the five hounds are the tanks which
which<00:04:06.959> protect<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.469> balloons<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:07.919> can<00:04:07.949> see

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
which protect the balloons you can see

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.309 
which protect the balloons you can see
