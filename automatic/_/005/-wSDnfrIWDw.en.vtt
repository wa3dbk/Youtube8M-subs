even<00:03:19.720> more<00:03:19.750> twisted<00:03:20.110> person<00:03:20.770> pick<00:03:21.280> them<00:03:21.430> up

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
even more twisted person pick them up

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.330 
even more twisted person pick them up
terrorize<00:03:22.600> them<00:03:22.959> go<00:03:23.140> up<00:03:23.260> skyscrapers<00:03:24.070> put

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
terrorize them go up skyscrapers put

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.400 
terrorize them go up skyscrapers put
them<00:03:24.520> down<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.120> then<00:03:25.540> basically<00:03:25.750> they<00:03:26.140> think

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
them down and then basically they think

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.650 
them down and then basically they think
they're<00:03:26.530> safe<00:03:26.770> grab<00:03:27.430> them<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:27.730> go<00:03:27.820> for

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
they're safe grab them and go for

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.780 
they're safe grab them and go for
another<00:03:28.720> ride<00:03:29.050> so<00:03:29.860> you<00:03:30.130> can<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.459> can<00:03:30.610> play

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
another ride so you can you can play

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.250 
another ride so you can you can play
basically<00:03:31.239> play<00:03:31.480> at<00:03:31.600> many<00:03:31.810> different<00:03:31.870> ways

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
basically play at many different ways

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.350 
basically play at many different ways
but<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.709> can<00:03:32.830> also<00:03:32.980> by<00:03:33.670> putting<00:03:34.030> things<00:03:34.270> down

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
but you can also by putting things down

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.360 
but you can also by putting things down
you<00:03:34.930> can<00:03:35.050> actually<00:03:35.170> put<00:03:35.470> cars<00:03:35.770> down<00:03:36.130> and

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
you can actually put cars down and

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.400 
you can actually put cars down and
objects<00:03:36.820> down<00:03:37.060> so<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:37.630> can<00:03:37.780> begin<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.050> stack

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
objects down so you can begin to stack

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.290 
objects down so you can begin to stack
things<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.130> really<00:03:39.340> cool<00:03:39.670> interesting

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
things and to really cool interesting

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.600 
things and to really cool interesting
stackable<00:03:41.260> columns<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.220> just<00:03:42.340> mess<00:03:42.580> around

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
stackable columns and just mess around

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.080 
stackable columns and just mess around
like<00:03:43.120> it's<00:03:43.269> a<00:03:43.360> real<00:03:43.510> sandbox<00:03:44.019> sounds<00:03:44.800> great<00:03:45.090> so

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
like it's a real sandbox sounds great so

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.630 
like it's a real sandbox sounds great so
talk<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:46.810> me<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.019> little<00:03:47.080> bit<00:03:47.320> about<00:03:47.640> traversal

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
talk to me a little bit about traversal

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.370 
talk to me a little bit about traversal
like<00:03:48.880> with<00:03:49.180> prototype<00:03:49.660> one<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:50.050> had<00:03:50.170> such<00:03:50.350> a

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
like with prototype one you had such a

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.440 
like with prototype one you had such a
large<00:03:50.680> world<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.250> big<00:03:51.400> aspect<00:03:51.970> of<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:52.269> was

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
large world and a big aspect of that was

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.940 
large world and a big aspect of that was
getting<00:03:52.720> around<00:03:52.989> are<00:03:53.440> there<00:03:53.590> any<00:03:53.650> sort<00:03:53.890> of

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
getting around are there any sort of

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.710 
getting around are there any sort of
additions<00:03:54.610> or<00:03:54.700> changes<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:55.300> how<00:03:55.420> you'd<00:03:55.600> be

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
additions or changes to how you'd be

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.540 
additions or changes to how you'd be
getting<00:03:55.870> around<00:03:56.170> in<00:03:56.260> prototype<00:03:56.500> 2<00:03:56.769> yeah<00:03:57.190> I'm

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
getting around in prototype 2 yeah I'm

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.310 
getting around in prototype 2 yeah I'm
you<00:03:57.730> know<00:03:57.850> prototype<00:03:58.660> was<00:03:58.840> going<00:03:58.989> to<00:03:59.050> famous

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
you know prototype was going to famous

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.350 
you know prototype was going to famous
for<00:03:59.650> its<00:03:59.860> over-the-top<00:04:00.130> parkour<00:04:00.970> you<00:04:01.239> know

obviously<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.130> could<00:04:09.280> glide<00:04:09.550> in<00:04:09.850> the<00:04:09.940> first

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
obviously you could glide in the first

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.030 
obviously you could glide in the first
one<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.660> one<00:04:11.080> of<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.260> one<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.620> pieces<00:04:11.860> of

was they wanted to have more of an

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.610 
was they wanted to have more of an
enhanced<00:04:15.580> way<00:04:15.819> to<00:04:16.359> glide<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:17.049> everyone<00:04:17.410> loves

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
enhanced way to glide and everyone loves

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.590 
enhanced way to glide and everyone loves
Superman<00:04:17.890> and<00:04:18.250> so<00:04:18.910> you<00:04:18.970> can<00:04:19.150> actually<00:04:19.329> now

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
Superman and so you can actually now

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.789 
Superman and so you can actually now
really<00:04:19.900> put<00:04:20.019> a<00:04:20.049> lot<00:04:20.109> of<00:04:20.200> points<00:04:20.680> and

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
really put a lot of points and

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.530 
really put a lot of points and
experience<00:04:21.220> points<00:04:21.400> into<00:04:22.030> that<00:04:22.180> gliding

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
experience points into that gliding

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.810 
experience points into that gliding
power<00:04:22.870> so<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.140> can<00:04:23.230> do<00:04:23.410> much<00:04:23.530> longer<00:04:24.130> glides

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
power so you can do much longer glides

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.090 
power so you can do much longer glides
across<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.630> world<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:26.080> so<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.530> can<00:04:26.680> do<00:04:26.800> start

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
across the world and so you can do start

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.440 
across the world and so you can do start
to<00:04:27.160> do<00:04:27.310> things<00:04:27.340> like<00:04:27.760> in<00:04:27.940> our<00:04:28.030> hunting

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
to do things like in our hunting

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.210 
to do things like in our hunting
mechanic<00:04:28.900> where<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.140> can<00:04:29.260> hunt<00:04:29.500> down<00:04:29.650> targets

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
mechanic where you can hunt down targets

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.580 
mechanic where you can hunt down targets
you<00:04:30.730> can<00:04:30.880> kind<00:04:31.030> of<00:04:31.150> circle<00:04:31.810> like<00:04:32.230> it<00:04:32.380> like<00:04:32.470> an

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
you can kind of circle like it like an

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.920 
you can kind of circle like it like an
eagle<00:04:33.010> above<00:04:33.370> like<00:04:33.910> a<00:04:33.940> Black<00:04:34.210> Watch<00:04:34.419> agent

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
eagle above like a Black Watch agent

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.990 
eagle above like a Black Watch agent
send<00:04:35.530> out<00:04:35.710> your<00:04:35.740> hunting<00:04:36.340> pulse<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:36.820> see

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
send out your hunting pulse and see

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.220 
send out your hunting pulse and see
where<00:04:37.180> they<00:04:37.270> are<00:04:37.300> in<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:37.690> crowd<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.110> then

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
where they are in the crowd and then

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.250 
where they are in the crowd and then
dive<00:04:38.590> down<00:04:39.010> and<00:04:39.280> basically<00:04:39.880> take<00:04:40.180> them<00:04:40.360> out<00:04:40.510> so

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
dive down and basically take them out so

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.960 
dive down and basically take them out so
it's<00:04:41.440> it's<00:04:41.800> pretty<00:04:41.980> cool<00:04:42.190> so<00:04:42.760> you've

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
it's it's pretty cool so you've

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.180 
it's it's pretty cool so you've
mentioned<00:04:43.150> experience<00:04:43.810> points<00:04:44.020> now<00:04:44.410> well

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
mentioned experience points now well

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.710 
mentioned experience points now well
what<00:04:45.520> kind<00:04:45.730> of<00:04:45.790> changes<00:04:46.090> can<00:04:46.240> we<00:04:46.330> look<00:04:46.450> forward

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
what kind of changes can we look forward

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.300 
what kind of changes can we look forward
to<00:04:46.900> in<00:04:47.020> terms<00:04:47.169> of<00:04:47.350> leveling<00:04:47.830> up<00:04:47.950> or<00:04:48.130> like

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
to in terms of leveling up or like

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.490 
to in terms of leveling up or like
almost<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.730> RPG<00:04:49.300> element<00:04:49.780> of<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:49.960> game<00:04:50.140> right

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
that visual pay off as well as you know

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.090 
that visual pay off as well as you know
obviously<00:05:22.090> want<00:05:23.080> to<00:05:23.110> make<00:05:23.260> sure<00:05:23.290> that<00:05:23.530> when

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100

we're giving you these powers we're

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.150 
we're giving you these powers we're
properly<00:05:25.780> matching<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:26.500> powers<00:05:26.950> to<00:05:27.130> the

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
properly matching the powers to the

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.640 
properly matching the powers to the
enemies<00:05:27.610> and<00:05:27.880> so<00:05:28.060> there's<00:05:28.330> also<00:05:28.510> a<00:05:28.690> sense<00:05:29.410> of

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
enemies and so there's also a sense of

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.890 
enemies and so there's also a sense of
the<00:05:29.770> right<00:05:29.979> power<00:05:30.640> for<00:05:31.060> the<00:05:31.120> right<00:05:31.300> job<00:05:31.330> the

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
the right power for the right job the

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.900 
the right power for the right job the
right<00:05:32.050> tool<00:05:32.410> for<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:32.680> right<00:05:32.740> job<00:05:32.890> as<00:05:33.700> an

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
right tool for the right job as an

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.969 
right tool for the right job as an
improvement<00:05:34.270> on<00:05:34.450> prototype<00:05:34.960> one<00:05:35.229> where<00:05:35.500> one

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
improvement on prototype one where one

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.010 
improvement on prototype one where one
power<00:05:36.280> could<00:05:36.520> almost<00:05:36.669> do<00:05:36.940> everything<00:05:37.360> as<00:05:37.870> we

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
power could almost do everything as we

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.870 
power could almost do everything as we
want<00:05:38.200> trying<00:05:38.410> to<00:05:38.470> bring<00:05:38.590> more<00:05:39.070> of<00:05:39.190> a<00:05:39.280> orbit
