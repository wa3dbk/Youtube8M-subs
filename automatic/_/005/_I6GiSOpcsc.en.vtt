weighted<00:01:20.009> foam<00:01:20.759> bobber<00:01:21.240> now<00:01:22.049> you'll<00:01:22.229> notice

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
weighted foam bobber now you'll notice

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.440 
weighted foam bobber now you'll notice
my<00:01:22.740> bobber<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> typical<00:01:23.729> bobber

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
my bobber is not the typical bobber

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.020 
my bobber is not the typical bobber
the<00:01:25.200> barbers<00:01:25.649> bright<00:01:25.950> orange<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.490> top<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:26.999> I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the barbers bright orange on top so I

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.330 
the barbers bright orange on top so I
can<00:01:27.359> see<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.749> but<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.109> the<00:01:28.140> bottom<00:01:28.499> because

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
can see it but on the bottom because

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.270 
can see it but on the bottom because
fish<00:01:29.759> are<00:01:29.969> looking<00:01:30.329> up<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.539> feed<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.439> paint<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
fish are looking up to feed I paint the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.190 
fish are looking up to feed I paint the
bottom<00:01:32.729> where<00:01:33.149> it's<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.359> same<00:01:33.600> color<00:01:33.929> as<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
bottom where it's the same color as the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.739 
bottom where it's the same color as the
water<00:01:34.649> so<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> fish<00:01:35.909> don't<00:01:35.939> realize<00:01:36.719> that

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:36.749 
water so the fish don't realize that

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:39.770 
water so the fish don't realize that
bobber<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.439> above<00:01:37.829> them<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.969> only<00:01:39.179> clip<00:01:39.630> it

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
bobber is above them and I only clip it

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.830 
bobber is above them and I only clip it
on<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:40.109> bottom<00:01:40.530> side<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.219> when<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.179> hang<00:01:42.569> up

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
on the bottom side and when you hang up

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.679 
on the bottom side and when you hang up
the<00:01:43.049> most<00:01:43.380> important<00:01:44.069> thing<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:45.359> take
