00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
but I think the main focus of this

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.690 
but I think the main focus of this
review<00:01:28.190> is<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.970> deck<00:01:29.180> itself<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:30.700> you

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
review is the the deck itself and you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.400 
review is the the deck itself and you
buy<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:31.940> deck<00:01:32.240> from<00:01:32.390> loaded<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:32.930> then<00:01:33.170> you

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
buy the deck from loaded and then you

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.580 
buy the deck from loaded and then you
can<00:01:33.740> outfit<00:01:34.310> it<00:01:34.460> however<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.119> like<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:36.380> deck

has<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:36.770> rockered<00:01:37.250> profile<00:01:37.729> which<00:01:38.210> means<00:01:38.479> that

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
has a rockered profile which means that

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.230 
has a rockered profile which means that
it<00:01:38.750> swoops<00:01:39.080> up<00:01:39.260> on<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.619> edges<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.160> what<00:01:41.060> that

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
it swoops up on the edges and what that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.240 
it swoops up on the edges and what that
does<00:01:41.509> is<00:01:41.750> allow<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.470> lock<00:01:42.680> your<00:01:42.860> feet<00:01:43.070> in

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
also has what's called the W concave and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.610

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
here and what that does is it improves

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.070 
here and what that does is it improves
your<00:02:49.640> center<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.030> gravity<00:02:50.510> as<00:02:50.660> well<00:02:50.960> as

just for show loaded actually added that

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.480 
just for show loaded actually added that
to<00:04:07.400> filter<00:04:08.240> out<00:04:08.450> Road<00:04:08.660> vibration<00:04:09.320> and<00:04:09.560> what

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
to filter out Road vibration and what

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.560 
to filter out Road vibration and what
the<00:04:10.610> material<00:04:11.000> is<00:04:11.210> is<00:04:12.070> UHMWPE<00:04:13.090> also<00:04:14.090> known<00:04:14.300> as

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
the material is is UHMWPE also known as

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.200 
the material is is UHMWPE also known as
ultra<00:04:15.110> high<00:04:15.290> molecular<00:04:15.320> weight<00:04:15.980> polyethylene

ultra high molecular weight polyethylene

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.630 
ultra high molecular weight polyethylene
and<00:04:17.210> what<00:04:18.140> that<00:04:18.290> material<00:04:18.710> does<00:04:18.890> is<00:04:19.220> just<00:04:19.520> as

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
and what that material does is just as

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.520 
and what that material does is just as
loaded<00:04:19.910> says<00:04:20.120> filters<00:04:20.960> out<00:04:21.140> road<00:04:21.380> vibration

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
loaded says filters out road vibration

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.830 
loaded says filters out road vibration
and<00:04:22.100> that's<00:04:22.790> very<00:04:23.000> helpful<00:04:23.210> for<00:04:23.510> when<00:04:23.630> you're

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
and that's very helpful for when you're

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.530 
and that's very helpful for when you're
go

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
go

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.510 
go
downhill<00:04:24.870> at<00:04:24.990> 40<00:04:25.260> miles<00:04:25.410> an<00:04:25.560> hour<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.980> it's

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
downhill at 40 miles an hour and it's

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.790 
downhill at 40 miles an hour and it's
nice<00:04:26.730> to<00:04:26.760> have<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:26.970> smoother<00:04:27.300> read

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
nice to have a smoother read

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.939 
nice to have a smoother read
so<00:04:29.400> I'm<00:04:29.490> gonna<00:04:29.580> kind<00:04:29.729> of<00:04:29.849> run<00:04:30.030> through<00:04:30.389> the

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
so I'm gonna kind of run through the

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.930 
so I'm gonna kind of run through the
materials<00:04:31.949> that<00:04:32.099> the<00:04:32.250> deck<00:04:32.400> is<00:04:32.430> made<00:04:32.699> out<00:04:32.910> of

materials that the deck is made out of

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.089 
materials that the deck is made out of
starting<00:04:33.930> from<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.169> top<00:04:34.349> you<00:04:34.620> have<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.949> grip

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
starting from the top you have the grip

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.010 
starting from the top you have the grip
tape<00:04:35.280> of<00:04:35.460> course<00:04:35.669> then<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.419> goes<00:04:36.599> down<00:04:36.780> to<00:04:36.990> a

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
tape of course then that goes down to a

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.529 
tape of course then that goes down to a
layer<00:04:37.229> of<00:04:37.440> epoxy<00:04:37.940> then<00:04:38.940> to<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.150> layer<00:04:39.360> of

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
layer of epoxy then to a layer of

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.749 
layer of epoxy then to a layer of
