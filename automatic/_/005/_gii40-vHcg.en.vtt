 instead of 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.679
 the special thing about this exhibition is that we met the Swedes 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.069
 we often have a continent 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.069
 that means this exhibition showed the shoes 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.099
 distributed throughout the world and percent through the ages 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.140
 we want to tell him history and radio-layered RZB 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.610
 Nature guides have meaning what the bearers of messages convey 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.610
 they know if they do not know 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.220
 Shoes are 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.070
 to protect the feet 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.530
 soon thereafter the further meaning got the served 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.930
 Dr the presentation the warning signs of status and power 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.480
 This state associated with the belief that they usually have a positive meaning 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.850
 and yes, of course, a strong public significance Altenstadt with 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.850
 Erotic forbidden 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.790
 It was claimed that only women have a shoe-stick 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.890
 Percent we have quite a few 4 of prominent women for example this one 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.270
 here 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.610
 Marlene Dietrich 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.730
 but the exhibition will certainly be interesting for men 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.210
 Offer 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.750
 We also have a lot of men per meter of men, for example, this one 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.870
 bored by Boris Becker's work on wimbledon's victory sometimes 86 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.700
 this is a shoe from a Unger calculating artist and they did that alone 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.929
 special about this shot 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.899
 he almost looks at the collar but you can not forgive them fifth fifth 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.800
 the really poor as pure art objects you can already see it 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.260
 This then moved back to work can not wear them but they are anyway 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
 Founder beautiful for me 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.519
 We have many highlights that we can show the visitors 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.689
 One of them is this bronze sculpture if you only saw the boy like that 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.230
 you do not have to be anymore but if you look at his feet you will see 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.139
 Shourd with wings and those clearly characterize him as the Greek god 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.609
 Hermes mediated to the between gods and humans and thus 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.760

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.340
 Can you even put on shoes? There is a catwalk Ã¶aw 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.789
 becomes 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:48.459
 To have replicas of schools across the ages, those from the visitor 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.449
 can try it on the catwalk and we have had a push around 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:57.419
 the music story is very full of songs in the shoe play a role 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:02.239
 Elvis Presley the Blue Suede Shoes Nancy Sinatra sounds like a scooter with a fury 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.479

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:06.149
 to see
