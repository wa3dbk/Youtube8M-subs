00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
for the three by three door as you can

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.040 
for the three by three door as you can
see<00:00:13.260> no<00:00:14.260> more<00:00:14.440> button<00:00:14.830> i<00:00:15.539> have<00:00:16.539> figured<00:00:16.810> out

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
see no more button i have figured out

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.970 
see no more button i have figured out
how<00:00:17.470> to<00:00:17.529> make<00:00:17.829> it<00:00:17.890> work<00:00:18.009> with<00:00:18.579> just<00:00:18.759> the<00:00:18.939> lever

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
how to make it work with just the lever

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.489 
how to make it work with just the lever
so<00:00:20.980> we'll<00:00:21.159> see<00:00:21.369> opens<00:00:23.339> both<00:00:24.339> locks<00:00:24.369> drop<00:00:25.060> i<00:00:25.499> put

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:26.499 
so we'll see opens both locks drop i put

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.290 
so we'll see opens both locks drop i put
an<00:00:26.619> lever<00:00:27.069> on<00:00:27.249> the<00:00:27.279> other<00:00:27.489> side<00:00:27.730> which<00:00:28.089> the

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
an lever on the other side which the

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.819 
an lever on the other side which the
same<00:00:28.899> too<00:00:32.100> I<00:00:33.930> tried<00:00:34.930> some<00:00:35.140> of<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.379> suggestions

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
same too I tried some of the suggestions

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.840 
same too I tried some of the suggestions
from<00:00:36.579> the<00:00:36.670> comments<00:00:37.329> about<00:00:37.690> a<00:00:37.750> clock<00:00:38.140> I<00:00:38.850> could

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
from the comments about a clock I could

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.060 
from the comments about a clock I could
not<00:00:40.000> get<00:00:40.149> that<00:00:40.300> to<00:00:40.449> work<00:00:40.480> with<00:00:40.750> a<00:00:40.780> clock<00:00:41.079> so

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
not get that to work with a clock so

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.750 
not get that to work with a clock so
this<00:00:42.489> is<00:00:42.519> what<00:00:42.850> is<00:00:43.420> currently<00:00:43.929> working<00:00:46.620> I

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
this is what is currently working I

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.220 
this is what is currently working I
don't<00:00:48.760> know<00:00:48.850> if<00:00:48.969> this<00:00:49.120> you<00:00:49.570> consider<00:00:50.019> this<00:00:50.170> a

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
don't know if this you consider this a

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.669 
don't know if this you consider this a
clock<00:00:50.559> but<00:00:50.890> whatever<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:54.039> I<00:00:54.370> got<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.699> torch<00:00:55.030> here

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
clock but whatever so I got a torch here

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.899 
clock but whatever so I got a torch here
which<00:00:56.679> powers<00:00:57.280> all<00:00:57.519> this<00:00:57.910> to<00:00:58.719> keep<00:00:59.909> basically

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
which powers all this to keep basically

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.970 
which powers all this to keep basically
keep<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.269> torch<00:01:01.539> off<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:02.820> under<00:01:03.820> here<00:01:04.330> is

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
keep the torch off and under here is

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:13.110 
keep the torch off and under here is
another<00:01:05.980> torch<00:01:07.680> which<00:01:10.500> well<00:01:11.730> when<00:01:12.730> this<00:01:12.880> turns

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
another torch which well when this turns

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.850 
another torch which well when this turns
off<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:15.130> will<00:01:15.400> turn<00:01:15.550> on

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.270 

and<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:20.020> will<00:01:20.440> keep<00:01:20.590> that<00:01:20.890> off<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.770> then

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
and that will keep that off and then

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.030 
and that will keep that off and then
when<00:01:24.400> it<00:01:24.520> all<00:01:24.910> powers<00:01:25.330> back<00:01:25.540> on<00:01:25.620> it<00:01:26.620> gives<00:01:26.950> that

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
when it all powers back on it gives that

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.280 
when it all powers back on it gives that
just<00:01:27.430> enough<00:01:27.730> time<00:01:27.940> to<00:01:28.000> flip<00:01:28.540> back<00:01:28.750> up<00:01:29.020> and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
just enough time to flip back up and

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.060 
just enough time to flip back up and
come<00:01:29.920> back<00:01:29.950> down<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.970> had<00:01:34.900> this<00:01:35.080> set<00:01:35.920> up

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
come back down so I had this set up

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.500 
come back down so I had this set up
better<00:01:37.380> more<00:01:38.380> compact<00:01:38.890> but<00:01:39.510> something

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
better more compact but something

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.890 
better more compact but something
happened<00:01:40.810> like<00:01:41.320> some<00:01:41.590> kind<00:01:41.830> of<00:01:41.890> bug<00:01:42.430> in<00:01:42.640> the

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
happened like some kind of bug in the

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.560 
happened like some kind of bug in the
game<00:01:44.910> maybe<00:01:45.910> have<00:01:46.120> to<00:01:46.270> move<00:01:46.450> everything

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
game maybe have to move everything

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.740 
game maybe have to move everything
around<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.130> set<00:01:48.610> this<00:01:48.760> up<00:01:48.940> however<00:01:49.690> you

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
around so you set this up however you

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.700 
around so you set this up however you
like<00:01:49.840> but<00:01:51.300> you<00:01:52.300> need<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.479> torch<00:01:52.750> that<00:01:53.080> powers

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
like but you need a torch that powers

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.080 
like but you need a torch that powers
this<00:01:54.690> section<00:01:56.310> some<00:01:57.310> redstone<00:01:57.490> running

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
this section some redstone running

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.650 
this section some redstone running
around<00:01:58.470> a<00:01:59.470> repeater<00:02:00.310> willpower<00:02:01.000> this<00:02:01.300> block

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
around a repeater willpower this block

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.249 
around a repeater willpower this block
here<00:02:02.140> which<00:02:02.590> has<00:02:02.830> a<00:02:02.890> torch<00:02:03.310> on<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:05.020> side

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
here which has a torch on it on the side

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.960 
here which has a torch on it on the side
which<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:06.660> right<00:02:07.660> under<00:02:07.899> that<00:02:07.930> torch<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.970> you

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
which is right under that torch and you

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.130 
which is right under that torch and you
can<00:02:10.119> put<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.360> no<00:02:11.200> no<00:02:11.920> delay<00:02:12.840> same<00:02:13.840> with<00:02:13.989> this

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
can put that no no delay same with this

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.920 
can put that no no delay same with this
one<00:02:14.340> now<00:02:15.340> this<00:02:15.370> one<00:02:15.550> here<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.120> need<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:18.930> 23

this one you three tek delay and a block
right<00:02:26.410> here<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:27.190> power<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.730> piston<00:02:28.440> and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
right here to power this piston and

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.270 
right here to power this piston and
that's<00:02:31.450> about<00:02:31.570> it<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:35.110> guys<00:02:35.260> need<00:02:35.500> more<00:02:36.250> of

depth<00:02:40.110> actually<00:02:41.110> placing<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.620> redstone<00:02:42.010> let

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
depth actually placing the redstone let

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.340 
depth actually placing the redstone let
me<00:02:42.459> know<00:02:45.420> but<00:02:46.420> i<00:02:46.450> guess<00:02:46.690> that's<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.540> i<00:02:49.810> hope
