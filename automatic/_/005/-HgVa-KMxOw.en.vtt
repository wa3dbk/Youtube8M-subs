to do a quote of Boulevard contractile

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.729 
to do a quote of Boulevard contractile
injection<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.719> will<00:00:57.870> be<00:00:57.989> ultra<00:00:58.320> sounding

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
injection and I will be ultra sounding

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.400 
injection and I will be ultra sounding
the<00:00:59.070> aqua<00:00:59.399> look<00:00:59.550> at<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> iris<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.750> oh<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the aqua look at the iris and the oh the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.130 
the aqua look at the iris and the oh the
lens<00:01:02.149> very<00:01:03.149> happy<00:01:03.480> camper<00:01:03.629> very<00:01:04.019> good<00:01:04.140> patient

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:18.050 

do<00:01:10.140> an<00:01:10.920> ultrasound<00:01:11.100> exam<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.940> his<00:01:12.090> below<00:01:17.060> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
do an ultrasound exam of his below the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.350 
do an ultrasound exam of his below the
eyeball

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.990 

so<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.470> far<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.800> is<00:01:22.980> a<00:01:23.010> normal<00:01:23.280> ultrasound

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
so so far this is a normal ultrasound

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.850 
so so far this is a normal ultrasound
exam<00:01:24.620> and<00:01:25.620> see<00:01:25.830> his<00:01:25.920> retina<00:01:26.370> and<00:01:26.430> his<00:01:26.690> lens

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.750 

I<00:01:29.950> would

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.910 

ultrasound<00:01:34.690> exam<00:01:34.960> of<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.140> eye<00:01:35.170> is<00:01:35.290> done<00:01:35.620> in<00:01:35.800> a

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
ultrasound exam of the eye is done in a

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
ultrasound exam of the eye is done in a
short<00:01:36.160> axis<00:01:36.340> in<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.730> long<00:01:36.880> axis<00:01:37.060> and<00:01:38.160> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
short axis in the long axis and the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.120 
short axis in the long axis and the
eyeball<00:01:40.570> looks<00:01:40.810> very<00:01:41.020> normal<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.500> retina<00:01:41.890> the

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
eyeball looks very normal the retina the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.290 
eyeball looks very normal the retina the
lens<00:01:43.260> of<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:44.680> anterior<00:01:44.980> chamber<00:01:45.300> posterior

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
lens of the anterior chamber posterior

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.570 
lens of the anterior chamber posterior
chamber<00:01:46.510> so<00:01:47.170> this<00:01:47.320> is<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.500> normal<00:01:47.830> ultrasound

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
chamber so this is a normal ultrasound

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.270 
chamber so this is a normal ultrasound
exam<00:01:48.910> of<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.180> eye<00:01:49.260> so<00:01:50.260> this<00:01:50.680> will<00:01:50.860> help<00:01:50.950> us<00:01:51.130> in

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
exam of the eye so this will help us in

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.660 
exam of the eye so this will help us in
our<00:01:51.370> therapy<00:01:52.030> I<00:01:52.270> had<00:01:52.870> a<00:01:53.130> spot<00:01:54.130> that<00:01:54.160> I<00:01:54.370> would<00:01:54.550> do

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
our therapy I had a spot that I would do

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.300 
our therapy I had a spot that I would do
a<00:01:54.700> bulb<00:01:54.970> or<00:01:55.060> contact<00:01:55.510> evil<00:01:55.870> conduct<00:01:56.830> eyeball

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
a bulb or contact evil conduct eyeball

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.550 
a bulb or contact evil conduct eyeball
injection<00:01:57.820> with<00:01:58.000> corticosteroids<00:01:58.840> but<00:01:59.530> I

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
injection with corticosteroids but I

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.780 
injection with corticosteroids but I
don't<00:01:59.740> feel<00:01:59.830> he<00:01:59.980> needs<00:02:00.070> that<00:02:00.310> right<00:02:00.490> now<00:02:00.640> we'll

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
don't feel he needs that right now we'll

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.580 
don't feel he needs that right now we'll
just<00:02:00.820> carry<00:02:01.090> on<00:02:01.210> with<00:02:01.450> his<00:02:01.600> aunt<00:02:01.840> meant<00:02:02.110> his

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
just carry on with his aunt meant his

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.790 
just carry on with his aunt meant his
triple<00:02:02.980> antibiotic<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:04.800> corticosteroid

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
triple antibiotic and corticosteroid

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.920 
triple antibiotic and corticosteroid
appointment<00:02:06.430> um<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:07.060> he's<00:02:07.360> doing<00:02:07.660> quite<00:02:07.810> well

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
appointment um and he's doing quite well

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.419 
appointment um and he's doing quite well
under<00:02:08.380> that<00:02:08.530> regime<00:02:08.679> along<00:02:09.130> with<00:02:09.280> some

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
under that regime along with some

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.700 
under that regime along with some
Banamine<00:02:09.760> twice<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.030> day<00:02:10.300> so<00:02:11.110> this<00:02:11.530> just

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
Banamine twice a day so this just

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.770 
Banamine twice a day so this just
augments<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.280> fact<00:02:12.550> that<00:02:12.640> we<00:02:13.240> don't<00:02:13.390> have<00:02:13.660> to

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
augments the fact that we don't have to

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.570 
augments the fact that we don't have to
go<00:02:13.810> further<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.290> our<00:02:14.380> therapy<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.460> he's

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
go further in our therapy and that he's

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:27.780 
go further in our therapy and that he's
