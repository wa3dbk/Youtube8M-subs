00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 good speaks all god in 6 black and in 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.490
 this occasion shame takes a few 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.290
 how many tricks of snake some already 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.660
 some others do not know but we'll start 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.580
 with the tutorial the first trick is 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.960
 how to change the color of cooler and so is 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.940
 that we go here on the top 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.910
 where it says options settings colors and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.350
 here we will change everything to taste 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.530
 because it's going to this the first one is the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.080
 waveform I will put a blue color 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:33.540
 and here in controls is everything first 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:37.780
 it's the background I'll put a gray color 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.270
 ok we say ok and it changes everything 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.030
 is the first trick the second trick is 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.280
 of how to reduce noise in a track 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.059
 we explain here in yesterday in here in the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:53.590
 record button and this is a test of 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.030
 audio or case 12 12 ok 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.730
 well I recorded is the track and 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.860
 we select the track is very small 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.790
 Wave so that we normalize 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.659
 we are going in amplitude effects normalize 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.960
 here if I put 40 but you 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.880
 they learn what is in engraving we give ok 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.020
 and the noise that we want to eliminate is this 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.170
 It's a knife 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.960
 and it is that we are going to the reduction 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.920
 the reduction and here capture 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.920
 thought 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.670
 here we put it in closed we select 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.920
 the track we are going to see affected not 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.920
 reduction we reduce and we give ok 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.899
 and the infiltrator is already listening 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.049
 this is an audio test ok 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.850
 12 12 ok this is for those who do not have 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.080
 a condenser microphone and just 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.560
 are starting with a microphone 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.060
 dynamic and the last trick is one that 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.490
 he always puts the rap singers at 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.200
 beginning and at the end is a small echo 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.240
 so we select in the part 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.539
 where we want to put the echo we're going to 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.509
 effects of live ect eco and here we put 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:07.610
 this canyon goal that is one of these 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.610
 two but it is more recommendable this one 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.110
 2 ok 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.850
 all ok well it was very good we are going to 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.850
 select an effect 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.870
 12 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.610
