of<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.609> mic<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:49.780> is<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.050> bit<00:00:50.170> that<00:00:50.199> actually

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
of the mic this is the bit that actually

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
best thing about the gooseneck is it

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.889 
best thing about the gooseneck is it
really<00:00:56.440> allows<00:00:56.559> you<00:00:56.980> to<00:00:57.129> get<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.460> mic<00:00:57.969> exactly

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
really allows you to get the mic exactly

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.930 
really allows you to get the mic exactly
where<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.320> want<00:00:59.559> it<00:00:59.769> if<00:01:00.039> you<00:01:00.460> want<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:00.730> put<00:01:00.850> the

more space to the drum sound you can do

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.860 
more space to the drum sound you can do
you<00:01:12.760> can<00:01:12.970> of<00:01:13.120> course<00:01:13.150> mount<00:01:13.600> it<00:01:13.750> on<00:01:13.840> a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
you can of course mount it on a

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.930 
you can of course mount it on a
conventional<00:01:14.470> stand<00:01:14.860> with<00:01:15.280> a<00:01:15.310> normal<00:01:15.670> clip

conventional stand with a normal clip

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.660 
conventional stand with a normal clip
but<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.660> a<00:01:16.690> 75mm<00:01:17.560> is<00:01:17.710> quite<00:01:18.100> neat<00:01:18.340> quite

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
but the a 75mm is quite neat quite

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.760 
but the a 75mm is quite neat quite
compact<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.210> very<00:01:19.510> well<00:01:19.750> put<00:01:19.960> together<00:01:20.140> now

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
compact and very well put together now

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.960 
compact and very well put together now
the<00:01:20.830> one<00:01:21.010> thing<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.220> have<00:01:21.400> noticed<00:01:21.550> from<00:01:21.850> all

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
the one thing I have noticed from all

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.120 
the one thing I have noticed from all
these<00:01:22.120> sure<00:01:22.450> drum<00:01:22.780> mics<00:01:23.020> is<00:01:23.260> their<00:01:23.500> output<00:01:24.100> is

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
these sure drum mics is their output is

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.580 
these sure drum mics is their output is
incredibly<00:01:24.910> high<00:01:25.120> as<00:01:25.390> you<00:01:25.870> can<00:01:25.990> see<00:01:26.260> here

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
incredibly high as you can see here

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.070 
incredibly high as you can see here
here's<00:01:26.950> my<00:01:27.040> active<00:01:27.550> channels<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.150> if<00:01:28.690> we<00:01:28.930> go

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
here's my active channels and if we go

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.080 
here's my active channels and if we go
to<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.290> top<00:01:29.500> of<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.980> channel<00:01:30.160> strips<00:01:30.610> you<00:01:30.910> can

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
to the top of the channel strips you can

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.990 
to the top of the channel strips you can
see<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.810> gain<00:01:32.290> settings<00:01:32.890> for<00:01:33.190> my<00:01:33.340> avid<00:01:33.670> pries

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
see the gain settings for my avid pries

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.270 
see the gain settings for my avid pries
and<00:01:34.690> that's<00:01:34.900> really<00:01:35.170> quite<00:01:35.470> low<00:01:35.830> compared<00:01:36.250> to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
and that's really quite low compared to

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.980 
and that's really quite low compared to
other<00:01:36.340> drum<00:01:36.880> mics<00:01:37.090> I've<00:01:37.300> used<00:01:37.570> probably

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
other drum mics I've used probably

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.900 
other drum mics I've used probably
because<00:01:38.320> their<00:01:38.470> condensers<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.190> hence<00:01:39.760> they

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
because their condensers and hence they

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.100 
because their condensers and hence they
require<00:01:40.210> phantom<00:01:40.660> power

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
require phantom power

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.020 
require phantom power
now<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.650> other<00:01:41.890> mic<00:01:42.130> I'm<00:01:42.370> using<00:01:42.670> in<00:01:42.880> this

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
now the other mic I'm using in this

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.810 
now the other mic I'm using in this
session<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.600> for<00:01:44.530> my<00:01:44.710> overheads<00:01:45.190> this<00:01:45.370> is<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.520> b2

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
session is for my overheads this is a b2

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.290 
session is for my overheads this is a b2
27<00:01:46.720> it's<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.230> super<00:01:47.740> cardioid<00:01:48.130> mic<00:01:48.550> with<00:01:49.270> a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
27 it's a super cardioid mic with a

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.390

for<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.890> life<00:02:05.980> of<00:02:06.160> me<00:02:06.250> after<00:02:06.460> trawling<00:02:07.210> the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
for the life of me after trawling the

for the life of me after trawling the

shore website I can't actually find out

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.100 
shore website I can't actually find out
what<00:02:09.129> these<00:02:09.640> frequencies<00:02:10.300> are<00:02:10.479> but<00:02:10.810> I'm<00:02:10.929> going

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
what these frequencies are but I'm going

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.180 
what these frequencies are but I'm going
to<00:02:11.170> roll<00:02:11.349> off<00:02:11.530> some<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.830> bottom<00:02:12.040> end

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
to roll off some of the bottom end

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.860 
to roll off some of the bottom end
because<00:02:12.459> primarily<00:02:12.730> all<00:02:13.209> I<00:02:13.239> want<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:13.629> do<00:02:13.750> is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
because primarily all I want to do is

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.300 
because primarily all I want to do is
use<00:02:14.080> this<00:02:14.230> for<00:02:14.410> picking<00:02:14.650> up<00:02:14.769> my<00:02:14.890> overheads

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
use this for picking up my overheads

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.979 
use this for picking up my overheads
it's<00:02:15.579> gonna<00:02:15.819> get<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.060> little<00:02:16.329> bit<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:16.719> Tom's

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
it's gonna get a little bit of the Tom's

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.660 
it's gonna get a little bit of the Tom's
but<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.620> want<00:02:17.890> this<00:02:18.010> just<00:02:18.189> to<00:02:18.310> pick<00:02:18.430> up<00:02:18.489> their

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
but I want this just to pick up their

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.490 
but I want this just to pick up their
heads<00:02:18.939> but<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.659> know<00:02:19.780> what<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:20.109> think

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
heads but you know what I think

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.290 
heads but you know what I think
I'm<00:02:20.650> fairly<00:02:20.920> convinced<00:02:21.520> that<00:02:21.640> for<00:02:21.700> overheads

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
I'm fairly convinced that for overheads

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.810 
I'm fairly convinced that for overheads
supercardioid<00:02:23.170> could<00:02:23.650> be<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.010> way<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.190> go<00:02:24.550> I'm

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
supercardioid could be the way to go I'm

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.540 
supercardioid could be the way to go I'm
getting<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.630> much<00:02:26.050> better<00:02:26.280> stereo<00:02:27.280> separation

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
getting a much better stereo separation

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.460 
getting a much better stereo separation
from<00:02:28.000> my<00:02:28.210> overheads<00:02:28.570> than<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.780> ever<00:02:28.960> have<00:02:29.230> done

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
from my overheads than I ever have done

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.800 
from my overheads than I ever have done
before<00:02:29.620> I've<00:02:30.370> got<00:02:30.550> my<00:02:30.640> session<00:02:30.970> built<00:02:31.210> so<00:02:31.600> all

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
before I've got my session built so all

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.570 
before I've got my session built so all
I'm<00:02:31.930> going<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.110> do<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.500> just<00:02:32.920> lay<00:02:33.100> down<00:02:33.130> some

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
I'm going to do is just lay down some

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.370 
I'm going to do is just lay down some
drums<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.270> I'm<00:02:34.480> going<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.750> lay<00:02:34.870> down<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:35.080> groove

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
drums and I'm going to lay down a groove

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.680 
drums and I'm going to lay down a groove
that<00:02:35.620> I'll<00:02:35.860> be<00:02:36.040> using<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.910> next<00:02:36.940> mic

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
that I'll be using in the next mic

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.310 
that I'll be using in the next mic
review<00:02:38.110> you'll<00:02:38.980> also<00:02:39.160> see<00:02:39.640> there's<00:02:40.150> two<00:02:40.630> mic

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
review you'll also see there's two mic

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.380 
review you'll also see there's two mic
channels<00:02:41.590> set<00:02:42.160> up<00:02:42.310> for<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.760> kick

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
channels set up for the kick

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.810 
channels set up for the kick
there's<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.110> kick<00:02:44.380> on<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.620> inside<00:02:45.070> and<00:02:45.310> kick

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
there's the kick on the inside and kick

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.960 
there's the kick on the inside and kick
out<00:02:46.170> now<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.230> inside<00:02:47.680> mic<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.580> base<00:02:48.790> of

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
out now the inside mic is the base of

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.580 
out now the inside mic is the base of
91a<00:02:49.420> which<00:02:49.780> we<00:02:49.900> talked<00:02:50.080> about<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.320> couple<00:02:50.410> of

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
91a which we talked about a couple of

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.470 
91a which we talked about a couple of
videos<00:02:50.800> ago<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.340> I'm<00:02:52.000> gonna<00:02:52.120> leave<00:02:52.360> you

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
videos ago and I'm gonna leave you

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.750 
videos ago and I'm gonna leave you
guessing<00:02:52.720> about<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.290> outside<00:02:53.739> mic<00:02:54.040> until<00:02:54.580> the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
guessing about the outside mic until the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.360 
guessing about the outside mic until the
next<00:02:55.000> video<00:02:55.330> so<00:02:56.260> here<00:02:56.410> we<00:02:56.500> go<00:02:56.620> let's<00:02:56.800> just<00:02:57.220> lay

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
next video so here we go let's just lay

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:33.890 
next video so here we go let's just lay
down<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.940> drums<00:02:58.180> for<00:02:58.510> this<00:02:58.630> particular<00:02:58.870> track

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.849 

so<00:03:34.900> one<00:03:35.079> of<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.230> things<00:03:35.379> I've<00:03:35.530> noticed<00:03:35.650> about

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
so one of the things I've noticed about

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.039 
so one of the things I've noticed about
the<00:03:36.129> Shaw<00:03:36.489> drum<00:03:36.849> mics<00:03:37.090> over<00:03:37.540> what<00:03:37.689> I<00:03:37.719> usually

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
the Shaw drum mics over what I usually

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.170 
the Shaw drum mics over what I usually
use<00:03:38.500> is<00:03:38.709> I'm<00:03:38.859> getting<00:03:38.980> a<00:03:39.129> much<00:03:39.370> brighter<00:03:39.730> much

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
use is I'm getting a much brighter much

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.509 
use is I'm getting a much brighter much
more<00:03:40.510> attackee<00:03:40.930> kind<00:03:41.290> of<00:03:41.349> sound<00:03:41.590> now<00:03:42.220> my

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
more attackee kind of sound now my

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.069 
more attackee kind of sound now my
normal<00:03:42.849> mics<00:03:43.060> are<00:03:43.239> great<00:03:43.450> for<00:03:43.689> kind<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:43.930> rock

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
normal mics are great for kind of rock

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.509 
normal mics are great for kind of rock
and<00:03:44.109> roll<00:03:44.319> and<00:03:44.379> that<00:03:44.530> kind<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.709> big<00:03:44.920> drum<00:03:45.220> sound

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
and roll and that kind of big drum sound

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.059 
and roll and that kind of big drum sound
but<00:03:46.329> if<00:03:46.420> I<00:03:46.480> was<00:03:46.599> recording<00:03:46.870> jazz<00:03:47.349> funk<00:03:47.799> or

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
but if I was recording jazz funk or

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.619 
but if I was recording jazz funk or
fusion<00:03:48.400> or<00:03:48.700> something<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.150> required<00:03:49.480> a

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
fusion or something that required a

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.449 
fusion or something that required a
really<00:03:49.959> tight<00:03:50.409> really<00:03:50.890> sort<00:03:51.189> of<00:03:51.250> clinical

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
really tight really sort of clinical

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.849 
really tight really sort of clinical
drum<00:03:51.879> sound<00:03:52.180> I'm<00:03:52.750> definitely<00:03:53.650> gonna<00:03:53.769> be

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
drum sound I'm definitely gonna be

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.949 
drum sound I'm definitely gonna be
leaning<00:03:54.069> towards<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.790> shore<00:03:55.000> mics<00:03:55.299> in<00:03:55.510> future

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
leaning towards the shore mics in future

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.259 
leaning towards the shore mics in future
I've<00:03:56.409> got<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.620> really<00:03:57.010> nice<00:03:57.280> stereo<00:03:57.819> spread<00:03:58.150> a

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
I've got a really nice stereo spread a

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.610 
I've got a really nice stereo spread a
really<00:03:58.540> nice<00:03:58.659> separation<00:03:59.319> from<00:03:59.439> the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
really nice separation from the

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.559 
really nice separation from the
overheads<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.549> Tom<00:04:00.790> mics<00:04:01.030> sound<00:04:01.269> great

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
overheads the Tom mics sound great

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.050 
overheads the Tom mics sound great
there's<00:04:01.810> no<00:04:01.989> processing<00:04:02.650> on<00:04:02.739> anything<00:04:03.060> so

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
there's no processing on anything so

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.789 
there's no processing on anything so
what<00:04:04.239> I'll<00:04:04.329> do<00:04:04.480> now<00:04:04.510> is<00:04:04.659> I'll<00:04:04.900> sign<00:04:05.230> off<00:04:05.409> but

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
what I'll do now is I'll sign off but

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.649 
what I'll do now is I'll sign off but
I'll<00:04:05.889> leave<00:04:06.099> you<00:04:06.310> with<00:04:06.340> me<00:04:06.730> playing<00:04:07.209> through

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
I'll leave you with me playing through

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.899 
I'll leave you with me playing through
the<00:04:07.810> individual<00:04:08.230> drums<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.829> soloing<00:04:09.549> them<00:04:09.760> so

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
the individual drums and soloing them so

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.460 
the individual drums and soloing them so
you<00:04:09.970> can<00:04:10.120> hear<00:04:10.329> exactly<00:04:10.780> what's<00:04:11.109> coming<00:04:11.290> down

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
you can hear exactly what's coming down

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.710 
you can hear exactly what's coming down
the<00:04:11.620> channels<00:04:11.980> I<00:04:12.129> think<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:12.939> Tom<00:04:13.150> mics<00:04:13.419> sound

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
the channels I think the Tom mics sound

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.499 
the channels I think the Tom mics sound
great<00:04:14.169> I<00:04:14.500> think<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.040> floor<00:04:15.250> tom<00:04:15.519> sounds<00:04:15.970> huge

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:16.509 
great I think the floor tom sounds huge

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:18.029 
great I think the floor tom sounds huge
it's<00:04:16.810> definitely<00:04:17.259> going<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.500> need<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.799> little

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
it's definitely going to need a little

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.430 
it's definitely going to need a little
bit<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.280> gate<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.389> compression<00:04:19.989> just<00:04:20.139> to<00:04:20.229> kind

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
bit of gate and compression just to kind

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.810 
bit of gate and compression just to kind
of<00:04:20.470> pull<00:04:20.769> it<00:04:20.799> back<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.099> little<00:04:21.340> bit<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.639> make<00:04:21.789> it

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
of pull it back a little bit and make it

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.370 
of pull it back a little bit and make it
blend<00:04:22.240> in<00:04:22.479> better<00:04:22.599> with<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.840> rest<00:04:23.020> of<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.169> kit

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
blend in better with the rest of the kit

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.100 
blend in better with the rest of the kit
but<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:23.979> sounds<00:04:24.310> absolutely<00:04:24.580> vast<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.810> snare

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
but it sounds absolutely vast the snare

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.140 
but it sounds absolutely vast the snare
sounds<00:04:26.500> great<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.949> kick<00:04:27.190> sounds<00:04:27.580> massive

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
sounds great the kick sounds massive

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.230 
sounds great the kick sounds massive
again<00:04:28.720> might<00:04:29.500> need<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:29.800> little<00:04:30.010> bit<00:04:30.099> of<00:04:30.190> 1176<00:04:31.060> on

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
again might need a little bit of 1176 on

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.520 
again might need a little bit of 1176 on
that<00:04:31.389> just<00:04:31.630> to<00:04:31.720> push<00:04:31.900> it<00:04:32.050> back<00:04:32.199> and<00:04:32.409> give<00:04:32.500> it

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
that just to push it back and give it

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.710 
that just to push it back and give it
that<00:04:32.680> kind<00:04:32.830> of<00:04:32.889> chris<00:04:33.099> lord-alge<00:04:33.340> e<00:04:33.699> sound<00:04:34.000> but

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
that kind of chris lord-alge e sound but

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.480 
that kind of chris lord-alge e sound but
sounding<00:04:35.500> really<00:04:35.650> good<00:04:35.770> so<00:04:36.070> far<00:04:36.280> with

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
sounding really good so far with

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.670 
sounding really good so far with
absolutely<00:04:37.090> no<00:04:37.300> processing<00:04:37.870> so<00:04:38.409> I'll<00:04:38.500> leave

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
absolutely no processing so I'll leave

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.770 
absolutely no processing so I'll leave
you<00:04:38.830> with<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:38.979> and<00:04:39.190> see<00:04:39.820> you<00:04:39.970> on<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.449> next

you with that and see you on the next

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.590 
you with that and see you on the next
