00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
what I found is best to do if you got a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.020 
what I found is best to do if you got a
plug<00:01:15.560> stuck<00:01:15.859> which<00:01:16.159> I<00:01:16.399> did<00:01:18.430> before<00:01:19.430> Christmas

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
plug stuck which I did before Christmas

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.609 
plug stuck which I did before Christmas
I've<00:01:20.210> put<00:01:20.390> a<00:01:20.420> double<00:01:20.719> flare<00:01:20.869> plug<00:01:21.109> in<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:21.469> goat

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.289 
I've put a double flare plug in and goat
stuck<00:01:22.329> and<00:01:23.590> that's<00:01:24.590> why<00:01:24.799> I've<00:01:25.130> stretched<00:01:25.909> up<00:01:26.179> a

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
stuck and that's why I've stretched up a

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.569 
stuck and that's why I've stretched up a
little<00:01:26.479> bit<00:01:26.689> more<00:01:26.899> than<00:01:27.409> 10<00:01:27.679> mil<00:01:27.950> I'll

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579

I<00:02:08.080> tend<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.200> find<00:02:09.520> I've<00:02:10.520> got<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.789> cream<00:02:11.300> I<00:02:11.890> think

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
I tend to find I've got a cream I think

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.680 
I tend to find I've got a cream I think
it's<00:02:13.069> Nivea<00:02:13.520> which<00:02:13.730> has<00:02:13.880> got<00:02:14.060> like<00:02:14.240> how<00:02:14.450> hard

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
it's Nivea which has got like how hard

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.979 
it's Nivea which has got like how hard
was<00:02:14.870> stuff<00:02:15.080> in<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.180> in<00:02:17.390> between<00:02:17.659> a

was stuff in and that that in between a

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.240 
was stuff in and that that in between a
that<00:02:18.650> tends<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.010> be<00:02:19.129> better

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
that tends to be better

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.850 
that tends to be better
but<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:21.210> also<00:02:21.690> use<00:02:21.930> cocoa<00:02:22.290> butter<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.620> lot<00:02:22.770> as

playing with them and eventually over

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.060 
playing with them and eventually over
the<00:03:34.200> space<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.769> probably<00:03:35.100> about<00:03:35.390> once<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.660> week

on<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:04.920> can<00:04:05.720> get<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:06.989> pop<00:04:07.140> up<00:04:07.730> it's<00:04:08.730> just<00:04:08.820> ever

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
on I can get it to pop up it's just ever

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.910 
on I can get it to pop up it's just ever
so<00:04:09.329> slightly<00:04:09.360> tighter<00:04:09.959> than<00:04:10.260> that<00:04:10.440> one<00:04:10.620> for

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
so slightly tighter than that one for

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.630 
so slightly tighter than that one for
some<00:04:11.040> reason<00:04:11.329> but<00:04:12.329> it's<00:04:13.019> not<00:04:13.200> a<00:04:13.230> problem<00:04:13.640> but

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
some reason but it's not a problem but

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.490 
some reason but it's not a problem but
basically<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.690> best<00:04:15.810> thing<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.079> do<00:04:16.260> is<00:04:16.350> not

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
basically the best thing to do is not

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.560 
basically the best thing to do is not
panic<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:16.950> try<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.250> rip<00:04:17.370> it<00:04:17.489> out<00:04:17.579> because<00:04:17.820> all

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
panic and try and rip it out because all

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.300 
panic and try and rip it out because all
you're<00:04:18.870> going<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.049> do<00:04:19.169> is<00:04:19.500> give<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:19.919> ear<00:04:20.100> or

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
you're going to do is give you ear or

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.420 
you're going to do is give you ear or
blow<00:04:20.489> out<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:21.290> it's<00:04:22.290> going<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.650> just<00:04:22.800> cause<00:04:23.070> or

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
blow out and it's going to just cause or

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.120 
blow out and it's going to just cause or
tear<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.210> or<00:04:24.390> cause<00:04:24.660> damage<00:04:24.900> I<00:04:25.290> think<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:25.979> best

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
tear it or cause damage I think the best

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.490 
tear it or cause damage I think the best
thing<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.400> do<00:04:26.729> is<00:04:27.090> not<00:04:27.300> panic<00:04:27.540> hopefully

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
thing to do is not panic hopefully

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.690 
thing to do is not panic hopefully
you've<00:04:28.590> got<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.770> pair<00:04:29.010> of<00:04:29.039> plugs<00:04:29.310> in<00:04:29.490> that<00:04:29.610> you

screw back ones stuck and if they're
plastic<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.820> can<00:05:02.850> use<00:05:03.270> some<00:05:03.600> little<00:05:03.960> butt<00:05:04.650> and

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
off the back and break it if you get

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.900 
off the back and break it if you get
metal<00:05:14.880> ones<00:05:15.210> stuck<00:05:15.600> like<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.290> did<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.650> once

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
metal ones stuck like I did the once

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.970 
metal ones stuck like I did the once
because<00:05:17.910> it's<00:05:18.060> got<00:05:18.240> cross<00:05:18.450> threaded<00:05:18.900> that's<00:05:19.770> a

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
because it's got cross threaded that's a

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.400 
because it's got cross threaded that's a
bit<00:05:20.130> more<00:05:20.310> tricky<00:05:20.930> because<00:05:21.930> obviously<00:05:22.170> you

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
bit more tricky because obviously you

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.410 
bit more tricky because obviously you
can't<00:05:22.650> just<00:05:22.920> play<00:05:23.280> with<00:05:23.460> your<00:05:23.520> ears<00:05:23.790> in<00:05:24.150> the

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
can't just play with your ears in the

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.540 
can't just play with your ears in the
hope<00:05:24.600> that<00:05:24.630> you'll<00:05:24.870> be<00:05:24.900> able<00:05:24.960> to<00:05:25.110> pop<00:05:25.230> them<00:05:25.410> out

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
hope that you'll be able to pop them out

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.650 
hope that you'll be able to pop them out
because<00:05:26.550> you're<00:05:27.000> not<00:05:27.030> going<00:05:27.240> to<00:05:27.300> stretch<00:05:27.510> them

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
because you're not going to stretch them

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.720 
because you're not going to stretch them
that<00:05:27.840> much<00:05:28.050> this<00:05:28.530> is<00:05:28.740> just<00:05:28.950> design<00:05:29.340> this

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
that much this is just design this

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.630 
that much this is just design this
method<00:05:30.570> just<00:05:30.600> works<00:05:31.020> if<00:05:31.290> they're<00:05:31.530> flares<00:05:32.460> like

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
method just works if they're flares like

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.910 
method just works if they're flares like
about<00:05:32.910> 1<00:05:33.150> mil<00:05:33.390> bigger<00:05:33.660> but<00:05:34.050> if<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.620> flares<00:05:34.830> a

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
about 1 mil bigger but if the flares a

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.230 
about 1 mil bigger but if the flares a
couple<00:05:35.190> mil<00:05:35.370> is<00:05:35.460> bigger<00:05:35.640> because<00:05:35.790> it's<00:05:36.090> like<00:05:36.210> a

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
couple mil is bigger because it's like a

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.240 
couple mil is bigger because it's like a
screw<00:05:36.540> back<00:05:36.720> one<00:05:36.960> then<00:05:37.230> you<00:05:37.890> are<00:05:37.920> going<00:05:38.190> to

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
screw back one then you are going to

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.090 
screw back one then you are going to
have<00:05:38.340> more<00:05:38.460> problems<00:05:38.610> I<00:05:39.090> found<00:05:40.080> I've<00:05:40.650> got<00:05:41.010> it

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
have more problems I found I've got it

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.190 
have more problems I found I've got it
cross<00:05:41.310> threaded<00:05:41.760> so<00:05:42.060> I<00:05:42.120> just<00:05:42.480> squeeze<00:05:43.050> it

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
cross threaded so I just squeeze it

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.410 
cross threaded so I just squeeze it
really<00:05:43.290> hard<00:05:43.590> and<00:05:43.710> it<00:05:43.830> clicked<00:05:44.130> which<00:05:45.000> sort<00:05:45.300> of

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
really hard and it clicked which sort of

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.850 
really hard and it clicked which sort of
put<00:05:45.660> it<00:05:45.750> back<00:05:45.930> in<00:05:46.140> line<00:05:46.320> and<00:05:46.470> then<00:05:46.560> I<00:05:46.620> was<00:05:46.770> able

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
put it back in line and then I was able

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.790 
put it back in line and then I was able
to<00:05:46.980> unscrew<00:05:47.430> it<00:05:47.900> but<00:05:48.900> I<00:05:48.930> was<00:05:49.110> there<00:05:49.260> for<00:05:49.410> a<00:05:49.500> JIRA

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
to unscrew it but I was there for a JIRA

to unscrew it but I was there for a JIRA
