00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
up this will darken leathers so if you

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.720 
up this will darken leathers so if you
use<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.450> on<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.570> light<00:02:42.840> leather<00:02:43.080> be<00:02:43.920> prepared<00:02:44.400> to

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
have your leather a bit darken but I

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.140 
have your leather a bit darken but I
like<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.440> look<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.680> ease<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:50.550> held<00:02:50.760> up<00:02:50.880> well

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150
