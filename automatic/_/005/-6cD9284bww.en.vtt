00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.800 
now and now this time I should be able
to<00:00:56.170> cut<00:00:56.320> all<00:00:56.470> the<00:00:56.500> way<00:00:56.770> through<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:57.160> rubber

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
to cut all the way through the rubber

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.380 
to cut all the way through the rubber
yes<00:00:58.810> go<00:00:59.410> through<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.850> I've<00:01:00.940> cut<00:01:01.150> through

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
yes go through so I've cut through

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.440 
yes go through so I've cut through
there's<00:01:01.750> my<00:01:01.960> finger<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:04.239> that's<00:01:04.510> done<00:01:05.250> then

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
there's my finger and that's done then

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.219 
there's my finger and that's done then
after<00:01:07.450> you<00:01:07.540> do<00:01:07.690> cut<00:01:08.260> the<00:01:08.380> top<00:01:08.560> off<00:01:08.860> flip<00:01:10.229> flip

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
after you do cut the top off flip flip

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.590 
after you do cut the top off flip flip
the<00:01:11.380> tire<00:01:11.560> over<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.100> cut<00:01:12.369> say<00:01:13.210> three

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
the tire over and cut say three

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.880 
the tire over and cut say three
triangles<00:01:14.290> here<00:01:14.820> that's<00:01:15.820> because<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:17.830> you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
triangles here that's because if you

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
triangles here that's because if you
look<00:01:18.070> in<00:01:18.340> there<00:01:18.490> now

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
look in there now

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.240 
look in there now
you<00:01:19.210> can<00:01:19.390> see<00:01:19.660> that<00:01:20.040> water<00:01:21.390> water<00:01:22.390> would<00:01:22.720> just

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you can see that water water would just

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.310 
you can see that water water would just
sit<00:01:24.250> here<00:01:24.490> on<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.670> bottom<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:26.110> roots

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
sit here on the bottom and the roots

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.200 
sit here on the bottom and the roots
would<00:01:26.560> get<00:01:26.800> soaked<00:01:27.130> in<00:01:27.310> water<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:27.940> need<00:01:28.119> to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
would get soaked in water so you need to

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.810 
would get soaked in water so you need to
cut<00:01:28.390> holes<00:01:28.690> you<00:01:29.650> need<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:29.830> cut<00:01:30.009> some<00:01:30.220> holes<00:01:30.369> in

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
cut holes you need to cut some holes in

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.590 
cut holes you need to cut some holes in
here<00:01:31.150> to<00:01:31.360> let<00:01:31.509> the<00:01:31.540> water<00:01:31.780> out<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:34.270> can<00:01:34.390> see

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
here to let the water out as you can see

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.230 
here to let the water out as you can see
I've<00:01:34.750> already<00:01:35.040> I've<00:01:36.040> already<00:01:36.220> cut<00:01:36.790> through

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
I've already I've already cut through

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.050 
I've already I've already cut through
here<00:01:37.630> I<00:01:37.830> think<00:01:38.830> I<00:01:38.920> might<00:01:39.100> be<00:01:39.130> able<00:01:39.370> to<00:01:39.550> just<00:01:39.760> get

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
here I think I might be able to just get

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.430 
here I think I might be able to just get
get<00:01:40.780> my<00:01:40.960> blade<00:01:41.200> in<00:01:41.409> here<00:01:41.620> now<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.900> start<00:01:43.900> this

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
get my blade in here now and start this

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.429 
get my blade in here now and start this
cut<00:01:45.180> so

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
cut so

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.499 
cut so
the<00:01:47.979> thing<00:01:48.159> about<00:01:48.369> cutting<00:01:48.579> rubber<00:01:48.880> is<00:01:49.090> if<00:01:49.299> if

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
the thing about cutting rubber is if if

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.260 
the thing about cutting rubber is if if
you<00:01:49.689> can<00:01:50.219> spread<00:01:53.340> spread<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.490> out<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:54.880> cuts

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
you can spread spread it out it cuts

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.010 
you can spread spread it out it cuts
very<00:01:55.479> easily

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.969 

see<00:02:00.590> I'm<00:02:00.680> pulling<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.189> away<00:02:01.280> from<00:02:01.579> itself<00:02:02.979> when

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
see I'm pulling it away from itself when

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.499 
see I'm pulling it away from itself when
you<00:02:04.009> pull<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.579> away<00:02:04.670> from<00:02:04.759> itself<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.299> cuts

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
you pull it away from itself the cuts

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.169 
you pull it away from itself the cuts
very<00:02:05.720> well<00:02:06.280> now<00:02:07.280> look<00:02:07.490> we're<00:02:07.700> on<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.939> tire

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
very well now look we're on the tire

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.270 
very well now look we're on the tire
I've<00:02:08.360> done<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.959> cut<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:09.649> is<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.890> highest

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
I've done the cut this is the highest

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.580 
I've done the cut this is the highest
point<00:02:10.580> on<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.759> tire<00:02:10.970> that<00:02:11.270> means<00:02:12.200> if<00:02:12.440> it's

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
point on the tire that means if it's

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.370 
point on the tire that means if it's
upside<00:02:12.860> down<00:02:13.190> this<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.330> lowest<00:02:14.569> point<00:02:15.050> and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
upside down this is the lowest point and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.490 
upside down this is the lowest point and
that's<00:02:16.310> where<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.640> water<00:02:16.819> will<00:02:17.030> go<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:19.250> again

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.240 

try<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.190> cut<00:02:23.460> that<00:02:23.610> piece<00:02:23.820> off<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.070> is

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
try to cut that piece off so this is

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.190 
try to cut that piece off so this is
just<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.580> allow<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:26.970> water<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:29.900> feel<00:02:30.900> at<00:02:31.080> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
just to allow the water to feel at the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.740 
just to allow the water to feel at the
bottom<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.950> doesn't<00:02:32.310> have<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.610> look<00:02:32.790> pretty<00:02:33.150> no

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
bottom it doesn't have to look pretty no

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.250 
bottom it doesn't have to look pretty no
one<00:02:33.900> will<00:02:34.080> ever<00:02:34.200> see<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:35.450> drainage<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.630> so

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
one will ever see it drainage is so

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.260 
one will ever see it drainage is so
important<00:02:38.210> that<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.510> want<00:02:40.550> good<00:02:41.550> drainage<00:02:41.790> as

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270

you can see I've got two already I'm
going<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.400> put<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> third<00:02:47.820> one<00:02:48.150> here<00:02:49.070> then<00:02:50.070> we've

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
going to put a third one here then we've

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.800 
going to put a third one here then we've
just<00:02:50.310> looked<00:02:50.730> around<00:02:50.850> our<00:02:51.300> neighborhood<00:02:51.720> to

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
just looked around our neighborhood to

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.980 
just looked around our neighborhood to
see<00:02:51.960> if<00:02:51.990> we<00:02:52.110> could<00:02:52.260> find<00:02:52.470> some<00:02:52.710> soil<00:02:53.630> we<00:02:54.630> found

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
see if we could find some soil we found

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.560 
see if we could find some soil we found
really<00:02:55.800> good<00:02:56.040> compost<00:02:56.580> there's<00:02:57.240> a<00:02:57.330> place

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
really good compost there's a place

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.670 
really good compost there's a place
where<00:02:57.780> some<00:02:58.260> birds<00:02:58.590> were<00:03:00.260> roosting<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.620> the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
where some birds were roosting in the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.890 
where some birds were roosting in the
trees<00:03:01.740> at<00:03:02.160> night<00:03:02.190> making<00:03:03.180> lots<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.450> compost

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
trees at night making lots of compost

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.650 
trees at night making lots of compost
under<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.380> tree<00:03:04.610> but<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.940> soil<00:03:06.210> was<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.510> bit

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
under the tree but that soil was a bit

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.860 
under the tree but that soil was a bit
too<00:03:06.810> rich<00:03:06.990> so<00:03:07.500> we<00:03:07.650> mixed<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.070> with<00:03:08.190> just<00:03:08.490> some

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
too rich so we mixed it with just some

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.130 
too rich so we mixed it with just some
gravelly<00:03:09.870> sand<00:03:10.560> 60%<00:03:11.370> gravelly<00:03:11.790> sand<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.330> 40%

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
gravelly sand 60% gravelly sand and 40%

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.390 
gravelly sand 60% gravelly sand and 40%
compost<00:03:14.480> then<00:03:15.480> we<00:03:15.720> stuck<00:03:16.080> some<00:03:16.410> basil<00:03:16.740> in<00:03:17.190> here

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
compost then we stuck some basil in here

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.570 
compost then we stuck some basil in here
just<00:03:17.760> some<00:03:18.470> we<00:03:19.470> thinned<00:03:20.010> out<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.370> pot

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
just some we thinned out this pot

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.530 
just some we thinned out this pot
actually<00:03:21.030> we<00:03:21.750> had<00:03:21.960> perhaps<00:03:22.820> 10<00:03:23.820> we<00:03:24.210> put<00:03:24.390> about

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
actually we had perhaps 10 we put about

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.140 
actually we had perhaps 10 we put about
10<00:03:24.810> cuttings<00:03:25.230> in<00:03:25.410> here<00:03:25.650> thinking<00:03:26.190> maybe<00:03:26.880> only

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
10 cuttings in here thinking maybe only

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.720 
10 cuttings in here thinking maybe only
one<00:03:27.450> would<00:03:27.630> root<00:03:27.840> but<00:03:28.140> they<00:03:28.290> all<00:03:28.410> rooted<00:03:28.800> so<00:03:29.610> we

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
one would root but they all rooted so we

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.940 
one would root but they all rooted so we
put<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.360> extra<00:03:30.720> ones<00:03:30.900> around<00:03:31.230> in<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.590> circle

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
put the extra ones around in a circle

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.699 
put the extra ones around in a circle
and<00:03:32.150> while<00:03:33.150> those<00:03:33.480> are<00:03:33.750> catching<00:03:34.440> on<00:03:34.560> and

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
and while those are catching on and

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.430 
and while those are catching on and
growing<00:03:34.920> we've<00:03:35.670> got<00:03:36.000> some<00:03:36.239> tomato<00:03:36.660> plants<00:03:37.290> in

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
growing we've got some tomato plants in

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.370 
growing we've got some tomato plants in
the<00:03:38.190> center<00:03:38.610> we're<00:03:39.480> only<00:03:39.690> planning<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.230> have

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
the center we're only planning to have

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.560 
the center we're only planning to have
one<00:03:40.680> tomato<00:03:41.040> plant<00:03:41.400> in<00:03:41.580> here<00:03:41.760> but<00:03:42.150> as<00:03:42.300> you<00:03:42.480> can

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
one tomato plant in here but as you can

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.540 
one tomato plant in here but as you can
see<00:03:42.630> there's<00:03:42.989> quite<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.709> lot<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:43.950> germinated

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
see there's quite a lot of germinated

this is just from a single tomato we
didn't<00:03:47.280> buy<00:03:47.489> tomato<00:03:48.180> seeds<00:03:48.450> or<00:03:48.600> anything<00:03:48.870> come

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
and follow me I'll show you the plant we

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.550 
and follow me I'll show you the plant we
got<00:03:51.209> it<00:03:51.300> from

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.830 

this<00:03:55.250> here<00:03:55.489> is<00:03:55.640> just<00:03:55.880> one<00:03:56.090> or<00:03:56.209> two<00:03:56.360> plants

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
this here is just one or two plants

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.620 
this here is just one or two plants
growing<00:03:59.840> very<00:04:00.650> nicely<00:04:00.860> we've<00:04:01.730> had<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:02.090> stake

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
growing very nicely we've had to stake

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.140 
growing very nicely we've had to stake
it<00:04:02.780> up<00:04:02.900> with<00:04:03.110> bamboo<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.099> whatnot<00:04:04.370> anyway

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
it up with bamboo and whatnot anyway

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.640 
it up with bamboo and whatnot anyway
this<00:04:05.510> doesn't<00:04:05.810> get<00:04:05.900> much<00:04:06.050> bigger<00:04:06.230> just<00:04:06.560> a

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
this doesn't get much bigger just a

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.839 
this doesn't get much bigger just a
cherry<00:04:06.890> tomato<00:04:07.040> so<00:04:08.050> no<00:04:09.050> there's<00:04:09.290> one<00:04:09.440> that's

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
red I didn't see it we've harvested

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.379 
red I didn't see it we've harvested
maybe<00:04:15.340> 30<00:04:16.340> or<00:04:16.549> 50<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.389> these<00:04:17.540> already<00:04:17.870> just

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
maybe 30 or 50 of these already just

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.759 
maybe 30 or 50 of these already just
pick<00:04:20.389> them<00:04:20.540> like<00:04:20.690> this<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.079> they'll<00:04:21.290> ripen<00:04:21.500> up

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
pick them like this and they'll ripen up

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.510 
pick them like this and they'll ripen up
nice<00:04:22.040> and<00:04:22.070> red<00:04:23.680> and<00:04:24.680> you<00:04:24.889> can<00:04:25.040> just<00:04:25.190> bite<00:04:25.370> into

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
nice and red and you can just bite into

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.300 
nice and red and you can just bite into
this<00:04:25.760> squeeze<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.480> seed<00:04:26.690> that<00:04:26.990> in<00:04:27.740> a<00:04:28.100> few<00:04:28.280> days

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
this squeeze the seed that in a few days

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.730 
this squeeze the seed that in a few days
you'll<00:04:28.610> have<00:04:28.669> another<00:04:29.030> plant<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:30.500> got<00:04:30.620> to

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
you'll have another plant you got to

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.150 
you'll have another plant you got to
always<00:04:30.860> keep<00:04:31.160> planting<00:04:32.150> new<00:04:32.300> tomato<00:04:32.540> plants

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
always keep planting new tomato plants
