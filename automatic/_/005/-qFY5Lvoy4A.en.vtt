00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
are you one of these people that sees

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.280 
are you one of these people that sees
numbers<00:00:02.639> everywhere<00:00:03.060> certain<00:00:03.720> sequences<00:00:04.170> of

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
numbers everywhere certain sequences of

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.789 
numbers everywhere certain sequences of
numbers<00:00:04.520> well<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.549> am<00:00:05.790> I<00:00:06.089> see<00:00:06.870> different

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
numbers well I am I see different

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.259 
numbers well I am I see different
sequences<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.400> numbers<00:00:08.670> everywhere<00:00:08.940> and

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
sequences and numbers everywhere and

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.780 
sequences and numbers everywhere and
there's<00:00:09.929> one<00:00:10.139> particular<00:00:10.349> number<00:00:11.099> that's

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
there's one particular number that's

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.180 
there's one particular number that's
been<00:00:11.940> coming<00:00:12.150> up<00:00:12.360> for<00:00:12.599> me<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:13.500> years<00:00:13.920> and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
been coming up for me for years and

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.000 
been coming up for me for years and
years<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.759> years<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:16.020> much<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.680> it's

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
years and years so much so that it's

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.130 
years and years so much so that it's
really<00:00:17.310> uncanny<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:18.810> not<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
really uncanny it's it's not a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.080 
really uncanny it's it's not a
coincidence<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:20.010> could<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.460> called<00:00:20.760> spooky

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
coincidence it could be called spooky

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.269 
coincidence it could be called spooky
but<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.539> don't<00:00:21.750> get<00:00:21.869> spooked<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.320> much<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.740> it's

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
but I don't get spooked so much so it's

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.890 
but I don't get spooked so much so it's
not<00:00:23.400> spooky<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:24.000> some<00:00:24.390> people<00:00:24.630> think<00:00:24.750> it's

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
not spooky but some people think it's

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.470 
not spooky but some people think it's

number coming up for whatever reason and
there's<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.820> lot<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.000> theories<00:00:45.510> out<00:00:45.600> there<00:00:45.660> why

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
there's a lot of theories out there why

there's a lot of theories out there why
this<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.649> happening<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:48.180> do<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
this is happening it's to do with the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.900 
this is happening it's to do with the
calendar<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.649> astrologically<00:00:50.039> what's<00:00:50.700> going

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
calendar to astrologically what's going

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.779 
calendar to astrologically what's going
on<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> world<00:00:51.449> right<00:00:51.660> now<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:52.469> whole

quickly<00:01:30.689> look<00:01:30.960> at<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.110> time<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.619> look<00:01:31.979> at<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
quickly look at the time I look at the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.510 
quickly look at the time I look at the
time<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.420> specific<00:01:33.930> number<00:01:34.520> hams

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
time and it's that specific number hams

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.700 
time and it's that specific number hams
I'll<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.540> driving<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.930> my<00:01:36.960> car<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.470> look<00:01:37.619> at

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the car in front will have my number

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.670 
the car in front will have my number
plate<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.720> number<00:01:39.930> plate<00:01:40.049> my<00:01:40.350> number<00:01:40.619> in

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
plate in the number plate my number in

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.510 
plate in the number plate my number in
the<00:01:40.770> number<00:01:40.979> plate<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:42.630> much<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.079> um<00:01:43.520> and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the number plate and so much so um and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.609 
the number plate and so much so um and
you<00:01:45.000> could<00:01:45.149> say<00:01:45.329> well<00:01:45.509> my<00:01:45.630> brain<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.170> trained

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
you could say well my brain is trained

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.280 
you could say well my brain is trained
to<00:01:46.740> see<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.130> specific<00:01:47.579> number<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:49.110> it

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
to see this specific number and but it

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.440 
to see this specific number and but it
happens<00:01:49.710> too<00:01:50.280> much<00:01:50.490> for<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.880> happen<00:01:51.030> like
