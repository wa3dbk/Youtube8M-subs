00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
smooth as I might other watches but it's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.649 
smooth as I might other watches but it's
definitely<00:01:59.009> good<00:01:59.460> enough<00:01:59.579> for<00:01:59.969> watching<00:02:00.479> this

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659

to replace the band's the most important
part<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.900> watching<00:03:34.470> for<00:03:35.070> that<00:03:35.100> matter

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
part of this watching for that matter

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.390 
part of this watching for that matter
any<00:03:35.880> watches<00:03:36.210> its<00:03:36.660> movements<00:03:37.350> um<00:03:37.530> all<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.220> know

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
any watches its movements um all I know

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.310 
any watches its movements um all I know
about<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.880> movement<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.570> that<00:03:39.600> it's<00:03:39.900> made<00:03:40.110> by

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
about the movement is that it's made by

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.160 
about the movement is that it's made by
Vostok<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.400> it's<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.670> mechanical<00:03:42.330> manual

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
Vostok and it's a mechanical manual

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.520 
Vostok and it's a mechanical manual
winding<00:03:43.580> as<00:03:44.580> far<00:03:44.850> as<00:03:45.090> specifics<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:46.050> just<00:03:46.320> don't

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
winding as far as specifics I just don't

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.010 
winding as far as specifics I just don't
know<00:03:46.800> it<00:03:47.070> does<00:03:47.700> keep<00:03:47.940> accurate<00:03:48.510> time<00:03:48.750> though

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
know it does keep accurate time though

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.870 
know it does keep accurate time though
and<00:03:49.350> that's<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.740> most<00:03:49.920> important<00:03:50.520> thing<00:03:50.700> in

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
and that's the most important thing in

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.500 
and that's the most important thing in
any<00:03:51.000> watch<00:03:52.220> overall<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:53.820> watch<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:54.240> a<00:03:54.270> good

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
any watch overall this watch is a good

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.560 
any watch overall this watch is a good
buy<00:03:54.690> for<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:55.110> price<00:03:55.460> it<00:03:56.460> has<00:03:56.670> some<00:03:56.910> issues<00:03:57.090> but

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
buy for the price it has some issues but

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.140 
buy for the price it has some issues but
it<00:03:57.690> does<00:03:57.870> keep<00:03:58.110> good<00:03:58.410> time<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:59.150> it's

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
it does keep good time and it's

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.600 
it does keep good time and it's
certainly<00:04:00.570> more<00:04:00.930> interesting<00:04:01.530> than<00:04:01.710> a<00:04:01.770> $60

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
certainly more interesting than a $60

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.510 
certainly more interesting than a $60

it's<00:04:09.510> just<00:04:09.660> called<00:04:09.990> the<00:04:10.340> submarine

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
it's just called the submarine
