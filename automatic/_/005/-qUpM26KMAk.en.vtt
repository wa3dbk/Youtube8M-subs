I<00:00:42.980> started<00:00:43.980> design<00:00:44.309> works<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.930> 1995

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
I started design works in 1995

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.290 
I started design works in 1995
predominantly<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> product<00:00:47.640> design<00:00:48.000> firm

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
predominantly as a product design firm

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.170 
predominantly as a product design firm
we<00:00:48.989> did<00:00:49.230> plain<00:00:49.710> paper<00:00:49.980> design<00:00:50.309> solving

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
we did plain paper design solving

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.529 
we did plain paper design solving
problems<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:51.960> our<00:00:52.199> customer<00:00:52.710> base<00:00:53.149> and<00:00:54.149> then

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
problems for our customer base and then

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.209 
problems for our customer base and then
as<00:00:55.789> 2002<00:00:56.789> around<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.539> time<00:00:57.840> frame<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.859> became

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
as 2002 around that time frame it became

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.910 
as 2002 around that time frame it became
evident<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.789> me<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.390> were<00:01:00.739> designing<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
evident to me that we were designing a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740 
evident to me that we were designing a
lot<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.250> test<00:01:02.460> equipment<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.149> qualify<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
lot of test equipment to qualify the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.270 
lot of test equipment to qualify the
automotive<00:01:04.260> products<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.129> were

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
automotive products that we were

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.240 
automotive products that we were
designing<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.570> purchased<00:01:07.020> my<00:01:07.170> first

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
designing and I purchased my first

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.890 
designing and I purchased my first
Hosmer<00:01:08.250> shining<00:01:08.580> center<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.479> started

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
Hosmer shining center and we started

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.080 
Hosmer shining center and we started
fabricating<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.890> test<00:01:11.130> equipment<00:01:11.670> which

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
fabricating the test equipment which

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.810 
fabricating the test equipment which
allowed<00:01:12.420> us<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.930> now<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> more<00:01:13.830> full<00:01:14.310> service

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
allowed us to be now a more full service

outsourced overseas and we thought about
it<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:27.990> tried<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.560> creative<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:29.430> how<00:01:30.030> we

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
it and tried to get creative at how we

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.380 
it and tried to get creative at how we

were<00:02:16.280> thought<00:02:16.730> they<00:02:16.880> were<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.120> best<00:02:17.330> value

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
were thought they were the best value

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.840 
were thought they were the best value
for<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.530> dollar<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:19.130> we've<00:02:19.490> been<00:02:19.640> buying

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
for the dollar and we've been buying

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.270 
for the dollar and we've been buying
them<00:02:20.180> now<00:02:20.360> for<00:02:20.420> over<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.990> decade<00:02:21.500> with<00:02:22.220> the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
them now for over a decade with the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.970 
them now for over a decade with the
delivery<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.000> our<00:02:23.360> 13th<00:02:23.930> machine<00:02:24.350> coming<00:02:24.680> very

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
delivery of our 13th machine coming very

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.310 
delivery of our 13th machine coming very
shortly<00:02:25.330> one<00:02:26.330> of<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.510> things<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.960> I<00:02:26.990> thought

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
shortly one of the things that I thought

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.260 
shortly one of the things that I thought
that<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.590> provided<00:02:28.130> me<00:02:28.250> is<00:02:28.400> all<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.730> controls

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
that it provided me is all the controls

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.570 
that it provided me is all the controls
are<00:02:29.600> almost<00:02:29.930> identical<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:31.010> when<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.220> bring<00:02:31.490> a

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
are almost identical so when I bring a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.730 
are almost identical so when I bring a
new<00:02:31.700> operator<00:02:32.180> in<00:02:32.420> train<00:02:32.810> them<00:02:33.050> they're

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
new operator in train them they're

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.800 
new operator in train them they're
capable<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.640> running<00:02:34.790> any<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.480> machines

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
capable of running any of the machines

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.920 
capable of running any of the machines
in<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.050> shop<00:02:36.170> in<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.850> cell<00:02:38.150> we're

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
in the shop in this cell we're

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.930 
in the shop in this cell we're
manufacturing<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:40.070> heart<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.730> power

earlier<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.810> we've<00:02:45.380> got<00:02:45.700> 19<00:02:46.780> operations<00:02:47.780> set

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
earlier and we've got 19 operations set

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.650 
earlier and we've got 19 operations set
up<00:02:48.410> here<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.250> we<00:02:49.340> can<00:02:49.490> do<00:02:49.610> extremely<00:02:50.330> lean

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660
