up<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:48.100> if<00:02:48.460> there's<00:02:48.670> rocks<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.270> area<00:02:49.360> you

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
up and if there's rocks in the area you

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.470 
up and if there's rocks in the area you
don't<00:02:50.050> need<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.410> shovel<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:51.850> see<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.240> got<00:02:52.390> to

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
don't need to shovel you see you got to

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.800 
don't need to shovel you see you got to
be<00:02:52.540> careful<00:02:52.810> because<00:02:53.170> this<00:02:53.530> had<00:02:53.770> two

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
be careful because this had two

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.300 
be careful because this had two
different<00:02:55.810> root<00:02:56.260> systems<00:02:56.710> coming<00:02:56.950> off<00:02:57.160> it

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
different root systems coming off it

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.240 
different root systems coming off it
sometimes<00:02:57.670> they<00:02:57.820> have<00:02:57.940> three<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.650> it<00:03:00.040> goes

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
sometimes they have three and it goes

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.880 
sometimes they have three and it goes
that<00:03:00.490> way<00:03:00.550> but<00:03:01.020> that's<00:03:02.020> all<00:03:02.290> we<00:03:02.470> got<00:03:02.650> on<00:03:02.830> that

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
that way but that's all we got on that

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.010 
that way but that's all we got on that
one<00:03:04.110> but<00:03:05.110> here's<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.500> size<00:03:05.740> of<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.010> leaves

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
one but here's the size of the leaves

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.600 
one but here's the size of the leaves
like<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.170> bigger<00:03:08.380> ones<00:03:08.650> will<00:03:08.920> keep<00:03:09.400> their

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
like the bigger ones will keep their

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.150 
like the bigger ones will keep their
greenness<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:10.270> time<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:10.660> year<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.560> they

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
greenness this time of year and they

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.710 
greenness this time of year and they
have<00:03:12.510> three<00:03:13.510> bigger<00:03:13.810> leaves<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:15.690> they're<00:03:16.690> a

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
have three bigger leaves and they're a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.330 
have three bigger leaves and they're a
little<00:03:16.990> jagged<00:03:17.260> on<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.680> edge<00:03:17.830> they're

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
little jagged on the edge they're

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.090 
little jagged on the edge they're
slender<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:20.080> two<00:03:20.260> smaller<00:03:20.620> leaves<00:03:20.920> at

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
slender and the two smaller leaves at

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.580 
slender and the two smaller leaves at
the<00:03:21.160> bottom<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:22.630> cluster<00:03:23.020> berries<00:03:23.470> in

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
the bottom and the cluster berries in

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.230 
the bottom and the cluster berries in
the<00:03:23.680> middle<00:03:23.980> so<00:03:24.160> this<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.430> three<00:03:24.760> prong<00:03:25.060> er

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
the middle so this is a three prong er

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.410 
the middle so this is a three prong er
and<00:03:26.430> normally<00:03:27.430> we<00:03:27.520> try<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.760> pick<00:03:27.970> this<00:03:28.180> and

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
and normally we try to pick this and

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.050 
and normally we try to pick this and
bigger<00:03:28.710> if<00:03:29.710> you<00:03:29.800> get<00:03:29.980> any<00:03:30.160> smaller<00:03:30.520> you're

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
bigger if you get any smaller you're

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.540 
bigger if you get any smaller you're
ruining<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.960> next<00:03:32.260> year's<00:03:32.560> or<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.250> next

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
like six or more plans this spot in

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.650 
like six or more plans this spot in
particular<00:04:26.650> last<00:04:27.650> year<00:04:28.100> we<00:04:28.640> got<00:04:28.820> a<00:04:29.060> four<00:04:29.420> prong

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.380 
particular last year we got a four prong
plant<00:04:30.140> here<00:04:30.380> and<00:04:30.860> it<00:04:31.790> looks<00:04:31.970> like<00:04:32.060> there's<00:04:32.330> a

nice three prong plant a couple three

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.160 
nice three prong plant a couple three
prongs<00:04:35.290> three<00:04:36.290> of<00:04:36.410> them<00:04:36.650> at<00:04:36.740> least<00:04:36.890> they're

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
prongs three of them at least they're

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.670 
prongs three of them at least they're
okay<00:04:39.170> it's<00:04:39.350> September<00:04:39.980> and<00:04:40.010> normally<00:04:41.680> the

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
okay it's September and normally the

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.130 
okay it's September and normally the
ginseng<00:04:43.580> I'll<00:04:43.730> start<00:04:44.000> getting<00:04:44.150> yellow<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:44.960> it

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
ginseng I'll start getting yellow to it

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.700 
ginseng I'll start getting yellow to it
and<00:04:46.540> it'll<00:04:47.540> start<00:04:47.920> being<00:04:48.920> harder<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.340> find<00:04:50.710> we

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
and it'll start being harder to find we

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.160 
and it'll start being harder to find we
just<00:04:51.890> have<00:04:52.040> to<00:04:52.160> move<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.370> berries<00:04:53.170> like

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
just have to move the berries like

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.110 
just have to move the berries like
they're<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:55.030> stem<00:04:56.030> snaps<00:04:56.450> off<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:58.490> rocks<00:04:58.850> is

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
they're the stem snaps off and rocks is

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.880 
they're the stem snaps off and rocks is
really<00:04:59.540> hard<00:04:59.750> to<00:04:59.870> dig<00:05:00.080> out<00:05:00.580> yeah<00:05:02.530> pull<00:05:03.530> stuff

collect and we get a bunch of these
we'll<00:05:27.970> about<00:05:29.110> five<00:05:30.110> times<00:05:30.380> going<00:05:30.740> out<00:05:30.980> we'll

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
we'll about five times going out we'll

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.740 
we'll about five times going out we'll
have<00:05:31.610> a<00:05:31.790> pound<00:05:32.360> in<00:05:32.540> there<00:05:32.720> time<00:05:33.010> so<00:05:34.419> I'll<00:05:35.419> show
