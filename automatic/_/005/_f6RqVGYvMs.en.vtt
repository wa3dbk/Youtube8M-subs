review of the iphone 4s retina display
this<00:00:06.509> display<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.280> super<00:00:08.280> high<00:00:08.460> quality

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
this display is super high quality

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.790 
this display is super high quality
supposedly<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.870> pixels<00:00:10.230> per<00:00:10.410> inch<00:00:10.440> are

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
supposedly the pixels per inch are

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.919 
supposedly the pixels per inch are
higher<00:00:11.280> than<00:00:11.639> what<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.210> human<00:00:12.540> eye<00:00:12.660> can

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
higher than what the human eye can

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.780 
higher than what the human eye can
decode<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:13.740> let<00:00:13.860> me<00:00:13.889> just<00:00:14.070> give<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.309> my<00:00:14.340> review

of<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.330> we'll<00:00:16.199> call<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.470> an<00:00:16.560> epic<00:00:16.920> screen<00:00:17.900> so

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
of this we'll call it an epic screen so

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.990 
of this we'll call it an epic screen so
first<00:00:19.170> let's<00:00:19.350> look<00:00:19.410> at<00:00:19.619> text<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.820> just

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
first let's look at text this is just

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.870 
first let's look at text this is just
some<00:00:21.150> notes<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.630> took<00:00:21.689> for<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.880> article

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
some notes that I took for a article

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.490 
some notes that I took for a article
that<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.150> wrote<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.390> long<00:00:24.570> time<00:00:24.840> ago<00:00:24.990> about<00:00:25.320> why

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
that I wrote a long time ago about why

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.040 
that I wrote a long time ago about why
you'd<00:00:25.650> want<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.949> keep<00:00:26.130> AOL<00:00:26.640> if<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.810> see

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
you'd want to keep AOL if you can see

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.680 
you'd want to keep AOL if you can see
the<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.519> really<00:00:29.519> really<00:00:29.760> crisp<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:32.570> you<00:00:33.570> know

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the is really really crisp and you know

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.360 
the is really really crisp and you know
what<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.989> can't<00:00:34.350> even<00:00:34.559> see<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> pixels<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
what I can't even see the pixels of the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.729 
what I can't even see the pixels of the
screen<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:36.780> let's<00:00:36.989> compare<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.500> just

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
screen so let's compare that just

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.380 
screen so let's compare that just
quickly<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.280> another<00:00:38.850> phone<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.270> have

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
quickly to another phone that I have

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.119 
quickly to another phone that I have
lying<00:00:39.660> around<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.410> see<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.770> can<00:00:40.920> see

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
lying around just to see if you can see

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:49.639 
lying around just to see if you can see
the<00:00:41.250> pixels<00:00:42.050> on<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.399> let's<00:00:44.550> zoom<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:48.649> and

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the pixels on this so let's zoom in and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.069 
the pixels on this so let's zoom in and
as<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.879> see<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.149> text<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.750> crisp

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
as you can see the text is in this crisp

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
as you can see the text is in this crisp
and<00:00:52.739> I'm<00:00:52.829> not<00:00:52.980> even<00:00:53.250> doing<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.760> comparison

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
and I'm not even doing a comparison

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.459 
and I'm not even doing a comparison
video<00:00:54.539> i<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.750> want<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> show<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> text

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
video i just want to show you the text

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.889 
video i just want to show you the text
is<00:00:55.559> not<00:00:55.649> as<00:00:55.770> crisp<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:57.239> indeed<00:00:57.629> see

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
is not as crisp and you can indeed see

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.680 
is not as crisp and you can indeed see
the<00:00:58.530> pixels<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.789> phone<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> answer

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the pixels of this phone so the answer

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.219 
the pixels of this phone so the answer
is<00:01:00.719> yes<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.440> message<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:03.239> let's<00:01:04.049> show<00:01:04.199> you

is yes to that message so let's show you

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.380 
is yes to that message so let's show you
the<00:01:04.470> iphone<00:01:04.799> 4<00:01:05.070> again<00:01:05.280> unless<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.939> time<00:01:06.180> go

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the iphone 4 again unless this time go

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.850 
the iphone 4 again unless this time go
to<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.630> website<00:01:06.930> just<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> extreme<00:01:08.909> pre-alpha

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
to a website just the extreme pre-alpha

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.980 
to a website just the extreme pre-alpha
preview<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.040> around<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> tech<00:01:12.180> which<00:01:12.750> by<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
preview of around the tech which by the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.830 
preview of around the tech which by the
way<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.010> not<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.549> final<00:01:14.760> design<00:01:15.060> clearly

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
way this is not the final design clearly

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.910 
way this is not the final design clearly
so<00:01:16.830> let's<00:01:17.009> flip<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.369> actually<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.740> then<00:01:19.740> let's

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
so let's flip it actually and then let's

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.710 
so let's flip it actually and then let's
zoom<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.220> all<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.850> way<00:01:22.430> look<00:01:23.430> at<00:01:23.700> how<00:01:24.180> crisp

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
zoom in all the way look at how crisp

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.880 
zoom in all the way look at how crisp
and<00:01:25.020> how<00:01:25.890> inky<00:01:26.869> if<00:01:27.869> that's<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.290> word<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.619> want<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and how inky if that's a word we want to

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.710 
and how inky if that's a word we want to
use<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.479> text<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:31.470> simply

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
use that text is it's simply

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.390 
use that text is it's simply
revolutionary<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.960> let's<00:01:34.770> even<00:01:34.950> look<00:01:35.159> at<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
revolutionary and let's even look at the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.590 
revolutionary and let's even look at the
viewing<00:01:35.729> angles<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.189> almost

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
viewing angles of this so that's almost

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.770 
viewing angles of this so that's almost
completely<00:01:39.600> blocked<00:01:39.869> out<00:01:40.189> you<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.369> see<00:01:41.780> you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
completely blocked out you can see you

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.200 
completely blocked out you can see you
can<00:01:42.960> see<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.470> then<00:01:44.340> as<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.939> there's

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
can see and then as you can see there's

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.830 
can see and then as you can see there's
a<00:01:45.299> hole<00:01:45.689> from<00:01:46.590> about<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:48.320> about<00:01:49.320> their

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
a hole from about here to about their

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.139 
a hole from about here to about their
complete<00:01:51.840> viewing<00:01:52.380> angle<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.950> same<00:01:53.250> contrast

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
complete viewing angle the same contrast

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.209 
complete viewing angle the same contrast
everything<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.110> then<00:01:55.530> as<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.770> move<00:01:55.799> away<00:01:56.070> it

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
everything and then as you move away it

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.520 
everything and then as you move away it
gets<00:01:56.399> less<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.700> less<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.930> an<00:01:58.049> IPS

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
gets less and less so this is an IPS

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.530 
gets less and less so this is an IPS
screen<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:59.490> an<00:01:59.610> extremely<00:02:00.119> great<00:02:00.680> ppi<00:02:01.680> so

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
screen with an extremely great ppi so

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.280 
screen with an extremely great ppi so
that<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.990> let's<00:02:04.530> look<00:02:04.710> at<00:02:04.979> some<00:02:05.909> photos<00:02:06.290> so

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
that is it let's look at some photos so

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.160 
that is it let's look at some photos so
if<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:08.399> remember<00:02:08.819> my<00:02:08.940> video<00:02:09.270> test<00:02:09.629> camera

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
if you remember my video test camera
