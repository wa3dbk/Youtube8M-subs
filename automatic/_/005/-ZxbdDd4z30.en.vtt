00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
that last video I did with the jet stove

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.500 
that last video I did with the jet stove
kind<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.129> turned<00:00:50.309> into<00:00:50.400> a<00:00:50.610> disappointment

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
kind of turned into a disappointment

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.490 
kind of turned into a disappointment
that<00:00:52.290> I<00:00:53.100> couldn't<00:00:53.940> get<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.149> boil<00:00:54.390> water<00:00:54.720> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that I couldn't get it to boil water to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.619 
that I couldn't get it to boil water to
save<00:00:55.710> my<00:00:55.920> life<00:00:56.159> it<00:00:56.489> took<00:00:56.729> too<00:00:56.940> much<00:00:57.120> fuel<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
save my life it took too much fuel and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.770 
save my life it took too much fuel and
too<00:00:57.809> long<00:00:58.019> so<00:00:58.729> I'm<00:00:59.729> moving<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.479> something

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
too long so I'm moving on to something

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.579 
too long so I'm moving on to something
else<00:01:01.019> going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.470> try<00:01:01.680> another<00:01:01.800> idea<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.589> that

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
else going to try another idea and that

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.740 
else going to try another idea and that
would<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:06.380> I've<00:01:07.380> got<00:01:07.440> this<00:01:07.770> monster<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.750> with

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
would be I've got this monster can with

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.080 
would be I've got this monster can with
a<00:01:09.840> nice<00:01:10.020> screw<00:01:10.440> on<00:01:10.619> lid<00:01:11.929> that<00:01:12.929> uh<00:01:13.610> I'm<00:01:14.610> thinking

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
a nice screw on lid that uh I'm thinking

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.440 
a nice screw on lid that uh I'm thinking
might<00:01:15.390> make<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:16.520> nice<00:01:17.780> homemade<00:01:18.780> Trangia<00:01:19.440> stove

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
might make a nice homemade Trangia stove

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.249 
might make a nice homemade Trangia stove
I've<00:01:21.450> been<00:01:21.630> watching<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> lot<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.140> YouTube

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
I've been watching a lot of YouTube

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.100 
I've been watching a lot of YouTube
videos<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:24.240> seems<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.780> one<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
videos and that seems to be one of the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.649 
videos and that seems to be one of the
better<00:01:25.289> ones<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> thought<00:01:27.149> I'd<00:01:27.270> take<00:01:27.479> this

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
better ones so I thought I'd take this

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.620 
better ones so I thought I'd take this
can<00:01:28.340> maybe<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:29.610> what<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.789> can<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.149> with<00:01:30.330> it

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
can maybe see what I can do with it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.270 
can maybe see what I can do with it
turn<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> into<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.920> transia<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:34.039> see<00:01:35.039> how<00:01:35.190> it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
turn it into a transia and see how it

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:46.070 
turn it into a transia and see how it
works

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.249 

okay<00:01:47.080> now<00:01:47.229> I've<00:01:47.350> got<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.619> three<00:01:47.860> parts<00:01:48.220> cut

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
okay now I've got the three parts cut

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:57.810 
okay now I've got the three parts cut
I'd<00:01:50.259> be<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.650> top<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:54.040> bottom<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.670> inner

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
I'd be the top the bottom and the inner

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.620 
I'd be the top the bottom and the inner
cylinder<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.009> inner<00:02:00.159> cylinder<00:02:00.640> will<00:02:01.360> fit

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
cylinder and the inner cylinder will fit

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:14.890 
cylinder and the inner cylinder will fit
right<00:02:02.440> up<00:02:02.560> inside<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:05.590> top

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.259 

not<00:02:15.900> mark<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.319> top<00:02:16.560> with<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.489> series<00:02:17.909> of<00:02:17.940> dots

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
not mark the top with a series of dots

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.059 
not mark the top with a series of dots
right<00:02:19.230> around<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.560> edge<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:21.920> I'm<00:02:22.920> going<00:02:23.040> to

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
right around the edge and I'm going to

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:35.340 
right around the edge and I'm going to
drill<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:23.610> 1/16<00:02:24.330> inch<00:02:25.280> drill<00:02:26.280> bit

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.590 

all<00:02:35.860> righty<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:36.550> here<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.880> is<00:02:37.000> this<00:02:37.270> is<00:02:37.330> the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
all righty so here it is this is the

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.460 
all righty so here it is this is the
finished<00:02:37.930> product<00:02:40.260> I've<00:02:41.260> taken<00:02:41.650> then<00:02:43.380> when<00:02:44.380> I

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
finished product I've taken then when I

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.800 
finished product I've taken then when I
assembled<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.100> put<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.400> b2<00:02:45.790> jb<00:02:46.270> weld<00:02:46.450> around

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
assembled it I put a b2 jb weld around

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.330 
assembled it I put a b2 jb weld around
the<00:02:46.900> bottom<00:02:47.230> here<00:02:48.210> I've<00:02:49.210> also<00:02:50.040> had<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.190> put

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
the bottom here I've also had to put

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.080 
the bottom here I've also had to put
another<00:02:51.520> sleeve<00:02:51.940> down<00:02:52.600> inside<00:02:53.670> because<00:02:54.670> the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
another sleeve down inside because the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.430 
another sleeve down inside because the
other<00:02:55.240> one<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.480> think<00:02:55.600> where<00:02:55.960> I<00:02:55.990> put<00:02:56.410> it

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
other one I think where I put it

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.860 
other one I think where I put it
together<00:02:56.620> had<00:02:57.100> too<00:02:57.280> many<00:02:57.370> holes<00:02:57.670> in<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.210> it

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
together had too many holes in it and it

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.200 
together had too many holes in it and it
was<00:02:59.020> just<00:02:59.050> allowing<00:02:59.530> the<00:03:00.460> alcohol<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.060> burn

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
was just allowing the alcohol to burn

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.680 
was just allowing the alcohol to burn
out<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.570> center<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.970> wasn't<00:03:03.970> igniting<00:03:04.570> the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
out the center and wasn't igniting the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.860 
out the center and wasn't igniting the
Jets<00:03:05.020> so<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.560> put<00:03:05.770> another<00:03:05.800> sleeve<00:03:06.460> inside<00:03:06.940> to

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
Jets so I put another sleeve inside to

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.020 
Jets so I put another sleeve inside to
cut<00:03:08.050> down<00:03:08.260> on<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.610> seems<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:09.940> be

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
cut down on that and it seems to be

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.750 
cut down on that and it seems to be
working<00:03:10.480> pretty<00:03:10.630> well<00:03:11.220> now<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.280> only<00:03:12.490> problem

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
working pretty well now the only problem

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.660 
working pretty well now the only problem
I'm<00:03:13.030> having<00:03:13.210> with<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.720> is<00:03:14.650> if<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.340> light<00:03:15.550> it

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
I'm having with it is if you light it

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.580 
I'm having with it is if you light it
from<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:15.940> top<00:03:16.740> it<00:03:17.740> takes<00:03:18.900> like<00:03:19.900> four<00:03:20.290> minutes

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
from the top it takes like four minutes

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.210 
from the top it takes like four minutes
to<00:03:20.950> prime<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:22.080> that's<00:03:23.080> way<00:03:23.350> too<00:03:23.380> long<00:03:23.800> that's

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
to prime and that's way too long that's

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.390 
to prime and that's way too long that's
burning<00:03:24.610> up<00:03:24.850> too<00:03:25.000> much<00:03:25.150> fuel<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:26.560> one<00:03:27.100> thing<00:03:27.310> I

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
burning up too much fuel so one thing I

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.280 
burning up too much fuel so one thing I
found<00:03:27.640> that<00:03:27.970> if<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.120> let<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.450> prime<00:03:28.780> for<00:03:29.110> about

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
found that if you let it prime for about

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.760 
found that if you let it prime for about
two<00:03:29.560> minutes<00:03:29.740> and<00:03:30.100> then<00:03:31.030> blow<00:03:31.360> on<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:32.050> helps

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
two minutes and then blow on it it helps

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.680 
two minutes and then blow on it it helps
ignite<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.280> Jets<00:03:34.860> it'll<00:03:35.860> also<00:03:36.190> prime<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:37.000> lot

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
ignite the Jets it'll also prime a lot

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.220 
ignite the Jets it'll also prime a lot
quicker<00:03:37.930> with<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:38.890> priming<00:03:39.370> pan<00:03:39.960> but<00:03:40.960> I'm<00:03:41.080> not

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
quicker with a priming pan but I'm not

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.010 
quicker with a priming pan but I'm not
real<00:03:41.470> big<00:03:41.620> on<00:03:41.770> priming<00:03:42.280> pans<00:03:42.550> so<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.330> was<00:03:43.840> kind

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
real big on priming pans so I was kind

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.920 
real big on priming pans so I was kind
of<00:03:44.080> hoping<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.470> get<00:03:44.590> around<00:03:44.980> that<00:03:45.390> so<00:03:46.390> let's

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
of hoping to get around that so let's

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.480 
of hoping to get around that so let's
fire<00:03:47.200> it<00:03:47.230> up<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:47.590> see<00:03:47.680> how<00:03:47.950> well<00:03:48.190> it<00:03:48.220> boils

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
fire it up and see how well it boils

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:57.620 
fire it up and see how well it boils
water<00:03:54.300> now<00:03:55.300> this<00:03:55.450> is<00:03:55.630> one<00:03:55.810> ounce<00:03:55.960> of<00:03:56.200> heat

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
water now this is one ounce of heat

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.760 
water now this is one ounce of heat
right<00:03:58.630> in<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.900> top<00:03:59.080> and<00:03:59.260> I<00:03:59.290> did<00:03:59.560> use

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
right in the top and I did use

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:06.650 
right in the top and I did use
insulation<00:04:00.550> on<00:04:00.700> this<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:02.620> act<00:04:02.710> as<00:04:02.950> a<00:04:02.980> wick<00:04:03.280> that

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.050 

works<00:04:07.660> really<00:04:07.900> good<00:04:08.310> soaks<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.460> heat<00:04:09.640> up<00:04:09.790> into

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
works really good soaks the heat up into

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:34.550 
works really good soaks the heat up into
the<00:04:10.180> outside<00:04:10.570> chamber

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.990 

okay<00:04:35.560> now<00:04:35.680> this<00:04:35.860> has<00:04:35.979> been<00:04:36.160> priming<00:04:36.490> for<00:04:36.669> about

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
okay now this has been priming for about

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.969 
okay now this has been priming for about
two<00:04:37.240> minutes<00:04:37.389> now<00:04:37.780> I'm<00:04:38.650> going<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.830> show<00:04:38.919> you

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
two minutes now I'm going to show you

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.530 
two minutes now I'm going to show you
what<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.220> mean<00:04:39.430> about<00:04:39.699> blowing<00:04:39.970> on<00:04:40.180> it<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.419> get

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
what I mean about blowing on it to get

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:58.560 
what I mean about blowing on it to get
it<00:04:40.660> to<00:04:40.750> light<00:04:56.669> see<00:04:57.669> this<00:04:57.820> is<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.060> problem<00:04:58.300> I'm

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
it to light see this is the problem I'm

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:10.050 
it to light see this is the problem I'm
having<00:04:58.780> with<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.260> Jets<00:04:59.530> lighting<00:05:08.880> but<00:05:09.880> once

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
having with the Jets lighting but once

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:26.969 
having with the Jets lighting but once
they<00:05:10.180> get<00:05:10.330> going<00:05:10.389> it<00:05:10.810> burns<00:05:11.080> great<00:05:25.979> there

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
they get going it burns great there

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:32.290 
they get going it burns great there
somebody<00:05:27.880> got<00:05:28.090> going<00:05:28.419> now

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.439 

okay<00:05:32.990> she's<00:05:33.229> going<00:05:33.440> now<00:05:33.770> that's<00:05:34.699> a<00:05:34.880> that's<00:05:35.300> a

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
okay she's going now that's a that's a

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.749 
okay she's going now that's a that's a
good<00:05:35.599> burner<00:05:35.900> right<00:05:36.169> there<00:05:37.509> and<00:05:38.509> we'll<00:05:39.380> boil

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
good burner right there and we'll boil

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.469 
good burner right there and we'll boil
two<00:05:40.759> cups<00:05:40.789> of<00:05:41.120> water

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
two cups of water

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.920 
two cups of water
I<00:05:42.580> don't<00:05:43.580> know<00:05:43.669> the<00:05:43.819> temperature<00:05:44.240> on<00:05:44.389> it<00:05:44.539> it

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
I don't know the temperature on it it

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.200 
I don't know the temperature on it it
just<00:05:45.259> felt<00:05:46.160> like<00:05:46.220> room<00:05:46.520> temperature<00:05:46.940> to<00:05:47.060> me

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
just felt like room temperature to me

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.140 
just felt like room temperature to me
and<00:05:48.139> the<00:05:49.039> other<00:05:49.190> tests<00:05:49.520> that<00:05:49.550> I<00:05:49.669> did<00:05:49.910> this

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
and the other tests that I did this

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.320 
and the other tests that I did this
boiled<00:05:50.750> in<00:05:51.020> between<00:05:51.729> six<00:05:52.729> and<00:05:52.880> a<00:05:52.910> half<00:05:52.940> to

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
boiled in between six and a half to

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:05.179 
boiled in between six and a half to
seven<00:05:53.720> minutes<00:05:54.520> more<00:05:55.520> or<00:05:55.729> less

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:05.189 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:07.829 

and<00:06:06.189> that's<00:06:06.819> what<00:06:07.029> the<00:06:07.119> flame<00:06:07.389> looks<00:06:07.629> like

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:07.839 
and that's what the flame looks like

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:22.250 
and that's what the flame looks like
lower

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.010 

so<00:06:22.890> we'll<00:06:23.010> let<00:06:23.130> that<00:06:23.190> run<00:06:23.660> come<00:06:24.660> back<00:06:24.810> in<00:06:24.960> a

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
so we'll let that run come back in a

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.269 
so we'll let that run come back in a
minute

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:30.279 

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:34.859 

okay<00:06:30.999> we<00:06:31.239> are<00:06:31.269> at<00:06:32.909> five<00:06:33.909> minutes<00:06:34.269> of<00:06:34.389> 55

00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:34.869 
okay we are at five minutes of 55

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:41.969 
okay we are at five minutes of 55
seconds<00:06:37.859> and<00:06:38.859> we<00:06:39.129> got<00:06:39.279> boil<00:06:40.349> so<00:06:41.349> that's<00:06:41.619> even

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
seconds and we got boil so that's even

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:43.679 
seconds and we got boil so that's even
better<00:06:42.159> time<00:06:42.399> than<00:06:42.579> I<00:06:42.699> originally<00:06:43.239> had<00:06:43.419> on<00:06:43.569> my

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:43.689 
better time than I originally had on my

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:53.609 
better time than I originally had on my
other<00:06:43.839> two<00:06:44.109> tests<00:06:47.429> so<00:06:48.429> that's<00:06:48.579> great<00:06:52.619> okay

00:06:53.609 --> 00:06:53.619 
other two tests so that's great okay

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:56.309 
other two tests so that's great okay
we're<00:06:53.769> coming<00:06:53.889> up<00:06:54.069> on<00:06:54.249> 13<00:06:54.849> minutes<00:06:55.269> of<00:06:55.479> total

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 
we're coming up on 13 minutes of total

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:59.159 
we're coming up on 13 minutes of total
burn<00:06:56.589> time<00:06:56.919> and<00:06:57.279> she<00:06:58.269> just<00:06:58.509> now<00:06:58.689> started<00:06:59.109> to

00:06:59.159 --> 00:06:59.169 
burn time and she just now started to

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.539 
burn time and she just now started to
die<00:06:59.349> down<00:07:01.379> the<00:07:02.379> other<00:07:02.529> two<00:07:02.739> tests<00:07:03.069> I<00:07:03.159> ran<00:07:03.189> on

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:03.549 
die down the other two tests I ran on

00:07:03.549 --> 00:07:06.509 
die down the other two tests I ran on
this<00:07:03.729> I<00:07:03.909> was<00:07:04.059> getting<00:07:04.329> 15<00:07:05.110> roughly<00:07:05.889> 15<00:07:06.309> minutes

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:06.519 
this I was getting 15 roughly 15 minutes

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:09.959 
this I was getting 15 roughly 15 minutes
total<00:07:07.029> burn<00:07:07.389> time<00:07:07.739> so<00:07:08.739> this<00:07:08.889> is<00:07:09.099> pretty<00:07:09.669> close

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:09.969 
total burn time so this is pretty close

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:17.219 
total burn time so this is pretty close
so<00:07:14.610> there<00:07:15.610> you<00:07:15.729> have<00:07:15.759> it<00:07:15.939> the<00:07:16.659> monster<00:07:17.049> can

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229 
so there you have it the monster can

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:21.029 
so there you have it the monster can
stove<00:07:17.619> I<00:07:18.449> like<00:07:19.449> it<00:07:19.659> I<00:07:19.809> think<00:07:20.529> a<00:07:20.619> few<00:07:20.799> things

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 
stove I like it I think a few things

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:22.499 
stove I like it I think a few things
could<00:07:21.219> be<00:07:21.339> tweaked<00:07:21.639> on<00:07:21.849> it<00:07:21.999> you<00:07:22.269> got<00:07:22.419> any

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:22.509 
could be tweaked on it you got any

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:25.249 
could be tweaked on it you got any
questions<00:07:22.989> or<00:07:23.079> comments

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:25.259 
questions or comments

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:29.219 
questions or comments
give<00:07:26.259> me<00:07:26.379> a<00:07:26.409> shout<00:07:26.679> and<00:07:27.779> maybe<00:07:28.779> you<00:07:28.929> could<00:07:29.049> have

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:29.229 
give me a shout and maybe you could have

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:31.169 
give me a shout and maybe you could have
some<00:07:29.379> recommendations<00:07:29.739> on<00:07:30.219> this<00:07:30.489> how<00:07:30.909> to<00:07:30.969> cut

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:31.179 
some recommendations on this how to cut

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:35.389 
some recommendations on this how to cut
down<00:07:31.209> to<00:07:31.479> prime<00:07:31.719> time<00:07:32.489> is<00:07:33.489> anyway<00:07:33.879> there<00:07:34.479> it<00:07:34.599> is

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:35.399 
down to prime time is anyway there it is

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:49.040 
down to prime time is anyway there it is
until<00:07:36.399> the<00:07:36.519> next<00:07:36.669> one<00:07:36.879> go<00:07:37.719> outside<00:07:38.049> and<00:07:38.229> play

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.050 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:55.559
