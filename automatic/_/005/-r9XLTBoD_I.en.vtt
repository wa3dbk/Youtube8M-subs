00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.789
 politicians that everyone knows the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.640

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.900

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.220
 received that they have received me very well 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.430
 because of the fact that they know him a lot 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.130
 to do or know how he is like him 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.840

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.949
 when you have this question that 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.040
 It has a political ideological issue 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.460
 formed from left is always 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.680
 difficult to touch these issues but does the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.370
 question and you have to answer not to 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.170
 the rounds and yes with the mayor 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.990

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.560
 kind of support has not supported us as 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.840
 as originally told us remember 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.600
 very good when we sit down 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.570
 with the mayor and the others 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.330

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.040

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.910
 Monica was I was my alternate 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.570
 We were all candidates for the 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.970
 4th district and Mauritius had promoted 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.570
 that meeting with the mayor knowing that 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.070
 the mayor is from country movement or he 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.979
 denominates as of movement country 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.590
 Mauricio promoted that meeting from 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.180
 from machachi and he told me wake you have 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.890
 to be present at that meeting that 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.570
 I'm going to have the mayor not good 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.300
 we approached we were 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.310
 were is red savior councilman 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.380
 it was good we were most of the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.000
 group of the work team of those who 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.510
 we went 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.850
 4 wherein the mayor told us good 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.010
 he says I will support us 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.290
 we are in power forever 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.240
 citizenship knows how he expresses himself 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.790
 you need to repeat the same words 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.770
 He told me he was going to support us here 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.680
 was the support he was going to give us 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.390
 even a car for the campaign that that 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.150
 do not worry about absolutely 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.190
 nothing that in cayambe we are that is 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.000
 country movement and what I was going to do is the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.040
 support was expected or expected a month passed 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.709
 I did not even answer the phone anymore 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.320
 one month exactly the mayor said 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.810
 how good we sit down to talk and that 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.500
 there is an agreement on what to do or not 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.910
 is thrown to the mayoral candidacy and 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.910
 we can be talking then it's 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.650
 true that support was conditioned but 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.390
 to be supportive but will support the 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.000
 candidacy of 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.209
 Mr. Mayor, if I am conditioned 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.640
 support unfortunately happened that was me 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.040
 conditions the support but also that 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.350
 tell the population a revolutionary 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.750
 one does not accept conditionings 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.120
 revolutionary can only do the 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.000
 campaign and in this case I have the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.270
 advantage that my dad is a politician 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.060
 known a with a proven politician of 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.610
 that had the support of fidelity to zero and not 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.989
 there was no need to make any agreement 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.480
 because if it had been someone else 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.700
 maybe another young woman who had 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.010
 approached in the same conditions and not 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.680
 has that strong strut as I do 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.110
 I accepted it I accepted it because because 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.670
 economic condition take advantage of that 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.489
 he has a good economic condition 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.040
 in my case it's not because of the fact I 'm good 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.110
 I said I wanted to have the support of the 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.560
 which is a country movement due to the fact 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.670
 that two years ago I live 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.890
 regardless of the country it would be a year 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.959
 eight months exactly I have tried to 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.519
 be independent of not living with the 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.360
 family whenever one graduates 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.180
 always think of living away from home and 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.220
 to start to develop then 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.720
 always my father has been waiting for 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.350
 us despite the fact that one day 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.820
 we live with him and I always wanted 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.720
 support him also as a person because the 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.630
 nomination to the candidacy was mine 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.930
 and I definitely do not thank you 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.270
 publicly I have done it in the house that 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.190
 of the children you always have to value what 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.380
 that a father does and in this case I 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.660
 I appreciate that he has possessed the 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.690
 political and economic strength to 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.700
 my campaign really a young as I said 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.940
 from the beginning it does not have the conditions 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.120
 economic conditions so as to cover a 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.250
 campaign like this if I really can 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.960
 thank my father that he has 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.240
 been the fundamental prop in what 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.890
 economic and politically and if there was the 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.430
 conditioning or conditioning 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:59.520
 of the mayor although one or the other 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.620
 way he can say that it has not been like this 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.490
 we had a conversation at the level of 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.800
 provincial bureau with the mayor in 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.300
 where this conditioning was ratified 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.370
 where this was talked about 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.760
 conditioning me in the campaign not 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.190
 I wanted to touch this topic but 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.550
 it is unfortunate that a person of that 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.650
 a call for the citizen revolution 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.360
 a person who is called the 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.880
 citizen revolution that is called 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.710
 country movement wants to condition you to 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.840
 a person who comes as quality by 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.180
 the fact that as he says is 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.610
 in the power to go is unfortunate for me 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.350
 it is unfortunate all have all 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.290
 knowledge in the national bureau in 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.620
 provincial bureau that this question has 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.870
 last and I really say we have 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.670
 we have how could you say the 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.000
 feature not that we 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.500
 Who are we really on the left? 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 we can accept that kind of 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.710
 conditions of that kind of 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.710
 blackmail if you do not accept it well
