00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.010 
mainly because I felt like I had to have
a<00:01:04.320> new<00:01:04.530> style<00:01:04.799> or<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.670> haven't<00:01:06.299> had<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.720> wear<00:01:06.869> my

a new style or I haven't had to wear my

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.539 
a new style or I haven't had to wear my
hair<00:01:07.229> down<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.979> haven't<00:01:08.310> I've

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
been worrying like this it's probably

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.380 
been worrying like this it's probably
the<00:01:10.080> main<00:01:10.229> reason<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.770> haven't<00:01:11.119> posted<00:01:12.119> a

trimmed was January and I noticed that

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:03.999 
trimmed was January and I noticed that
my<00:02:02.479> hair<00:02:02.959> is<00:02:02.990> starting<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.349> shed<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.590> little<00:02:03.799> bit

my hair is starting to shed a little bit

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.770

more<00:02:04.250> when<00:02:04.429> I<00:02:04.459> take<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.700> shower<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:05.569> think

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
more when I take a shower and I think

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.020 
more when I take a shower and I think
part<00:02:06.020> of<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.170> is<00:02:06.319> attributed<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.610> split

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
part of that is attributed to the split

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.339 
part of that is attributed to the split
ends<00:02:09.670> but<00:02:10.670> that's<00:02:11.599> about<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:11.959> that's<00:02:12.079> all<00:02:12.260> the
