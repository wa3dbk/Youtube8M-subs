00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.880
 so this is cherokee 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.790
 imagine the situation over 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.540
 the victorian london is circling a huge 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.839
 airship 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.699
 lady freedom at the helm of which 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.020
 is nobody else but the president of the united states 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.480
 Abraham Lincoln 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.180
 why did he come to britain ask 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.939
 you all very simply arrived to save 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.369
 from the alien threat is not England itself and 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.349
 the rest of the world with the help of a secret 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.350
 squad possessing the most modern 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.260
 steam technologies 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.860
 technology like the outset the comic does not 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.460
 so but no, this is just the beginning of the game 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.649
 k1m steam although I must pay tribute to myself 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.989
 the game is stylized like decay comics and 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.610
 here everything is done right everything 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.039
 remotely happening on screen 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.309
 reminds league outstanding gentlemen 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.219
 un amour too england 19th century same 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.899
 technologies are not even game characters too 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.750
 taken from various artistic 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.170
 literature and all this is presented to us 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.420
 as a turn-based tactical game 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.310
 gameplay which is also easier 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.830
 describe with references to other works 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.070
 in fact, it is a cross between 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.920
 xcom and beautiful and no less drawn 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.720
 valtery chronicles from 1 inherited 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.560
 alien threat and rudiments 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.250
 management 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.810
 and the second one is the core of the gameplay we 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.090
 and go in turns available to us 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.600
 characters here here are limited by the margin 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.590
 the pair that replaces progress points 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.619
 attack movement expend it 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.299
 differently which is logical but after 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.189
 the end of the phase begins 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.579
 the enemy which affect no way 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.490
 It is impossible in general scheme familiar to all 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.619
 lovers of tactical games and so 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.610
 way of protecting the arena behind the arena 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.680
 we do not need to move through the plot 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.229
 all sounds of course a little sad and about 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.719
 skolno but trust me the game carries 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.930
 no worse than a recent reissue 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.909
 old school xcom 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.759
 nintendo 3ds for sure 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.099
 a little zadolbala top rubber series 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.610
 fm damn it is generally a sip of fresh 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.890
 air in general 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.320
 if you like tactical games then you 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.950
 it's worth a try before 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.950
 new meetings
