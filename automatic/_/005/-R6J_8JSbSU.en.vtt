00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.139
 very good to all boys that such 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.840
 you are about to say good and good in this 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.090
 next 90 round video was already my 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.970
 personal record of this map had already 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.849
 tight I did not even want to 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.340
 I had not even thought about getting to 90 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.680
 this was live uploaded in tweets 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.210
 lately something quite direct in 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.280
 tweets although good the truth is that 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.289
 well 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.019
 I decided I did not feel like leaving the 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:44.420
 heading the game not the console 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.300
 lit all night long neither 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.070
 I wanted to continue playing was much more 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.829
 and a little bit to the knees and 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.129
 I decided that when I started 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.949
 the round 90 had 10 bullets only 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.780
 is the disc and dif and heat and good 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.720
 I say I'm going to play it if it gives me ammunition 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.260
 Well, if you do not give it to me 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.670
 I'll kill myself the truth I did not have 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.990
 more eager to continue playing with a map 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.850
 pretty fast at the time of uploading 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.650
 they were around that good in this area either 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.470
 is that it's so fast if we put on 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.850
 in the restaurant area is very much 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.400
 faster but good 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.439
 we have the risk of also falling more than 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.909
 that we play more to not have 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.830
 since they are giving us touches 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.710
 while we collect the zombies and we 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.930
 so put red game more times I had 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.299
 pretty lucky in this game that 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.460
 the trial 1 meter then there are also three 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.110
 times and three times then once 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.539
 can reanimate with the judge the others 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.759
 two and it dries here here you have a rescue 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.130
 hold the 45 seconds that lasts 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.920
 course 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.520
 gathering for the zombies and humans 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:57.360
 taking us to an area so that I do not 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.720
 they will kill and little more I believe kids 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.540
 changing the subject because I do not know how I'm going 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.720
 to do 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.700
 if I'm going to make a good video almost 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.680
 I always do direct I'll do a mini video 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.930
 and I'll put it public then when I go to 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.620
 be direct in clicks are not always going to 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.620
 make zombie 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.970
 howard because the truth is quite 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:25.810
 saturation this last day 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:29.410
 has taken a map I will travel a 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.670
 a brief opinion of the new map this 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.030
 last they have taken although the truth 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.560
 It has let me go a lot but good 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.330
 a video like that of my opinion what has 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.670
 similar to me 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.830
 and although we still do not know or not 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.420
 It has gone to play but well I'm going to 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.550
 give my opinion of what I found 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.100
 to me and the truth is that you have not 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.800
 seen or play it much but to record 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.800
 anything specific and little more 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.280
 also thank you all we are 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.740
 two thousand followers on twitter and the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.710
 true many thanks 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.900
 today he touched I got into the had 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.860
 a few pretty questions are we going to 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.170
 be almost all remembering me I think 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.450
 for the simple reason that I have 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.430
 borrowed the twitter surely and good 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.370
 lately do not forget much that still 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.680
 live 2.0 and good what I was thinking 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.660
 it was for the special because I do not know if nine 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.030
 thousand or ten thousand annually is close 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.970
 of 10,000 well enough is left for me 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.590
 it's still pretty but hey I wanted to 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.150
 you can only make a video as well 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.340
 Frequently asked questions gallery 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.080
 because I see that there are many new 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.990
 and they almost always ask me the 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.770
 same as if from where you are coming 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:44.319
 that if you add play does not add then it happens 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.420
 thing 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.709
 you can do them in a video I'll put 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.730
 that video then in all the 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:55.400
 descriptions so that more or less 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.829
 what is clear is the video makes 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.980
 all the questions that are here, you see 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:03.409
 in the end the truth approaches 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.150
 I had nothing else to do if you can not 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.280
 over the years I knew that I did not 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.650
 I was going to pass the granda nor could I help 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.629
 you're going to throw the box to the truth 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.299
 of fronda because it is a suicide and less 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.010
 still does not have the monkeys because if more 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.840
 I would have had them then 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.739
 I had managed to save here I 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.460
 I got out with judgment and turn to 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.870
 throw 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.030
 for the first elevator let's see what 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.800
 so good I make a plug 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.910
 zombies here I think they gave me a 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.919
 touch if I'm not wrong and then little more 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.510
 I hope you like it 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.930
 as always there is a favorite if you like 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.930
 the video 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.410
