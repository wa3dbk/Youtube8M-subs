00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 well let's see in this video tutorial 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.460
 basic things that sometimes escape us 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.070
 and it's good to comment first on 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.660
 the notification bar we know that 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.670
 there is a series of cones what always 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.470
 they appear but good of that country that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.950
 we have here on the left another series 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.860
 of icons 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.600
 to the right also 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.210
 one of them for example that is the wifi 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.310
 when we activate we know that it is activated 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.510
 the wifi but if we are outside in a bar 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.940
 or a local or if we have to go to good 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.100
 configuration settings to see them wifi 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.920
 that reach we have a need already 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.470
 is here that directly takes us 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.559
 what is wifi is that we have to 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.870
 reach even sometimes also a sun 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.030
 of the brightness when I have low battery 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.200
 it will be below so that they last me until 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.970
 when I get home to load it 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.970
 then for example the subject d 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.920
 of the keyboard 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.019
 I remember that before 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.090
 to do what is factory reset 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.530
 when I recorded the video tutorial I had to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.200
 the left you have it now 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.299
 you are an icon that was in the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.020
 real Chinese pulsed without wanting that 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.020
 I put myself in Chile 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:24.300
 this time I respected it configure it 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.700
 in language and input configuration 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.330
 here in the language you logically chose 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.010
 the Spanish 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.840
 and then where do you put keyboard 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:38.159
 predetermined the same the espanyol 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.119
 even 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.119
 even to use 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.820
 even when you click here on what is 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:51.680
 the space bar for being the menu 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.830
 to select it from the Spanish language 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.510
 estimated for example the issue of 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.360
 managers or closing applications 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.150
 you know there are programs where he manages 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.580
 applications that are open I 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.649
 I'm using the launcher's own 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.629
 sometimes I for example if I open the 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.650
 let's go to them if I open for example the 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.650
 play story 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.840
 and I 'm going for example in the tab 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.830
 games 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.470
 and I'm going good because the first of nba 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.720
 we know that if we give the home button 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.290
 it does not return us to the main screen 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.490
 but if you look if we go to the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.940
 application 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.440
 It is open where we leave it good 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.800
 then what I usually do is click 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.410
 the button down here centrally I get 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.620
 open applications I take the one from 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.069
 play stories pulse and I tell you to eliminate 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.790
 the list 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.760
 then if you look and so I open it 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.340
 and I'm going to the story again 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.810
 I'm not in the game of the nba since 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.510
 the application has been closed 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.650
 then another detail for example here in 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.110
 the first tab I remember that in 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.610
 configuration access card 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.459
 state of the card sorry 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.880
 had a series like of icons here in 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.989
 Chinese good that country and if you click here 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.170
 you can edit the name of the card 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.390
 without you can call without one our 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.680
 operator etcetera and then even 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.480
 we can insert here 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.319
 what is he 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.370
 the telephone number 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.370
 in principle that
