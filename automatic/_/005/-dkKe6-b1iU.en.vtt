this<00:00:04.380> is<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:05.990> model<00:00:06.990> of<00:00:07.820> an<00:00:08.820> e<00:00:09.059> 100<00:00:09.690> EA<00:00:10.620> passer

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
this is the model of an e 100 EA passer

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:20.470 
this is the model of an e 100 EA passer
with<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.400> enormous<00:00:16.010> 170<00:00:17.010> millimeter<00:00:17.400> gun

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.170 

gigantic<00:00:21.480> glassy<00:00:21.990> plate<00:00:25.939> probably<00:00:26.939> back<00:00:27.150> in

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
gigantic glassy plate probably back in

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.950 
gigantic glassy plate probably back in
the<00:00:27.420> day<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.869> was<00:00:28.609> um<00:00:32.000> 165<00:00:33.000> millimeter<00:00:33.480> plate

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
the day it was um 165 millimeter plate

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.000 
the day it was um 165 millimeter plate
see<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> suture<00:00:34.950> points<00:00:35.480> yeah<00:00:37.010> there's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
see the suture points yeah there's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.740 
see the suture points yeah there's
gigantic<00:00:38.820> tracks<00:00:39.920> as<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> side<00:00:41.629> is<00:00:42.629> a

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
gigantic tracks as the side is a

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.130 
gigantic tracks as the side is a
periscope<00:00:44.420> this<00:00:45.420> probably<00:00:45.629> commanders

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
periscope this probably commanders

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.970 
periscope this probably commanders
cupola<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:47.539> some<00:00:48.950> sundry<00:00:50.030> hatches<00:00:51.800> for<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
cupola is some sundry hatches for the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.830 
cupola is some sundry hatches for the
other<00:00:53.129> crew<00:00:53.399> members<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.420> periscope

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
other crew members it's a periscope

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:05.149 
other crew members it's a periscope
there<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.080> derived<00:01:04.470> from<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.949> paper

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
there so this is derived from a paper

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.140 
there so this is derived from a paper
study<00:01:06.470> most<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> well<00:01:08.729> certainly<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
study most of it well certainly the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.380 
study most of it well certainly the
superstructure<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> gun<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:12.150> hull

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
superstructure of the gun and the hull

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.789 
superstructure of the gun and the hull
or<00:01:12.659> chassis<00:01:13.229> actually<00:01:14.100> existed<00:01:15.409> that<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
or chassis actually existed that the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.830 
or chassis actually existed that the
back<00:01:17.040> looks<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> yag<00:01:18.090> tiger<00:01:18.659> or

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
back looks just like a yag tiger or

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.080 
back looks just like a yag tiger or
tiger<00:01:22.369> get<00:01:23.369> close<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.939> there<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.960> airborne

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
tiger get close up there so airborne

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:35.149 
tiger get close up there so airborne
airborne<00:01:27.770> eat<00:01:28.770> 100<00:01:33.439> now<00:01:34.439> these<00:01:34.590> hatches<00:01:35.009> in

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
airborne eat 100 now these hatches in

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.999 
airborne eat 100 now these hatches in
the<00:01:35.220> back<00:01:35.430> they<00:01:35.729> actually<00:01:36.060> open<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.890> you're

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the back they actually open so you're

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.819 
the back they actually open so you're
going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.460> oh<00:01:38.869> I<00:01:39.869> got<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:42.590> that's<00:01:43.590> so

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
going to do that oh I got it that's so

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.300 
going to do that oh I got it that's so
cool<00:01:46.310> if<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.790> actually<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:49.159> don't<00:01:50.159> know

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
cool if we can actually see I don't know

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.429 
cool if we can actually see I don't know
if<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.490> breach<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.939> visible<00:01:51.450> something<00:01:52.320> in

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
if a breach is visible something in

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.710 
if a breach is visible something in
there<00:01:52.619> that's<00:01:53.130> visible<00:01:53.549> oh<00:01:54.710> well
