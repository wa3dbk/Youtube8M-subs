00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.500
 hello everyone 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.600
 and before you the most expensive and probably 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.090
 the most desirable premium tank in the game 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.340
 left let's try to figure out what 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.100
 we will get by giving 12 and a half thousand 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.720
 gold coins and traditionally we begin with 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.239
 t x 1650 kpb almost 90 tons of weight and 400 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.489
 meters of the survey there is nothing to complain about but 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.920
 review, most t 8 and all can 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.530
 just envy the dynamics at mass 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.870
 a tank of 90 tons is not worth waiting with 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.330
 exact mobility therefore the maximum speed in 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.460
 35 kilometers per hour secured 800 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.440
 strong engine maybach i think 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.659
 quite acceptable power density 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.540
 almost nine horses per ton and speed 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.760
 turning on the spot of 24 degrees per second and 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.250
 now for what's actually left and 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.409
 bought it a hundred and five millimeter 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.659
 gun possessing chic and breaking 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.310
 great accuracy but on this 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.740
 the advantages of this instrument are not 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.810
 end in addition to breaking through and accuracy 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.750
 we have quite fit for theta 8 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.640
 alpha in 320 units and most importantly 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.920
 veins which is a duet with a strong tower 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.410
 let us work wonders on the battlefield 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.280
 every shot of silver is worth a thousand 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.950
 thirty coins 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.660
 About gold 4000 but use gold 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.550
 only very extreme 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.100
 when you punch 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.770
 no depends on the outcome of the battle armor 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.810
 forehead hull and turret 120 millimeters in 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.540
 we have 100 boards in the stern and in all 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.670
 the rest of the projections of the tower except the forehead 80 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.070
 there are also caterpillars which is not bad 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.530
 eating damage I would not say that Lego 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.420
 has fantastic armor but if 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.850
 you know how to use it inexperienced 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.860
 the enemy will be very problematic 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.050
 punch you equipment I would put 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.480
 the next is the ram stabilizer and 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.340
 ventilation perks necessary crew 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.409
 lions are on your screen and i 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.250
 I propose to go to the viewing battle 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.250
 go 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.760
 for a start a little bit of history and history 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.750
 it is sad for the left and war 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.110
 he didn't have a chance 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.360
 the development of this tank began in 1941 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.770
 Krupp in the process of creating 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.540
 lion planned to use 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.760
 modified royal highway 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.420
 tiger and as a weapon one of three 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.970
 Options 150 128 and 105 graph paper 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.070
 however, in March 42, it was accepted 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.720
 the decision to develop a heavier 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.880
 tank and working on the left were 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.440
 frozen at the drawing stage and one 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.440
 rough wood layout 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.340
 only cool farm depends first 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.620
 turn from the player and if manages 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.640
 tank player understands that he is provided 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.780
 highest income for a good fight 60 70 80 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.030
 thousand silver 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.400
 but if you wake up strike then not 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.300
 be surprised out of the battlefield 150 thousand 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.300
 silver and more 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.340
 buying a premium tank you should know 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.800
 what do you need it for 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.810
 if you want to be fun then you are exactly 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.270
 does not fit because there is no fan in it 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.920
 nothing is a good breakthrough which 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.730
 actually provides a high 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.680
 yield 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.260
 After all, not everyone is straight in the game 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.360
 stable punch take at least apt-5 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.150
 there hit the ninth level battles this 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.070
 already tragedy olive not being preferential 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.190
 feels more or less confident in 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.830
 battles 9 10 level but still its own spoon 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.410
 fly there and not even one of the first he 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.270
 dear secondly slow your armor 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.950
 will be a barrier to tanks until 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.960
 seventh level inclusive 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.130
 and the tank is quite exposed 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.130
 fire and fire 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.300
 as for the tactics of the game, then the king is left 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.100
 in the city there is often no need to drive 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.350
 far from the base and in which case 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.910
 with a top speed and at 35 kilometers per hour we 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.220
 we will have time to return to shoot down 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.870
 also our allies are at home 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.660
 from which you can play through the tracks 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.520
 in the open we are very light and 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.600
 tasty target for the arts so climb 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.000
 forward we can not 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.680
 our role is a sniper or there the second third 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.930
 lines being in the top you can still 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.150
 show arrogance but getting to the tens 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.889
 be invisible bite and from afar 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.380
 and do not attract attention 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.599
 playing relief will help you near the vein and 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.280
 a large gun mask which is essentially 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.440
 the only really strong 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.620
 place of our tank when choosing a position 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.120
 need to pay attention to two aspects 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.130
 position should cover you as much as possible 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.270
 from the arts and allows enemy tanks to see 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.270
 just your gun mask 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.980
 When buying, you should be aware that 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.710
 take a tank that requires from you 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.510
 patience and slowness at the beginning 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.310
 almost every fight you have to 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.410
 pay considerable attention to choosing 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.900
 directions to be able to weigh with stages 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.360
 your and enemy teams and anticipate 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.430
 where will your presence be needed and then 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.919
 wait patiently for the enemy to appear 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.900
 sight if you're ready for this then the lion 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.760
 will delight you with accurate shots and 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.840
 large numbers of loans after the battle 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.820
 statistics 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.340
 if not, try better 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.560
 fan and forgiving mistakes of 6 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.570
 Subscribe to this wot fan and 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.220
 reddl company and you were good 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.220
 see you in new videos
