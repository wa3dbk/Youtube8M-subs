00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
second thing you know not only being

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.690 
second thing you know not only being
able<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:51.439> embrace<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:52.100> but<00:01:52.310> also

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
able to embrace that but also

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.569 
able to embrace that but also
understanding<00:01:53.659> that<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:54.409> is<00:01:54.470> your<00:01:55.009> unique

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
understanding that that is your unique

understanding that that is your unique
place<00:01:56.090> in<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.619> kingdom<00:01:57.619> you<00:01:58.400> know<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.520> lot<00:01:58.729> of

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
place in the kingdom you know a lot of

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.249 
place in the kingdom you know a lot of
times<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.119> think<00:01:59.329> especially<00:01:59.479> for<00:01:59.750> creative

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
times I think especially for creative

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.420 
times I think especially for creative
people<00:02:00.409> because<00:02:00.770> we're<00:02:00.950> wired<00:02:01.159> a<00:02:01.340> little

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
people because we're wired a little

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.550 
people because we're wired a little
differently<00:02:01.610> we<00:02:02.600> get<00:02:02.810> into<00:02:02.990> this<00:02:03.079> idea<00:02:03.320> of

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
differently we get into this idea of

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.660 
differently we get into this idea of
thinking<00:02:03.680> that<00:02:03.920> we've<00:02:04.070> got<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:04.369> be<00:02:04.460> like

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
thinking that we've got to be like

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.550 
thinking that we've got to be like
somebody<00:02:04.939> else<00:02:05.299> or<00:02:05.479> do<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:05.780> this<00:02:05.899> way<00:02:06.140> or<00:02:06.320> do<00:02:06.470> it

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
somebody else or do it this way or do it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.740 
somebody else or do it this way or do it
that<00:02:06.740> way<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.670> think<00:02:07.909> frankly<00:02:08.329> that's<00:02:08.540> been

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
that way and I think frankly that's been

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.840 
that way and I think frankly that's been
a<00:02:08.780> lot<00:02:09.049> of<00:02:09.079> our<00:02:09.259> struggle<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:09.860> even<00:02:10.070> being<00:02:10.640> in

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
a lot of our struggle and even being in

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.449 
a lot of our struggle and even being in
the<00:02:10.880> church<00:02:11.239> because<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.709> church<00:02:12.739> many<00:02:13.190> times

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
the church because the church many times

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.550 
the church because the church many times
can<00:02:13.700> be<00:02:13.790> set<00:02:14.030> up<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.780> say<00:02:14.959> hey<00:02:15.110> follow<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
can be set up to to say hey follow the

can be set up to to say hey follow the
rules<00:02:15.739> keep<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.130> in<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.310> lines<00:02:16.519> don't<00:02:16.850> make

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
bit more understanding maybe seeking

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.149 
bit more understanding maybe seeking
first<00:02:56.969> the<00:02:57.090> kingdom<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.959> not<00:02:58.290> about<00:02:58.680> seeking

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
first the kingdom is not about seeking

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.240 
first the kingdom is not about seeking
this<00:02:59.340> vague<00:02:59.819> religious<00:03:00.510> ideals<00:03:01.349> or<00:03:01.680> going<00:03:02.159> to

worship more or just trying to do the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.800 
worship more or just trying to do the
religious<00:03:08.040> thing<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:09.000> jesus<00:03:09.389> said<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.599> the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
religious thing but jesus said that the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.259 
religious thing but jesus said that the
kingdom<00:03:10.049> of<00:03:10.230> God<00:03:10.439> lives<00:03:10.829> inside<00:03:11.639> of<00:03:11.849> us<00:03:11.969> that

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
kingdom of God lives inside of us that

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.539 
kingdom of God lives inside of us that
means<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.199> when<00:03:13.439> the<00:03:13.530> kingdom<00:03:13.919> comes<00:03:14.069> out<00:03:14.370> of

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
means that when the kingdom comes out of

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.490 
means that when the kingdom comes out of
you<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.939> going<00:03:15.329> to<00:03:15.389> be<00:03:15.569> expressed<00:03:16.139> differently

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
you is going to be expressed differently

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.220 
you is going to be expressed differently
than<00:03:17.129> when<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.430> comes<00:03:17.639> out<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.879> me<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.599> so<00:03:19.109> when

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
than when it comes out of me and so when

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.020 
than when it comes out of me and so when
I<00:03:19.260> think<00:03:19.319> when<00:03:19.859> Jesus<00:03:20.189> is<00:03:20.280> talking<00:03:20.400> about<00:03:20.609> seek

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
I think when Jesus is talking about seek

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.300
