00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
how I do my bliss curl um so in and

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.070 
how I do my bliss curl um so in and
micro<00:00:19.770> step

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
micro step

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.189 
micro step
this<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.259> the<00:00:22.380> best<00:00:22.590> curl<00:00:22.920> pact<00:00:23.310> I'm<00:00:23.849> using<00:00:24.390> p1b

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
this is the best curl pact I'm using p1b

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.150 
this is the best curl pact I'm using p1b
30<00:00:25.769> as<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.490> color<00:00:27.199> it<00:00:28.199> comes<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.679> two<00:00:28.830> sections

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
30 as a color it comes in two sections

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.069 
30 as a color it comes in two sections
like<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.570> more<00:00:30.810> than<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.199> looks

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
like this it's more than it looks

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.330 
like this it's more than it looks

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the Bliss curl by equal three strips

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.290 
the Bliss curl by equal three strips
also<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.680> burn<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.100> my<00:00:59.400> half<00:00:59.610> week<00:00:59.880> that<00:01:00.150> I've

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.759 
also the burn of my half week that I've
showed<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.110> in<00:01:01.200> my<00:01:01.320> other<00:01:01.440> video<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
showed you in my other video if it

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.429 
showed you in my other video if it
uploads<00:01:04.769> properly<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.720> yeah<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.320> is

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
uploads properly and so yeah this is

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.880 
uploads properly and so yeah this is
equal<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.190> curl<00:01:08.610> weave<00:01:08.940> so<00:01:09.480> check<00:01:10.350> back<00:01:10.590> on

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
equal this curl weave so check back on

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.530 
equal this curl weave so check back on
part<00:01:11.310> two<00:01:11.870> when<00:01:12.870> I'm<00:01:12.990> halfway<00:01:13.200> through<00:01:14.540> I'm

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
part two when I'm halfway through I'm

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.020 
part two when I'm halfway through I'm
doing<00:01:15.950> so<00:01:16.950> far<00:01:17.280> um<00:01:17.840> as<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.370> move<00:01:20.880> in

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
doing so far um as you can see I move in

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.310 
doing so far um as you can see I move in
a<00:01:21.120> circular<00:01:21.360> motion<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.440> I<00:01:23.659> did<00:01:24.659> my<00:01:24.840> edges

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
a circular motion so I did my edges

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.640 
a circular motion so I did my edges
around<00:01:27.980> as<00:01:28.980> you<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:29.870> I've<00:01:30.870> done<00:01:30.930> my<00:01:31.230> edges

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
around as you can see I've done my edges

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.610 
around as you can see I've done my edges
and<00:01:31.800> down<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.400> my<00:01:32.460> way<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> front<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> bit

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
and down on my way to the front so I bit

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:47.110 
and down on my way to the front so I bit
my<00:01:34.890> circle<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.400> break<00:01:36.560> after<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.920> did<00:01:38.250> my<00:01:38.280> edges

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:55.550 

so<00:01:48.770> cuz<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.950> don't<00:01:50.190> look<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.490> way<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:54.560> so

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
so cuz that don't look that way so so

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.590 
so cuz that don't look that way so so
basically<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.280> simple<00:01:56.760> process<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.420> all

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
basically the simple process is all

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.050 
basically the simple process is all
about<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.590> type<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:59.010> hair<00:01:59.190> you<00:01:59.220> buy<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.880> how

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
about the type of hair you buy and how

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.930 
about the type of hair you buy and how
you<00:02:00.119> style<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.900> okay<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.010> not<00:02:02.190> about<00:02:02.250> you

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
you style it okay it's not about you

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.380 
you style it okay it's not about you
know<00:02:03.119> oh<00:02:04.190> how<00:02:05.190> you<00:02:05.250> do<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.210> just

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
know oh how you do you can do it just

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.990 
know oh how you do you can do it just
stuff<00:02:06.630> you're<00:02:06.810> not<00:02:06.900> to<00:02:07.020> pay<00:02:07.200> any<00:02:08.000> somewhere

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
stuff you're not to pay any somewhere

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.360 
stuff you're not to pay any somewhere
else<00:02:09.149> hair<00:02:09.840> Florida<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.379> pair<00:02:10.890> will<00:02:11.099> be<00:02:11.220> at

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
else hair Florida this pair will be at

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.050 
else hair Florida this pair will be at
least<00:02:11.549> easy<00:02:11.969> 100

and<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.510> can<00:02:13.660> just<00:02:13.780> do<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:13.990> yourself<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:14.620> with

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
and you can just do it yourself so with

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.059 
and you can just do it yourself so with
this<00:02:14.980> type<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.220> here<00:02:15.460> after<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.180> break<00:02:16.390> one<00:02:16.450> I

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
this type of here after I break one I

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.809 
this type of here after I break one I
bring<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.190> all<00:02:18.280> together

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
bring it all together

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.990 
bring it all together
so<00:02:19.480> farmers<00:02:19.720> crawl<00:02:20.200> right<00:02:20.350> here<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.850> hold

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
so farmers crawl right here just to hold

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.260 
so farmers crawl right here just to hold
it<00:02:22.240> so<00:02:23.230> when<00:02:23.319> it<00:02:23.440> falls<00:02:23.650> back<00:02:24.069> or<00:02:24.700> father<00:02:25.120> that

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270
