 an easter assistant a point on the timeline 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.209
 the moment that we live now it was still very good

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.419
 Nothing 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.419
 but a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second rises 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.679
 so it's normal 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:17.590

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.039
 past 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.400
 the series was now no gold 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.370

 so we are close to present 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.169
 at the moment the present is the product of the past 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.990

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.419
 past 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.419
 but the future under the stars everything is linked 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.300
 and the present it is the product of the past or the future 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.280
 not the product of the past and this figure as the proceeds of sale but the 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.099
 present it is by a moment of the future that is to say the moment 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.930
 for the future 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.910
 the past in the present before m - present to this seems not the future 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.490
