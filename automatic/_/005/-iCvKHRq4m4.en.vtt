be a third you know might be testament
knowledge<00:00:48.300> here<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.660> could<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:48.930> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
knowledge here but it could be in a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.139 
knowledge here but it could be in a
third<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.039> one<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.850> most<00:00:50.910> unique

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
third but this is one of the most unique

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.160 
third but this is one of the most unique
set<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.539> game<00:00:51.690> because<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.960> actually

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
set to the game because you actually

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.540 
set to the game because you actually
it's<00:00:52.410> an<00:00:52.469> empty<00:00:52.620> set<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.309> four

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
it's an empty set and you have four

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.100 
it's an empty set and you have four
receivers<00:00:53.789> split<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.600> side<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.050> then

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
receivers split to one side and then

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.540 
receivers split to one side and then
your<00:00:55.260> house<00:00:55.379> will<00:00:55.590> have<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> bunch<00:00:56.010> alignment

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
your house will have a bunch alignment

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.430 
your house will have a bunch alignment
so<00:00:56.699> when<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.690> think<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.320> do

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
so when you think of this you can do

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.319 
so when you think of this you can do
everything<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.010> kind<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.340> do<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.820> of<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
everything that you kind of do out of a

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.180 
everything that you kind of do out of a
bunch<00:01:00.690> formation<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.500> gun<00:01:01.680> bunch<00:01:01.890> single

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
bunch formation like gun bunch single

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.650 
bunch formation like gun bunch single
back<00:01:02.280> bunch<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.210> do<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.480> out

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
back bunch but then you can do it out

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.509 
back bunch but then you can do it out
with<00:01:04.199> an<00:01:04.320> extra<00:01:04.619> receiver<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.159> side<00:01:05.339> so

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
with an extra receiver on that side so

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.149 
with an extra receiver on that side so
it<00:01:05.580> doesn't<00:01:05.790> great<00:01:05.909> job<00:01:06.030> flooding<00:01:06.390> routes

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
it doesn't great job flooding routes

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.230 
it doesn't great job flooding routes
this<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.280> one<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.460> my<00:01:08.520> favorite<00:01:08.850> formations

kind of your four verticals play I like
to<00:01:21.720> flip<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.229> well<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:22.920> we've<00:01:23.280> left<00:01:23.490> to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
to flip it as well I like we've left to

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.660 
to flip it as well I like we've left to
right<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:24.259> this<00:01:25.259> play<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:26.070> gives<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
same type of you know think of vertical

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.219 
same type of you know think of vertical
Seattle<00:01:29.729> type<00:01:29.909> play<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.299> your<00:01:30.479> post<00:01:30.659> if

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
Seattle type play you have your post if

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.480 
Seattle type play you have your post if
the<00:01:31.380> two<00:01:31.530> wheels<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.070> left<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.400> a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the two wheels on the left you have a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.069 
the two wheels on the left you have a
streak<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> right<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.360> there's<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> lot<00:01:34.049> of

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
streak on the right so there's a lot of

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.200 
streak on the right so there's a lot of
things<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.530> verticals<00:01:35.400> will<00:01:35.520> do<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.150> a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
things that verticals will do you get a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.640 
things that verticals will do you get a
lot<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.390> success<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.990> play<00:01:37.200> beat<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> lot

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
lot of success with this play beat a lot

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.130 
lot of success with this play beat a lot
of<00:01:37.740> different<00:01:37.979> defenses<00:01:38.570> if<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.689> play<00:01:39.869> man

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
of different defenses if they play man

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.600 
of different defenses if they play man
if<00:01:40.409> they<00:01:40.470> play<00:01:40.650> zone<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:41.340> you're<00:01:41.490> right

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
if they play zone so if you're right

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.980 
if they play zone so if you're right
here<00:01:41.820> you're<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.060> zone<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.540> check<00:01:42.810> down

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
here you're in zone you can check down

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.200 
here you're in zone you can check down
to<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> drag<00:01:43.470> caught<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.890> upfield<00:01:44.250> make<00:01:45.030> some

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
to the drag caught it upfield make some

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.330 
to the drag caught it upfield make some
plays<00:01:45.439> we<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> verticals<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.189> user

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
plays we have the verticals for user

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.539 
plays we have the verticals for user
catching<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:47.939> pretty<00:01:48.420> flexible<00:01:49.549> obviously

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
catching so pretty flexible obviously

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.789 
catching so pretty flexible obviously
what<00:01:50.670> hurts<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.509> there's<00:01:52.079> no<00:01:52.229> run<00:01:52.560> I

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
what hurts it is is there's no run I

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.980 
what hurts it is is there's no run I
give<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.369> quarterback<00:01:53.700> draw<00:01:53.970> what<00:01:54.390> right<00:01:54.960> i

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
give a quarterback draw what right i

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.950 
give a quarterback draw what right i
will<00:01:55.200> say<00:01:55.590> that's<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.549> gun<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.719> one

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
will say that's really gun so one

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.719 
will say that's really gun so one
another<00:01:58.530> formation<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:59.100> liked<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.369> lot<00:01:59.520> last

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
another formation we liked a lot last

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.480 
another formation we liked a lot last
year<00:01:59.909> with<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.270> Minnesota<00:02:00.630> yeah<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.189> they

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
year with the Minnesota yeah and they

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.330 
year with the Minnesota yeah and they
have<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.759> motion<00:02:03.119> read<00:02:03.270> option<00:02:03.450> from<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.990> so

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
have the motion read option from that so

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.530 
have the motion read option from that so
if<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.610> kind<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.909> find<00:02:06.090> yourself<00:02:06.360> maybe

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
if you do kind of find yourself maybe

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.089 
if you do kind of find yourself maybe
like<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.960> bunch<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.200> quads<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.560> can<00:02:07.710> think

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
like it's a bunch of quads you can think

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.300 
like it's a bunch of quads you can think
about<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.550> or<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:09.569> quite

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
about that or is that not quite

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.570 
about that or is that not quite
name<00:02:10.429> um<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:11.569> that<00:02:11.630> run<00:02:11.959> knock<00:02:12.140> so<00:02:12.470> hard<00:02:13.099> now

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
name um is that run knock so hard now

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.100 
name um is that run knock so hard now
it's<00:02:13.610> pretty<00:02:13.910> good<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.720> difference<00:02:14.930> that

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
it's pretty good so the difference that

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.930 
it's pretty good so the difference that
you'd<00:02:15.290> see<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:15.830> don't<00:02:16.220> like<00:02:16.370> an<00:02:16.550> emotional

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
you'd see is I don't like an emotional

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.630 
you'd see is I don't like an emotional
guy<00:02:17.060> over<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.200> difference<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:18.590> see<00:02:18.620> is<00:02:19.130> this

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
guy over the difference you see is this

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.540 
guy over the difference you see is this
let's<00:02:20.569> pretend<00:02:20.930> Corliss<00:02:21.349> let's<00:02:22.160> pretend<00:02:22.459> that

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
let's pretend Corliss let's pretend that

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.500 
let's pretend Corliss let's pretend that
cop<00:02:22.819> is<00:02:23.060> in<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:23.989> bunch<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.760> Vikings

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
cop is in that bunch the the Vikings

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.180 
cop is in that bunch the the Vikings
formation<00:02:26.930> would<00:02:27.110> look<00:02:27.290> just<00:02:27.620> like<00:02:27.739> this<00:02:27.950> but

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
formation would look just like this but

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.890 
formation would look just like this but
Cobb<00:02:28.430> would<00:02:28.670> be<00:02:28.790> bunched<00:02:29.180> with<00:02:29.420> Adams<00:02:29.720> and

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
Cobb would be bunched with Adams and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.550 
Cobb would be bunched with Adams and
Boykin<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:31.610> it's<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.819> gun<00:02:31.970> empty<00:02:32.209> bunch<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:33.319> it

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
Boykin so it's a gun empty bunch so it

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.960 
Boykin so it's a gun empty bunch so it
twins<00:02:34.040> on<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.220> right<00:02:34.370> bunt<00:02:34.610> on<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.790> Left

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
twins on the right bunt on the Left

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.160 
twins on the right bunt on the Left
that's<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.330> it's<00:02:35.510> pretty<00:02:35.810> much<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.930> same

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
that's it it's pretty much the same

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.390 
that's it it's pretty much the same
you're<00:02:36.319> gonna<00:02:36.440> get<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.620> same<00:02:36.739> route<00:02:36.950> concepts

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
you're gonna get the same route concepts

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.430 
you're gonna get the same route concepts
but<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.239> does<00:02:38.360> have<00:02:38.569> that<00:02:38.720> motion<00:02:39.140> read<00:02:39.290> opt

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
but it does have that motion read opt

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.770 
but it does have that motion read opt
options<00:02:40.069> which<00:02:40.250> can<00:02:40.970> be<00:02:41.120> pretty<00:02:41.390> valuable<00:02:41.480> i

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
options which can be pretty valuable i

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.880 
options which can be pretty valuable i
think<00:02:41.989> it<00:02:42.050> was<00:02:42.110> better<00:02:42.260> last<00:02:42.470> year<00:02:42.739> i<00:02:42.860> think

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
think it was better last year i think

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.380 
think it was better last year i think
read<00:02:43.220> options<00:02:43.519> are<00:02:43.730> as<00:02:43.910> good<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:44.330> year

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
read options are as good this year

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.729 
read options are as good this year
they're<00:02:44.720> still<00:02:44.900> annoying<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.440> saw<00:02:45.560> have<00:02:45.650> to

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
they're still annoying you saw have to

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.039 
they're still annoying you saw have to
respect<00:02:46.040> them<00:02:46.190> but<00:02:46.519> you<00:02:47.450> seem<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.780> not<00:02:47.870> really

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
respect them but you seem to not really

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.809 
respect them but you seem to not really
be<00:02:48.170> able<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.530> pick<00:02:48.709> us<00:02:48.860> up<00:02:49.069> pick<00:02:49.489> up<00:02:49.610> as<00:02:49.730> many

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
be able to pick us up pick up as many

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.729 
be able to pick us up pick up as many
yards<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.269> year<00:02:50.330> with<00:02:50.630> them<00:02:50.780> indeed<00:02:51.500> indeed

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
yards this year with them indeed indeed

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.770 
yards this year with them indeed indeed
so<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.340> nice<00:02:52.610> formation<00:02:53.120> here<00:02:53.330> you<00:02:53.540> can<00:02:53.660> do<00:02:53.750> a

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
so a nice formation here you can do a

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.330 
so a nice formation here you can do a
lot<00:02:53.930> from<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.230> bunch<00:02:54.440> quads<00:02:54.680> not<00:02:55.010> something

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
lot from it bunch quads not something

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.949 
lot from it bunch quads not something
you're<00:02:55.549> going<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.760> see<00:02:55.970> everybody<00:02:56.569> running

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
you're going to see everybody running

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.870 
you're going to see everybody running
online<00:02:57.110> can<00:02:57.860> be<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.980> good<00:02:58.190> mix<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.580> throw<00:02:58.730> your
