00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.070 
and just log in and will say all this
the<00:05:00.800> same<00:05:01.010> thing<00:05:01.250> in<00:05:01.460> here<00:05:02.060> whenever<00:05:02.570> you<00:05:02.840> try

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
the same thing in here whenever you try

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.290 
the same thing in here whenever you try
to<00:05:03.110> join<00:05:03.380> an<00:05:03.500> earlier<00:05:03.979> server<00:05:04.280> whoever<00:05:04.940> didn't

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
to join an earlier server whoever didn't

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.529 
to join an earlier server whoever didn't
buy<00:05:05.419> it<00:05:05.479> it<00:05:05.780> would<00:05:05.960> probably<00:05:06.200> say<00:05:07.510> not<00:05:08.510> a

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
buy it it would probably say not a

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:09.969 
buy it it would probably say not a
Premium<00:05:08.840> Member<00:05:09.050> because<00:05:09.500> you<00:05:09.620> didn't<00:05:09.830> buy<00:05:09.919> it

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
Premium Member because you didn't buy it

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.870 
Premium Member because you didn't buy it
but<00:05:10.310> now<00:05:10.690> if<00:05:11.690> you're<00:05:12.530> hosting<00:05:13.070> you<00:05:13.460> can<00:05:13.669> just

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
but now if you're hosting you can just

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.810 
but now if you're hosting you can just
type<00:05:14.090> in<00:05:14.330> local<00:05:14.960> host<00:05:15.520> that's<00:05:16.520> 12<00:05:17.470> 7.0<00:05:18.470> 10.1

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
type in local host that's 12 7.0 10.1

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.100 
type in local host that's 12 7.0 10.1
correct<00:05:20.690> I<00:05:21.050> think<00:05:21.610> but<00:05:22.610> if<00:05:22.910> your<00:05:23.570> friend<00:05:23.930> is

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
correct I think but if your friend is

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.190 
correct I think but if your friend is
going<00:05:24.260> to<00:05:24.350> type<00:05:24.560> in<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:26.300> code<00:05:26.570> that<00:05:26.630> is<00:05:26.990> right

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
going to type in the code that is right

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.520 
going to type in the code that is right
here<00:05:27.740> this<00:05:28.550> code<00:05:28.850> right<00:05:28.880> here<00:05:29.090> and<00:05:29.420> then<00:05:29.690> I'll

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
here this code right here and then I'll

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.560 
here this code right here and then I'll
show<00:05:30.590> you<00:05:30.920> what<00:05:31.010> I<00:05:31.070> do<00:05:33.220> so<00:05:34.220> it's<00:05:34.850> either<00:05:34.970> you<00:05:35.420> do

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
that sorry about that I'm stupid I have

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.500 
that sorry about that I'm stupid I have
to<00:05:39.680> run<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:39.920> server<00:05:42.700> you<00:05:43.700> either<00:05:43.850> do<00:05:44.150> this

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
to run the server you either do this

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.290 
to run the server you either do this
code<00:05:46.600> this<00:05:47.600> is<00:05:47.780> what<00:05:47.960> your<00:05:48.080> friend<00:05:48.290> will<00:05:48.410> do

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
code this is what your friend will do

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.750 
code this is what your friend will do
this<00:05:50.300> is<00:05:50.540> survival<00:05:50.930> island<00:05:51.310> and<00:05:52.480> then<00:05:54.760> if

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
this is survival island and then if

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:02.650 
this is survival island and then if
you're<00:05:56.570> just<00:05:57.320> the<00:05:57.560> host<00:05:57.830> of<00:05:58.160> it<00:05:59.740> then<00:06:01.660> this

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
you're just the host of it then this

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.330 
you're just the host of it then this
also<00:06:02.930> works<00:06:03.520> so<00:06:04.520> it<00:06:04.700> doesn't<00:06:04.910> matter<00:06:06.340> that's

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
also works so it doesn't matter that's

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.370 
also works so it doesn't matter that's
