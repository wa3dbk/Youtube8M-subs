00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
past players and it was pretty tough

play<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.120> was<00:03:57.150> genuinely<00:03:57.720> really<00:03:58.680> really

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
play it was genuinely really really

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.850

difficult<00:03:59.730> but<00:04:00.090> I'm<00:04:00.420> gonna<00:04:00.630> be<00:04:00.810> honest<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:01.440> I

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
difficult but I'm gonna be honest and I

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.440 
difficult but I'm gonna be honest and I
do<00:04:01.980> think<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.490> team<00:04:02.700> is<00:04:02.730> decent<00:04:03.270> I<00:04:03.300> don't

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
do think the team is decent I don't

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.800 
do think the team is decent I don't
think<00:04:03.600> it's<00:04:03.690> bad<00:04:03.780> at<00:04:03.959> all<00:04:04.080> but<00:04:05.060> carbon<00:04:06.060> really

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
think it's bad at all but carbon really

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.870 
think it's bad at all but carbon really
really<00:04:07.500> does<00:04:07.709> Stroh<00:04:08.070> to<00:04:08.280> get<00:04:08.370> past<00:04:08.580> players

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
really does Stroh to get past players

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.360 
really does Stroh to get past players
and<00:04:09.209> they<00:04:10.200> don't<00:04:10.350> have<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.770> dribbling<00:04:11.190> that

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
and they don't have the dribbling that

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.010 
and they don't have the dribbling that
you<00:04:11.430> kind<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:11.790> used<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.090> with<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.810> more

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
you kind of used to with the more

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.370 
you kind of used to with the more
expensive<00:04:13.440> players<00:04:14.010> it's<00:04:14.670> weird<00:04:15.140> pavan<00:04:16.140> and

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
expensive players it's weird pavan and

Arizona didn't feel smooth they didn't
feel<00:04:19.530> very<00:04:19.890> like<00:04:20.220> fluid<00:04:20.820> in<00:04:20.940> there<00:04:21.090> dribbling

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
feel very like fluid in there dribbling

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.540 
feel very like fluid in there dribbling
I<00:04:21.570> felt<00:04:21.780> kind<00:04:21.960> of<00:04:21.989> statically<00:04:22.560> let's<00:04:23.190> stop<00:04:23.520> a

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
I felt kind of statically let's stop a

I felt kind of statically let's stop a
lot<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:23.970> a<00:04:24.120> bit<00:04:24.300> strange<00:04:24.600> carraro<00:04:25.350> was

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
lot is a bit strange carraro was

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.490 
lot is a bit strange carraro was
brilliant<00:04:25.979> again

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
brilliant again

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.250 
brilliant again
as<00:04:26.590> good<00:04:26.830> as<00:04:27.010> he<00:04:27.100> was<00:04:27.130> at<00:04:27.760> right<00:04:27.820> forward<00:04:28.690> the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
as good as he was at right forward the

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.550 
as good as he was at right forward the
left-back<00:04:29.950> was<00:04:30.640> actually<00:04:31.360> a<00:04:31.390> month<00:04:31.960> like<00:04:32.320> he

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
left-back was actually a month like he

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.130 
left-back was actually a month like he
was<00:04:32.680> so<00:04:32.920> good<00:04:33.250> at<00:04:33.430> stopping<00:04:34.000> even<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.870> really

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
was so good at stopping even the really

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.260 
was so good at stopping even the really
fast<00:04:35.770> wingers<00:04:36.310> Fellaini<00:04:36.610> was<00:04:36.850> really<00:04:37.120> good

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
fast wingers Fellaini was really good

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.590 
fast wingers Fellaini was really good
but<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.140> team<00:04:38.470> is<00:04:38.830> so<00:04:39.250> hard<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.700> pin<00:04:40.030> down<00:04:40.060> what

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
but the team is so hard to pin down what

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.900 
but the team is so hard to pin down what
you<00:04:40.750> needed<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.050> do<00:04:41.290> to<00:04:41.890> get<00:04:42.040> past<00:04:42.370> players<00:04:42.640> it

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
you needed to do to get past players it

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.450 
you needed to do to get past players it
was<00:04:43.180> genuinely<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:43.990> really<00:04:44.200> tough<00:04:44.920> team<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.220> use

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
was genuinely a really tough team to use

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.590 
was genuinely a really tough team to use
but<00:04:45.640> it's<00:04:45.760> interesting<00:04:46.090> it's<00:04:46.390> something<00:04:46.570> a

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
but it's interesting it's something a

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.540 
but it's interesting it's something a
little<00:04:46.690> bit<00:04:46.840> different<00:04:47.230> I<00:04:47.380> think<00:04:47.950> if<00:04:48.100> you<00:04:48.250> work

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
little bit different I think if you work

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.790 
little bit different I think if you work
with<00:04:48.580> it<00:04:49.090> and<00:04:49.270> maybe<00:04:49.900> build<00:04:50.200> up<00:04:50.320> play<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.560> little

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
with it and maybe build up play a little

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.340 
with it and maybe build up play a little
bit<00:04:51.010> more<00:04:51.130> than<00:04:51.280> I<00:04:51.400> did<00:04:51.910> it<00:04:52.120> might<00:04:52.780> be<00:04:52.990> a<00:04:53.020> fairly

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
bit more than I did it might be a fairly

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.460 
bit more than I did it might be a fairly
strong<00:04:53.590> team<00:04:53.860> i'm<00:04:54.010> giving<00:04:54.250> a<00:04:54.310> 7.5<00:04:55.150> out<00:04:55.540> of<00:04:55.900> 10<00:04:56.290> i

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
strong team i'm giving a 7.5 out of 10 i

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.860 
strong team i'm giving a 7.5 out of 10 i
really<00:04:56.920> did<00:04:57.100> kind<00:04:57.760> of<00:04:57.910> struggle<00:04:58.450> like<00:04:58.600> it's<00:04:58.780> a

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
really did kind of struggle like it's a

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.600 
really did kind of struggle like it's a
good<00:04:59.169> team<00:04:59.410> I<00:04:59.440> think<00:04:59.620> Arizona<00:05:00.040> and<00:05:00.340> have<00:05:00.490> one

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
good team I think Arizona and have one

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.450 
good team I think Arizona and have one
aren't<00:05:00.910> bad<00:05:01.150> but<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:02.740> need<00:05:02.980> to<00:05:03.160> come<00:05:03.340> up

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
aren't bad but you need to come up

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.430 
aren't bad but you need to come up
against<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:04.000> right<00:05:04.300> team<00:05:04.690> because<00:05:04.930> if

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
against the right team because if

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.860 
against the right team because if
they've<00:05:05.710> got<00:05:05.890> strong<00:05:06.400> or<00:05:06.700> very<00:05:06.760> quick<00:05:07.540> or<00:05:07.720> just

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
they've got strong or very quick or just

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.350 
they've got strong or very quick or just
generally<00:05:08.290> good<00:05:08.560> defenders<00:05:09.190> it's<00:05:09.820> going<00:05:10.330> to

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
generally good defenders it's going to

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.900 
generally good defenders it's going to
be<00:05:10.690> a<00:05:10.840> really<00:05:11.230> tough<00:05:11.650> time<00:05:12.220> at<00:05:12.430> least<00:05:12.490> in<00:05:12.730> my

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
be a really tough time at least in my

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.700 
be a really tough time at least in my
opinion<00:05:13.060> I<00:05:13.360> struggled<00:05:13.930> so<00:05:14.140> much<00:05:14.290> to<00:05:14.440> get<00:05:14.530> past

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
opinion I struggled so much to get past

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.080 
opinion I struggled so much to get past
