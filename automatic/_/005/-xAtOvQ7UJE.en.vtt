00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.360
 hello then the subject of the day how 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.490
 compare 2 way proteins so this is a 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.199
 little video that led the answer to 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.270
 questions that I often see as well 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.350
 on our forum that are facebook of 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.460
 people trying to compare two 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.470
 products and especially to compare 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.820
 the effectiveness of two different ways 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.949
 so first of all a nation does count 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.449
 that it is absolutely impossible for a 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.560
 no one can compare 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.160
 the effectiveness of two new 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.560
 different 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.149
 if we take for example someone who is going 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.710
 for a month to use an ear 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.380
 then the next month 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.430
 use another wei and who would have had 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 during the two months the same 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.640
 feeding the same supplements 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.260
 food the same workout has the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.149
 same rest there are so many others 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.910
 trick factors that will be anyway 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.550
 impossible to say whether the effects that have 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.199
 felt or not were due to 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.809
 one or other of his flock 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.219
 proteins and yet it does not come 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.739
 to say that all proteins are equal 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.510
 because there are still net 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.829
 differences in the big and the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.559
 fabrications or in the quality of 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.299
 products then the first difference is going 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.220
 to be the quality of the raw material 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.590
 it is to say the quality of the milk of 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.689
 many proteins are actually the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.000
 cheese protein that is to say that it 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.560
 uses milk from residues of 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.939
 the cheese industry 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.100
 so the problem with that is that if a 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.880
 relay that has cheaper but has already 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.330
 undergone many transformations 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.549
 chemicals to contain the cheese so 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.780
 there is going to be a lot of interest in having 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.640
 milk proteins ie the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.229
 protein that uses milk and not 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.150
 a residue of the cheese industry 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.350
 the benefit of third party proteins 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.939
 we are on a protein world 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.400
 and nature and so who will be better than they 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.840
 did not say your body then the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.579
 manufacturing processes can also 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.090
 can play a role if we take by 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.250
 example the case of the case cfmc of a 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.960
 way that is extracted that would avoid to 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.570
 cold without adding chemicals 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.700
 and the same way as for the residues 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.020
 cheese when we will add either 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.509
 heat is chemicals 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.610
 either the two in the milk for a 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.610
 protein extract we will degrade at 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.430
 green denaturing 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.840
 proteins then the processes of 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.190
 manufacturing and especially the standards of 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.910
 manufacturing will also have an impact 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.590
 important 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.630
 except that if you have a product that is 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.460
 gmp certified this is for the products 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.240
 American or a product that is 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.330
 h certified 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.710
 ac PC ce1 its European products 46 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.510
 that the factory that manufactured the product 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.610
 meets more manufacturing standards 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.320
 strict in the end so a product of 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.230
 better quality but we also have a 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.850
 better guarantee than the what is 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.350
 marked under the product label is 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.000
 actually in terms of doses to that 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.860
 you will find yourself in the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.180
 product 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.920
 finally we also have the concentration in 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.970
 proteins then a lot of people 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.020
 really care about this 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.239
 protein concentration 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.980
 yet it's not my sense the criterion 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.630
 principal simply because the 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.489
 most of the time when you have a way 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.770
 who is more concentrated in protein she 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.360
 is also more expensive so in the end the 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.520
 price per gram of protein passes against 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.180
 the most important therefore the concentration 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.070
 in proteins 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.989
 you must not have it as it 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.550
 just reading the label but he 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.709
 must especially water especially is always 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.940
 there to relate to the price of the 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.010
 product 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.840
 and then finally because the shakers in 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.709
 sometimes we are several times a day 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.480
 or at least several times a 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.470
 week have a product that has a good 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.970
 taste is a good mixture 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.620
 even though it's not at all a criterion for 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.940
 quality is really a criterion that 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.769
 can be interesting to help 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.940
 choose his product because for a 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.560
 product that is often discussed 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.680
 as much to please simply 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.280
 so in the end to know what is the 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.200
 best 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.570
 why protein and for you to try 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.400
 to compare two products try everything 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.720
 to simply find the products that 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.280
 match the criteria I have 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.140
 listed above ie if 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.340
 possible a dairy protein that 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.620
 meets quality standards 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.750
 and then there is a concentration in 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.890
 protein that is correct according to 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.150
 his price 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.530
 icing on the cake if you have a good 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.480
 taste is a good mix but that you 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.549
 have really found whey protein 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.230
 which suits you no I give an appointment 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.000
 you what is point org protein 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.160
 if you want more details about 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.450

 do not hesitate to make a thumbs in 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.040
 look on youtube it's always 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.660
