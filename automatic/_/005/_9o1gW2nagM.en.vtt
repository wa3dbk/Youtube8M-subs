00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.750
 Hello everyone I'm Keiko and good what 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.360
 are going to see below are the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.700
 fragments of a live that I wanted 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.590
 do two or three days ago but was 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.140
 be a failure because I came across a 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.810
 I'm typical of this game and I 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.590
 I started noticing a lot I started 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.000
 enable and hit things and stop 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.360
 record after you no longer can not 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.550
 continue how annoying I was then 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.489
 already the video was going to erase it but it 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.300
 I saw it and it was funny to hear me 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.800
 myself angry and all those things and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.839
 well that's also why I do not do 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.110
 likes because I when these happen 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.250
 situations I was bothered enough 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.640
 so then I do not know how much acceptance 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.530
 I could have that but good if you 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.380
 comes hoping that they like it and we 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.890
 we see in the next goodbye 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.890
 good 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.970
 I'm sure someone is going to come out 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.970
 here 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.530
 always in the herds 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.500
 like a time here there's more 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.840
 or this guy has realms xb through 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.670
 the walls half an hour before I already 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.720
 I was shooting 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.720
 really amazing 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.420
 and what comes 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.280
 They go three by three but good of something 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.780
 crazy to fix the part of this move is 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.960
 intense 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.930
 everything is fine we are in a good 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.270
 heading to see if we can go around 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.090
 to the marker 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.020
 and we're losing by 20 more points or 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.880
 less 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:54.030
 and we started with things of course yes 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.950
 there beautiful look at her look at her eyes 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.159
 killer came of course and in a 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.159
 corner 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.420
 so that only 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.149
 that is, someone who does not 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.450
 champion 15 seconds pray because change 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.500
 15 seconds nothing more no more and me everything 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.500
 explodes of course 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.160
 an entire loader to kill someone 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.600
 besides it can not be 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.600
 the greatest asset as 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:44.920
 a nation is a test of fagot 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.440
 what a little mother what a scoundrel 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.030
 it comes to me that I happen to find myself 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.709
 with someone like that I have to go kill him 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.709
 yes or if it stung me 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.060
 come with me to kill that neck 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.150
 we have already lost 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.230
 someone is going to come out in your mind 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.819
 all right
