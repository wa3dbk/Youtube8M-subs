00:00:05.489 --> 00:00:10.413
 When the Brain Scoop production team was preparing to spend a whole day shooting, a college grounds manager who found a wild bear skull in the woods became an uninvited guest. 

00:00:10.413 --> 00:00:15.747
 It's so old! - Yeah, I think so too. It is the oldest I have ever seen. Look at the molars. 

00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:19.541
 - Yeah. God. - Yeah, more than twenty years old. 

00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:25.880
 - These P2 (second small molars) are normal, I mean, there will be double crowns here, but it has almost completely worn to the roots. 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.043
 This... it smells bad. 

00:00:29.043 --> 00:00:31.136
 Well, it smells a bit bad. - It's a bit bad. 

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:34.460
 - Yeah, this is good. too crazy. 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.318
 This... this is a pathology lesson. - Yeah. 

00:00:37.318 --> 00:00:39.549
 - Look at that oversized tooth abscess! - That... the original teeth will be like this? 

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:42.948
 Is the bone rotten like this? Or is it that the teeth have been ground like this when he died? 

00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:47.112
 - Well, it looks a bit...well. - It seems that some areas of the bone are a bit protruding, like this place. 

00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:53.586
 - Compared with the other side, look at this, it’s all swollen, and this root takes up so much space. 

00:00:53.586 --> 00:01:00.006
 I can see that it has become bigger here, and there are swollen and proliferating bones here. - Ok. 

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:05.791
 - And you can see that this is an old injury, because he lost his teeth... they are all polished. 

00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:08.094
 - So what is the tooth that he lost when he was still alive? - Yeah, that's right. 

00:01:08.094 --> 00:01:11.127
 - This is so cool. - Yeah, not only that, it’s great. - Ok. 

00:01:11.127 --> 00:01:18.068
 - Yeah, this is definitely an old injury. This is crazy. Is it the broken tooth or the front of the mouth? 

00:01:18.068 --> 00:01:21.994
 - I don't know yeah. - I think that is probably just a broken tooth. 

00:01:21.994 --> 00:01:25.560
 - Ok, there is something broken here. Maybe. - too crazy. 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.475
 Did the lens be photographed? - Uh huh. 

00:01:29.335 --> 00:01:33.273
 - You see you, can you see it? The tooth on the other side is much more powerful... 

00:01:33.273 --> 00:01:35.286
 - You can pull it out, but it may be a bit stinky. 

00:01:35.286 --> 00:01:37.916
 - Yeah, I don't want to try it now. - I put him in the fridge for a few days. 

00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:46.635
 - looks great. Oh, this is crazy enough: the bone loss is also very serious here and it is still swollen... I guess this guy is really old. I mean, I can't be sure how old he is. 

00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:54.188
 - Yeah, that... I talked to the hunting supervisor. He took this to the person who knows the wild bear. Then he said that there is a way to know, that is to cut a tooth, and then he said there should be two Ten years old. 

00:01:54.188 --> 00:01:56.932
 He said that there should be twenty years old. - Yeah. I believe so. 

00:01:56.932 --> 00:02:04.934
 Because these swollen look like this, the crowns are polished. - Really cool, you can see that this is the time when he is still alive, not after death. 

00:02:04.934 --> 00:02:11.187
 - Oh, it's impossible. I mean this wear also happens here. This means that the teeth are worn out when he eats. 

00:02:11.187 --> 00:02:14.916
 - This is why wild bears will be angry. - That's why I think he is a grizzly bear. I mean, he is really big... his skeleton is big. 

00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:20.784
 Do you have a skull of a grizzly bear so that I can compare it? - There is wow, we have it. They are on the side of the museum, but... 31 00:02:22,076 --&gt; 00:02:26, ​​449 This guy is crazy. - Should I wash him before I take it to the beetle? 32 00:02:26, ​​449 --&gt; 00:02:29,922 - You know, I don't think it is necessary to put it in the insect box. - No need? 

00:02:29.922 --> 00:02:33.219
 - Because... no need. - But there are a few pieces of meat here, there is a little bit on the chin and there... 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:41.044
 - These are hydrogen peroxide drops for one night... in a 3% solution, and it can be done in the lab. 

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:45.791
 - All these tissues will be loosened when soaked in water and then we can peel off. - Yeah, there are some below. 

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:48.205
 - Thanks, Hank! - This is big. - It’s really big! 

00:02:48.205 --> 00:02:55.738
 - Yeah, this is big, it is a grizzly skull. - Look here, this is what I am guessing. That sagittal scorpion, I have seen it on the picture, it is much bigger on the head of the grizzly bear. 

00:02:55.738 --> 00:03:05.008
 - And from here you can be sure whether it is a grizzly or a black bear: Obviously this guy is a lot smaller, and the last molar should be at least 31 cm. 

00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:10.831
 - Is this the Montana Grizzly? - Yeah. This was collected by John and Frank Clay. 

00:03:10.831 --> 00:03:14.436
 - Clay Sea Brothers? - Clay, right. Collected in Yellowstone Park in the 1960s. 

00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:23.739
 - I guess it's probably... those guys are 700 pounds or more when they die. - Yeah. I mean, these guys are super heavy. Here is a whole tooth. Super big. 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.563
 - Then this guy... The rest is really not much. - Not much. His teeth are... I mean... - Yeah, he’s worn out and it’s almost gone. 

00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:36.487
 - The size is almost half. - God, that... it’s a big, scary animal. - This guy is really huge. But he is also very old. 

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:45.550
 - How big do they think the bear is? - I don't know yeah, um... it's big. As big as a big bear. 

00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:50.197
 But ah, that's still cool! - Definitely! - Really cool! 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.381
 Also, this will be posted to YouTube. 

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:07.000
 ...and brains stuck on it
