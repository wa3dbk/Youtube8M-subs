go<00:02:12.140> as<00:02:12.260> slow<00:02:12.440> as<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.590> can<00:02:12.730> practice<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.880> and

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
go as slow as you can practice that and

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.070 
go as slow as you can practice that and
once<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.270> get<00:02:14.360> used<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.840> then<00:02:14.990> we're

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
once you get used to that then we're

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.120 
once you get used to that then we're
going<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.260> move<00:02:15.380> on<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.650> next<00:02:15.830> one<00:02:15.950> it's

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
going to move on to the next one it's

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.560 
going to move on to the next one it's
still--it's<00:02:16.310> for<00:02:16.580> 132<00:02:16.970> but<00:02:17.330> what<00:02:17.420> you're

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
still--it's for 132 but what you're

doing<00:02:17.810> is<00:02:17.900> now<00:02:18.020> you're<00:02:18.200> playing<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.500> fourth

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
doing is now you're playing the fourth

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
doing is now you're playing the fourth

time

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.910 

then<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.180> third<00:02:25.360> in<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.510> second<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.709> it's<00:02:26.830> going

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
then the third in a second so it's going

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:37.640 
then the third in a second so it's going
to<00:02:26.980> sound<00:02:27.129> like<00:02:27.190> this

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
and you're gonna work on your speed on

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.080 
and you're gonna work on your speed on
that<00:02:39.670> too

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
that too

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.500 
that too
the<00:02:40.810> ghost<00:02:41.020> passage<00:02:41.380> can<00:02:41.560> go<00:02:42.310> slow<00:02:42.580> jam<00:02:42.910> once

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510

you're going to combine them it's going
to<00:02:46.270> sound<00:02:46.360> like<00:02:46.510> this

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.949

part of it and then the rest of it it's
just<00:03:13.530> going<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.829> be<00:03:13.920> filler<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:15.150> it's<00:03:15.269> going<00:03:15.390> to

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
just going to be filler so it's going to

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:35.640 
just going to be filler so it's going to
sound<00:03:15.599> more<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:16.019> this

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650
