00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
everything pops but the performance and

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.730 
everything pops but the performance and
the<00:04:44.669> frame<00:04:44.970> rate<00:04:45.210> is<00:04:45.390> definitely<00:04:45.930> below<00:04:46.320> where

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
the frame rate is definitely below where

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.250 
the frame rate is definitely below where
you<00:04:47.250> would<00:04:47.370> want<00:04:47.400> it<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:47.940> be<00:04:48.120> but<00:04:48.450> it's

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
you would want it to be but it's

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.659 
you would want it to be but it's
definitely<00:04:49.560> playable<00:04:50.190> you<00:04:50.340> can<00:04:50.460> see<00:04:50.550> how

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
definitely playable you can see how

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.550 
definitely playable you can see how
their<00:04:50.880> swing<00:04:51.090> across<00:04:51.330> it's<00:04:51.630> not<00:04:51.810> horrible

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
their swing across it's not horrible

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.820 
their swing across it's not horrible
it's<00:04:52.710> not<00:04:52.890> jittering<00:04:53.310> all<00:04:53.520> over<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:53.970> place

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
it's not jittering all over the place

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.350 
it's not jittering all over the place
you<00:04:55.830> know<00:04:55.860> but<00:04:56.580> you<00:04:56.700> can<00:04:56.850> definitely<00:04:57.030> see<00:04:57.330> the

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
you know but you can definitely see the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.310 
you know but you can definitely see the
frame<00:04:57.630> rate<00:04:57.810> isn't<00:04:57.990> stupid<00:04:58.890> high<00:04:59.340> and<00:05:00.290> again<00:05:01.290> I

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
frame rate isn't stupid high and again I

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.690 
frame rate isn't stupid high and again I
think<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.740> is<00:05:01.860> due<00:05:02.070> to<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.280> screen

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
think that is due to the screen

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.980 
think that is due to the screen
resolution<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.390> also<00:05:03.690> just<00:05:03.840> the

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
resolution and also just the

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.050 
resolution and also just the
optimization<00:05:04.680> of<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.890> game<00:05:05.100> more<00:05:06.000> than

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
optimization of the game more than

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:14.600 
optimization of the game more than
anything<00:05:06.450> actually<00:05:08.510> if<00:05:09.510> we<00:05:09.660> drop<00:05:09.990> here<00:05:13.610> good

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
anything actually if we drop here good

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.790 
anything actually if we drop here good
landing<00:05:14.790> let's<00:05:15.690> just<00:05:15.780> run<00:05:16.020> around<00:05:16.140> the<00:05:16.380> circle

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
landing let's just run around the circle

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.469 
landing let's just run around the circle
and<00:05:16.919> watch<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.400> backgrounds<00:05:18.030> you<00:05:18.090> can<00:05:18.180> see
