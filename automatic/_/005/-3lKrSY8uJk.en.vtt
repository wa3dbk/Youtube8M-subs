00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
we're gonna be looking at the halo to

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.359 
we're gonna be looking at the halo to
TARDIS<00:00:15.450> from<00:00:15.780> MacFarlane<00:00:16.470> he<00:00:16.650> came<00:00:16.859> out<00:00:17.100> in

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
TARDIS from MacFarlane he came out in

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.760 
TARDIS from MacFarlane he came out in
the<00:00:17.580> Halo<00:00:17.880> universe<00:00:17.910> line<00:00:18.630> because<00:00:19.470> they

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
the Halo universe line because they

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.970 
the Halo universe line because they
didn't<00:00:20.039> have<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.250> halo<00:00:20.430> two<00:00:20.670> line<00:00:20.880> obviously<00:00:21.060> I

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
didn't have a halo two line obviously I

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.200 
didn't have a halo two line obviously I
thought<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.010> reviewed<00:00:23.460> him<00:00:23.640> but<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.850> didn't<00:00:24.090> see

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
thought I reviewed him but I didn't see

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.390 
thought I reviewed him but I didn't see
it<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.359> my<00:00:24.510> list<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.650> started<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.130> review

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
it in my list and I started to review

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.580 
it in my list and I started to review
some<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.699> other<00:00:26.820> Halo<00:00:27.240> 3<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.109> Halo<00:00:28.289> 2

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
some of the other Halo 3 and Halo 2

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.710 
some of the other Halo 3 and Halo 2
figures<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.820> figured<00:00:30.240> what<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.390> heck<00:00:30.570> I'm

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
figures so I figured what the heck I'm

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.030 
figures so I figured what the heck I'm
gonna<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.080> again<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.619> case<00:00:31.679> anybody

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
gonna do it again just in case anybody

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.810 
gonna do it again just in case anybody
missed<00:00:32.250> it

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
missed it

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.729 
missed it
and<00:00:33.360> because<00:00:33.660> it's<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.870> really<00:00:34.050> sweet<00:00:34.290> figure

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
and because it's a really sweet figure

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.889 
and because it's a really sweet figure
so<00:00:34.980> here<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.520> he<00:00:35.850> stands<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:38.510> under<00:00:39.510> 7<00:00:39.840> inches

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
so here is he stands just under 7 inches

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.200 
so here is he stands just under 7 inches
tall<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.469> top<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.980> his<00:00:41.309> Mohawk<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.090> he's

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
tall to the top of his Mohawk so he's

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.450 
tall to the top of his Mohawk so he's
good<00:00:42.540> size<00:00:42.780> fits<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.680> line<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> rest<00:00:44.340> of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
good size fits in line with the rest of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.029 
good size fits in line with the rest of
the<00:00:44.579> brutes<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.180> he<00:00:45.690> really<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.230> probably<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the brutes and he really is probably the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.190 
the brutes and he really is probably the
best<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> brute<00:00:48.059> figures<00:00:48.450> at<00:00:48.690> least<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.050> my

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
best of the brute figures at least in my

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.170 
best of the brute figures at least in my
opinion<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:50.010> far<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.370> accessories<00:00:50.820> go<00:00:50.850> he

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
opinion as far as accessories go he

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.020 
opinion as far as accessories go he
comes<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.629> his<00:00:51.660> hammer<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:53.010> fist<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.610> are

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
you Katie however you pronounce that I

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.430 
you Katie however you pronounce that I
think<00:00:57.059> that's<00:00:57.120> how<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.420> spelled<00:00:57.510> anyway<00:00:58.020> it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
think that's how it's spelled anyway it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.959 
think that's how it's spelled anyway it
actually<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.890> pretty<00:00:59.039> good<00:00:59.280> mine's<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.699> little

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.060 
actually is pretty good mine's a little
warped<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.530> fix<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.859> with

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
warped but you can just fix that with

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.770 
warped but you can just fix that with
some<00:01:02.250> warm<00:01:02.460> water<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.359> look<00:01:03.510> at<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
some warm water but if you look at the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.479 
some warm water but if you look at the
sculpt<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> paint<00:01:04.739> work<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> head<00:01:05.339> of

the hammer it's really nicely done it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.469 
the hammer it's really nicely done it
looks<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.549> cool<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> nice<00:01:09.090> metallic

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
then the handle has some dry brushing on

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.910 
then the handle has some dry brushing on
it<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:11.970> well<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.510> separates<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.740> slide

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
his hands over the narrow end and then

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.560 
his hands over the narrow end and then
put<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> top<00:01:16.619> back<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.060> really<00:01:18.450> a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
put the top back on so it's really a

put the top back on so it's really a
nice<00:01:18.750> piece<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.619> almost<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.640> tall<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:20.850> he<00:01:21.119> is

bronze dish gold armor looks a lot like

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.059

the new arbiter armor from the four pack

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.570 
the new arbiter armor from the four pack
but<00:02:08.550> either<00:02:08.670> way<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.119> cool<00:02:09.450> his<00:02:09.989> little

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580

thing<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.830> separate<00:02:14.280> piece<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.850> won't

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
thing is a separate piece so it won't

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.360 
thing is a separate piece so it won't
impede<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.420> articulation<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.320> let's<00:02:17.280> go

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
impede the articulation and let's go

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.110 
impede the articulation and let's go
ahead<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.580> talk<00:02:17.670> about<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.910> articulation

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
ahead and talk about the articulation

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.230 
ahead and talk about the articulation
the<00:02:18.840> head<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.380> on<00:02:19.800> what<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.430> believe<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> ball

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
the head is on what I believe is a ball

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.240 
the head is on what I believe is a ball
peg<00:02:21.510> it's<00:02:21.840> hard<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.200> sell<00:02:22.440> tell<00:02:22.830> because<00:02:23.010> you

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
peg it's hard to sell tell because you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.340 
peg it's hard to sell tell because you
can't<00:02:23.460> really<00:02:23.610> see<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:24.000> there<00:02:24.210> at<00:02:24.330> all<00:02:24.450> but<00:02:25.050> it

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
can't really see in there at all but it

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.780 
can't really see in there at all but it
moves<00:02:25.590> around<00:02:25.710> like<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> ball<00:02:26.520> pegs

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
moves around like it's on a ball pegs

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.150 
moves around like it's on a ball pegs
you<00:02:26.910> can<00:02:27.030> cog<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.360> from<00:02:27.480> side<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.720> side<00:02:28.160> forward

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
you can cog it from side to side forward

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.980 
you can cog it from side to side forward
and<00:02:29.370> back<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.940> then<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.480> course<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.810> has<00:02:30.960> the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
and back and then of course it has the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.890 
and back and then of course it has the
swivel<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:31.740> enough<00:02:32.340> enough<00:02:33.030> range<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.570> motion

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
swivel so enough enough range of motion

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.050 
swivel so enough enough range of motion
due<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.830> hair<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.520> collar<00:02:35.730> around

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
due to the hair and the collar around

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.590 
due to the hair and the collar around
there<00:02:36.450> which<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:36.720> also<00:02:36.870> sculpted<00:02:37.380> really<00:02:37.680> well

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
there which is also sculpted really well

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.630 
there which is also sculpted really well
it's<00:02:39.600> pretty<00:02:39.750> limited<00:02:40.200> but<00:02:40.340> it's<00:02:41.340> going<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.520> be

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
it's pretty limited but it's going to be

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.600 
it's pretty limited but it's going to be
good<00:02:41.820> enough<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:43.140> shoulders<00:02:43.530> are<00:02:43.800> on<00:02:43.830> ball

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
good enough the shoulders are on ball

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.820 
good enough the shoulders are on ball
discs<00:02:45.090> ball<00:02:45.390> hinges<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:45.990> like<00:02:46.560> all<00:02:46.710> the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
discs ball hinges just like all the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.820 
discs ball hinges just like all the
other<00:02:46.980> brutes<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.640> halo<00:02:48.570> figures<00:02:48.960> so<00:02:49.590> full

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
other brutes and halo figures so full

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.220 
other brutes and halo figures so full
range<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.160> motion<00:02:50.310> there<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:51.120> course<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:52.020> fur

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
range of motion there of course the fur

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.690 
range of motion there of course the fur
does<00:02:52.470> stick<00:02:52.710> out<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.070> can't<00:02:53.280> get<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.430> arms

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
does stick out so you can't get the arms

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.090 
does stick out so you can't get the arms
straight<00:02:54.060> up<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.510> side<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.020> this<00:02:55.560> armor

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
straight up to the side and this armor

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.670 
straight up to the side and this armor
piece<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.580> in<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.820> way<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.330> lot<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:58.350> it's<00:02:58.500> pretty

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
piece is in the way a lot so it's pretty

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.220 
piece is in the way a lot so it's pretty
limited<00:02:59.070> on<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.370> side<00:02:59.690> but<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.900> can<00:03:00.930> still

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
limited on that side but you can still

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.010 
limited on that side but you can still
swing<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:01.980> around<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.520> it's<00:03:02.670> not<00:03:02.760> too<00:03:03.000> bad<00:03:03.030> the

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
swing it around so it's not too bad the

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.530 
swing it around so it's not too bad the
bicep<00:03:04.470> swivel<00:03:04.800> is<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:04.950> cut<00:03:05.250> joint<00:03:05.580> it's<00:03:06.120> not<00:03:06.360> the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
bicep swivel is a cut joint it's not the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.960 
bicep swivel is a cut joint it's not the
worst<00:03:06.840> because<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.770> stays<00:03:08.040> mostly<00:03:08.400> within

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
worst because it stays mostly within

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.230 
worst because it stays mostly within
that<00:03:09.120> little<00:03:10.040> strap<00:03:11.040> thingy<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.030> doesn't

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
that little strap thingy so it doesn't

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.210 
that little strap thingy so it doesn't
look<00:03:12.330> horrible<00:03:12.570> but<00:03:12.990> cut<00:03:13.590> joints<00:03:13.920> aren't<00:03:14.070> my

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
look horrible but cut joints aren't my

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.500 
look horrible but cut joints aren't my
favorite<00:03:14.700> type<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:14.880> joint<00:03:15.180> unless<00:03:15.270> they're

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
favorite type of joint unless they're

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.330 
favorite type of joint unless they're
hidden<00:03:15.750> well<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.590> it's<00:03:16.770> not<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.980> best<00:03:17.130> but

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
hidden well so it's not the best but

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.729 
hidden well so it's not the best but
it's<00:03:17.489> good<00:03:17.640> enough<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.840> elbows<00:03:19.200> have<00:03:19.500> the

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
it's good enough the elbows have the

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.740 
it's good enough the elbows have the
ratcheted<00:03:20.280> ball<00:03:20.640> disc<00:03:20.940> that<00:03:21.120> swivels<00:03:21.540> in<00:03:21.660> the

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
ratcheted ball disc that swivels in the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.650 
ratcheted ball disc that swivels in the
forearm<00:03:22.550> so<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.640> can<00:03:23.790> spin<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.150> around<00:03:24.239> there

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
forearm so you can spin it around there

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.170 
forearm so you can spin it around there
and<00:03:24.810> then<00:03:25.320> of<00:03:25.470> course<00:03:25.500> it's<00:03:26.430> got<00:03:26.520> a<00:03:26.580> very<00:03:26.850> fine

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
and then of course it's got a very fine

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.320 
and then of course it's got a very fine
ratchet<00:03:27.720> for<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:29.010> hinge<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:30.180> pretty

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
ratchet for the hinge so it's pretty

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.560 
ratchet for the hinge so it's pretty
good<00:03:30.570> good<00:03:30.930> articulation<00:03:31.200> there<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:33.150> wrists

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
good good articulation there the wrists

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.390 
good good articulation there the wrists
have<00:03:33.810> basically<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.260> same<00:03:34.410> joint<00:03:34.739> its

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
have basically the same joint its

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.370 
have basically the same joint its
ratcheted<00:03:35.910> hinge<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.450> then<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.870> tools<00:03:37.110> at

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
ratcheted hinge and then the tools at

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.130 
ratcheted hinge and then the tools at
the<00:03:37.560> wrist<00:03:37.739> itself<00:03:38.160> if<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:39.120> can<00:03:39.270> do<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:40.110> a

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
the wrist itself if I can do it so a

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.720 
the wrist itself if I can do it so a
pretty<00:03:40.410> good<00:03:40.590> range<00:03:40.770> of<00:03:40.890> motion<00:03:41.040> actually<00:03:41.400> and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
pretty good range of motion actually and

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.490 
pretty good range of motion actually and
it's<00:03:41.850> a<00:03:41.910> pretty<00:03:42.150> nice<00:03:42.420> looking<00:03:42.690> joint<00:03:43.140> I<00:03:43.320> mean

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
it's a pretty nice looking joint I mean

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.710 
it's a pretty nice looking joint I mean
it<00:03:43.650> doesn't<00:03:43.800> stand<00:03:44.100> out<00:03:44.310> it's<00:03:44.550> not<00:03:44.670> obvious<00:03:45.150> so

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
it doesn't stand out it's not obvious so

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.750 
it doesn't stand out it's not obvious so
I'm<00:03:45.840> pretty<00:03:46.019> happy<00:03:46.140> with<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:47.160> torso<00:03:47.430> is

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
I'm pretty happy with that the torso is

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.210 
I'm pretty happy with that the torso is
on<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:47.940> diaphragm<00:03:48.540> double<00:03:48.900> ball<00:03:49.110> joint<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.680> has

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
on a diaphragm double ball joint it has

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.479 
on a diaphragm double ball joint it has
a<00:03:50.250> huge<00:03:50.910> range<00:03:51.420> of<00:03:51.600> motion<00:03:52.080> really<00:03:53.070> anything

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
a huge range of motion really anything

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.699 
a huge range of motion really anything
you<00:03:53.820> want<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.090> do<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.450> can<00:03:54.660> do<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.260> it's

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
you want to do you can do it and it's

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:56.810 
you want to do you can do it and it's
not<00:03:55.860> going<00:03:56.100> to<00:03:56.190> be<00:03:56.310> ugly

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
not going to be ugly

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.699 
not going to be ugly
you<00:03:56.910> can<00:03:57.060> only<00:03:57.239> barely<00:03:57.750> just<00:03:58.140> begin<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.530> see

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
you can only barely just begin to see

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.290 
you can only barely just begin to see
inside<00:03:59.100> if<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.430> look<00:03:59.670> from<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.850> back<00:04:00.090> when

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
inside if you look from the back when

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.910 
inside if you look from the back when
you<00:04:00.390> put<00:04:00.540> them<00:04:00.660> all<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.900> way<00:04:01.019> forward<00:04:01.320> but

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
you put them all the way forward but

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.790 
you put them all the way forward but
every<00:04:02.190> other<00:04:02.340> pose<00:04:02.989> look<00:04:03.989> at<00:04:04.110> that<00:04:04.290> it's<00:04:04.560> just

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
every other pose look at that it's just

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.860 
every other pose look at that it's just
they<00:04:05.190> did<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.519> great<00:04:06.030> job<00:04:06.060> with<00:04:06.510> this<00:04:06.630> figure

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
they did a great job with this figure

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.170 
they did a great job with this figure
with<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.410> torso<00:04:07.890> joint<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:08.760> a<00:04:08.880> little

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
with that torso joint it's a little

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.150 
with that torso joint it's a little
loose<00:04:09.420> but<00:04:09.840> not<00:04:09.870> so<00:04:10.440> much<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:11.040> is<00:04:11.130> a

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
loose but not so much so that is a

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.580 
loose but not so much so that is a
problem<00:04:11.580> it's<00:04:11.700> not<00:04:11.820> wobbly<00:04:12.690> so<00:04:13.170> that's<00:04:13.350> really

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
problem it's not wobbly so that's really

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.759 
problem it's not wobbly so that's really
good<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.910> hips<00:04:15.150> now<00:04:15.390> are<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:16.200> different<00:04:16.530> story

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
good the hips now are a different story

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.099 
good the hips now are a different story
they<00:04:17.130> are<00:04:17.160> very<00:04:17.549> limited<00:04:17.820> they've<00:04:18.540> almost<00:04:18.780> no

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
they are very limited they've almost no

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.099 
they are very limited they've almost no
over<00:04:19.350> inch<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.620> motion<00:04:20.070> at<00:04:20.280> all<00:04:20.960> there<00:04:21.960> are<00:04:21.989> in

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
over inch of motion at all there are in

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.779 
over inch of motion at all there are in
an<00:04:22.200> old<00:04:22.350> school<00:04:22.500> ball<00:04:22.860> joint<00:04:23.100> I<00:04:23.250> believe<00:04:23.580> like

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
an old school ball joint I believe like

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.219 
an old school ball joint I believe like
I<00:04:23.910> said<00:04:24.120> on<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.390> neck<00:04:24.570> it's<00:04:24.600> kind<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:24.990> hard<00:04:25.169> to

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
I said on the neck it's kind of hard to

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.870 
I said on the neck it's kind of hard to
get<00:04:25.380> in<00:04:25.530> there<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.800> see<00:04:25.830> but<00:04:26.310> that's<00:04:26.400> how<00:04:26.610> it

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
get in there to see but that's how it

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.810 
get in there to see but that's how it
seems<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.660> be<00:04:27.690> it's<00:04:28.470> pretty<00:04:28.740> limited<00:04:28.920> you<00:04:29.670> can

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
seems to be it's pretty limited you can

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.970 
seems to be it's pretty limited you can
get<00:04:29.940> them<00:04:30.060> out<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.180> little<00:04:30.420> bit<00:04:30.690> but<00:04:31.530> not<00:04:31.950> a

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
get them out a little bit but not a

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.670 
get them out a little bit but not a
whole<00:04:32.310> lot<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.610> range<00:04:32.910> of<00:04:33.030> motion<00:04:33.090> there<00:04:33.680> the

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
whole lot of range of motion there the

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.280 
whole lot of range of motion there the
knees<00:04:34.920> are<00:04:35.310> like<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.790> wrists<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.660> elbows

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
knees are like the wrists and the elbows

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.890 
knees are like the wrists and the elbows
it's<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.920> ratcheted<00:04:38.430> joint<00:04:38.760> with<00:04:39.270> a<00:04:39.300> swivel<00:04:39.630> in

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
it's a ratcheted joint with a swivel in

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.310 
it's a ratcheted joint with a swivel in
it<00:04:40.400> which<00:04:41.400> is<00:04:41.580> good<00:04:41.760> enough<00:04:41.970> for<00:04:42.480> me<00:04:42.630> now<00:04:43.260> the

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
it which is good enough for me now the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.380 
it which is good enough for me now the
feet<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:44.010> think<00:04:44.700> are<00:04:44.820> just<00:04:45.000> on<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.150> ball<00:04:45.360> joint

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
feet I think are just on a ball joint

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.750 
feet I think are just on a ball joint
again<00:04:45.900> but<00:04:46.260> they<00:04:46.380> have<00:04:46.530> full<00:04:47.040> range<00:04:47.340> of<00:04:47.700> motion

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
again but they have full range of motion

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.180 
again but they have full range of motion
so<00:04:48.450> that<00:04:48.870> is<00:04:49.020> fine<00:04:49.260> with<00:04:49.290> me<00:04:49.470> they<00:04:49.800> can<00:04:49.950> swivel

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
so that is fine with me they can swivel

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.740 
so that is fine with me they can swivel
and<00:04:50.520> pivot<00:04:50.940> any<00:04:51.150> way<00:04:51.270> you<00:04:51.330> want

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
and pivot any way you want

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.790 
and pivot any way you want
so<00:04:52.230> he<00:04:52.410> stands<00:04:52.890> no<00:04:53.930> problem<00:04:54.930> at<00:04:55.230> all<00:04:55.260> I<00:04:55.740> mean

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
so he stands no problem at all I mean

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.140 
so he stands no problem at all I mean
you<00:04:56.100> can<00:04:56.220> really<00:04:56.460> get<00:04:56.550> them<00:04:56.670> to<00:04:56.760> do<00:04:56.940> whatever

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
you can really get them to do whatever

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.050 
you can really get them to do whatever
pose<00:04:57.510> you<00:04:57.720> want<00:04:57.750> -<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:59.100> limitation<00:04:59.700> of<00:04:59.880> the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
pose you want - the limitation of the

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.870 
pose you want - the limitation of the
hips<00:05:00.300> so<00:05:00.870> he's<00:05:01.020> really<00:05:01.320> really<00:05:02.040> a<00:05:02.190> cool<00:05:02.460> figure

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
hips so he's really really a cool figure

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.190 
hips so he's really really a cool figure
you<00:05:03.480> can<00:05:03.600> put<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.870> hammer<00:05:04.110> in<00:05:04.350> his<00:05:04.440> hand

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
you can put the hammer in his hand

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.750 
you can put the hammer in his hand
and<00:05:07.200> it<00:05:07.650> makes<00:05:07.830> for<00:05:07.890> a<00:05:08.040> great<00:05:08.250> display<00:05:08.670> piece

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
and it makes for a great display piece

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.750
