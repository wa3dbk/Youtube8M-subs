00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.030
 hello girls today I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.010
 this design 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.880
 good girls we started doing the 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.880
 French on white 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.730
 ah 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.180
 ah 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.870
 okay girls now with the brush and 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:49.379
 black acrylic paint we will make a line 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.379
 here 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.870
 on the border 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.870
 of the French 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:04.500
 and we will make another line 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.500
 in the middle of the French 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.130
 and now we will make squares 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.010
 ok and now with the punch 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.780

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.780
 a little black dot here 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.229
 we will clean it 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.680
 we will take a little bit of acrylic paint 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.680
 white 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.320
 and we'll see it 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.390
 we'll wait for it to dry a little and 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.170
 we will take our shine 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.880

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.880
