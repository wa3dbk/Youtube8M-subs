00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.360
 have now been released 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.640
 numerous with the whole sealed 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.980
 from the gameplay is from the campaign in 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.680
 single that of the multiplayer and we are there 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.750
 get an almost definite idea of â€‹â€‹how 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.880
 will be this new chapter of the saga of 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.680
 activision certainly characterized by 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.230
 a remarkable dynamism and rapidity in the 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.660
 fights has really put his hand to 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.420
 gameplay and moving what had been 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.400
 the real innovation in the flexo saga ci 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.530
 we will find ourselves facing soldiers no longer 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.320
 equipped with ex suites but with forms 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.899
 different enemies ranging from 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.120
 one equipped with artificial limbs up to 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.219
 others completely robotic le 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.899
 main changes obviously not 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.289
 they can find themselves in the mode 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.219
 multiplayer who saw a remarkable one 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.570
 distortion with respect to the chapters 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.760
 previous 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.980
 let's start with the set of movements for 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.080
 our in- game avatar joins 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.039
 mechanics already known to others entirely 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.410
 unreleased 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:12.050
 it goes from the combat helmet on the ground and 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.300
 in the air thanks to the new system of 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.070
 rhinestone jam which however will not be 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.560
 at all equal double jump exor in 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.560
 advance warfare and then move on to 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.540
 powerslide that is the slip tasted 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.670
 thanks to our jetpack 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.549
 in addition to underwater fights for 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.909
 finally to gain as in titan 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.979
 but done better in dazzling titan was 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.439
 undoubtedly beautiful to look at and give 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.229
 dynamism at the games but in how much 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.030
 practicality was definitely not the top 3 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.369
 iarc has included the possibility of 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.070
 walk on all interior walls and 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.350
 external but at the same time guaranteeing the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.689
 chance to fire and fight 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.200
 too much like you were with your feet to 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.720
 land 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.180
 all this made possible thanks to 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.250
 traverse to the improvement there 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.590
 will allow to shoot also in the course 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.840
 animation without losing 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.430
 firefight for fault of eg 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.250
 a wall to climb over 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.200
 and all this can only make us happy 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.299
 but we are now at great news for the 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.120
 creation and personalization of 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.650
 own class between matches 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.950
 specialists have been introduced 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.680
 nine classes with two specializations 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.440
 each a weapon and an ability to which the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.110
 player 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.690
 will have to choose bringing for example for 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.990
 the evening then reaper to finally arrive 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.220
 to the new entry sharks in oman equipped with 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.190
 tactical rifle 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.440
 i've in rome with adhesive bullets 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.320
 containing hundreds of robotic insects 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.620
 and the prof is able to draw skills 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.900
 water ingrid and tempest these last two 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.740
 specialists were revealed during 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.790
 put in place these days 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.860
 beware of facing soldiers 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.260
 strong opponents of this special guide 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.880
 because you might find yourself dead even though 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.400
 think you killed the enemy 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.680
 previously the amount of life 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.360
 granted to the player is more respect 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.180
 to the one we saw in 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.220
 past episodes in this understanding indeed 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.920
 two or three blows will not be enough 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.600
 settled to land an enemy but 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.670
 as we have learned for the festival 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.190
 developed by trial it will take six 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.970
 seven bullets and that allows to have 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.980
 way to respond to the opposing fire 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.260
 black ops 3 at first glance as far as 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.090
 concerns the resulting multiplayer compartment 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.250
 be much less futuristic than that 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.410
 which seems to diverge and for many 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.570
 aspects from the good work done by 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.850
 sledgehammer with its advanced water 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.520
 passing instead to personalization 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.680
 of weapons that deviates return class 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.690
 to the beloved peak ten as it was in black 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.209
 ops 2 which will require players 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.730
 utmost attention in evaluating then 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.350
 explain why accessories and weapons 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.760
 best to deal with any type 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.140
 of match 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.220
 the schimidt creation level and le 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.510
 own weapons has reached levels 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.760
 awesome 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.220
 now we can modify three parts 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.320
 of the weapon to color dyes emblems 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.239
 which we like the most as it happened from 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.190
 a few years now instead for 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.000
 fully enjoy the multiplayer sector 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.130
 of the title 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.200
 we will have servers available 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.239
 dedicated thus allowing to avoid 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.590
 that annoying change we oz 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.780
 will hit in the middle of a shootout 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.400
 or a conquest in a domain 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.799
 surrounded by enemy soldiers 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.320
 in short, Traian is back at the 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.810
 great with black ops 3 and is ready 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.870
 literally to revolutionize in the way of 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.700
 understand and play with ethical beauty 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.980
 is based on the very solid foundations of a 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.080
 best seller which was black ops 2 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.060
 but still the darkness with regards to the 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.370
 now zombie mode character 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.240
 distinctive work signed by the house 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.920
 of santa monica 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.870
 all we can do is wait 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.340
 with lots of aids the tide of novelties that 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.140
 we will analyze until the launch 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.750
 of the beta in the months of August 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.790
 if you station and then on xbox 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.670
 virtue of the exclusivity time had 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.440
 acquired by the Japanese company 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.050
 we obviously await the date of 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.310
 throw with open arms 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.200
 it's probably the cod that most 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.230
 we wish to play in the latter 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.230
 years
