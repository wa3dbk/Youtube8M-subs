we can smash the likes and get over 500

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.470 
we can smash the likes and get over 500
that'd<00:00:22.289> be<00:00:22.320> absolutely<00:00:22.920> epic<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.330> yeah

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
that'd be absolutely epic and and yeah

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.420 
that'd be absolutely epic and and yeah
were<00:00:24.720> crates<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.170> my<00:00:25.260> opinion<00:00:25.560> are<00:00:25.859> seriously

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
were crates in my opinion are seriously

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.980 
were crates in my opinion are seriously
important<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.210> know<00:00:27.330> they<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.660> make<00:00:27.810> or

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
important you know they can make or

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.960 
important you know they can make or
break<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.230> player<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.460> think<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.760> new

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
break a player and I think this new

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.370 
break a player and I think this new
feature<00:00:30.179> would<00:00:30.449> actually<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.869> really<00:00:30.900> really

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
feature would actually be really really

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.900 
feature would actually be really really
cool<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.920> we're<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.460> jump<00:00:32.669> straight

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
cool so we're going to jump straight

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.150 
cool so we're going to jump straight
into<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.570> now<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:35.040> an

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
into it and now just so you get an

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.650 
into it and now just so you get an
understanding<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.880> what<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.270> may<00:00:36.420> look

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
understanding as to what it may look

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.049 
understanding as to what it may look
like<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.860> see<00:00:37.890> next<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> shrine

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
like and as you can see next to a shrine

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.880 
like and as you can see next to a shrine
Steiger<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> right-hand<00:00:40.230> side<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.559> him<00:00:40.680> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
Steiger on the right-hand side of him a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.889 
Steiger on the right-hand side of him a
little<00:00:41.550> box<00:00:41.760> appears<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.480> would<00:00:42.629> be<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
little box appears and this would be the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.180 
little box appears and this would be the
same<00:00:43.079> for<00:00:43.260> every<00:00:43.500> single<00:00:43.710> player<00:00:43.980> if<00:00:44.160> you

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
same for every single player if you

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.920 
same for every single player if you
hovered<00:00:44.610> over<00:00:44.910> them<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.570> will<00:00:45.660> give<00:00:45.840> you

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
hovered over them and it will give you

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.750 
hovered over them and it will give you
the<00:00:46.050> option<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.469> change<00:00:46.800> his<00:00:47.070> attacking<00:00:47.460> work

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the option to change his attacking work

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.569 
the option to change his attacking work
rate<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.270> what<00:00:49.110> defensive<00:00:49.680> workrate<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:50.280> well

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
rate and what defensive workrate as well

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.069 
rate and what defensive workrate as well
so<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.300> would<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.780> would<00:00:51.899> either

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so what you would do is you would either

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.990 
so what you would do is you would either
select<00:00:52.500> between<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.100> attacking<00:00:53.640> or<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
select between the attacking or the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.310 
select between the attacking or the
defensive<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.690> then<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.930> would<00:00:55.020> give<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.289> a

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
defensive and then it would give you a

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.290 
defensive and then it would give you a
little<00:00:55.620> option<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.219> little<00:00:56.489> slide<00:00:56.760> option<00:00:57.180> in

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
little option a little slide option in

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.580 
little option a little slide option in
the<00:00:57.390> middle<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.930> were<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> go<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the middle and if you were to go on the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.110 
the middle and if you were to go on the
left<00:00:58.739> hand<00:00:58.890> side<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.370> would<00:00:59.699> change<00:00:59.910> his

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
left hand side it would change his

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.849 
left hand side it would change his
attacking<00:01:00.480> work<00:01:00.750> rates<00:01:00.989> too<00:01:01.199> low<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.620> if

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
attacking work rates too low and if

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.439 
attacking work rates too low and if
you'd<00:01:02.010> go<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> right<00:01:02.520> hand<00:01:02.699> side<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.270> would

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
you'd go on the right hand side it would

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.210 
you'd go on the right hand side it would
change<00:01:03.660> his<00:01:03.930> sub<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:04.320> attacking<00:01:04.650> work<00:01:04.979> rates

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
change his sub or attacking work rates

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.969 
change his sub or attacking work rates
well<00:01:05.519> attacking<00:01:06.119> workers<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.840> attack<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
well attacking workers to attack and and

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.560 
well attacking workers to attack and and
yeah<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.400> I've<00:01:08.520> done<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.850> up<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.360> put<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
yeah what I've done is up just to put a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.179 
yeah what I've done is up just to put a
few<00:01:09.810> more<00:01:09.930> images<00:01:10.080> together<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.950> get

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
few more images together just so you get

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.560 
few more images together just so you get
sort<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.520> better<00:01:11.729> understanding<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:12.240> how<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
sort of better understanding of how it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.480 
sort of better understanding of how it
will<00:01:12.720> work<00:01:12.750> moving<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.799> left<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.189> right<00:01:14.220> so

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
will work moving it left and right so

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.890 
will work moving it left and right so
you've<00:01:14.610> got<00:01:14.640> low<00:01:14.880> attacking<00:01:15.150> medium

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
you've got low attacking medium

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.719 
you've got low attacking medium
attacking<00:01:16.320> low<00:01:16.439> attacking<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.100> yeah<00:01:17.549> we're

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
attacking low attacking and yeah we're

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.740 
attacking low attacking and yeah we're
going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> set<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.090> too<00:01:18.270> high<00:01:18.299> too<00:01:18.540> high

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
going to set it too high too high

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.690 
going to set it too high too high
because<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.500> what's<00:01:19.979> right<00:01:20.189> side<00:01:20.490> girl

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
because that is what's right side girl

defensive and high-tech workers because

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.800 
defensive and high-tech workers because
players<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.250> Sergio<00:01:47.700> Ramos<00:01:47.939> who<00:01:48.360> who

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
players like Sergio Ramos who who

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.539 
players like Sergio Ramos who who
attacks<00:01:49.200> he's<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> very<00:01:49.740> very<00:01:49.979> good<00:01:50.159> defender

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
attacks he's a very very good defender

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.760 
attacks he's a very very good defender
but<00:01:51.060> he<00:01:51.149> gets<00:01:51.360> forward<00:01:51.689> too<00:01:51.840> much<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.350> like

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
but he gets forward too much and I like

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.859 
but he gets forward too much and I like
to<00:01:52.979> sort<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.610> my<00:01:53.759> defenders<00:01:54.299> sit<00:01:54.509> further

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
to sort of have my defenders sit further

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.340 
to sort of have my defenders sit further
back<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.829> them<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.130> defend<00:01:56.490> basically<00:01:57.030> and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
back I like them to defend basically and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.749 
back I like them to defend basically and
players<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.530> cavani's<00:01:59.100> got<00:01:59.340> high<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.579> high

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
players like cavani's got high to high

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.179 
players like cavani's got high to high
work-rate<00:02:00.149> switch<00:02:00.659> he'd<00:02:01.259> be<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.710> good<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.070> he

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
work-rate switch he'd be so good if he

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.039 
work-rate switch he'd be so good if he
had<00:02:02.310> sort<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.670> blow<00:02:02.850> defensive<00:02:03.390> workrate<00:02:03.570> sand

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
had sort of blow defensive workrate sand

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.080 
had sort of blow defensive workrate sand
and<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.409> was<00:02:04.500> more<00:02:04.680> higher<00:02:05.070> up<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.399> pitch<00:02:05.430> let

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and it was more higher up the pitch let

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.480 
and it was more higher up the pitch let
me<00:02:06.240> know<00:02:06.390> your<00:02:06.689> opinions<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.380> this

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
me know your opinions on this

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.280

it would be absolutely fantastic and I

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.840 
it would be absolutely fantastic and I
think<00:02:10.470> maybe<00:02:10.590> if<00:02:10.800> EA<00:02:11.010> didn't<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.520> like<00:02:11.640> this

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
think maybe if EA didn't do it like this

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.730 
think maybe if EA didn't do it like this
they<00:02:12.270> could<00:02:12.450> bring<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.810> sort<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.560> some

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
they could bring it in sort of some

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.260 
they could bring it in sort of some
