00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
been asked on so many occasions what is

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.209 
been asked on so many occasions what is
the<00:00:08.480> purpose<00:00:08.870> of<00:00:08.960> a<00:00:09.080> hydrometer<00:00:09.469> what<00:00:09.920> does<00:00:10.040> it

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
the purpose of a hydrometer what does it

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.690 
the purpose of a hydrometer what does it
do<00:00:10.400> how<00:00:10.820> do<00:00:10.880> we<00:00:11.059> user<00:00:11.559> have<00:00:12.559> to<00:00:12.590> say<00:00:12.980> in<00:00:13.400> my

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
do how do we user have to say in my

do how do we user have to say in my
opinion<00:00:14.150> the<00:00:14.629> hydrometer<00:00:15.230> is<00:00:15.289> one<00:00:15.500> of<00:00:15.590> the

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
opinion the hydrometer is one of the

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.040 
opinion the hydrometer is one of the
most<00:00:15.980> important<00:00:16.940> pieces<00:00:17.119> of<00:00:17.300> equipment<00:00:17.510> in

hydrometer will read the gravity of the
liquid<00:00:23.360> it's<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:24.230> only<00:00:24.440> way<00:00:24.860> that<00:00:25.160> we<00:00:25.460> can

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
liquid it's the only way that we can

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.420 
liquid it's the only way that we can
really<00:00:25.970> accurately<00:00:26.720> test<00:00:27.200> whether<00:00:28.100> the

really accurately test whether the

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.480 
really accurately test whether the
fermentation<00:00:29.150> is<00:00:29.270> finished<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.590> if<00:00:30.890> we<00:00:31.220> think

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
fermentation is finished so if we think

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.190 
fermentation is finished so if we think
we've<00:00:32.000> got<00:00:32.149> a<00:00:32.180> bucket<00:00:32.570> full<00:00:32.809> of<00:00:32.870> grape<00:00:33.170> juice

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
we've got a bucket full of grape juice

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.300 
we've got a bucket full of grape juice
and<00:00:34.000> water<00:00:35.110> whatever<00:00:36.110> combination<00:00:36.890> we're

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
and water whatever combination we're

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.800 
and water whatever combination we're
going<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:37.520> drop<00:00:37.700> a<00:00:37.760> hydrometer<00:00:38.210> in<00:00:38.600> that

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
going to drop a hydrometer in that

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.960 
going to drop a hydrometer in that
typically<00:00:39.620> if<00:00:39.950> we're<00:00:40.160> going<00:00:40.340> to<00:00:40.400> make<00:00:40.579> a<00:00:40.610> wine

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
typically if we're going to make a wine

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.870 
typically if we're going to make a wine
it's<00:00:41.510> going<00:00:41.750> to<00:00:41.810> be<00:00:41.900> somewhere<00:00:42.260> between<00:00:42.880> 1070

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
it's going to be somewhere between 1070

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.190 
it's going to be somewhere between 1070
and<00:00:44.060> 1090<00:00:45.370> 1070<00:00:46.370> 1090<00:00:47.060> what<00:00:47.720> we've<00:00:47.870> got<00:00:48.079> is

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
and 1090 1070 1090 what we've got is

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.420 
and 1090 1070 1090 what we've got is
we've<00:00:48.410> got<00:00:48.440> a<00:00:48.560> scale<00:00:48.950> that<00:00:49.250> goes<00:00:50.060> from<00:00:50.570> 99<00:00:51.320> o<00:00:51.430> up

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
we've got a scale that goes from 99 o up

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.729 
we've got a scale that goes from 99 o up
to<00:00:52.700> a<00:00:52.730> thousand<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.540> then<00:00:54.110> a<00:00:54.200> thousand<00:00:54.590> and

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
to a thousand and then a thousand and

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.270 
to a thousand and then a thousand and
ten<00:00:54.950> twenty<00:00:55.460> all<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.149> way<00:00:56.270> to<00:00:56.329> 1100<00:00:57.290> so<00:00:58.100> the

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
ten twenty all the way to 1100 so the

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.060 
ten twenty all the way to 1100 so the
scale<00:00:58.700> of<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.180> hydrometer<00:00:59.870> will<00:01:00.350> measure<00:01:00.649> the

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
scale of the hydrometer will measure the

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.060 
scale of the hydrometer will measure the
gravity<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.239> as<00:01:02.360> I<00:01:02.390> say<00:01:02.630> a<00:01:02.809> typical<00:01:02.989> wine<00:01:03.500> will

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
gravity so as I say a typical wine will

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.700 
gravity so as I say a typical wine will
be<00:01:04.219> somewhere<00:01:04.549> between<00:01:04.729> 1070<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:05.780> 1090<00:01:06.500> a

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
be somewhere between 1070 and 1090 a

can then work out the alcohol content to

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.370 
can then work out the alcohol content to
the<00:01:31.369> later<00:01:31.580> stage<00:01:31.970> but<00:01:32.659> more<00:01:32.900> importantly

the later stage but more importantly

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.330 
the later stage but more importantly
we're<00:01:33.560> going<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.770> know<00:01:33.920> whether<00:01:34.130> the

so<00:02:13.840> we<00:02:13.989> starting<00:02:14.470> at<00:02:14.590> thousand<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.489> eighty<00:02:15.640> we

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
so we starting at thousand and eighty we

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.360 
so we starting at thousand and eighty we
drop<00:02:16.569> down<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.959> thousand<00:02:17.650> we've<00:02:18.099> moved

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
drop down to a thousand we've moved

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.210 
drop down to a thousand we've moved
eighty<00:02:18.819> points<00:02:19.540> on<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.780> hydrometer<00:02:20.170> all<00:02:20.950> we

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
eighty points on the hydrometer all we

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.220 
eighty points on the hydrometer all we
do<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:21.670> divide<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.360> by<00:02:22.569> seven<00:02:22.930> point<00:02:23.170> three

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
do is divide that by seven point three

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.440 
do is divide that by seven point three
six<00:02:23.620> two<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.670> will<00:02:24.849> give<00:02:25.060> us<00:02:25.239> our

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
six two and that will give us our

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.750 
six two and that will give us our
alcoholic<00:02:26.410> content<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.430> particular

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
alcoholic content of that particular

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.050 
alcoholic content of that particular
wine<00:02:28.239> or<00:02:28.569> brew<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.349> we've<00:02:29.530> done<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.940> the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
wine or brew that we've done so the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.699 
wine or brew that we've done so the
hydrometer<00:02:31.630> is<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.810> really<00:02:32.200> important<00:02:32.620> piece

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
hydrometer is a really important piece

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.009 
hydrometer is a really important piece
of<00:02:32.769> equipment<00:02:33.299> there's<00:02:34.299> a<00:02:34.420> trial<00:02:34.690> jar<00:02:34.989> that

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
of equipment there's a trial jar that

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.930 
of equipment there's a trial jar that
you<00:02:35.230> can<00:02:35.410> buy<00:02:35.590> as<00:02:35.739> well<00:02:35.769> that<00:02:36.340> goes<00:02:36.519> with<00:02:36.760> it

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
you can buy as well that goes with it

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.850 
you can buy as well that goes with it
that<00:02:37.120> obviously<00:02:38.019> makes<00:02:38.230> life<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.530> lot<00:02:38.799> easier

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
that obviously makes life a lot easier

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.740 
that obviously makes life a lot easier
when<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.519> actually<00:02:39.670> read<00:02:40.120> they<00:02:40.299> also<00:02:40.420> have

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
when you actually read they also have

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.259 
when you actually read they also have
the<00:02:40.930> case<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.130> hydrometer<00:02:42.790> comes<00:02:43.030> in

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
the case that the hydrometer comes in

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.449 
the case that the hydrometer comes in
and<00:02:43.480> some<00:02:43.959> people<00:02:44.260> use<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.680> pour<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> liquid

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
and some people use that pour the liquid

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.030 
and some people use that pour the liquid
in<00:02:45.850> drop<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.510> hydrometer<00:02:47.110> in<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.530> we<00:02:47.799> take<00:02:47.980> a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
in drop the hydrometer in and we take a

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.910 
in drop the hydrometer in and we take a
reading<00:02:48.489> now<00:02:49.209> here<00:02:49.510> I've<00:02:49.870> actually<00:02:50.350> got<00:02:50.769> the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
reading now here I've actually got the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.729 
reading now here I've actually got the
beer<00:02:51.130> that's<00:02:51.700> just<00:02:52.000> finished<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:53.260> we<00:02:53.440> are

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
beer that's just finished and we are

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:54.960 
beer that's just finished and we are
going<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.069> take<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.250> reading<00:02:54.580> on<00:02:54.819> this

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
going to take a reading on this

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.910 
going to take a reading on this
particular<00:02:55.299> beer<00:02:55.660> what<00:02:56.410> we're<00:02:56.590> looking<00:02:56.890> for

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
particular beer what we're looking for

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.020 
particular beer what we're looking for
is<00:02:57.400> across<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.810> line<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.739> liquid<00:03:00.099> now

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
is across the line of the liquid now

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.370 
is across the line of the liquid now
what<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.209> always<00:03:01.420> like<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.690> do<00:03:01.900> is<00:03:02.019> just<00:03:02.170> give<00:03:02.290> it

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
what I always like to do is just give it

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.380 
what I always like to do is just give it
a<00:03:02.470> quick<00:03:02.680> little<00:03:02.830> spin<00:03:03.250> like<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.549> just<00:03:04.269> to

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
a quick little spin like that just to

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.640 
a quick little spin like that just to
make<00:03:04.569> sure<00:03:04.599> there's<00:03:05.500> no<00:03:06.060> bubbles<00:03:07.060> or<00:03:07.239> anything

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
make sure there's no bubbles or anything

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.430 
make sure there's no bubbles or anything
attached<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.209> hydrometer<00:03:10.209> now<00:03:11.170> that

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
attached to the hydrometer now that

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.470 
attached to the hydrometer now that
particular<00:03:11.620> one<00:03:12.130> as<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.579> can<00:03:12.730> see<00:03:13.000> across<00:03:13.239> the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
particular one as you can see across the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.530 
particular one as you can see across the
line<00:03:13.840> it's<00:03:14.380> reading<00:03:14.709> 1014<00:03:15.430> which<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.060> perfect

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
line it's reading 1014 which is perfect

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.720 
line it's reading 1014 which is perfect

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
for a beer the hydrometer is si most

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.729 
for a beer the hydrometer is si most
important<00:03:22.239> piece<00:03:22.359> of<00:03:22.390> equipment<00:03:22.630> I<00:03:23.140> always

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
important piece of equipment I always

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.910 
important piece of equipment I always
compare<00:03:24.130> a<00:03:24.190> hydrometer<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:25.630> if<00:03:26.440> you've<00:03:26.739> got<00:03:26.890> a

compare a hydrometer to if you've got a

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.800 
compare a hydrometer to if you've got a
car<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.519> you<00:03:27.640> think<00:03:27.910> you<00:03:28.030> need<00:03:28.209> some<00:03:28.420> oil<00:03:28.630> in

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
car and you think you need some oil in

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.170 
car and you think you need some oil in
it<00:03:28.930> what<00:03:29.530> do<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.709> do<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.459> put<00:03:30.700> your<00:03:30.819> dipstick

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
it what do you do you put your dipstick

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.840 
it what do you do you put your dipstick
and<00:03:31.480> test<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.799> see<00:03:32.829> whether<00:03:33.130> it<00:03:33.310> needs<00:03:33.340> any

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
and test it to see whether it needs any

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.530 
and test it to see whether it needs any
oil<00:03:34.569> then<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.470> fill<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:36.100> car<00:03:36.340> with<00:03:36.370> oil<00:03:36.819> you

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
oil then you fill the car with oil you

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.210 
oil then you fill the car with oil you
don't<00:03:37.690> just<00:03:38.019> go<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.350> put<00:03:38.530> oil<00:03:38.680> in<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.069> car

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
don't just go and put oil in the car

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.340 
don't just go and put oil in the car
because<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.120> think<00:03:40.359> you<00:03:40.600> might<00:03:40.630> need<00:03:41.019> some

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
because you think you might need some

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.069 
because you think you might need some
and<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:42.280> hydrometer<00:03:42.940> is<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.299> same<00:03:43.540> with<00:03:43.870> wine

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
and the hydrometer is the same with wine

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.309 
and the hydrometer is the same with wine
when<00:03:44.980> fermentation<00:03:45.819> is<00:03:45.940> finished<00:03:46.359> if<00:03:46.600> we<00:03:47.109> take

when fermentation is finished if we take

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.430 
when fermentation is finished if we take
a<00:03:47.380> reading<00:03:47.709> we<00:03:48.519> know<00:03:48.819> two<00:03:49.540> or<00:03:49.690> three<00:03:49.959> days<00:03:50.200> on
