00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
bit of a pain in the butt but it's not

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.630 
bit of a pain in the butt but it's not

going to be impossible you just have to

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.100 
going to be impossible you just have to
make<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.819> more<00:02:35.120> worth<00:02:35.329> their<00:02:35.599> while<00:02:35.780> and

this yet it has been rumored to be set
for<00:02:57.980> oktober<00:02:58.370> 2013<00:02:59.200> but<00:03:00.200> it's<00:03:00.409> simply<00:03:00.739> been

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
for oktober 2013 but it's simply been

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.970 
for oktober 2013 but it's simply been
set<00:03:01.430> by<00:03:01.579> Sega<00:03:01.819> as<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.239> late<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.780> year<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.590> it

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
set by Sega as a late this year so it

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.250 
set by Sega as a late this year so it
could<00:03:04.159> be<00:03:04.220> right<00:03:04.489> that<00:03:04.700> is<00:03:04.940> October<00:03:05.420> 13th<00:03:05.900> for

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
could be right that is October 13th for

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.589 
could be right that is October 13th for
this<00:03:06.440> particular<00:03:06.909> game<00:03:07.909> but<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:08.389> could<00:03:08.569> also

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
this particular game but it could also

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.569 
this particular game but it could also
be<00:03:08.870> completely<00:03:09.470> wrong<00:03:09.680> however<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.250> sounds

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
be completely wrong however that sounds

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.629 
be completely wrong however that sounds
about<00:03:10.700> right<00:03:10.879> to<00:03:11.659> me<00:03:11.780> but<00:03:12.470> obviously<00:03:12.590> we<00:03:13.220> may

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
about right to me but obviously we may

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.240 
about right to me but obviously we may
learn<00:03:13.879> very<00:03:14.209> very<00:03:14.450> differently<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.200> have<00:03:16.099> done

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250
