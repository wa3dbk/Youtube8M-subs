 fanatic of this channel what they see 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.910
 all the videos and how to say it 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:22.060
 small time arrived in total communes 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:27.370
 in these 34 days something has happened with 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:29.380
 78 people as it is and as in some 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.450

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.719

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.850
 xbox 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.230
 I always ask questions and people 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.109
 that you see all the video obviously says 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.899

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:46.300
 answers because he will go with his freedom 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.210
 that 's how it is that adding people ok is 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.760
 as fair and is the simplest and 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.530
 practically add to the true ones to 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.210
 the true fail by saying the friends 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.190

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.870

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.040
 wacker gameplay and always a question and 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.810
 obviously always say good added to 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.400
 the first two people or the first 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.750
 person that answers this to me via twitter 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.060
 with I had de marta guide added it and 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.340
 points and if I did not add it I follow it 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.320
 twitter and when I get the xbox the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.880
 hat reminds me of that he adds me 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.950
 he assaults and he added that it is the new 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.420
 way to add hits in xbox ok has 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:29.020
 the examples ok the second streaming 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.740
 streaming chip hello 4 yes or yes this 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.110
 week is coming 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.720
 the onslaught of fil 3 right now, wait no 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.860
 I do not take the disk to xbox see between 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.080
 the server also patience 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.030
 There is one condition thing and it seems that I 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.280
 I'm not going to upload the gameplay anymore because of 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.770
 that the game is to demand it is much more 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.090
 difficult than I expected 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.010
 inclusive hillman that the turn was more 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.680
 difficult for me but it seems it says no 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.440
 I'm not going to upload it more to the channel 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.060
 that not what would block hear me what 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.910
 what can be an accountant is the following 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.500
 stop uploading it as a good star 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.750
 like a with videos or suddenly do 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.030
 streaming but you do not want to sound 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.450
 comment what I can what I can 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.880
 comes what's next for xbox would be to 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.250
 see with this order of games ok me 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.930
 would come the dragon ball z pure kai hd 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.330
 collection hdmi sells this game to 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.380
 xbox you comment that it has been said 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.330
 by themselves or not put honor I want trouble 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.430
 or pons and if you want please 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.190
 they commented and well that would be the game 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.690
 that would replace warning by moving to 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.060
 keep the game good but it's not for me 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.730
 style the truth and apart I realize 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.470
 that there is no better or better I tell you what 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.600
 game on my own 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.610
 I finish it on my own obviously and already 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.170
 there were not and end point and I dedicate myself to 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.580
 climb the dragon ball 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.560
 obviously that is if you put yourself in dragon 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.990
 ball I make the order of dragon ball that 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.840
 comes in a few days maximum this next 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.970
 Saturday but dragon dragon ball would come 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.040
 balls out there a subscriber migo that already 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.740
 video the video to 1500 likes the last 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.660
 video of dragon ball ace so I do not think 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.850
 make it tomorrow but next week 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.040
 between a Friday and a Saturday would 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.260
 live streaming of dragon ball as goku 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.260
 bears would be good versus simian vegueta 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.520
 we'll do it live I killed that egg ni 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.080
 take out the chorus if there were videos 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.360
 normal ok 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.640
 so it would not be blight or by bye bye or 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.330
 he stays here if he goes and comes dragon 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:25.530
 ball z the hd version the collection for 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.330
 xbox 360 and something else for the box or 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.250
 suddenly out there 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.400
 I bought farcry to see the quality 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.620
 to see how far cry 3 walks on xbox 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.930
 cool there are also people who asked me 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.640
 farcry also for consoles but the most 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.500
 likely that it is for xbox that for 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.570
 playstation 3 follows xerez xbox and has 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.580
 in part 3 a good idea but it is not 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.810
 confirmed is still confirmed if it 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.660
 smooth flame is not confirmed that it 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.400
 comes the dragon balls and out there maybe 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.780
 the bat with the most chance for dragon 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.890
 ball and also experience dragon ball 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.230
 as ok 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.640
 so I repeat if the streaming of 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.640
 halo 4 with you 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.100
 and good adding people in gameplays of 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.660
 xbox so I say goodbye a lot 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.450
 thanks please comment if you want 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.830
 made an observer to the chorus' 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.350
 moment we put everything against a ball 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.490
 about saying goodbye I went to use the iphone and 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.440
 is comments and obviously we will see 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.720
 back by are I wrong dragon balls 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.260
 it's kinect and dragon ball budokai is 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.260
 gameplay 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.180
 so I fire fidocs there where 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.710
