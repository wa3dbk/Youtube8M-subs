00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.930 
either a prequel or a sequel because
they<00:01:34.530> haven't<00:01:34.679> really<00:01:34.830> come<00:01:35.009> out<00:01:35.160> and<00:01:35.399> said

that this is either a prequel or sequel
to<00:01:38.220> carnage<00:01:38.700> however<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.660> does<00:01:39.929> tie<00:01:40.229> into

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
to carnage however it does tie into

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.180

carnot<00:01:41.160> of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.399> book<00:01:41.550> carnage

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.520 

they<00:01:44.820> said<00:01:45.120> actually<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.870> did<00:01:46.080> remember<00:01:46.230> they

cast<00:01:48.810> he<00:01:49.020> survived<00:01:49.350> his<00:01:49.590> encounter<00:01:49.980> with<00:01:50.010> the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
cast he survived his encounter with the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.450 
cast he survived his encounter with the
century<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:51.020> I<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.890> guessing<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.400> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
century and I so I guessing it's a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.490 
century and I so I guessing it's a
prequel<00:01:53.640> I'm<00:01:53.970> guessing<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.810> prequel<00:01:55.020> it's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
prequel I'm guessing it's a prequel it's

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.290 
prequel I'm guessing it's a prequel it's
also<00:01:55.620> going<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.830> have<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.980> carnage<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.120> run

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
also going to have a carnage on the run

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.390 
also going to have a carnage on the run
from<00:01:57.860> a<00:01:58.860> spider<00:01:59.790> man<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> Avengers<00:02:01.400> so

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
from a spider man in the Avengers so

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.460 
from a spider man in the Avengers so
that's<00:02:02.520> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.730> cool<00:02:02.970> but<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.470> really

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
that's going to be cool but I really

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.990 
that's going to be cool but I really
hope<00:02:04.620> this<00:02:04.800> book<00:02:04.980> is<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.190> to<00:02:05.280> be<00:02:05.370> like<00:02:05.490> it's
