00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.459
 it's clear that I'm going to win you in this 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:18.660
 also good is that in this I'm not going to 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.660

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.509
 but now the good thing is that now 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.509
 to lose the last 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.080
 this bet is not placed 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.630
 also for us 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.590
 it was this moment tells me farkas comes to 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:13.980
 for me and between that I am the one who wins if 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:15.420
 out for me you're the one who wins this 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.650
 moment because I could have won you 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.890
 two races of all those that we have 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.890
 played 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:29.420
 ie you are winning that winning should be 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.420
 see it if we were gta ghosts 3 2 1 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.740
 and art but beautiful 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.610
 2 to 2 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.090
 to see what the hell it is you pilla 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.090
 and that's it 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.630
 what is this fuck shit decayed uncle I 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.630
 also that has gone down 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:07.750
 but hey I get on and there he is 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.750
 how strong 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:21.540
 I think I'm going 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:24.330
 from now on we are going to be the one to be 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.770
 this one happens that I was left behind 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.770
 you see the advantage 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.220
 they say that the point you know 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.810
 I will not kill him kill him like 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.330
 you can is already very management that is 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.489
 there we go in account that I do not see 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.959
 for was hypothetical lower in people 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:57.519
 to if you have to go for him 16 bastards uncle 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.519
 that I have not done anything 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.739
 he is the most pig of the whole game 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.650
 if the only one that kills has been charged to 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.019
 only 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.790
 come far win and I'm regent 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.810
 they do not kill anyone, nothing happens to them 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.959
 it means that I have been killed 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.099
 now he does not see us now in everything 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.470
 we have highlighted the rule is 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.030
 absolutely nobody has behaved me well 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.040
 had anger next to him there could be 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.040
 taken the exams give him the opportunity 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:54.120
 I went over the roofs but I had the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.990
 opportunity of your life to win and not 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.210
 to waste national fabra I have you 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.210
 I'm going to win so I ate the whole wall 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.450
 and that is that the bike is not given to me very 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.450
 well, let's say 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:24.130
 by giving him a gun you will see how it becomes 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.130
 crazy everything 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.860
 in pam pam pam 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:34.570
 now do not want to hurry but you're going to 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.420
 kill one Fardan tell me if you 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:42.740
 asked if it continues where it is to know 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:45.830
 here for what 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.830
 your lives 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:58.389

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.389
 approaching very happy that's you 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.310
 and I see a whiplash of 15 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.440
 to see tranquility 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:13.020
 its value we are 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.860
 to wendy gave I fall short of unless 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.860
 children houses 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.570
 or you can 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.840
 even voted to escape 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.350
 is about to kill him 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:43.350
 and to the other past very matter about 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.700

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.700
 Good, I already have bastards 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.030

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:59.020
 the goal 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:06:02.180
 and here comes stratus walking I can 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:06.469
 because he has missed the song of a hard 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.090
 to eat has been missing is that the 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:11.120
 a hard song could be with a 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.280
 traditional good to a hard but the record 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.050
 from cacho real dog 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.610
