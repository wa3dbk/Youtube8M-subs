another thing I would recommend if you
could<00:02:39.050> leave<00:02:39.380> this<00:02:39.940> marinate<00:02:40.940> for<00:02:41.360> minimum

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
could leave this marinate for minimum

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.440 
could leave this marinate for minimum
two<00:02:42.140> hours<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:43.220> will<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:43.580> be<00:02:43.730> delicious<00:02:44.240> if

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
two hours it will just be delicious if

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.300 
two hours it will just be delicious if
you<00:02:44.900> could<00:02:45.080> leave<00:02:45.200> from<00:02:45.470> hunger<00:02:45.830> better

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
you could leave from hunger better

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.130 
you could leave from hunger better
because<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.120> know<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.390> longer<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:47.840> marinate

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
because you know the longer you marinate

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.400 
because you know the longer you marinate
this<00:02:48.410> port<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:49.250> tastier<00:02:49.850> will<00:02:50.030> be<00:02:50.209> so<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:50.959> would

pork I'm gonna cook for about I would

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.090 
pork I'm gonna cook for about I would
say<00:03:10.820> maybe<00:03:11.209> two<00:03:11.600> hours<00:03:11.810> two<00:03:12.320> and<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.500> half<00:03:12.680> hours

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
say maybe two hours two and a half hours

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.100 
say maybe two hours two and a half hours
we're<00:03:13.880> gonna<00:03:14.000> see<00:03:14.330> because<00:03:14.480> it's<00:03:14.840> more

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
we're gonna see because it's more

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.020 
we're gonna see because it's more
usually<00:03:15.500> don't<00:03:15.709> do<00:03:15.830> them<00:03:15.980> too<00:03:16.130> small<00:03:16.250> but<00:03:17.000> I

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
usually don't do them too small but I

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.120 
usually don't do them too small but I
think<00:03:17.120> two<00:03:17.720> two<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.140> half<00:03:18.380> hours<00:03:18.830> would<00:03:19.010> be

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
think two two and a half hours would be

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.729 
think two two and a half hours would be
cooking<00:03:19.430> time<00:03:19.850> will<00:03:19.880> be<00:03:20.209> okay<00:03:20.480> for<00:03:20.510> this<00:03:20.810> I'm
