00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.109
 hello how about friends good mysteries 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.230
 tutorials I will explain how we can 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:10.600
 play 22 cooperative mode online 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.530
 well you just have to download the 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:18.040
 opus dei and crack online of course 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:23.010
 Well, he's going to have to have them 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:25.510
 google the crack and the steam these 3 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.060
 OK fine 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.600
 since we have three installed in the 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.950
 cdi 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.950
 we believe that you forget 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.250
 we open and put the udl 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.770
 and we execute it as administrator 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.130
 we're 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.840
 ok we hope that term of 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.880
 interaction and again from scratch 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.530
 so from the standard that is installed 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.580
 alone do not move anything at all 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.580
 what to expect 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.950
 ok well already once it's installed 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.520
 press any key and 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.520
 we finalize 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.910
 Now we go for the look of 2 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.850
 good this of the opus facilities 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.369
 dei takes a long time 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.180
 I'm going to cut the videos so they do not 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.810
 the tutorial is very long 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.810
 okay 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.900
 paper 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.170
 good because once you're done 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.930
 we press turn 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.930
 to continue and we can finish 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.510
 for the third 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.510
 the third update 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.099
 although we can 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.099
 the butter as administrator 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:53.120
 ready is already good once it is 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.980
