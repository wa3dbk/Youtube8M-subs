00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.039
 since first of september 2012 is final 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:27.730
 finish with her the good old light bulb 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.919
 has finally served its purpose and was good 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.079
 never between three and five 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.000
 percent luminous efficacy the rest goes as 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.449
 heat lost and that at one 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.399
 Life of only 1000 hours 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.860
 at the skyrocketing electricity prices 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.360
 bright madness and also ecological 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.610
 the waste of energy with light bulbs 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.519
 easy in the face of climate change 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.879
 bad there is already a long time 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:55.269
 Alternatives since 1960 he years the 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.030
 led and already in 1891 as a principle 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.649
 discovered like induction lamp the 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.999
 induction lamp offers many 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.620
 benefits at once 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.050
 It is an electrode loose 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.880
 gas discharge lamps and therefore has one 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.190
 ultra long life of ten years 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.619
 at continuous operation and has one 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.840
 operating time of up to 100,000 hours 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.979
 This reduces maintenance and 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.789
 personnel costs 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.130
 It has a very good light utilization 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.990
 an electronic ballast with 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.329
 Good efficiency is immediate 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.520
 ready for less sensitive 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.729
 Voltage fluctuations five years 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.649
 Warranty also the hamburger town hall market 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.000
 is with the induction lamps 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.969
 been illuminated 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.219
 Their color reproduction is similar to 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.710
 in other lamps, the sunlight 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.600
 and is 100% flatter and 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.600
 flicker-free and therefore good for 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.250
 human eye at day and night of 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.610
 Light is because of the wide spectrum 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.979
 less intense environmentally friendly because 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.500
 instead of mercury amalgam is used 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.729
 and insects burn when touched 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.439
 not because the heat emission is low 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.479
 with the induction lamps from cani 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.159
 Save a lot in the medium and long term 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.259
 money by the excellent 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.890
 energy efficiency and extremely long 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.109
 lifespan 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.200
 They also save money when buying from 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:16.500
 co2 certificates and they do something for you 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.500
 climate 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.160
 The induction lamp is ideal 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.890
 as a light source for large areas like 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:30.170
 hardware stores garden center consumers and 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:35.420
 to specialist markets is the resume of the customers 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.370
 excellent the advantages of our new 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.519
 lighting are clearly on the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.140
 On the one hand, this is not pleasant 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.170
 for the human eye 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.569
 that shows our goods in a whole 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.760
 other light and the other we have 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.010
 still a huge one at the end of the year 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.459
 Energy saving at over 50 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.860
 percent compared to the previous year 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.150
 It was important for us during the retrofitting 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.420
 that the lamps are much more durable 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.280
 are as their predecessors and that we 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.970
 a five-year warranty on this 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.099
 have the induction lamps from cani 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.489
 but are also ideal for example 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.010
 production facilities warehouses 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.709
 Gas stations hotels and 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.660
 retail stores but also for the 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.370
 Exterior and street lighting is the 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.290
 induction lamp the first choice 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.239
 not least because of their color rendering 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.769
 much better than others 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:33.410
 Products de / ml induction lamps from 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.620
 cani the light of the next generation 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.060
 With our induction lamps we offer 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.170
 of course, a comprehensive 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.329
 assortment of leds to premium products in 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.000
 the led range of cani sees ours 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.920
 LED tubes compared to conventional ones 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.819
 Fluorescent tubes provide numerous 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:57.049
 Advantages of very low energy consumption 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.730
 of only 14 watts or 28 watts one 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.150

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.849
 at least 30,000 hours very easy 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.310
 Installation in existing facilities there enormous 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.420
 sizes is produced 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.100
 brighter than conventional 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.170
 fluorescent tubes 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.150
 no ballasts and staring 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.180
 therefore no energy required 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.950
 losses only five to twelve lessen 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.170
 the light output over the lifetime 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.160
 compared to shining former ones 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:28.160
 no uv or infrared radiation in the 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.170

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.900
 Maintenance costs due to exchange defective 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.360
 Tube LED tubes do not need any 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.320
 warm-up time the light is immediately to 100
