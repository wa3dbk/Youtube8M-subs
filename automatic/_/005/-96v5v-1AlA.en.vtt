00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.940
 so it's soon its come back 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.130
 today for a little video on 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:56.200
 how to install brands on 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:58.360
 senators 2015 on mac os x 10.7 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.190
 mavericks so first of all we start 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.660
 by it will have to enter files 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.720
 visible otherwise we will not be able to 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.050
 modify this little file so we do 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.620
 a copy paste of text that I 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.180
 will put in the description have made to 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.280
 entry 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.990
 so here's where the files are 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.990
 visible then we restart the finder 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.500
 so reindeer women have revived 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.880
 so here for example this file is there 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.619
 a normally invisible file that 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:33.550
 we can see then we go in 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.600
 the user in library so me 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.860
 I am obliged to open the canvases 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.710
 English if we knew how to make suffering 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.090
 so here is then application support 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:47.140
 fascinating research 2015 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:50.979
 we go in the number of your backup 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.750
 so here I am I'm going to open it jamie 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.520
 which sank directly with texts and 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:03.130
 said we have here we look for money 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.270
 so the currency is here so here yes 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.740
 sir but I had already done a 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.869
 small modification so there you put 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.390
 you put the figure that you want 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:17.020
 so see me you see I have 990 987 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.380
 million then of course control 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.590
 is it so recorded files 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.830
 then confirm there your game and 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.390
 I 'm going to crack you have a million or 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.730
 the value of money arges that you 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.900
 will then have it if you want because 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.790
 for reasons that's what if you 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.150
 want to deliver the invisible files 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.880
 is it to no longer see this debate where 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.400
 all but these little files there all 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.740
 this is well hope one just 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:55.019
 take this text there we put it back in the 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.019
 terminal relaunching the fender 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:04.150
 so the file disappeared and power that 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.870
 these files again it even me that 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.590
 simple video to crack close 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.209
 its sales in 2015 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.319
