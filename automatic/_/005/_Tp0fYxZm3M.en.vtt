purl 2 up to here and then with the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.180 
purl 2 up to here and then with the
waste<00:01:38.729> yarn<00:01:39.149> I<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:40.050> done<00:01:40.229> circular<00:01:40.950> knitting

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
waste yarn I have done circular knitting

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.419 
waste yarn I have done circular knitting
which<00:01:41.940> can<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.420> folded<00:01:42.720> down<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.800> that<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.009> can

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
which can be folded down so that I can

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.840 
which can be folded down so that I can
sew<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.570> edge<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.800> first<00:01:47.070> step<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.640> to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
sew the edge and the first step is to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.749 
sew the edge and the first step is to
thread<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> needle<00:01:48.270> with<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.810> loose<00:01:49.170> end<00:01:49.759> so

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
thread the needle with the loose end so

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.300 
thread the needle with the loose end so
I<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:51.330> take<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.750> needle<00:01:52.130> fold<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.280> yarn

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
I just take the needle fold the yarn

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.499 
I just take the needle fold the yarn
around<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:54.000> pinch<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.689> push<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.619> through<00:01:55.830> the

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
around it pinch and push it through the

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.810 
around it pinch and push it through the
next<00:01:57.509> step<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.619> bring<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:59.009> yarn<00:01:59.310> from<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
next step is to bring this yarn from the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.539 
next step is to bring this yarn from the
outside<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.689> purple<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.829> inside<00:02:02.400> of

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
outside of the purple to the inside of

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.240 
outside of the purple to the inside of
the<00:02:02.640> purple<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.329> what<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.479> want<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.960> do<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.860> go

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the purple and what I want to do is go

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.880 
the purple and what I want to do is go
in<00:02:05.460> right<00:02:05.759> next<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.020> stitch<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.560> came

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
in right next to the stitch this came

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.030 
in right next to the stitch this came
out<00:02:07.920> of

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.080 

the<00:02:13.550> next<00:02:13.909> step<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.720> fold<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:16.610> waste<00:02:16.849> yarn

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
the next step is to fold the waste yarn

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:25.449 
the next step is to fold the waste yarn
down<00:02:22.269> now<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.720> stitches<00:02:24.319> that<00:02:24.349> I<00:02:24.709> am<00:02:25.010> going<00:02:25.310> to

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
down now the stitches that I am going to

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.289 
down now the stitches that I am going to
sew<00:02:25.760> into<00:02:26.180> are<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.769> rose-colored<00:02:28.299> stitches

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
sew into are the rose-colored stitches

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.640 
sew into are the rose-colored stitches
that<00:02:30.200> show<00:02:30.760> right<00:02:31.760> beyond<00:02:32.269> this<00:02:32.780> ring<00:02:33.260> of

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
that show right beyond this ring of

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.640 
that show right beyond this ring of
waste<00:02:34.040> yarn<00:02:34.430> where<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.420> first<00:02:35.720> row<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.290> waste

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
waste yarn where the first row of waste

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.039

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
yarn being pulled across just goes

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.879 
yarn being pulled across just goes
across<00:03:57.889> the<00:03:58.190> top<00:03:58.389> now<00:03:59.389> I<00:03:59.419> go<00:03:59.930> to<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.109> opposite

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
by two ribbing because it is very

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.210 
by two ribbing because it is very
different<00:06:45.380> in<00:06:45.500> the<00:06:45.620> way<00:06:45.650> it's<00:06:45.919> constructed

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
from a one by one ribbing but look how

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.749 
from a one by one ribbing but look how
nice<00:06:49.550> that<00:06:49.610> looks<00:06:49.880> I<00:06:50.740> will<00:06:51.740> tell<00:06:52.250> you<00:06:52.460> that

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 
nice that looks I will tell you that

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.379 
nice that looks I will tell you that
even<00:06:53.659> though<00:06:54.199> it<00:06:54.349> looks<00:06:54.560> just<00:06:54.860> fine<00:06:55.220> on<00:06:55.580> this

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:56.389 
even though it looks just fine on this

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:59.110 
even though it looks just fine on this
end<00:06:56.870> and<00:06:57.110> the<00:06:57.830> same<00:06:58.099> on<00:06:58.430> the<00:06:58.580> front<00:06:58.849> and<00:06:59.030> the

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.300 
back look it doesn't really look like

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.770 
back look it doesn't really look like
the<00:07:03.080> circular<00:07:03.349> cast<00:07:04.009> on<00:07:04.370> at<00:07:04.580> all<00:07:04.759> it<00:07:05.509> really

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:05.780 
the circular cast on at all it really

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.810 
the circular cast on at all it really
does<00:07:05.990> look<00:07:06.020> a<00:07:06.409> little<00:07:06.560> different<00:07:07.099> but<00:07:07.280> that's

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:07.820 
does look a little different but that's

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.390 
does look a little different but that's
quite<00:07:08.030> a<00:07:08.150> nice<00:07:08.389> bind<00:07:08.780> off<00:07:08.990> and<00:07:09.259> you<00:07:09.800> can<00:07:10.009> use<00:07:10.220> it

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
quite a nice bind off and you can use it

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.570 
quite a nice bind off and you can use it
in<00:07:10.520> a<00:07:10.550> lot<00:07:10.610> of<00:07:10.909> situations<00:07:11.380> so<00:07:12.380> that<00:07:12.590> was<00:07:12.889> the
