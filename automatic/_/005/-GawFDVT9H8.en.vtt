my name is Stasia bliss and this is

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.220 
my name is Stasia bliss and this is
acupressure<00:00:03.270> for<00:00:03.689> cold<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.740> virus<00:00:05.430> relief<00:00:06.230> so

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
acupressure for cold and virus relief so

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.110 
acupressure for cold and virus relief so
briefly<00:00:07.620> acupressure<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.639> stimulation

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
briefly acupressure is the stimulation

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.049 
briefly acupressure is the stimulation
of<00:00:09.389> certain<00:00:09.780> points<00:00:10.290> on<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:11.070> body<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.580> run

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
of certain points on the body that run

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.180 
of certain points on the body that run
along<00:00:12.360> what's<00:00:12.690> known<00:00:12.929> as<00:00:13.110> meridians<00:00:13.440> or

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
along what's known as meridians or

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.460 
along what's known as meridians or
energy<00:00:14.910> systems<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.809> body<00:00:16.020> it's<00:00:16.260> a

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
energy systems in the body it's a

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.090 
energy systems in the body it's a
Chinese<00:00:18.050> philosophy<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.590> Chinese<00:00:19.949> would

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
Chinese philosophy the Chinese would

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.210 
Chinese philosophy the Chinese would
call<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.400> energy<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> body<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.330> Chi<00:00:21.660> and

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
call the energy in the body the Chi and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.679 
call the energy in the body the Chi and
we'd<00:00:23.220> also<00:00:23.400> call<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> lifeforce<00:00:24.480> energy

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
we'd also call it the lifeforce energy

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.529 
we'd also call it the lifeforce energy
so<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.710> like<00:00:25.859> where<00:00:26.039> nerves<00:00:26.390> bundle<00:00:27.390> at<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
so just like where nerves bundle at a

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.980 
so just like where nerves bundle at a
certain<00:00:27.960> spot<00:00:28.640> we<00:00:29.640> stimulate<00:00:30.210> these<00:00:30.390> points

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
certain spot we stimulate these points

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.990 
certain spot we stimulate these points
and<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.320> stimulates<00:00:31.800> more<00:00:32.070> circulation<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
and it stimulates more circulation and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.970 
and it stimulates more circulation and
more<00:00:33.149> energy<00:00:33.540> into<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.960> area<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.710> some

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
more energy into that area so some

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.340 
more energy into that area so some
points<00:00:35.460> we're<00:00:35.610> going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.790> tap<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.630> some

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
points we're going to tap on and some

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.990 
points we're going to tap on and some
points<00:00:37.680> will<00:00:37.829> give<00:00:37.920> gentle<00:00:38.399> pressure<00:00:38.700> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
points will give gentle pressure and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.660 
points will give gentle pressure and
hold<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> few<00:00:40.290> moments<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.219> we'll<00:00:41.489> go<00:00:41.640> ahead

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
hold for a few moments so we'll go ahead

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.160 
hold for a few moments so we'll go ahead
and<00:00:41.940> start<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> point<00:00:42.690> that's<00:00:42.899> at<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.140> top

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
and start with a point that's at the top

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.470 
and start with a point that's at the top
of<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.590> head<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.579> cold<00:00:45.180> just

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
of the head so if you have a cold just

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.840 
of the head so if you have a cold just
starting<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> come<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> nice

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
starting to come on and this is a nice

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.299 
starting to come on and this is a nice
one<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.420> use<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:49.230> your<00:00:49.710> middle<00:00:49.890> finger

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
one you just use like your middle finger

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and we're just going to tap 12 times

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.380 
and we're just going to tap 12 times
gently<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> top<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> head<00:00:56.300> just<00:00:57.300> like

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
gently at the top of the head just like

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.680 
gently at the top of the head just like
that<00:00:57.829> and<00:00:58.829> that's<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.160> first<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.270> second

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
that and that's the first one the second

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.020 
that and that's the first one the second
point<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.109> going<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.559> at<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.100> top<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
point is going to be at the top of the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.960 
point is going to be at the top of the
spine<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.140> you're<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.409> take<00:01:04.970> two

light down and then from the bone you're

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.620 
light down and then from the bone you're
going<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.250> go<00:02:31.340> out<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.880> side<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.480> little

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
going to go out to the side and a little

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.110 
going to go out to the side and a little
divot<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:33.640> again<00:02:34.640> you're<00:02:34.819> just<00:02:34.970> going<00:02:35.090> to

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
divot and again you're just going to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.729 
divot and again you're just going to
kind<00:02:35.330> of<00:02:35.390> poke<00:02:35.600> and<00:02:35.840> prod<00:02:35.989> until<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.470> find

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
kind of poke and prod until you find

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.880 
kind of poke and prod until you find
that<00:02:36.890> tender<00:02:37.400> spot<00:02:37.930> this<00:02:38.930> one<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.319> probably

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
that tender spot this one is probably

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.100 
that tender spot this one is probably
the<00:02:40.130> most<00:02:40.250> challenging<00:02:40.520> spot<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.330> find<00:02:41.569> once

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110

you<00:02:42.200> find<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.830> very<00:02:43.550> effective<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.420> we're

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
you find it is very effective and we're

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.000 
you find it is very effective and we're
just<00:02:45.230> going<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.380> go<00:02:45.500> ahead<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.800> gently

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
just going to go ahead and gently

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.860 
just going to go ahead and gently
stimulate<00:02:46.700> that<00:02:46.850> point<00:02:47.180> with<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.480> little<00:02:47.750> bit

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
stimulate that point with a little bit

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.380 
stimulate that point with a little bit
of<00:02:47.959> pressure<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.920> after<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:52.910> do<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.120> for

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
of pressure and after you do it for

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.059 
of pressure and after you do it for
about<00:02:53.480> 15<00:02:53.720> seconds<00:02:54.470> we'll<00:02:54.709> gently<00:02:54.920> release

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
about 15 seconds we'll gently release

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.949 
about 15 seconds we'll gently release
and<00:02:55.730> you're<00:02:56.060> going<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.239> do<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.420> same<00:02:56.630> spot<00:02:56.930> on

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
and you're going to do the same spot on

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.590 
and you're going to do the same spot on
the<00:02:57.110> other<00:02:57.200> side
