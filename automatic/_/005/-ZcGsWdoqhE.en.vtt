sports and Sun of course this there's
one<00:04:44.450> down<00:04:44.750> turn<00:04:44.960> about<00:04:45.230> this<00:04:45.440> this<00:04:45.620> one<00:04:45.800> is

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
one down turn about this this one is

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.330 
one down turn about this this one is
quite<00:04:46.510> sticky<00:04:47.510> and<00:04:48.020> not<00:04:48.350> not<00:04:48.860> getting<00:04:49.130> in<00:04:49.220> the

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
quite sticky and not not getting in the

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.610 
quite sticky and not not getting in the
skin<00:04:49.610> so<00:04:49.880> well<00:04:50.150> to<00:04:50.570> be<00:04:50.690> quite<00:04:50.840> honest<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:51.500> the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
skin so well to be quite honest and the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.400 
skin so well to be quite honest and the
other<00:04:51.800> problem<00:04:52.340> is<00:04:52.490> this<00:04:52.930> it's<00:04:53.930> not<00:04:54.110> closing

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
other problem is this it's not closing

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.170 
other problem is this it's not closing
so<00:04:54.710> well<00:04:54.860> it's<00:04:55.220> often<00:04:55.550> that<00:04:55.670> it's<00:04:55.820> in<00:04:55.970> quite

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
so well it's often that it's in quite

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.360 
so well it's often that it's in quite
off<00:04:56.360> open<00:04:56.870> it's<00:04:57.080> not<00:04:57.590> really<00:04:57.860> closing<00:04:58.070> very

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370

something<00:05:09.920> like<00:05:10.160> this<00:05:10.280> so<00:05:10.490> this<00:05:10.790> one<00:05:11.660> be

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
something like this so this one be

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.530 
something like this so this one be
careful<00:05:12.110> positive<00:05:12.380> packaging<00:05:12.830> I<00:05:13.820> also<00:05:14.240> think

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
careful positive packaging I also think

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.710 
careful positive packaging I also think
it's<00:05:14.630> protecting<00:05:15.080> very<00:05:15.290> well<00:05:15.530> that<00:05:16.720> the

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
it's protecting very well that the

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.360 
it's protecting very well that the
formula<00:05:18.170> is<00:05:18.200> a<00:05:18.380> bit<00:05:18.500> greasy<00:05:18.740> and<00:05:19.010> it's<00:05:19.190> not

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
formula is a bit greasy and it's not

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.500 
formula is a bit greasy and it's not
getting<00:05:19.610> in<00:05:19.760> the<00:05:19.880> skin<00:05:20.090> very<00:05:20.270> well<00:05:22.360> so<00:05:23.360> yeah

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510
