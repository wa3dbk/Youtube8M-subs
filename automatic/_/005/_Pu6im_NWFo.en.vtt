00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
especially using the setup that I have

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.520 
especially using the setup that I have
which<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:22.890> MSMC<00:01:23.790> i<00:01:24.000> use<00:01:24.720> quick-draw<00:01:25.170> handle

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
which is MSMC i use quick-draw handle

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.179 
which is MSMC i use quick-draw handle
and<00:01:26.040> i<00:01:26.280> use<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> grip<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.420> two<00:01:28.320> attachments

and i use the grip to two attachments
that<00:01:29.220> i<00:01:29.310> think<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.970> very<00:01:30.119> important<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that i think are very important to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.469 
that i think are very important to
running<00:01:31.380> an<00:01:31.500> effective<00:01:31.920> smt<00:01:32.369> glass<00:01:32.579> there

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
running an effective smt glass there

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.960 
running an effective smt glass there
really<00:01:33.810> quick<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> chance<00:01:35.400> hop<00:01:35.759> in

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
really quick if you get a chance hop in

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.120 
really quick if you get a chance hop in
a<00:01:36.180> bike<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:37.049> combat<00:01:37.380> training<00:01:37.650> or<00:01:37.829> something

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
a bike like combat training or something

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.760 
a bike like combat training or something
along<00:01:38.189> those<00:01:38.430> lines<00:01:38.900> or<00:01:39.900> even<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> custom<00:01:40.560> game

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
along those lines or even a custom game

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.639 
along those lines or even a custom game
and<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.270> how<00:01:42.270> quick<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.170> difference

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and see how quick and the difference

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.340 
and see how quick and the difference
there<00:01:44.040> actually<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.790> when<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.270> pull<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.540> with

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
there actually is when you pull up with

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.609 
there actually is when you pull up with
quick-draw<00:01:46.710> versus<00:01:47.189> when<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.460> pull<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:47.670> with

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
quick-draw versus when you pull up with

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.069 
quick-draw versus when you pull up with
standard<00:01:50.299> you<00:01:51.299> know<00:01:51.390> no<00:01:51.509> attachment<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
standard you know no attachment the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.080 
standard you know no attachment the
quick<00:01:52.229> draw<00:01:52.409> handle<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.890> there's<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.579> definite

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
quick draw handle and there's a definite

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.270 
quick draw handle and there's a definite
advantage<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:55.140> right<00:01:55.320> there<00:01:55.500> been<00:01:56.130> a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
advantage like right there been a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.830 
advantage like right there been a
quick-draw<00:01:56.640> handle<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:56.969> got<00:01:57.119> probably<00:01:57.390> got<00:01:57.689> me

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
quick-draw handle it got probably got me

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.420 
quick-draw handle it got probably got me
even<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:58.469> he<00:01:58.560> hadn't<00:01:58.740> amidst<00:01:59.009> he<00:01:59.189> probably

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
even if he hadn't amidst he probably

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.550 
even if he hadn't amidst he probably
would<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.670> got<00:01:59.820> enough<00:02:00.149> time<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:01.200> shoot

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
would have got enough time to shoot

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.450 
would have got enough time to shoot
again<00:02:01.710> when<00:02:02.340> she<00:02:02.490> didn't<00:02:03.799> this<00:02:04.799> was<00:02:04.950> real<00:02:05.130> I

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
again when she didn't this was real I

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.609 
again when she didn't this was real I

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
I'm really watching the spawn flip so my

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.190 
I'm really watching the spawn flip so my
team<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.800> actually<00:02:39.070> pushing<00:02:39.520> over<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.200> what

team is actually pushing over and what
I've<00:02:41.320> noticed<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.250> guys<00:02:42.610> can<00:02:42.880> check<00:02:43.450> this

I've noticed and you guys can check this

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.760 
I've noticed and you guys can check this
out<00:02:43.810> maybe<00:02:43.990> do<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> little<00:02:44.230> more<00:02:44.410> research<00:02:44.590> than

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
out maybe do a little more research than

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.280 
out maybe do a little more research than
myself<00:02:45.150> eating<00:02:46.150> tell<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.390> team<00:02:46.720> especially<00:02:46.990> in

myself eating tell a team especially in
team<00:02:47.440> deathmatch<00:02:47.590> pushes<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.520> I<00:02:48.610> missed<00:02:48.850> it

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
team deathmatch pushes and I missed it

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.280 
team deathmatch pushes and I missed it
right<00:02:49.120> here<00:02:49.300> I<00:02:49.480> was<00:02:49.690> hoping<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.960> grab<00:02:50.110> the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
right here I was hoping to grab the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.500 
right here I was hoping to grab the
sponsor<00:02:50.740> any<00:02:51.190> time<00:02:51.400> they<00:02:51.520> push<00:02:51.820> past<00:02:52.150> it

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
sponsor any time they push past it

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.330 
sponsor any time they push past it
almost<00:02:53.260> seems<00:02:53.470> like<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.650> half<00:02:53.890> way<00:02:54.100> that

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
almost seems like the half way that

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.890 
almost seems like the half way that
three-quarter<00:02:54.760> mark<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.270> get<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.540> spawn<00:02:55.750> to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
three-quarter mark you get the spawn to

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.100 
three-quarter mark you get the spawn to
flip<00:02:56.310> if<00:02:57.310> you're<00:02:57.460> actually<00:02:57.640> over<00:02:58.270> there<00:02:58.480> when

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
flip if you're actually over there when

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.540 
flip if you're actually over there when
the<00:02:59.230> spot<00:02:59.500> flips<00:02:59.830> all<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.070> takes<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:00.340> one

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
the spot flips all it takes is one

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.280 
the spot flips all it takes is one
person<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.880> spawn<00:03:01.180> in<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.750> can<00:03:01.900> grab<00:03:02.110> the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
person to spawn in you can grab the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.360 
person to spawn in you can grab the
