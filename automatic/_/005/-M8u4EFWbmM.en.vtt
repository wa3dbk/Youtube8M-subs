00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.010 
real nice shine for a couple seconds and
then<00:03:45.230> it's<00:03:45.380> gonna<00:03:45.470> fog<00:03:45.830> over<00:03:46.220> again<00:03:47.020> basically

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
and you can see that it's already I

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.260 
and you can see that it's already I
lucked<00:04:49.030> out<00:04:49.210> this<00:04:49.270> time<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:51.310> got<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:51.970> nice

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.840 
lucked out this time and got a nice
shine<00:04:52.990> on<00:04:53.230> there<00:04:53.520> so<00:04:54.570> just<00:04:55.570> gonna<00:04:56.580> shine<00:04:57.580> this

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
shine on there so just gonna shine this

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.180 
shine on there so just gonna shine this
with<00:04:58.120> a<00:04:58.150> regular<00:04:58.570> dry<00:04:59.110> cloth<00:04:59.470> or<00:04:59.830> a<00:04:59.919> cotton

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
with a regular dry cloth or a cotton

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.050 
with a regular dry cloth or a cotton
ball<00:05:00.490> that's<00:05:01.150> all<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.450> fogginess<00:05:01.930> is<00:05:02.290> going

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
ball that's all the fogginess is going

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.830 
ball that's all the fogginess is going
then<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.180> should<00:05:04.360> have<00:05:04.540> a<00:05:04.570> nice<00:05:06.840> mirroring

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
then you should have a nice mirroring

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:15.230 
then you should have a nice mirroring
coat<00:05:08.169> on<00:05:08.770> there

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.650 

fogging<00:05:16.240> it<00:05:16.540> up<00:05:17.520> will<00:05:18.520> help<00:05:18.760> you<00:05:18.970> get<00:05:19.390> that

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
fogging it up will help you get that

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:53.520 
fogging it up will help you get that
mirror<00:05:20.590> finish<00:05:22.440> which<00:05:23.440> is<00:05:23.680> crucial

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.059 

yeah

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:00.480 

he's<00:05:57.490> pretty<00:05:57.759> decent<00:05:58.180> a<00:05:59.099> couple<00:06:00.099> more<00:06:00.279> coats

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
he's pretty decent a couple more coats

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.480 
he's pretty decent a couple more coats
like<00:06:00.879> that<00:06:01.150> per<00:06:01.539> boot<00:06:01.869> you<00:06:02.439> should<00:06:02.770> have<00:06:03.009> a

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
like that per boot you should have a

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.239 
like that per boot you should have a
well<00:06:04.449> enough<00:06:04.749> shined<00:06:05.369> boot<00:06:06.369> for<00:06:06.669> the<00:06:06.759> Academy

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:08.249 
well enough shined boot for the Academy

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:16.409 
well enough shined boot for the Academy
this<00:06:09.249> is<00:06:09.399> everyday<00:06:12.779> basically<00:06:14.879> your<00:06:15.879> boot<00:06:16.210> is

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
this is everyday basically your boot is

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.619 
this is everyday basically your boot is
not<00:06:16.659> shiny<00:06:17.139> enough<00:06:17.289> until<00:06:18.129> you<00:06:19.029> can<00:06:19.270> see<00:06:19.599> the

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629 
not shiny enough until you can see the

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.779 
not shiny enough until you can see the
reflection<00:06:20.559> in<00:06:20.589> your<00:06:20.710> face<00:06:21.039> pretty<00:06:21.430> clearly

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
reflection in your face pretty clearly

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.969 
reflection in your face pretty clearly
when<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:22.210> boot<00:06:22.539> is<00:06:22.689> on<00:06:22.809> your<00:06:23.020> foot<00:06:23.319> looking

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
when the boot is on your foot looking

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.029 
when the boot is on your foot looking
down<00:06:24.249> so<00:06:25.210> if<00:06:25.569> you're<00:06:25.719> six<00:06:26.050> feet<00:06:26.229> tall<00:06:26.559> like<00:06:26.589> I

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
down so if you're six feet tall like I

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.320 
down so if you're six feet tall like I
am<00:06:29.099> you<00:06:30.099> need<00:06:30.279> to<00:06:30.339> be<00:06:30.490> able<00:06:30.639> to<00:06:30.759> see<00:06:30.999> pretty

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
am you need to be able to see pretty

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.480 
am you need to be able to see pretty
clearly<00:06:31.539> a<00:06:32.080> reflection<00:06:32.770> of<00:06:32.860> your<00:06:32.949> face<00:06:33.249> from

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
clearly a reflection of your face from
