00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
mini twists so this is the two I guess

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.479 
mini twists so this is the two I guess
you<00:00:29.039> would<00:00:29.160> call<00:00:29.189> switch<00:00:29.670> roles<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> back

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
you would call switch roles in the back

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.310 
you would call switch roles in the back
you<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.700> see<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:34.820> then<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.149> pompadour<00:00:36.989> in

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.250 
you can see it and then the pompadour in
the<00:00:37.530> front<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.910> her<00:00:39.300> style<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.960> look<00:00:40.079> our
