ring lately and unfortunately it's

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.910 
ring lately and unfortunately it's
simply<00:03:17.819> because<00:03:17.849> as<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:19.319> mentioned<00:03:19.440> before

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
simply because as I mentioned before

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.330 
simply because as I mentioned before
I've<00:03:20.549> gained<00:03:21.359> about<00:03:21.620> 17<00:03:22.620> pounds<00:03:23.040> since<00:03:23.159> my

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
I've gained about 17 pounds since my

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.699 
I've gained about 17 pounds since my
last<00:03:23.519> cut<00:03:23.909> so<00:03:24.659> it<00:03:25.400> no<00:03:26.400> longer<00:03:26.430> fits<00:03:27.349> now<00:03:28.349> I

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
last cut so it no longer fits now I

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.649 
last cut so it no longer fits now I
could<00:03:29.159> probably<00:03:29.489> get<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.000> on<00:03:30.209> there<00:03:30.450> but

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
could probably get it on there but

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.770 
could probably get it on there but
getting<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:31.109> off<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.590> always<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.250> task<00:03:32.879> so<00:03:33.510> I

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
getting it off is always a task so I

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.839 
getting it off is always a task so I
don't<00:03:34.349> wear<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:35.030> too<00:03:36.030> often<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:37.370> could<00:03:38.370> go<00:03:38.609> get

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
don't wear it too often I could go get

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.530 
don't wear it too often I could go get
it<00:03:38.970> resized<00:03:39.799> but<00:03:40.799> then<00:03:41.040> once<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.940> start<00:03:42.299> cutting

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
it resized but then once I start cutting

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.750 
it resized but then once I start cutting
it's<00:03:42.989> going<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.319> be<00:03:43.440> big<00:03:43.650> then<00:03:44.370> I'll<00:03:44.489> have<00:03:44.639> to
