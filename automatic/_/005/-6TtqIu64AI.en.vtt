there's<00:00:28.680> always<00:00:28.800> just<00:00:28.920> got<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> toaster<00:00:29.760> up

there's always just got a toaster up
front<00:00:30.150> randomly<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.900> he's<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:32.160> absolutely

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
front randomly and he's just absolutely

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.250 
front randomly and he's just absolutely
obliterating<00:00:33.390> them<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.660> playing<00:00:33.930> out<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.170> his

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
obliterating them and playing out of his

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.479 
obliterating them and playing out of his
skin<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.559> he<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:34.860> shouldn't<00:00:35.100> be<00:00:35.160> able<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.370> do

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
skin and he just shouldn't be able to do

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.370 
skin and he just shouldn't be able to do
that<00:00:35.640> because<00:00:35.790> he's<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.149> six<00:00:36.420> chemistry<00:00:36.809> so

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
that because he's on six chemistry so

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.720 
that because he's on six chemistry so
what<00:00:37.469> I've<00:00:37.559> decided<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.309> go<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.610> get

what I've decided to do is go and get
meself<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.149> there<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.390> stick<00:00:39.780> him<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:39.960> this

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
meself in there so stick him in this

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.440 
meself in there so stick him in this
team<00:00:40.500> which<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.309> see<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.030> screen<00:00:42.239> now

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
team which you can see on the screen now

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.150 
team which you can see on the screen now
with<00:00:42.899> basically<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> standard

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
with basically just the standard

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.850 
with basically just the standard
overpowered<00:00:44.910> sweaty<00:00:45.420> team<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.870> then<00:00:46.320> stick<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
overpowered sweaty team and then stick a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.950 
overpowered sweaty team and then stick a
toe<00:00:46.920> up<00:00:47.219> front<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.700> six<00:00:48.120> chemistry<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:48.899> if

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
toe up front on six chemistry and see if

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.299 
toe up front on six chemistry and see if
he<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> business<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.770> see<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.100> he<00:00:50.190> is

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
he can do the business and see if he is

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.400 
he can do the business and see if he is
actually<00:00:50.460> horrendously<00:00:51.300> overpowered<00:00:51.780> like

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
actually horrendously overpowered like

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.160 
actually horrendously overpowered like
people<00:00:52.860> say<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.879> my<00:00:54.149> first<00:00:54.360> port<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.780> call<00:00:54.840> was

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
people say so my first port of call was

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.810 
people say so my first port of call was
to<00:00:55.350> check<00:00:55.500> his<00:00:55.649> in-game<00:00:55.980> stats<00:00:56.250> now<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.699> is

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
to check his in-game stats now this is

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.880 
to check his in-game stats now this is
the<00:00:56.940> same<00:00:57.149> card<00:00:57.600> or<00:00:57.899> vessel<00:00:58.199> he's<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.770> in

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the same card or vessel he's just in

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.470 
the same card or vessel he's just in
different<00:00:59.039> teams<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.640> in<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.090> team<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
different teams so in the team on the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000 
different teams so in the team on the
left<00:01:00.750> he's<00:01:00.870> got<00:01:01.020> six<00:01:01.230> chem<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> team

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
left he's got six chem and on the team

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.009 
left he's got six chem and on the team
on<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> right<00:01:02.399> he's<00:01:02.640> got<00:01:02.789> nine<00:01:03.030> chem<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.690> both

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
on the right he's got nine chem in both

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.630 
on the right he's got nine chem in both
teams<00:01:04.320> he's<00:01:04.559> got<00:01:04.739> large<00:01:04.979> morale<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.489> that's

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
teams he's got large morale so that's

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.429 
teams he's got large morale so that's
why<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> sorta<00:01:06.150> stats<00:01:06.600> are<00:01:06.810> slightly<00:01:07.170> higher

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
why I sorta stats are slightly higher

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.990 
why I sorta stats are slightly higher
than<00:01:07.950> what<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.189> shows<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.850> Ted<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
than what it shows on for Ted and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.550 
than what it shows on for Ted and
footways<00:01:09.450> however<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.229> see<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:10.530> are

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
footways however you can see they are

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.590 
footways however you can see they are
literally<00:01:11.070> exactly<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.729> same<00:01:11.909> seven<00:01:12.360> six

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
literally exactly the same seven six

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.120 
literally exactly the same seven six
chemistry<00:01:12.990> made<00:01:13.229> no<00:01:13.470> difference<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.010> his

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
chemistry made no difference to his

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.770 
chemistry made no difference to his
stats<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.150> only<00:01:15.240> way<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.420> could<00:01:15.630> make

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
stats at all the only way it could make

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630 
stats at all the only way it could make
a<00:01:15.810> difference<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> way<00:01:16.470> he<00:01:16.590> played<00:01:16.799> was<00:01:17.400> if

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
a difference to the way he played was if

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.670 
a difference to the way he played was if
EA<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.210> got<00:01:18.330> some<00:01:18.570> form<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.049> script<00:01:19.500> or

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
EA have got some form of like script or

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.230 
EA have got some form of like script or
script<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.340> even<00:01:20.580> exists<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> make

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
pretty good goals he's still extremely

pretty good goals he's still extremely
quick<00:02:10.050> obviously<00:02:10.500> because<00:02:10.649> his<00:02:10.800> stats

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
quick obviously because his stats

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.589 
quick obviously because his stats

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
he's on six chemistry there's a myth

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.710 
he's on six chemistry there's a myth
going<00:02:20.130> around<00:02:20.460> that<00:02:20.760> when<00:02:21.210> he's<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:21.450> six

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
going around that when he's on six

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.970 
going around that when he's on six
chemistry<00:02:22.080> he's<00:02:22.230> better<00:02:22.500> than<00:02:22.650> he<00:02:22.710> is<00:02:22.770> when

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
chemistry he's better than he is when

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.530 
chemistry he's better than he is when
he's<00:02:23.100> on<00:02:23.190> nine<00:02:23.400> chemistry<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.240> have<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.450> say

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
he's on nine chemistry and I have to say

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.090 
he's on nine chemistry and I have to say
that<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:24.900> isn't<00:02:25.110> true<00:02:25.260> but<00:02:25.620> he<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.800> literally

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
that just isn't true but he is literally

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.130 
that just isn't true but he is literally
exactly<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.850> same<00:02:27.000> player<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> six

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
exactly the same player so the six

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.080 
exactly the same player so the six
chemist<00:02:28.440> etho<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.010> better<00:02:29.460> than<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.940> nine

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
chemist etho is better than the nine

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.820 
chemist etho is better than the nine
cameto<00:02:30.450> but<00:02:30.780> not<00:02:30.960> because<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.230> in-game<00:02:31.560> stuff

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
cameto but not because of in-game stuff

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.110 
cameto but not because of in-game stuff
so<00:02:32.010> how<00:02:32.160> he<00:02:32.220> plays<00:02:32.460> in<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.640> nothing<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:32.880> that

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
so how he plays in a nothing like that

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.760 
so how he plays in a nothing like that
just<00:02:33.720> for<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.930> fact<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.410> can<00:02:34.530> put<00:02:34.680> him

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
just for the fact that you can put him
