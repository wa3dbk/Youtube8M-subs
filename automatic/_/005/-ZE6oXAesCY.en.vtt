spectrum and a really good lighting it's
doing<00:00:36.000> really<00:00:36.210> well<00:00:36.450> with<00:00:36.630> my<00:00:36.660> low-light

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
doing really well with my low-light

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.930 
doing really well with my low-light
plants<00:00:37.559> here<00:00:37.770> although<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.399> don't<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:38.730> I'd

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
plants here although I don't think I'd

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.389 
plants here although I don't think I'd
try<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.480> really<00:00:39.660> well<00:00:40.110> lit<00:00:40.290> tank<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
try it for a really well lit tank the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.490 
try it for a really well lit tank the
thing<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.700> like<00:00:41.910> about<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.480> lighting<00:00:43.140> strip

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
thing I like about this lighting strip

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.750 
thing I like about this lighting strip
though<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.160> features<00:00:45.440> as<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.520> see

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
though are the features as you can see

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.700 
though are the features as you can see
we<00:00:48.210> got<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.360> lightning<00:00:48.719> storm<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.469> right

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
we got a lightning storm going on right

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.299 
we got a lightning storm going on right
now<00:00:50.629> there<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:51.780> three<00:00:52.079> storm<00:00:53.070> settings<00:00:55.309> this

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
now there are three storm settings this

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.380 
now there are three storm settings this
one<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.640> course<00:00:56.820> being<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> first<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.690> them

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.579 

and<00:01:03.390> here's<00:01:03.600> another<00:01:03.690> one<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> bit

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
and here's another one with a bit

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.280 
and here's another one with a bit
gentler<00:01:05.189> lightning<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:09.810> third<00:01:10.020> one

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
gentler lightning and the third one

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.620 
gentler lightning and the third one
which<00:01:10.470> brings<00:01:10.770> us<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.280> daylight<00:01:11.760> fading<00:01:12.330> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
which brings us to a daylight fading to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.890 
which brings us to a daylight fading to
a<00:01:12.659> moonlight<00:01:12.900> storm<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:15.030> also<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
a moonlight storm you also have the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.850 
a moonlight storm you also have the
option<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.380> cloud<00:01:16.619> cover<00:01:17.150> this<00:01:18.150> saw<00:01:18.860> imitates

lights<00:01:24.119> along<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.820> fading<00:01:26.820> into<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.119> blue

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
lights along with fading into the blue

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.069 
lights along with fading into the blue
spectrum<00:01:28.310> here<00:01:29.310> you'll<00:01:29.490> get<00:01:29.670> higher<00:01:30.360> Blues<00:01:30.750> in

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
spectrum here you'll get higher Blues in

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.149 
spectrum here you'll get higher Blues in
and<00:01:31.259> out<00:01:31.549> a<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:33.090> bit<00:01:33.240> more<00:01:33.450> cloud<00:01:33.780> cover

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
and out a little bit more cloud cover

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.499 
and out a little bit more cloud cover
you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.310> adjust<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> cloud<00:01:36.000> cover<00:01:36.270> there's<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
you can adjust the cloud cover there's a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.109 
you can adjust the cloud cover there's a
heavy<00:01:36.720> one<00:01:36.900> there's<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.229> lighter<00:01:37.439> one

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
heavy one there's a lighter one

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.130 
heavy one there's a lighter one
and<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:39.750> there's<00:01:39.990> also<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:42.140> red

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
and you can all there's also a red

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.620 
and you can all there's also a red
spectrum<00:01:43.729> let's<00:01:44.729> see<00:01:44.850> if<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.000> want<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.390> red

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
spectrum let's see if you want to do red

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.420 
spectrum let's see if you want to do red
spectrum<00:01:45.960> lighting<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.590> cloud<00:01:46.740> cover<00:01:49.430> in

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
spectrum lighting and cloud cover in

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.170 
spectrum lighting and cloud cover in
addition<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:52.939> sunrise<00:01:53.939> and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
addition to that you have sunrise and

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.080 
addition to that you have sunrise and
sunset<00:01:54.720> setting<00:01:55.369> which<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.399> kind<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.880> pretty

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
sunset setting which is kind of pretty

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.450 
sunset setting which is kind of pretty
and<00:01:57.360> then<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.590> go<00:01:58.740> into<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.130> different

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460

lunar<00:02:03.390> lights<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:04.500> have<00:02:04.530> one<00:02:04.890> that's<00:02:05.159> a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
lunar lights you have one that's a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.630 
lunar lights you have one that's a
little<00:02:05.700> less<00:02:05.969> intense<00:02:07.220> with<00:02:08.220> some<00:02:08.399> cloud

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
little less intense with some cloud

and<00:02:12.490> yet<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:14.730> third<00:02:15.730> one<00:02:16.000> here<00:02:16.360> for<00:02:17.350> lowlights

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
and yet a a third one here for lowlights

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.760 
and yet a a third one here for lowlights
in<00:02:18.880> addition<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.810> have<00:02:19.840> preset

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
in addition to that you have preset

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.770 
in addition to that you have preset
spectrums

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
spectrums

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.540 
spectrums
I'll<00:02:22.780> just<00:02:23.050> go<00:02:23.200> run<00:02:23.410> through<00:02:23.620> them<00:02:23.830> quickly

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.300 

purples<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:28.410> here's<00:02:29.410> what<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.680> use<00:02:29.920> for<00:02:30.130> most

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
purples and here's what I use for most

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.050 
purples and here's what I use for most
of<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:30.550> day<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.210> your<00:02:31.260> all<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.320> lights

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
of the day this is your all the lights

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.600 
of the day this is your all the lights
really<00:02:34.060> good<00:02:34.210> spectrum<00:02:34.510> for<00:02:35.070> plant<00:02:36.070> growth<00:02:36.310> so

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
really good spectrum for plant growth so

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.210 
really good spectrum for plant growth so
far<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.120> then<00:02:38.020> you<00:02:38.140> just<00:02:38.350> have<00:02:38.500> your<00:02:38.740> whites

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
far and then you just have your whites

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.620 
far and then you just have your whites
if<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.640> want<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:39.910> use<00:02:40.030> just<00:02:40.240> through<00:02:40.450> full

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
if you want to use just through full

colors and save them in memory it's

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.700 
colors and save them in memory it's
really<00:02:52.870> neat<00:02:53.020> and<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.770> all<00:02:53.920> works<00:02:54.220> on<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.990> remote

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
really neat and it all works on a remote

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.710 
really neat and it all works on a remote
control<00:02:57.190> believe<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:57.670> or<00:02:57.790> not<00:02:57.910> not<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.480> great

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
control believe it or not not a great

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.030 
control believe it or not not a great
remote<00:02:59.080> control<00:02:59.380> but<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.650> works<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:02.860> is

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
remote control but it works and that is

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.040 
remote control but it works and that is
it<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.520> is<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.700> lighting<00:03:04.210> lighting<00:03:04.480> system

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
it that is the lighting lighting system

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.240 
it that is the lighting lighting system
for<00:03:06.570> my<00:03:07.570> tank<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.470> think<00:03:08.650> it's<00:03:08.740> a<00:03:08.890> it's<00:03:09.130> a

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
for my tank and I think it's a it's a

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.740 
for my tank and I think it's a it's a
really<00:03:09.580> neat<00:03:09.850> option<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.360> wasn't<00:03:10.660> too

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
really neat option it wasn't too

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.000 
really neat option it wasn't too
expensive<00:03:11.140> when<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.470> start<00:03:11.740> looking<00:03:11.980> at

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
expensive when you start looking at

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.620 
expensive when you start looking at
lighting<00:03:12.310> strips<00:03:12.580> so<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.910> really<00:03:13.270> spend<00:03:13.570> a

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
lighting strips so you really spend a

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.270 
lighting strips so you really spend a
lot<00:03:13.810> more<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.230> get<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.350> lot<00:03:14.560> less<00:03:14.590> that's<00:03:15.130> for

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
lot more and get a lot less that's for

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.170 
lot more and get a lot less that's for
