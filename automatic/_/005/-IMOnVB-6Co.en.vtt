00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 go a little fun and creativity 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.610
 I start by isolating the bottles 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.170
 glass in my little tin can the goal 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.890
 of the demo can be to do them 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.900
 soften to deform them I already 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.550
 tried in the past to soften 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.769
 green following this process but my 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.240
 burns was not powerful enough with 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.740
 this one of meals too much to have 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.330
 problem 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.880
 it's a burner blow I already have you 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.289
 makes a presentation of it and the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:40.980
 heat output is clearly 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:42.930
 higher I push the climb into 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.629
 temperature until you get a color 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.430
 cherry red on the bottles alas the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.430
 green will gradually be global 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.500
 with pliers I will remove the 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.150
 bottles to avoid breakage and 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.190
 cracks it will follow the different 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.270
 levels of cooking in winter that you 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.270
 find in other videos 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.079
 with the glass we will avoid anyway 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.700
 big thermal shocks so that's why 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.659
 that you see a flame that is blue 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.369
 and yellow to have some time to 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.799
 softening some euro time 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.340
 then sounds short let's go all this is 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.340
 quite technical 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.770
 we can see that the heat has even made 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:40.980
 welded some bottles that constitutes 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:42.600
 now a room in itself others have 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.640
 took nice shapes that we can 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.940
 reuse as a base or objects of 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.940
 Deco 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.150
 and here I hope that this video you 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.040
 will please feel free to share it and 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.070
 to subscribe to the al chain and to very 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.070
 soon
