00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
that's how it's recommended but it's a

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.560 
that's how it's recommended but it's a
little<00:04:13.370> bit<00:04:13.490> darker<00:04:13.910> than<00:04:14.060> my<00:04:14.180> skin<00:04:14.210> tone

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
little bit darker than my skin tone

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.930 
little bit darker than my skin tone
which<00:04:14.780> is<00:04:14.810> what<00:04:15.140> I<00:04:15.170> like<00:04:15.440> because<00:04:15.860> my<00:04:16.370> body<00:04:16.790> is

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
which is what I like because my body is

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.760 
which is what I like because my body is
a<00:04:17.090> lot<00:04:17.360> Tanner<00:04:17.630> than<00:04:17.780> my<00:04:17.900> face<00:04:18.140> so<00:04:18.410> this<00:04:18.530> kind

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
a lot Tanner than my face so this kind

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.920 
a lot Tanner than my face so this kind
of<00:04:18.800> bounces<00:04:19.370> it<00:04:19.550> out<00:04:19.670> and<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.209> really<00:04:20.630> love<00:04:20.780> how

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
of bounces it out and I really love how

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.110 
of bounces it out and I really love how
this<00:04:21.110> is<00:04:21.170> it's<00:04:21.500> like<00:04:21.650> liquid<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.190> powder<00:04:22.340> so<00:04:23.090> I

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
this is it's like liquid to powder so I

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.090 
this is it's like liquid to powder so I
just<00:04:23.360> use<00:04:23.510> this<00:04:23.630> all<00:04:23.840> over<00:04:24.170> my<00:04:24.320> face<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:24.830> I
