00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.140
 we play to perform feels problem of complex numbers is telling me that 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.820
 calculate the value of the kills 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.930
 so that the quotient one plus three equis i 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.919
 match of 3-4 and a tribute is made 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.039
 the section a 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.070
 very well then I will do it is cáceres and quotient 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.450
 is to pay the real part and imaginary pat of the opposite to do what is 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.390
 doing on each leg of the environment 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.630
 that the quotient one plus 3 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.710
 photo x 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.699
 match of three - 4 i 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.990
 that what we do when we go to the so-called 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.540
 a part a number with imaginary pat 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.730
 we have to multiply and divide by with nominated players 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.229
 that is, we have to 

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:42.360
 multiply and divide 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.750
 3 more 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.340
 4 i 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.560
 party of three 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.720
 4 I started with play that there is a minor 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.080
 so here you know here and here they get more 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.330
 it's like jumping that product will be 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.460
 efe one plus 13 x and for three +4 and 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.410
 3 one per subject which king 3-4 and 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.630
 3 x and three were 9 x 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.680
 and more 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.380
 climbed 4 12 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.590
 xy square 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.880
 and down it stays three by three 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.020
 more climbed 4 12 and as in three by four 12 i 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.770
 and less for more 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.770
 16 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.350
 now where is he and square we have to replaced by 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.840
 well we make this change of background has started here and here 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.350
 replaced by 2-1 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.270
 3 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.820
 plus 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.820
 to the group whatever comes and 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.869
 this has 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.090
 and this one has four more children for x 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.470
 and all for and 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.310
 and later 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.609
 the fourth site with something else to say 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.880
 - 12 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.770
 match 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.659
 9 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.440
 here it is 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.829
 pto and this post and -2 6% 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.829
 and squares era - 16 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.879
 I keep multiplying our 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.439
 - 12 x 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.669
 4 +9 x 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:30.829
 and here party d 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.089
 9 - for less plus 16 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:37.469
 she just part imaginary realitat part 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.529
 3 - 12 x 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:41.829
 match of this unique building 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:42.679
 plus 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:44.230
 4 +9 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.889
 x 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.569
 in this the final patina we are published by idc 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.129
 difficult match 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.509
 Well, text is 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.869
 the quotient separated in part real 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:58.469
 this will be the real part 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.469
 i this will be the final part nobody 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:05.639
 well, adam are saying 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:10.229
 catón akular the value of X to be a number of samoa 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:15.079
 real means that the imaginary peace is zero was I ago the patina gil arias 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.349
 what is this 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.239
 then 0 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.070
 plus 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.939
 9 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:22.830
 x 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.650
 and matches of 25 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.369
 it equaled zero because they're telling me 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:31.869
 so much this happens multiplying I have 4 more 9 x 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.869
 equal to zero 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:39.459
 9 x equal to -4 therefore equal x 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.779
 that's what it has to be worth x 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:45.269
 for that to be a 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.019
 the real number 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.469
 I asked that I have it 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:52.819
 the section in is saying that it is a pure imaginary imaginary number pure 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.019
 means that it has no real part is to say that this is learned very well 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.539
 now that 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:00.089
 12 by X 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:02.059
 and match of 25 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:06.309
 it equaled to zero this happens multiplying the fiscal remains 3-2 tx 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:07.319
 equal to zero 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.319
 therefore 3 equal to 12 x 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.619
 is the same as the one that was at three and 12 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.479
 and between 3 is 1 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.109
 from four therefore 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.109
 x equal to a quarter 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.509
 is the value that avoids having x for what 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.949
 has imagined being able to say that the real part is 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.979
 have more exercise just go to and website p 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.039
 how it resolves point blunted tele
