00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
change and at any time you can drag some

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.510 
change and at any time you can drag some
of<00:00:56.860> these<00:00:56.950> out<00:00:57.250> that's<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.120> noise<00:00:58.770> gate<00:00:59.770> the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
of these out that's the noise gate the

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.170 
of these out that's the noise gate the
walls<00:01:00.820> there's<00:01:01.750> echoes<00:01:02.670> more<00:01:03.670> effects<00:01:03.970> and<00:01:04.150> I

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
walls there's echoes more effects and I

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.760 
walls there's echoes more effects and I
could<00:01:04.360> probably<00:01:04.540> even<00:01:05.050> remember<00:01:05.440> let<00:01:05.560> alone

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
could probably even remember let alone

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.340 
could probably even remember let alone
mention<00:01:06.220> but<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:06.940> idea<00:01:07.270> is<00:01:07.360> whatever<00:01:07.900> kind<00:01:08.260> of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
mention but the idea is whatever kind of

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.960 
mention but the idea is whatever kind of
music<00:01:08.650> you<00:01:08.770> like<00:01:08.980> you<00:01:09.160> can<00:01:09.310> probably<00:01:09.550> dial<00:01:09.850> up
