the sigma f30 and this is just a sephora

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.569 
the sigma f30 and this is just a sephora
mineral<00:00:35.440> powder<00:00:35.620> it<00:00:35.800> was<00:00:35.920> like<00:00:36.039> about<00:00:36.219> ten

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
mineral powder it was like about ten

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.049 
mineral powder it was like about ten
dollars<00:00:36.730> at<00:00:37.030> sephora<00:00:37.390> and<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:39.370> is<00:00:39.609> a<00:00:39.640> very

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
dollars at sephora and this is a very

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.569 
dollars at sephora and this is a very
loose<00:00:40.809> powder<00:00:41.379> as<00:00:41.710> you<00:00:41.859> can<00:00:42.039> probably<00:00:42.309> tell

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
loose powder as you can probably tell

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.569 
loose powder as you can probably tell
and<00:00:43.059> loose<00:00:43.960> powders<00:00:44.410> give<00:00:44.890> a<00:00:45.100> lot<00:00:45.399> more

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
and loose powders give a lot more

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.240 
and loose powders give a lot more
coverage<00:00:46.059> in<00:00:46.239> my<00:00:46.359> opinion<00:00:46.690> but<00:00:47.620> obviously

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
coverage in my opinion but obviously

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.779 
coverage in my opinion but obviously
loose<00:00:48.699> powders<00:00:49.089> are<00:00:49.300> very<00:00:49.690> very<00:00:50.170> messy<00:00:50.620> so<00:00:51.280> um

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
loose powders are very very messy so um

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.240 
loose powders are very very messy so um
they're<00:00:52.660> gonna<00:00:52.839> cause<00:00:53.140> a<00:00:53.170> really<00:00:53.649> big<00:00:53.800> mess<00:00:54.039> if

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
they're gonna cause a really big mess if

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.400 
they're gonna cause a really big mess if
you're<00:00:54.370> not<00:00:54.460> careful<00:00:54.670> with<00:00:54.999> them<00:00:55.120> so<00:00:55.839> I<00:00:55.870> like

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410
