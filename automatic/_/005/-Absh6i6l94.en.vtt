00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.020
 hello, I'm the Charlie and I'm 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.520
 recording this because of the multiple 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.639
 questions that came up from the video 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.950
 previous where it showed some batteries that 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.900
 are activated with water all over the world from 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.430
 products and could be reloaded 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:26.099
 just with water and good I asked 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.349
 to the suppliers and affirm that yes but 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.779
 the manufacturer states that no then there is 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.040
 some discrepancies so what better 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.040
 to check for myself 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.550
 the methodology is in fact quite 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.880
 simple 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.810
 I have the batteries here in this 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.810
 internal 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.840
 the waters 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.290
 and I'm going to let the flashlight turn on 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.199
 the night and the batteries are spent very 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.780
 elaborated my methodology and once 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:09.880
 they download good I go to my report and 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:14.190
 they are delivering to try to get him out 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.230
 all the energy that i 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.320
 and I'll go back to fill them with water 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.659
 see if they really recharge with water 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.640
 it's little idiot this because there should be 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.170
 done this for the previous video but in 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.890
 end as 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.890
 so 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.430
 first I'm going to close this 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:45.510
 and light and I'll let internet be 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.850
 all night he had 7 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.420
 and so we take advantage of seeing how is the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.290
 performance of these batteries 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.920
 cast 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.920
 let's see 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.370
 after the 5th sense in performance 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.530
 falls considerably and the lantern already 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.190
 does not illuminate the same as before after 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.740
 12 hours you hardly see a point and just 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.500
 illuminates but the batteries continue with 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.170
 charge then you must keep three days 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.140
 the flashlight is turned on and it looks like 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.120
 it was completely downloaded because 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.120
 work hits you a flash 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.829
 can not maintain a lens 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.980
 and if we measure it with the text 0.2 volts 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.209
 quite less than the initial 1.6 in 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.640
 we'll see if these issues are 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.650
 they can recharge we are going to leave it there 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.900
 about five or ten minutes and let's see 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.760
 what's going to be 10 minutes like that 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.900
 that now we are going to see if indeed 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.900
 They charged 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.130
 my name is 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.350
 filling them with water causes them to 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.350
 recover a little load which I doubt 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.690
 do not 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:28.540
 12 if they were like 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.540
 actually 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:37.340
 and follow the voltage a bit but 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:41.450
 but just as it is in charge we do not see if 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:44.140
 they can do it again 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.140
 Flashlight 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:56.680
 it congealed if they descended 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.680
 to give equal is impressive 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.950
 it was quite poor 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.430
 but considering this performance 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.430
 that have 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.739
 could could they serve could be 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.329
 ideal for remote control by 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.949
 example the biggest one loading with water and 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.410
 like the remote controls almost 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:26.320
 consume current these batteries would last 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:30.550
 a lot and more over as they are almost 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.460
 plastic and can be recycled in order so 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.260
 like that gross they charge not but something 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.790
 you can recharge 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.200
 probably for applications that 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.410
 require very little current with the 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.940
 remote control is also so that already 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.410
 leave the doubt and see you next 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.410
