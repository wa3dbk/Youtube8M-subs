then you fill the water up to one of the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.320 
then you fill the water up to one of the
first<00:01:18.270> lines<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.369> I'm<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.119> use

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
first lines in here so I'm going to use

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.039 
first lines in here so I'm going to use
Brita<00:01:21.720> water<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.299> lukewarm<00:01:24.299> but<00:01:24.840> you

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
Brita water and this is lukewarm but you

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.620 
Brita water and this is lukewarm but you
can<00:01:25.229> use<00:01:25.409> cold<00:01:25.770> water<00:01:25.860> or<00:01:26.580> hot<00:01:26.909> water

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.080 

he<00:01:32.630> benefit<00:01:33.110> of<00:01:33.290> using<00:01:33.560> hot<00:01:34.250> water<00:01:34.490> is<00:01:34.790> that

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
he benefit of using hot water is that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.970 
he benefit of using hot water is that
the<00:01:35.270> soy<00:01:35.480> milk<00:01:35.750> is<00:01:35.900> made<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.140> lot<00:01:36.440> faster

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
the soy milk is made a lot faster

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.270 
the soy milk is made a lot faster
because<00:01:37.280> what<00:01:38.240> happened<00:01:39.110> is<00:01:39.320> this<00:01:39.770> metal<00:01:40.130> rod

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
because what happened is this metal rod

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.210 
because what happened is this metal rod
heats<00:01:40.790> up<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.330> water<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.870> 180<00:01:42.530> degrees<00:01:42.979> and

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
heats up the water to 180 degrees and

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.460 
heats up the water to 180 degrees and
then<00:01:43.460> after<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:44.180> pulverizes<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:45.020> soybeans

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
then after it pulverizes the soybeans

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.800 
then after it pulverizes the soybeans
and<00:01:45.740> any<00:01:45.950> other<00:01:46.130> combination<00:01:46.760> of<00:01:46.850> nuts<00:01:47.510> or

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
and any other combination of nuts or

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.440 
and any other combination of nuts or
grains<00:01:48.110> that<00:01:48.260> you<00:01:48.380> have<00:01:49.090> so<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.240> soya

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
grains that you have so the soya

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.570 
grains that you have so the soya
