different because I've lately been
focusing<00:00:08.940> on<00:00:09.090> amazes<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.200> how<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.380> can<00:00:10.530> use

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
focusing on amazes and how I can use

upstairs<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.070> my<00:00:14.190> lab<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> little<00:00:14.790> bit<00:00:14.910> into<00:00:15.089> a

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
upstairs of my lab a little bit into a

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.269 
upstairs of my lab a little bit into a
demonstration<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.949> I'm<00:00:17.100> going<00:00:17.250> to

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
demonstration of that and I'm going to

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.320 
demonstration of that and I'm going to
use<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> next<00:00:17.699> couple<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.000> advanced

I've<00:00:20.760> done<00:00:20.820> with<00:00:21.300> moon<00:00:21.539> crafts<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.260> make<00:00:22.289> mazes

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
I've done with moon crafts to make mazes

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.310 
I've done with moon crafts to make mazes
a<00:00:23.039> little<00:00:23.490> different<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.660> as<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.019> can<00:00:25.140> see

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
a little different so as you can see

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.849 
a little different so as you can see
I've<00:00:25.560> got<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> sort<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.310> shape<00:00:26.670> m<00:00:27.859> passageway

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
I've got a sort of a shape m passageway

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.200 
I've got a sort of a shape m passageway
here<00:00:29.330> if<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.420> hit<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.599> button<00:00:32.000> suddenly<00:00:33.000> it's

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
here if I hit this button suddenly it's

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.120 
here if I hit this button suddenly it's
different<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.320> that's<00:00:34.500> not<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:34.739> face

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
different and that's not just face

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.190 
different and that's not just face
blocks<00:00:35.430> that's<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.880> mixture<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.570> phase<00:00:36.899> blocks

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
blocks that's a mixture of phase blocks

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.459 
blocks that's a mixture of phase blocks
and<00:00:37.469> pistons<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:39.079> you<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.230> see

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
and pistons because them as you can see

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.260 
and pistons because them as you can see
I've<00:00:40.680> got<00:00:40.739> half<00:00:41.129> slabs<00:00:41.460> down<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.120> i<00:00:42.149> can

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
I've got half slabs down here so i can

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.819 
I've got half slabs down here so i can
activate<00:00:42.540> their<00:00:43.079> ruin<00:00:43.320> craft<00:00:43.590> pressure

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
activate their ruin craft pressure

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.040 
activate their ruin craft pressure
sensors<00:00:44.370> whilst<00:00:44.700> people<00:00:45.480> are<00:00:45.570> walking<00:00:45.719> over

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
sensors whilst people are walking over

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.110 
sensors whilst people are walking over
the<00:00:46.140> floor<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:47.280> i<00:00:47.309> need<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.270> that

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
the floor but i need to get it so that

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.270 
the floor but i need to get it so that
the<00:00:51.120> half<00:00:51.570> slab<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.079> replaced<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.890> solid

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
the half slab is replaced with a solid

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.670 
the half slab is replaced with a solid
brick<00:00:53.610> here<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.809> don't<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.320> then

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
brick here and I don't do that then

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.709 
brick here and I don't do that then
it'll<00:00:56.370> look<00:00:56.520> obvious<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.539> tell

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
it'll look obvious and you can tell

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.470 
it'll look obvious and you can tell
they'll<00:00:57.899> be<00:00:58.020> able<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.500> something<00:00:58.859> there<00:00:59.480> so

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
they'll be able to be something there so

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.450 
they'll be able to be something there so
this<00:01:00.899> patrol<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.590> basically<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.340> be

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
this patrol is basically going to be

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.609 
this patrol is basically going to be
about<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.969> switching<00:01:03.570> process<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.379> turns

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
about that switching process that turns

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.640 
about that switching process that turns
one<00:01:05.580> block<00:01:05.850> into<00:01:06.270> another<00:01:06.540> using<00:01:07.380> phase

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
one block into another using phase

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.060 
one block into another using phase
blocks<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.390> distance<00:01:09.590> start<00:01:10.590> off<00:01:10.680> I'm<00:01:10.920> going

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
blocks and distance start off I'm going

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.649 
blocks and distance start off I'm going
to<00:01:11.250> need<00:01:11.430> some<00:01:12.650> basics<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.520> line<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.090> those

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
to need some basics just a line of those

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.429 
to need some basics just a line of those
blocks<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.259> lock<00:01:16.409> block<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:18.380> I<00:01:19.380> need

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
blocks on the lock block here and I need

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.770 
blocks on the lock block here and I need
to<00:01:19.650> pick<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:19.860> which<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.400> want<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.670> replace<00:01:20.970> ok

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
to pick one which I want to replace ok

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.920 
to pick one which I want to replace ok
so<00:01:21.840> here's<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> setup<00:01:22.650> I've<00:01:23.009> got<00:01:23.570> two<00:01:24.570> sticky

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
so here's the setup I've got two sticky

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.749 
so here's the setup I've got two sticky
pistons<00:01:25.320> here<00:01:25.500> controlling<00:01:26.009> those<00:01:26.340> bottom

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
pistons here controlling those bottom

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.840 
pistons here controlling those bottom
steps<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.390> steps<00:01:28.170> behind<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:29.280> lock<00:01:29.610> block

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
steps and steps behind this lock block

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.420 
steps and steps behind this lock block
here<00:01:30.090> toggles<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.720> wall<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.189> what<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.220> want

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
here toggles this wall and what I want

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.840 
here toggles this wall and what I want
to<00:01:32.640> happen<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.049> face<00:01:35.040> blocks<00:01:35.310> toggle

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
to happen is for the face blocks toggle

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.940 
to happen is for the face blocks toggle
off<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.390> then<00:01:36.720> these<00:01:36.960> two<00:01:37.020> step<00:01:37.530> forward

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
off and then these two step forward

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.330 
off and then these two step forward
eggby<00:01:38.610> push<00:01:38.820> forwards<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.890> redstone

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
eggby push forwards but on the redstone

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.399 
eggby push forwards but on the redstone
signal<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:42.030> off<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.479> want<00:01:42.659> these<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.049> retract

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
signal going off I want these to retract

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.700 
signal going off I want these to retract
and<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.909> flick<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.259> one

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
and then this to flick in so it's a one

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.730 
and then this to flick in so it's a one
to<00:01:47.040> one<00:01:47.430> option<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.899> what<00:01:49.259> I'm<00:01:49.380> trying<00:01:49.619> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
to one option a is what I'm trying to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.580 
to one option a is what I'm trying to
create<00:01:49.950> with<00:01:50.220> redstone<00:01:50.549> here<00:01:51.079> now<00:01:52.079> from<00:01:52.470> this

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
create with redstone here now from this

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.830 
create with redstone here now from this
lever<00:01:52.860> here<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.520> found<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> best<00:01:54.360> way<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.810> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
lever here I found the best way is to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.310 
lever here I found the best way is to
have<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.560> pistons<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.840> two<00:01:57.840> or<00:01:57.869> three

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
have the pistons on a two or three

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.880 
have the pistons on a two or three
extension<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.100> then<00:01:59.820> leading<00:02:00.719> into<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.500> lock

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
extension and then leading into the lock

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.219 
extension and then leading into the lock
block<00:02:02.219> because<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:03.000> lesser-known<00:02:03.479> attribute

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
block because a lesser-known attribute

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.109 
block because a lesser-known attribute
of<00:02:04.290> lock<00:02:04.530> blocks<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.130> when<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.880> block<00:02:06.090> is

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
of lock blocks is when the block is

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.210 
of lock blocks is when the block is
powered<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> face<00:02:07.350> blocks<00:02:07.649> are<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:07.979> but

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
powered then the face blocks are on but

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.490 
powered then the face blocks are on but
if<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.520> block<00:02:08.729> itself<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.360> unpowered<00:02:09.690> then

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
if the block itself is unpowered then

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.990 
if the block itself is unpowered then
the<00:02:10.619> face<00:02:10.800> blocks<00:02:11.069> toggle<00:02:11.489> off<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.910> can

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
the face blocks toggle off so you can

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.490 
the face blocks toggle off so you can
actually<00:02:12.150> use<00:02:12.480> redstone<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:13.110> them

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
actually use redstone with them

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.990 
actually use redstone with them
directly<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.750> yes<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.610> found<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.700> best<00:02:17.910> way

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
directly and so yes I found the best way

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.270 
directly and so yes I found the best way
to<00:02:18.150> go<00:02:18.300> about<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.930> create<00:02:19.380> an<00:02:20.040> and

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
to go about this is to create an and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.420 
to go about this is to create an and
gate<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:22.070> to<00:02:23.070> run<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.120> way<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:26.040> first

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
gate and to run it that way the first

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.199 
gate and to run it that way the first
and<00:02:27.090> toggle<00:02:27.810> thing<00:02:27.990> there<00:02:28.350> should<00:02:29.280> be<00:02:29.550> instant

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
and toggle thing there should be instant

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.090 
and toggle thing there should be instant
and<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.750> second<00:02:31.170> one<00:02:31.290> over<00:02:31.500> here<00:02:31.830> should<00:02:32.070> be

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
and the second one over here should be

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.470 
and the second one over here should be
on<00:02:32.370> for<00:02:34.400> put<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> piece<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.640> line<00:02:36.209> in<00:02:36.390> between

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
on for put a piece of line in between

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.180 
on for put a piece of line in between
there<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.860> first<00:02:38.340> thing<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.730> happens<00:02:39.060> is

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
there so the first thing that happens is

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.940 
there so the first thing that happens is
well<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.340> shall<00:02:41.610> demonstrate<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.950> without

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
well I shall demonstrate to you without

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.070 
well I shall demonstrate to you without
having<00:02:44.580> anything<00:02:44.850> live<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:47.370> see<00:02:47.580> when<00:02:48.570> this

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
having anything live you see when this

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.070 
having anything live you see when this
toggles<00:02:49.650> off<00:02:50.360> first<00:02:51.360> thing<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.660> happens<00:02:51.930> is

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
toggles off first thing that happens is

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.100 
toggles off first thing that happens is
this<00:02:52.260> torch<00:02:52.680> turns<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:54.510> turns<00:02:54.870> off

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
this torch turns on and that turns off

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.990 
this torch turns on and that turns off
then<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.340> goes<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:57.320> then<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.530> goes<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.910> the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
then this goes and then that goes so the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.650 
then this goes and then that goes so the
result<00:03:00.270> is<00:03:01.310> more<00:03:02.310> or<00:03:02.459> less<00:03:02.520> that<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.390> toggles

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
result is more or less that it toggles

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.180 
result is more or less that it toggles
off<00:03:03.930> instantly<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.510> toggles<00:03:06.510> on<00:03:06.690> last<00:03:09.980> 5th<00:03:10.980> at

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
off instantly and toggles on last 5th at

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.370 
off instantly and toggles on last 5th at
work<00:03:11.400> it's<00:03:11.790> also<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.540> however<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.959> needs<00:03:13.140> an

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
work it's also the however it needs an

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.479 
work it's also the however it needs an
inverter<00:03:15.080> before<00:03:16.080> I<00:03:16.140> forget<00:03:16.170> about<00:03:16.500> that

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.759 

because<00:03:20.489> they<00:03:20.700> need<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:20.970> be<00:03:21.150> out<00:03:21.360> of<00:03:21.540> phase<00:03:22.230> so

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
because they need to be out of phase so

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.110 
because they need to be out of phase so
that<00:03:22.950> when<00:03:23.160> this<00:03:23.970> is<00:03:24.209> on<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.549> off<00:03:26.790> and

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
that when this is on that is off and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.110 
that when this is on that is off and
vice<00:03:27.660> versa<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:29.160> hopefully<00:03:29.700> when<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:29.850> flick

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
vice versa so hopefully when I flick

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.120 
vice versa so hopefully when I flick
this<00:03:30.299> switch<00:03:30.360> everything<00:03:30.930> will<00:03:31.350> go<00:03:31.590> exactly

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
this switch everything will go exactly

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.550 
this switch everything will go exactly
according<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.610> plan<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:33.570> phase<00:03:34.080> blocks<00:03:34.380> will

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
according to plan the phase blocks will

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.850 
according to plan the phase blocks will
flip<00:03:34.799> off<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.250> then<00:03:35.370> pistons<00:03:35.850> will<00:03:35.940> extend

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
flip off and then pistons will extend

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.610 
flip off and then pistons will extend
exactly<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.100> in<00:03:38.910> Reverse<00:03:39.180> yes<00:03:40.170> perfect<00:03:42.620> I'll

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
exactly and in Reverse yes perfect I'll

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.979 
exactly and in Reverse yes perfect I'll
lead<00:03:43.860> this<00:03:44.010> wire<00:03:44.310> round<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.360> can<00:03:45.720> see<00:03:45.900> it

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
lead this wire round so you can see it

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.100 
lead this wire round so you can see it
from<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.709> front<00:03:47.209> okay<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.540> demonstrate

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.160 

perfect<00:03:52.110> sick<00:03:52.320> sequence<00:03:53.220> them

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.230 

the<00:03:57.170> face<00:03:57.560> blocks<00:03:57.890> always<00:03:58.220> happened<00:03:58.610> first<00:03:58.820> or

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
the face blocks always happened first or

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.400 
the face blocks always happened first or
last<00:03:59.350> depending<00:04:00.350> and<00:04:00.530> pistons<00:04:01.430> in<00:04:01.610> between

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
last depending and pistons in between

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.340 
last depending and pistons in between
and<00:04:03.410> random<00:04:04.280> Anderman<00:04:04.670> aside<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.270> so<00:04:06.080> I<00:04:06.110> did

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
and random Anderman aside and so I did

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.650 
and random Anderman aside and so I did
with<00:04:06.470> that<00:04:06.500> technology<00:04:06.920> was<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.730> make<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.240> into

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
with that technology was to make it into

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.840 
with that technology was to make it into
a<00:04:08.930> day<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:09.650> night<00:04:09.800> indicator<00:04:10.480> daytime
