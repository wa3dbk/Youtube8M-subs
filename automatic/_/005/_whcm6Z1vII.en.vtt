00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.550
 French and two months I would say 6 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:12.750
 and 2 6 I watched this morning we're making 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.190
 leave and I realized that if 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.070
 I win today jallet ahead of my 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.000
 seniors to know or wishing in and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.519
 for me this is it adds again 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.340
 more value in this respect even though 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.050
 it's my third 100 km I like 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.490
 beat the records 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.630
 beat her the records of my elders 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.460
 those who called me almost all 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.880
 all learned florian rousseau listens to you 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.910
 by the way here is good ben this is it 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.140
 for me it's important it's me 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.510
 fight me we train every day 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.710
 not to say yet the trackers here 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.600
 we are fighting against times against 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.100
 people against the records and bah 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.969
 I absolutely wanted to win already for 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.930
 be champion mans and keep my title 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.340
 at home relive that and then bah 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.520
 why not go past them 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.660
 sure how nice you managed this km 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.949
 Yesterday you are going to bed very late 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.049
 we said three o'clock in the morning with 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.390
 the excitement of the title how are you 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.689
 mobilized today and how how 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.689
 it happened 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.370
 I felt I knew days 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.680
 better but after that I like 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.030
 wanted 10 compared to years 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.120
 previous ones I had a big margin of 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.010
 maneuver sometimes a second the year 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.550
 last I had six tenths on his 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.510
 dolphin age and the eight hundredths but 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.520
 I thought even if I am less 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.150
 well I still have six tenths of 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.190
 margin 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.890
 except that he continues to make good progress 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:42.050
 he is still young and I counted 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.910
 still out of 7 on this margin 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.130
 I knew she was going to decrease because 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.200
 that I am diminished compared to 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.970
 two previous years 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.810
 but still like these as yesterday 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.180
 what I have public and from the first 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.580
 pedaling it's crazy it's 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.070
 hysteria 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.290
 cg i really did everything for pamiers 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.960
 are carried away will pass right away 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.000
 want to give everything this despite my a 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.530
 kilometer is long even though with a 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.700
 minute do how to keep for for the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.820
 last trick to stay fluid and 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:19.280
 productive and it was hard to say good 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.810
 he sowed 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.209
 concentrate on your effort as 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.600
 usually and it will not be necessary that 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:30.320
 you pedal too soon you put forces is 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.060
 too early and that was super hard city â€‹â€‹I 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.550
 think the hardest really manage 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.940
 the effort as I usually do is 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.060
 passed without reach by the public 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.200
 so the well after good the last round 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.600
 I think I have queen is very 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.480
 very well we like stuck but 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.709
 that's what it was screaming so much in the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.209
 headphones I had not even hurt people 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.739
 it was just physical fatigue 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.530
 general and that's it I gave everything 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.480
 I continue to think of being well 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.460
 bankrupt of productive assets not me 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.440
 disunite 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:07.800
 push pull shoot pull on the 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.800
 pedals and until the end
