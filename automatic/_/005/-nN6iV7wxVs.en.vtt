I<00:00:03.680> want<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.770> take<00:00:04.980> responsibility<00:00:05.990> to<00:00:06.990> improve

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
I want to take responsibility to improve

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.610 
I want to take responsibility to improve
my<00:00:07.649> balance<00:00:08.160> so<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.510> felt<00:00:10.170> like<00:00:10.230> I'm<00:00:10.349> doing

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
my balance so I felt like I'm doing

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.830 
my balance so I felt like I'm doing
something<00:00:10.950> for<00:00:11.040> me<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.460> chose<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.179> join<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:12.690> that

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
something for me I chose to join so that

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.660 
something for me I chose to join so that
I<00:00:12.929> can<00:00:13.080> keep<00:00:13.230> my<00:00:13.290> balance<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:14.009> could<00:00:14.190> feel<00:00:14.400> every

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
I can keep my balance I could feel every

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.790 
I can keep my balance I could feel every
once<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.030> while<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.839> was<00:00:16.379> having

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
once in a while that I was having

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.640 
once in a while that I was having
trouble<00:00:17.190> with<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.199> joined<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
trouble with it and so I joined the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.109 
trouble with it and so I joined the
program<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.250> try<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.670> strengthen<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
program to try and strengthen the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.509 
program to try and strengthen the
balance<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:21.840> there's<00:00:22.830> someone<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.189> know<00:00:23.310> what

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
balance but there's someone to know what

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.970 
balance but there's someone to know what
it<00:00:23.609> was<00:00:23.760> like<00:00:24.019> and<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.170> want<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.619> know<00:00:25.769> how

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
it was like and I want you to know how

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:49.630 
it was like and I want you to know how
off<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.400> balance<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:27.000> was<00:00:27.240> which<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.750> knew<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.960> was

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:01.540 

I<00:00:57.910> could<00:00:58.910> walk<00:00:59.120> a<00:00:59.449> little<00:00:59.720> better<00:01:00.489> even<00:01:01.489> a

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
I could walk a little better even a

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:09.790 
I could walk a little better even a
little<00:01:01.730> further<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:07.780> like<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.140> fact<00:01:09.410> that<00:01:09.590> I'm

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
little further I like the fact that I'm

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:20.350 
little further I like the fact that I'm
being<00:01:09.979> trained<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:12.350> help<00:01:12.740> myself<00:01:19.360> really

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
being trained to help myself really

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.350 
being trained to help myself really
concentrating<00:01:21.170> powers<00:01:24.369> to<00:01:25.369> keep<00:01:25.759> a<00:01:25.940> good

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
concentrating powers to keep a good

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.790 
concentrating powers to keep a good
balance<00:01:26.420> which<00:01:27.020> he<00:01:27.140> felt<00:01:27.380> did<00:01:27.560> everything

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
balance which he felt did everything

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.969 
balance which he felt did everything
else<00:01:28.039> it's<00:01:28.460> fun<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:28.940> limit<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:30.530> then<00:01:30.800> each

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
else it's fun to limit and then each

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.800 
else it's fun to limit and then each
time<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:31.460> want<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.700> do<00:01:31.880> better<00:01:32.090> than<00:01:32.420> his<00:01:32.539> kind

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
time you want to do better than his kind

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:41.830 
time you want to do better than his kind
before<00:01:39.820> we<00:01:40.820> would<00:01:41.030> have<00:01:41.090> never<00:01:41.390> had<00:01:41.539> the

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
before we would have never had the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.930 
before we would have never had the
confidence<00:01:42.050> I<00:01:42.619> don't<00:01:42.800> believe<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.460> just<00:01:43.700> start

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
confidence I don't believe to just start

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.910 
confidence I don't believe to just start
we<00:01:44.149> bowling<00:01:44.420> or<00:01:44.810> we<00:01:44.960> fit<00:01:45.200> on<00:01:45.320> our<00:01:45.470> own<00:01:45.619> we<00:01:45.890> need

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
we bowling or we fit on our own we need

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.090 
we bowling or we fit on our own we need
itself<00:01:46.490> I<00:01:46.880> think<00:01:47.149> that<00:01:47.479> it<00:01:47.570> was<00:01:47.720> way<00:01:48.050> to<00:01:48.110> have

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
itself I think that it was way to have

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.770 
itself I think that it was way to have
some<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.429> us<00:01:49.580> get<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.910> know<00:01:50.090> each<00:01:50.270> other<00:01:50.539> by

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
some of us get to know each other by

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.630 
some of us get to know each other by
talking<00:01:51.200> about<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.830> different<00:01:52.220> things<00:01:52.250> and

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
talking about the different things and

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.520 
talking about the different things and
what<00:01:53.149> we<00:01:53.330> were<00:01:53.450> good<00:01:53.750> in<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.110> what<00:01:54.200> we<00:01:54.350> were

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
what we were good in and what we were

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
after having been exposed to the we

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.830 
after having been exposed to the we
program<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.000> convinced<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.120> as<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.270> step<00:02:23.660> in

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
program and convinced it as a step in

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.290 
program and convinced it as a step in
the<00:02:23.900> right<00:02:24.050> direction
