00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.090
 whatsapp everybody what would 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.400
 well that would be breaking news about the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.860
 game gta 5 it's going to be link done between the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.660
 solo mode and online mode proposed 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.100
 in a kind of new dlc we had 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.720
 a kind of image that has been leaked 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.400
 unfortunately I can not power you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.840
 show on the screen since I can 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.430
 have copyright issues if 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.260
 that's really the case anyway if that 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.810
 is really a fine product if you 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.340
 want if it's really a future dlc of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.439
 rockstar i can have little worries 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.820
 the video can be deleted or at 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.899
 little problems on it we're not going 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.649
 take the risk it's going to be in the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.750
 description 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.210
 I will put a link so where I hosted 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.370
 so just the image to which 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.719
 you can then look elsewhere 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.460
 it's talking a lot right now 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.250
 and what is this weapon there 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.809
 we can notice it's not mine a 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.800
 banal actually somewhere like I am 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.309
 not a trick simply with the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.949
 trigger 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.989
 there we have a kind of a kind of two 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.940
 small gas bottles with 2 front 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.500
 a kind of little thing a kind 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.809
 of matches in fact finally to 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.239
 with a kind of little wick in fact 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.700
 and what it can do is just go 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.860
 a flamethrower that of the image goods in 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.869
 she even at the level of her design everything 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.119
 that's his way of being and that's it 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.280
 look like this weapon there be careful 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.320
 will take the tweezers or not 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.340
 can be one of the fake or not you know 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.930
 everything there was anyway 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.580
 information that has been educated somehow 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.100
 part where there have been people who are 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.689
 apparently getting into the game are 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.700
 assembled in the humble data of the game 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.310
 it's a bit complicated and then who have 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.710
 a little tied up information such 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.960
 that for example the killing that word j36 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 and stuff like that and who beats who 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.860
 turns out to be just actually these were 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.689
 information that was said maybe 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.840
 a week before rockstar 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.909
 formalizes the info as a dlc a 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.320
 new update 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.460
 so somewhere we could tell ourselves 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.229
 by the way, even if we can talk about it 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.179
 a flamethrower that makes a very good 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.460
 idea already has me in the multiplayer mode 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.780
 all are also in the solo mode I 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.729
 think it can be a very good thing 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.770
 to which bassa little is that it is 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.560
 really having fun with interactions 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.840
 additional this is kind of 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.640
 activity a little extra well 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.200
 sure there will not be a weapon there will not be 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.970
 that the flames lance as a dlc a 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.250
 already will be full of glitch that are 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.720
 patched and then here they are going to do the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.280
 needed to improve the field 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.780
 himself and then of course for maybe 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.849
 take out some vehicles as I 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.000
 had already talked about vehicles that 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.720
 will be able to appear 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.760
 shortly 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.290
 and then certainly with as 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.090
 that the fire lance 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.120
 after that will depend on them how they 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.920
 will choose at the level of additions 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.750
 of vehicle objects of course are not going to 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.269
 put a great dlc pack 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.310
 and then after being a less good bercy 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.670
 they will try to put one will say 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.440
 dlc packs rather low already they 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.079
 are going to try to wing it not be it 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.660
 medium but rather high at the level of 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.480
 that's the vehicle objects 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.950
 spatial you understand that is to say that 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.599
 they will try to spread a little 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.150
 shoes of the dlc that they planned a 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.430
 to say that there the next dlc rockstar 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.810
 have it planned and the one after that also they 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.739
 are not stupid and think a little 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.419
 he's gonna anticipate actually all this and 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.859
 so we do not know at all when you're so 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.700
 daddy of lens there but in any case it's 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.519
 a very good idea 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.840
 I could see that and then honestly ben 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.849
 we know it's a very good thing 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.230
 so thank you for telling me 76% in a bar 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.930
