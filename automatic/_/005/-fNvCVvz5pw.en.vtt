glare the most important part of the
process<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.240> cleaning<00:01:13.490> anything<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
process is the cleaning anything that

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.030 
process is the cleaning anything that
gets<00:01:14.820> left<00:01:15.000> behind<00:01:15.260> while<00:01:16.260> we<00:01:16.409> put<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.770> film

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
gets left behind while we put that film

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.890 
gets left behind while we put that film
on<00:01:17.310> top<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.760> it<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.090> going<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.570> there

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
on top of it is going to be there

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.630 
on top of it is going to be there
forever<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.710> become<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.010> fossil<00:01:20.310> in

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
forever it's going to become a fossil in

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
between the film and the glass so when

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.730 
between the film and the glass so when
we<00:01:23.220> come<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.850> spend<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.659> as<00:01:24.990> much<00:01:25.020> time<00:01:25.229> on

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
we come in we spend just as much time on

we come in we spend just as much time on
the<00:01:25.920> cleaning<00:01:26.340> side<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.299> actually

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the cleaning side as we do actually

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.690 
the cleaning side as we do actually
applying<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.320> film<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.950> glass<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
applying the film to the glass the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.030 
applying the film to the glass the
maintenance<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.770> would<00:01:31.860> be

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
