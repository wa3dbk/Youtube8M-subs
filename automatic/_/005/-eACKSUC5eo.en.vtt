00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
nice and neat edge to edge and corner to

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.020 
nice and neat edge to edge and corner to
corners<00:00:58.810> make<00:00:59.650> those<00:00:59.890> first<00:01:00.190> creases<00:01:00.760> count

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
corners make those first creases count

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.240 
corners make those first creases count
because<00:01:01.570> they<00:01:01.900> are<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.290> most<00:01:02.440> important<00:01:03.070> and

direction diagonally turn it around once

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:32.460 
direction diagonally turn it around once
more<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.800> then<00:01:21.580> fold<00:01:22.330> it<00:01:22.450> in<00:01:22.570> half

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.380 

and<00:01:33.470> if<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.250> want<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.550> also<00:01:34.820> in<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.240> other

and if you want to also in the other
direction<00:01:35.600> for<00:01:36.350> good<00:01:36.530> measure

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
direction for good measure

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:45.670 
direction for good measure
but<00:01:37.700> once<00:01:38.150> should<00:01:38.390> be<00:01:38.570> enough<00:01:43.360> okay<00:01:44.360> great<00:01:44.690> now

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
but once should be enough okay great now

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.520 
but once should be enough okay great now
open<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.310> up<00:01:46.490> turn<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.510> around<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:47.840> push<00:01:48.230> the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
open it up turn it around and push the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.190 
open it up turn it around and push the
center<00:01:48.800> so<00:01:49.190> it<00:01:49.280> will<00:01:49.430> pop<00:01:49.850> up<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.210> then<00:01:50.300> it

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
center so it will pop up and then it

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.500 
center so it will pop up and then it
will<00:01:51.350> be<00:01:51.470> really<00:01:51.860> easy<00:01:52.040> to<00:01:52.190> bring<00:01:52.610> down<00:01:53.090> the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
will be really easy to bring down the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.440 
will be really easy to bring down the
edges<00:01:53.690> like<00:01:54.020> this<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.910> flatten<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.000> top<00:01:56.180> this

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
edges like this and flatten the top this

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.320 
edges like this and flatten the top this
is<00:01:56.630> called<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:57.200> waterbomb<00:01:58.130> base<00:01:58.190> because<00:01:59.000> this

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
is called a waterbomb base because this

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.600 
is called a waterbomb base because this
whole<00:01:59.570> shape<00:01:59.870> basically<00:02:00.110> is<00:02:00.590> also<00:02:01.160> a<00:02:01.190> water

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
whole shape basically is also a water

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.390 
whole shape basically is also a water
bottle<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:03.020> is<00:02:03.200> just<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.650> companion<00:02:04.130> cube

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
bottle it is just a companion cube

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.080 
bottle it is just a companion cube
because<00:02:04.850> of<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.600> template<00:02:05.990> were<00:02:06.170> using<00:02:06.530> then

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
because of the template were using then

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.020 
because of the template were using then
from<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.300> four<00:02:08.720> flaps<00:02:09.200> we<00:02:09.440> have<00:02:09.649> fold<00:02:10.070> one<00:02:10.369> to

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
from the four flaps we have fold one to

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.699 
from the four flaps we have fold one to
the<00:02:11.150> top<00:02:11.390> corner<00:02:11.959> here<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:14.720> there<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.410> now

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
the top corner here to there and now

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.240 
the top corner here to there and now
along<00:02:16.370> this<00:02:16.610> line<00:02:17.170> google<00:02:18.170> trees<00:02:18.470> the

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
along this line google trees the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.850 
along this line google trees the
template<00:02:19.730> also<00:02:20.360> indicates<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.350> crease<00:02:21.590> lines

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
template also indicates the crease lines

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.060 
template also indicates the crease lines
which<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.280> really<00:02:22.580> helpful<00:02:22.850> i<00:02:23.060> think<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.660> you

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
which is really helpful i think and you

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.130 
which is really helpful i think and you
can<00:02:25.070> see<00:02:25.310> now<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.700> heart<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.690> companion

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
can see now the heart of the companion

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.930 
can see now the heart of the companion
crew<00:02:27.940> arranges<00:02:28.940> nicely<00:02:31.390> fold<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:33.670> also<00:02:34.670> fold

and<00:02:38.720> now<00:02:39.710> maybe<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.790> hardest<00:02:41.030> part<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.600> the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
and now maybe the hardest part of the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.020 
and now maybe the hardest part of the
whole<00:02:41.990> model<00:02:42.260> is<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.740> tuck<00:02:43.070> in<00:02:43.310> this<00:02:43.610> corner

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
whole model is to tuck in this corner

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.650 
whole model is to tuck in this corner
here<00:02:44.590> let<00:02:45.590> me<00:02:45.830> first<00:02:46.190> fold<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.730> down<00:02:46.880> so<00:02:46.910> it's

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
here let me first fold it down so it's

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.310 
here let me first fold it down so it's
easier<00:02:48.110> later<00:02:48.350> on<00:02:48.560> like<00:02:49.070> this<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:50.020> then<00:02:51.020> we

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
easier later on like this and then we

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.240 
easier later on like this and then we
open<00:02:51.770> up<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.250> pocket<00:02:52.580> here<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.360> cube<00:02:53.690> and

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
open up the pocket here of the cube and

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.730 
open up the pocket here of the cube and
tuck<00:02:55.250> in<00:02:55.490> the<00:02:55.760> flap

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.930 

and<00:03:00.740> yeah

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
and yeah

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.360 
and yeah
and<00:03:04.250> put<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.340> in<00:03:05.430> all<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.850> way<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.030> everything

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
and put it in all the way so everything

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.430 
and put it in all the way so everything
aligns<00:03:08.370> perfectly<00:03:10.310> yeah<00:03:11.340> well<00:03:11.910> done<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.440> also

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
aligns perfectly yeah well done and also

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.650 
aligns perfectly yeah well done and also
the<00:03:13.620> other<00:03:13.770> corner<00:03:14.220> we<00:03:14.430> will<00:03:15.090> repeat<00:03:15.450> those

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
the other corner we will repeat those

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.910 
the other corner we will repeat those
steps<00:03:16.020> with<00:03:16.440> all<00:03:16.740> four<00:03:17.280> flaps<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:18.120> our

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
steps with all four flaps of our

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.720 
steps with all four flaps of our
whatever<00:03:19.920> base<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:23.430> first<00:03:23.940> big<00:03:24.750> flap<00:03:25.730> upwards

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
whatever base so first big flap upwards

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.660 
whatever base so first big flap upwards
like<00:03:26.940> this<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.510> then<00:03:28.320> we<00:03:28.770> fold<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.490> this

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
towards the pocket to make the tucking

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.729 
towards the pocket to make the tucking
in<00:03:51.060> part<00:03:51.450> easier<00:03:52.670> fold<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.819> back<00:03:54.000> again<00:03:54.739> open

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
in part easier fold it back again open

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:47.059 
no need to hurry this is not a race it's

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:56.739 
no need to hurry this is not a race it's
origami<00:05:52.719> in<00:05:53.719> the<00:05:53.809> pocket<00:05:54.999> touch<00:05:55.999> to<00:05:56.569> the

00:05:56.739 --> 00:05:56.749 
origami in the pocket touch to the

00:05:56.749 --> 00:06:03.269 
origami in the pocket touch to the
pocket<00:05:57.199> and<00:05:57.939> now<00:05:58.939> after<00:05:59.779> the<00:06:00.109> folding<00:06:00.529> is<00:06:00.649> done

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:03.279 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.029 

we<00:06:04.279> just<00:06:05.239> have<00:06:05.419> two<00:06:05.629> more<00:06:05.659> steps<00:06:06.049> to<00:06:06.289> do<00:06:06.409> now

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
we just have two more steps to do now

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.759 
we just have two more steps to do now
those<00:06:07.279> corners<00:06:08.089> that<00:06:08.299> point<00:06:08.869> outwards<00:06:09.379> and

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:09.769 
those corners that point outwards and

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.039 
those corners that point outwards and
differentiate<00:06:10.669> from<00:06:10.849> the<00:06:10.939> square<00:06:11.269> just<00:06:11.779> fold

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:12.049 
differentiate from the square just fold

00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:13.719 
differentiate from the square just fold
them<00:06:12.199> once<00:06:12.499> and<00:06:12.889> there<00:06:13.069> are<00:06:13.189> a<00:06:13.249> lot<00:06:13.429> of<00:06:13.459> layers

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729 
them once and there are a lot of layers

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.079 
them once and there are a lot of layers
so<00:06:14.119> put<00:06:14.929> it<00:06:15.049> a<00:06:15.109> little<00:06:15.319> bit<00:06:15.499> more<00:06:15.799> power<00:06:16.759> and

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:17.089 
so put it a little bit more power and

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:21.519 
so put it a little bit more power and
force<00:06:17.479> into<00:06:17.929> that<00:06:18.819> and<00:06:19.819> now<00:06:20.029> we<00:06:20.419> will<00:06:20.569> just

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:21.529 
force into that and now we will just

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:25.679 
force into that and now we will just
flip<00:06:22.399> every<00:06:23.029> part<00:06:23.419> and<00:06:23.689> we<00:06:24.319> will<00:06:24.499> blow<00:06:24.769> into

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:25.689 
flip every part and we will blow into

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:36.879 
flip every part and we will blow into
the<00:06:26.689> open<00:06:26.989> tip<00:06:27.199> here<00:06:27.669> so<00:06:28.669> that<00:06:29.179> goes<00:06:35.739> it<00:06:36.739> looks

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
the open tip here so that goes it looks

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.919 
the open tip here so that goes it looks
best<00:06:37.189> if<00:06:37.399> you<00:06:37.519> have<00:06:37.879> a<00:06:37.909> strong<00:06:40.479> puff<00:06:41.479> of<00:06:41.719> air

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:41.929 
best if you have a strong puff of air

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:45.369 
best if you have a strong puff of air
basically<00:06:42.769> and<00:06:42.919> now<00:06:43.929> reinforce<00:06:44.929> the<00:06:45.169> corners

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:45.379 
basically and now reinforce the corners

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:49.050 
basically and now reinforce the corners
and<00:06:45.739> the<00:06:45.859> edges

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.580 

and<00:06:49.530> there<00:06:50.530> you<00:06:50.620> go<00:06:50.830> a<00:06:51.190> beautiful<00:06:52.590> companion

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
and there you go a beautiful companion

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.210 
and there you go a beautiful companion
queue<00:06:54.010> for<00:06:55.000> you<00:06:55.150> to<00:06:55.570> use<00:06:56.140> this<00:06:56.290> decoration<00:06:56.770> or
