00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:04.409
 yes 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.910
 One last pass from the inapa is an honor 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.739
 to be able to use my talent to help 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.540
 celebrate your achievements to me not 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.440
 I can believe that club has scored 200 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.440
 points in a match 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.640
 an ultra cup match has looked for that 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.390
 ball is irreplaceable to save it 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.390
 bring here 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.420
 a swamp has fallen to the old well 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.420
 we will have to be born to recover it 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.680
 there it is, we lost it forever 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.090
 let's try some nun sets 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.100
 sweet potatoes 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:19.270
 you have to calculate the distance is there 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:21.399
 then we go we need that the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.950
 problems are not always resolved with 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.020
 strength shows I was the only one 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.009
 monster and is in a family of seven 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.569
 brothers everything was a competition one day 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.159
 my father asked everyone to give him 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.929
 let's help capture an evil 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.420
 creature that was terrorizing 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:40.359
 our village all my brothers were 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.880
 for the beast did not try to get it out of 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.799
 his lair with force and violence but 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.319
 all they brought were bones 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.599
 broken the wisest strategy is no 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.810
 enter the force but to manage them 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:55.450
 to bring it out 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.079
 I know what I do not know I know what 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.079
 I will prove 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.210
 in genius water will drag the ball 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.840
 until we see the force and the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.410
 violence are not always the answer what 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.410
 only one that drags 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.870
 but sometimes force helps I think that I 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.870
 I should keep it
