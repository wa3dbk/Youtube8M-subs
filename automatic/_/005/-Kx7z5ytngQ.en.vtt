patch<00:01:21.780> material<00:01:22.340> but<00:01:23.340> then<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.550> used<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.910> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
patch material but then we used on the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.109 
patch material but then we used on the
ceiling<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:25.350> was<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> joint<00:01:25.890> compound<00:01:27.440> and

ceiling that was a joint compound and

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.880 
ceiling that was a joint compound and
this<00:01:30.119> stuff<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.960> bit<00:01:31.080> heavier<00:01:31.500> duty

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
this stuff is a little bit heavier duty

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.640 
this stuff is a little bit heavier duty
and<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.910> nice<00:01:33.090> thing<00:01:33.119> about<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.990> sets

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
and the nice thing about it is it sets

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.250 
and the nice thing about it is it sets
up<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:34.979> dries<00:01:35.250> within<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.729> couple<00:01:35.910> hours<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:37.170> we

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
up and dries within a couple hours so we

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:49.219 
up and dries within a couple hours so we
don't<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.590> wait<00:01:37.710> all<00:01:37.860> night<00:01:48.229> anywhere

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
don't have to wait all night anywhere

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.030 
don't have to wait all night anywhere
you<00:01:49.350> see<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> hole<00:01:54.380> just<00:01:55.380> go<00:01:55.619> over<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.830> real

you see a hole just go over it real

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.100 
you see a hole just go over it real
smoothly<00:01:59.390> don't<00:02:00.390> worry<00:02:00.539> if<00:02:00.660> it's<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.899> little

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
smoothly don't worry if it's a little

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.350 
smoothly don't worry if it's a little
chunky<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:02.070> you're<00:02:02.250> gonna<00:02:02.369> sand<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.880> after

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
chunky if you're gonna sand it after

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:19.449 
chunky if you're gonna sand it after
it's<00:02:03.600> dry

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.600 

okay<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.489> think<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.790> got<00:02:20.970> most<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.299> them<00:02:22.610> we're

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
okay I think I got most of them we're

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.550 
okay I think I got most of them we're
gonna<00:02:23.730> let<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:23.940> dry<00:02:24.120> should<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:25.019> an<00:02:25.140> hour<00:02:25.320> at

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
gonna let that dry should be an hour at

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.860 
gonna let that dry should be an hour at
least<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:26.580> in<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.910> meantime<00:02:27.150> we'll<00:02:27.540> move<00:02:27.720> on

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
least and in the meantime we'll move on

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.380 
least and in the meantime we'll move on
to<00:02:27.900> something<00:02:28.170> else
