00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
but grillage was developing quite quite

on<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> good<00:02:02.430> level<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:03.030> he<00:02:03.180> would<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.630> he

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
wasn't playing that well if you see his

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.020 
wasn't playing that well if you see his
number<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.119> games<00:02:06.329> played<00:02:06.450> only<00:02:07.280> 1687<00:02:08.280> and
