about JBL a bad bad man I don't think

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.040 
about JBL a bad bad man I don't think
he's<00:00:50.250> good<00:00:50.520> enough<00:00:50.550> for<00:00:50.820> Ray<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.780> could<00:00:51.930> also

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
he's good enough for Ray it could also

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.049 
he's good enough for Ray it could also
come<00:00:52.350> down<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.680> cardio<00:00:53.039> too<00:00:53.309> because<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
come down to cardio too because the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.700 
come down to cardio too because the
longer<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> match<00:00:54.539> goes<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.140> think<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.620> would

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
longer the match goes I think it would

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.010 
longer the match goes I think it would
favor<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> smaller<00:00:56.579> Mysterio<00:00:57.270> who<00:00:57.870> would

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
favor the smaller Mysterio who would

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.750 
favor the smaller Mysterio who would
have<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.739> cardiovascular<00:00:59.489> training

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
have that that cardiovascular training

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.420 
have that that cardiovascular training
yes<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.690> would<00:01:00.960> think<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.260> too<00:01:01.410> absolutely<00:01:02.250> I'm

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
