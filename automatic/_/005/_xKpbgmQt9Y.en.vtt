00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello friends have you ever had such a thing 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.290
 there is some book that you all 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.570
 advise tell what she is great 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.030
 Yes, you yourself know what is good 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.849
 a book but for some reason all hers 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.949
 put it off to read what a friend is 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.949
 just do some other 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.210
 chores and then you get and think about 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.300
 my god why did I put it off why not 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.240
 read a long time ago and about such 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.850
 my feelings after reading Ken kizi 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.380
 over the cuckoo's nest about this book 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.380
 right now and talk 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.640
 let's start with the fact that I love their movie 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.859
 flying over the cuckoo's nest with jack 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.129
 Nicholson I think it's probably his 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.469
 the best part I think the movie itself 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.079
 very atmospheric I probably watched it 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.570
 1 5 but somehow everything could not get to 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.030
 books and at some point it happened 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.129
 I'm not really in favor of comparing 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.799
 movies and books i think that is 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.020
 absolutely two different genres they live then 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.539
 in different planes absolutely and 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.970
 comparison is usually incorrect but I 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.399
 I can compare my emotions and if the movie 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.009
 was oh god what he is cool 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.220
 then the book gave me about ten times 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:25.399
 more emotions from the first pages I 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.460
 fell in love with this book narration entry 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.210
 in the style of the author in his heroes everything to me 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.190
 liked it 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.110
 from start to finish and it's pretty 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.080
 strange because the books I usually 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.450
 I am more critical sitting here 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.690
 as if on drugs and baldel from 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.940
 each page from each line from 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.190
 each sentence and comparison with 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.320
 drug dice is not accidentally known 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.409
 that Ken Kesey himself is quite a lot 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.930
 used LSD and these experiments with 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.079
 knowledge naturally they come out and on 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.659
 here's this book page if we talk about 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.680
 the plot is probably many are familiar with it 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.380
 exactly according to the film 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.289
 This psychiatric clinic where 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.429
 hits the main character mcmerfi who 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.320
 trying to slip away from prison 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.570
 pretending to be crazy because it thinks 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.400
 that he would rather not be in prison 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.310
 where a rather strict rules and 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.590
 mental hospital where they feed better and more 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.079
 freedoms but very soon it turns out that 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.870
 no freedom here is possible 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:29.359
 outwardly yes but psychologically 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.959
 patients are working very hard 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:34.900
 try to bring them well you are a certain norm and 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.820
 the book you melt such opposition 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.209
 between makmerfi who personifies 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.850
 yourself and free such spirit and elder 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.130
 sister which on the contrary symbolizes 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.920
 myself a system and at some point I have 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.530
 there is a feeling that I read dystopia 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.190
 and perhaps better dystopia in his 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.920
 life as a rule when we read haxley 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.380
 order ha this is some kind of future gone then 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.710
 is war some kind of global nuclear then 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.040
 Does something like that then and now people have built people 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.380
 themselves to build themselves a prison or 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.230
 terrible or vice versa where everything seems 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.600
 blissful actually goes terror over 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.280
 personality and here modernity and 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.100
 moreover america 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.040
 that and the freest country in the world where 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.770
 so much more freedom except in modern 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.080
 America actually is about fifty 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.050
 back but it doesn't feel that is 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.090
 read the book as if here are our days but 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.120
 while people who turn out and 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.240
 such as everything is slightly different 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.100
 they are labeled as psychotic and 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.220
 sent to the hospital 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:47.450
 and here are the main characters mcmerfi he tries 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.120
 defend first his and then right 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.440
 other people here these be sick here 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.570
 not like everyone else 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.540
 of older sister easily guessed 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.940
 big brother from the order of ha and and the fact that 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.520
 this is our time our days from everything 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.930
 it becomes really creepy and in 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.480
 differences again from the majority 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.030
 dystopia there is no such oppressive 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.739
 the atmosphere it appears near the end 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.580
 the main narration code is read 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.810
 pretty easy there are a lot of some and 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.359
 dramatic moments and at the same time 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.239
 quite a few techno jokes funny and 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.859
 everyday's stories and then subtracts 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.020
 getting pretty easy 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.060
 separately and naturally the box tell about 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.790
 storytelling in general story 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.060
 told on behalf of the leader this is such 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.550
 big semi indian who pretends 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.620
 deaf and is in hospital but 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.720
 while he sees everything hears everything and 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.510
 and here with his eyes we look after that 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.400
 what happens in the hospital and here is very 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.280
 interesting and very manner of narration 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.530
 it consists of three styles 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.720
 who are intertwined first this 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.950
 realistic that is what he sees it 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.630
 tells 2 is a language of some kind 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.150
 surreal metaphor and third this 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.150
 frank delirium mad and when here 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.090
 these directions merge into one and 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.820
 it's hard to understand what is what when 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.660
 the text becomes with the riddle you need 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.750
 read and 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.320
 climb this bottom indescribable 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.570
 feeling 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.830
 we are good i certainly have to find 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.460
 some cons 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.770
 flaws but i cant not the only one 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.320
 I have some complaints about the translation 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.590
 it is this publication that is sometimes visible 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.370
 candid mistakes read it does not interfere 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.590
 but it is unpleasant, too, well, let this 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.600
 minus as it were conditional here everything 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.420
 divided into black and white 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.390
 Ie Makmerfi countries the fact that he of course 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.460
 he is still a mischievous bastard but he 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.740
 It is perceived as an absolute good and 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.140
 sister is perceived older sister 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.330
 perceived as an absolute evil this 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.550
 could be attributed to minuses that is 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.150
 there are no halftones and so much black 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.520
 and white 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.490
 but I think that this is the idea of ​​the author and 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.410
 so criticize for that, well, probably 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.720
 I have no rights and I do not even see the point 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.510
 summing up some seems to me from 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.120
 my speech is so clear that I am in full 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.700
 delighted with this book and if by 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.910
 for whatever reason, you missed out and 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:17.210
 did not read then advise you to do it 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.460
 right now as soon as possible and if 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.250

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.919
