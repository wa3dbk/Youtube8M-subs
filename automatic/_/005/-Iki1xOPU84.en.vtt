 then then without sound and then you 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.570
 I put the voice over on top and I think 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.610
 that way I also explain myself a little better 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.740

 with the micellar water of garnier that I have 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.170
 taught in this morning's video the 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.540

 essential tale protection factor 40 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.510
 of sensitive the one of kiko gives a lot of light 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.090
 I love to use this base to nix 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.890
 presents and 7 the base is the tone 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.580
 6 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.470
 cover age consider version of elx and me 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.840
 it's a bit dark as you can 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.670
 see but then good fun enough 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.160
 good with the skin and it does not show 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.240
 rare light reflecting nash crystal 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.490
 with the brush but 28 burlesque a 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.040
 little touches in the dark circles already passed in 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.220
 the rest of the face the slick trio 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.620
 medium and the brush of the bombetas would be 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.180
 the 100th technique to contour the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.549
 face very cheekbones front 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.950
 and more brown be to give a 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.049
 little bit of warmth and color to the face with 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.250
 the number 300 of the plot I'm going to 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.190
 apply what is the illuminator 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.900
 above the cheekbone the cupid's bow and 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.890
 these other powders that I love 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.500
 take a little more 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.500
 I love leaving a beautiful light are 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.069
 I saw them live the mac and they are already well 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.080
 limited 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.050
 I'm sorry the test this eyelid 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.540
 train and use the infallible 017 sweet 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.670
 strawberry de l'oréal that I like a lot 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.430
 this type of shadows also teaches us 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.000
 this morning in the reviewed two other 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.970
 different in the hall of primor luso with 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.580
 the 057 burlesque brush and what I'm going 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.590
 to do is to create a transition 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.440
 very soft reddish intensified a tad 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.100
 more just what it is from the basin but 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.010
 I saw very well blurred 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.970
 blow blaustein cement faces no 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.590
 gala and the burlesque pro 84 brush 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.330
 giving well squeezing well on the eyelid 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.800
 mobile so that it is very very very 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.170
 concentrated the color 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.120
 and with the same brush I will blur the 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.040
 cut that is very well integrated with 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.770
 the previous color like this is much easier 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.720
 make the transition by clearing the brush 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.370
 I put the same shadow on the line 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.959
 bottom of the tabs to give a 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.540
 little bit of eye feel bigger and 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.490
 more open 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.460
 simply in the outer part of the 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.170
 eye and you see that the eye looks like more 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.600
 big more open compared to the 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.670
 another a little bit of cocoa and we're going to 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.380
 make me eyebrows with the perfect brou 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.090
 the kalamata tone of nash 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.610
 what I do is fill in equal a 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.610
 little bit the shape of the two eyebrows 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:49.229
 with pro 30 of burlesque I'm going to comb and 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.229
 I use who vibrates a like the benefit 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.050
 very good here because there is still the 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.820
 price 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.070
 your work 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.070
 at the most time 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.919
 in short this is the duo 3 hot brown of 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.380
 sephora and with the burlesque brush 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.479
 17 I will intensify a tad the 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:17.120
 corner of the basin what is fair 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.120
 the ub to mark a little more the eye 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.540
 the end of the eye connected to the basin 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.210
 that v 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.340
 it also marked a tad the final end 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.940
 end of the eye connecting with the part 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:36.040
 from above and with the dish tone I'm going to 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.320
 illuminate the 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.450
 Tear to be a little touch 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.870
 of light rhythm the communicator of kevin to 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.270
 which is that I love 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.490
 and I'm going to apply a couple of layers of the 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:51.320
 the royal benefit that lately of 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.320
 this taste taking a lot of the gustillo 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:06:01.169
 the 725 route of maybelline which is a 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:04.289
 I love using it very much 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:06.240
 and of the matte of extens the tone 6 that is 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.260
 a little darker and what I do is 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.110
 put it on the edges 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.430
 and mix to give a feeling of 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.650
 more volume if it is a tad more 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.420
 I clear the middle of the lip well 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.810
 blurred 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.669
 how nice 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.669
 and this is already the nucleus I hope that 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:26.320

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:29.639
