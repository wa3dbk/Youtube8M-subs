yeah<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:40.050> got<00:00:40.559> some<00:00:40.800> attempts<00:00:41.370> I'll<00:00:41.730> add<00:00:42.239> in

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
yeah I got some attempts I'll add in

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.330 
yeah I got some attempts I'll add in
from<00:00:43.079> whenever<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.469> was<00:00:43.590> first<00:00:43.860> learning<00:00:44.010> them

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
from whenever I was first learning them

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.080 
from whenever I was first learning them
and<00:00:45.289> you<00:00:46.289> might<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.559> already<00:00:46.680> seen<00:00:47.100> my

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
and you might have already seen my

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.150 
and you might have already seen my
attempts<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.780> landing<00:00:49.230> my<00:00:49.500> first<00:00:49.739> tale<00:00:49.980> with

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
attempts and landing my first tale with

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.619 
attempts and landing my first tale with
360<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> pretty<00:00:53.039> much<00:00:53.160> all<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:54.000> some

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
360 so pretty much all it is is some

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.709 
360 so pretty much all it is is some
people<00:00:54.930> throw<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.590> tail<00:00:55.770> up<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> last<00:00:56.719> 180

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
people throw the tail up at the last 180

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.959 
people throw the tail up at the last 180
lat<00:00:58.500> you're<00:00:58.800> turning<00:00:59.129> back<00:00:59.280> around<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.670> throw

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
lat you're turning back around and throw

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.479 
lat you're turning back around and throw
it<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.420> flight<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.920> throw<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.280> right

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
it in flight I like to throw it right

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.660 
it in flight I like to throw it right
off<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> lip<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.030> go<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.510> 180<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:05.040> pull

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
off the lip and go for 180 and just pull

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.649 
off the lip and go for 180 and just pull
up<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.909> rest<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.330> way<00:01:06.450> around<00:01:08.479> I'll<00:01:09.479> show

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
up the rest of the way around I'll show

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.899

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
that you're going to mess up on probably

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.870 
that you're going to mess up on probably
is<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:18.090> throw<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.960> Thank<00:01:19.380> feet<00:01:19.860> Mike<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.580> stuck

is you throw it Thank feet Mike it stuck
to<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.180> grip<00:01:21.360> tape<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:23.040> won't<00:01:23.280> actually

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
to the grip tape and you won't actually

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.270 
to the grip tape and you won't actually
get<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> whole<00:01:25.070> Taylor<00:01:26.070> parted<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:28.080> ill<00:01:28.409> yeah

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
get the whole Taylor parted and ill yeah

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.219 
get the whole Taylor parted and ill yeah
we<00:01:29.549> might<00:01:29.700> nut<00:01:29.970> yourself<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.570> bar<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.049> I've

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
we might nut yourself on the bar so I've

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.560 
we might nut yourself on the bar so I've
done<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:34.490> yeah<00:01:35.490> another<00:01:35.790> thing<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.390> that

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
done for it yeah another thing is that

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.310 
done for it yeah another thing is that
could<00:01:36.869> go<00:01:37.049> blind<00:01:37.799> front<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:39.420> happens

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
could go blind front of you that happens

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.710 
could go blind front of you that happens
if<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> don't<00:01:40.909> completely<00:01:41.909> focus<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.600> that

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
if you don't completely focus on that

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.980 
if you don't completely focus on that
180<00:01:43.140> width<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.460> really<00:01:44.670> focusing<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.270> 360

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
180 width if you really focusing on 360

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.960 
180 width if you really focusing on 360
more<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> tail<00:01:46.560> whip<00:01:46.850> fly<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:49.009> so<00:01:50.009> yeah

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
more in the tail whip fly out so yeah

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.719 
more in the tail whip fly out so yeah
you<00:01:51.030> should<00:01:51.299> probably<00:01:51.329> try<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.640> don't<00:01:53.640> know

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
you should probably try it I don't know

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.969 
you should probably try it I don't know
about<00:01:53.850> kicker<00:01:54.210> let's<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.689> go<00:01:54.899> all<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.229> had<00:01:55.560> so

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
about kicker let's just go all I had so

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.520 
about kicker let's just go all I had so
that's<00:01:56.399> why<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> learned<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.530> you're

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
that's why I learned it on you're

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.600 
that's why I learned it on you're
probably<00:01:58.680> going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.920> want<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.340> out<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.549> a

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
probably going to want to do it out of a

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.170 
probably going to want to do it out of a
bowl<00:01:59.850> with<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> lot<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.509> speed<00:02:00.780> about<00:02:01.290> air

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.050 

yeah<00:02:05.180> probably<00:02:05.660> carve<00:02:06.410> a<00:02:06.650> little<00:02:06.800> more<00:02:08.740> and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
yeah probably carve a little more and

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.350 
yeah probably carve a little more and
they'll<00:02:11.060> get<00:02:11.390> like<00:02:11.690> ill<00:02:12.530> get<00:02:12.770> your<00:02:12.890> spin

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
they'll get like ill get your spin

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.110 
they'll get like ill get your spin
started<00:02:14.620> faster<00:02:15.620> i<00:02:15.680> guess<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.760> keep<00:02:16.970> your

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
started faster i guess and keep your

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.830 
started faster i guess and keep your
momentum<00:02:17.480> spinning<00:02:18.320> around<00:02:19.210> so<00:02:20.210> pretty<00:02:20.750> much

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
momentum spinning around so pretty much

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.540 
momentum spinning around so pretty much
all<00:02:21.020> they<00:02:21.140> got<00:02:21.290> focus<00:02:21.710> on<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:22.040> just<00:02:22.130> getting

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
all they got focus on is just getting

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.120 
all they got focus on is just getting
that<00:02:22.640> 180<00:02:23.090> wit<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.870> just<00:02:24.200> turning<00:02:24.830> your<00:02:24.920> head

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
that 180 wit and just turning your head

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.540 
that 180 wit and just turning your head
