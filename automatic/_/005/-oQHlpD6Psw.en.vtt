00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:02.380
 Dr 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.380
 they leave the meridian field 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.439
 Noble extinction of our worlds 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.599
 like the death sentence for our eyes 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.219
 the aliens have returned to Levy stunts have come our retribution 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.899
 a huge many people will become our good guys 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.360
 it's not over yet 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.170
 under this beauty 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.520
 is the key to our newspaper 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.840
 and the roots 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.840
 our destruction 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.830
 Next to Schwarms lies the digestion StÃ¼mpel 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.630
 we need a sample of this one dissent saying so we can fight 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.160
 Maybe revive Thule 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.520
 so we can maybe use weapons against the Swabians fleet itself 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.520
 develop 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:19.799
 she is the swarm fleet get only a genetic a sample will us 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.349
 allow a deep development with the in-form fleet can paralyze 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.389
 and they must have access to Angel's forge on the planet Meridian 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.809
 Only the extensive production possibilities secure these old ones 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:37.489
 Forge will enable us to produce weapons with which we can 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.019
 Bring poison 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.580
 each of these tasks put their handful of people against countless billions 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.359
 to be the TuS 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.119
 It's good to be so tight 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:51.079
 and so warriors beamed 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.319
 to be resurrected from the dead 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.319
 even if it is now included in all pages 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:03.409
 even more important is that the biotops have problems that worried them 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.569
 It allows us to develop a weapon that wants the swarm 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.569
 Quarter can kill the death blow 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:18.819
 a ca 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.349
 Dr 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.689
 he has 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.169
 on 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.099
 were 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:24.759
 this ancient astronomical field is one of the keys to victory over the 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.759
 Taliban 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.119
 With his data, we can identify weaknesses in the Swarm fleet 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.460
 we have to secure the field 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.680
 care4 others do it 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:00.409
 so may 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.729
 I think the team has 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.729
 Dirk Kretzschmar me 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.220
 the intelligence in the heart of the swarm led to being vulnerable 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.939
 made 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:15.060
 hit her when her tendrils got into the planet below 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.509
 Help them with the poison we have developed 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.659
 they have to do it cost whatever it takes 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.669
 Red 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:04.259
 she and her expense list are these warrior commander 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:10.059
 thanks to them 

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:13.059
 there is still life in Elijah too 

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:19.409
 the plaut talk we still have their creative controversy 

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:24.419
 still orientate in the sector 

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:28.499
 their deeds will never be forgotten 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.800
 i have never had a win i have him running 

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:40.399
 this crisis was only slightly injured 

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:52.789
 Dr
