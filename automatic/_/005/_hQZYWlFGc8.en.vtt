00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 and now it may have been a tutorial type or 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.799
 rather a way of how can 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.750
 you fix your speakers when you 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.269
 sinks this part to your horn that is 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.429
 the one that covers the dust so that 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.890
 between dust to the coil goods that 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.260
 they have this bigger part smaller 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.050
 what it does is flat is not round like 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.350
 in this case there are different types 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.710
 of this kind of dust protectors 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.330
 you can say ah and well then they 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.160
 granted a form because as I said 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.790
 there are many cuisines that I have seen in 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.610
 rinse myself in my years I do not think that or 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.160
 regular house kitchens this part 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.309
 they get them like this in this case 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.050
 he gets in there as he got up here 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.600
 is a little old Augustine to whom 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.470
 they came and in my mercedes to see in order and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.630
 the only way 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.330
 that I have found to be able to save or 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.040
 to be able to remove that part of dust is with 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.930
 a tool that you can all 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.730
 we have in our houses that I am here 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.110
 I do not recommend constant gray because 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.960
 It has a lot of glue and you can open it 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.900
 previously here but possible to work 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.610
 in black is more advisable or any 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.290
 another tape that is having strength 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.020
 also that is not also a tape that 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.180
 that will not stand and what we do 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.730
 more practically is we put the tape 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.460
 in where is where is the area 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.710
 affected can you say never do is 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.090
 well it worked here with this there will be no 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.040
 a lot of time that moves because 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.100
 seized but the only way the only 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.380
 to do is pull the tape and that of 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.869
 return to normal you do not see any 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.000
 part here that is over bent or that 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.220
 has been damaged and no no no is not 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.140
 necessarily that it affects the 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.290
 sound of your horn that this part is 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.080
 inside but it affects you in what 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.570
 cosmetic that if you have a good 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.220
 installation and a toxin being broken or 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.470
 no ruben sanz defeat as I said but 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.330
 this part of here is the protector of the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.700
 dust is stuck 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.010
 It makes it look a bit ugly 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.350
 installation a little ugly its horns or 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.080
 that a nap and a I do not know a little 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.910
 uneven but if there are many that come 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.380
 with grids some that do not and those that do not 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.960
 they come so I recommend you do as 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.760
 government right now the tigris was mentioned 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.700
 but as I said this one has a lot 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.460
 glue sometimes it stays like 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.080
 residue here from of the glue and by 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.370
 what we want to do is avoid them 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.920
 because you do not want to save a towel what 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.020
 clean it or something you can wet and 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.340
 clean it up and risk that you're 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.830
 studying and sinking again what 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.750
 you have to progress type again 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.120
 but as it says black team works 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.880
 well and as they saw they are always 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.590
 well and then another kind of strong tea is not 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.880
 more people I thought they are like to paint 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.340
 and that I do not think you're not getting 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.860
 enough as force from 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.470
 glue to work but in 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.150
 That's why I want to teach them because 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.650
 I said I said I saw many 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.750
 people who have that problem in their 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.730
 cooks and do not know how to solve it or pos 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.370
 they give up and they leave it because they say 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.980
 something recent fix health goes worse 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.810
 the situation but you define this good 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.620
 next gone as I said no more 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.620
 and of a tip and then us and video 6
