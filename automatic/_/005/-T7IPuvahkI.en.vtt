yeah<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.290> salver<00:02:44.860> clin<00:02:45.370> but<00:02:45.550> now<00:02:46.350> here's<00:02:47.350> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
yeah a salver clin but now here's the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.230 
yeah a salver clin but now here's the
clone<00:02:48.030> yes<00:02:49.030> sir<00:02:49.090> his<00:02:49.360> clone<00:02:50.760> put<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.790> part<00:02:52.120> of

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
clone yes sir his clone put a part of

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.770 
clone yes sir his clone put a part of
the<00:02:52.420> mock<00:02:53.160> here<00:02:54.160> we've<00:02:54.310> got<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.820> one<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.690> the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
the mock here we've got a one of the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.860 
the mock here we've got a one of the
down<00:02:55.960> buildings<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:58.150> Brooke<00:02:58.390> scattered

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
down buildings so Brooke scattered

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.020 
down buildings so Brooke scattered
around<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.320> then<00:02:59.440> at<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.650> front<00:02:59.980> we've<00:03:00.730> got

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
around and then at the front we've got

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.990 
around and then at the front we've got
over<00:03:01.240> one<00:03:01.570> kenobi<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.320> then<00:03:02.680> come<00:03:03.550> on<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.760> Cody

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
over one kenobi and then come on to Cody

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.920 
over one kenobi and then come on to Cody
um<00:03:05.010> with<00:03:06.010> six<00:03:06.430> clones<00:03:06.820> reinforcing<00:03:07.630> them<00:03:07.780> I

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
um with six clones reinforcing them I

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.630 
um with six clones reinforcing them I
didn't<00:03:08.170> put<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.380> guns<00:03:08.590> on<00:03:08.830> these<00:03:08.980> ones<00:03:09.250> or<00:03:09.520> on

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
didn't put the guns on these ones or on

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.850 
didn't put the guns on these ones or on
the<00:03:09.760> droids<00:03:10.030> because<00:03:10.510> it's<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.590> work<00:03:11.830> in

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
the droids because it's a work in

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.500 
the droids because it's a work in
progress<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.790> just<00:03:12.910> can<00:03:13.090> really<00:03:13.390> be

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
progress and I just can really be

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.680 
progress and I just can really be
bothered<00:03:15.150> see<00:03:16.150> ya<00:03:16.470> there's<00:03:18.000> 36<00:03:19.000> i<00:03:19.300> think<00:03:19.540> in

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
bothered see ya there's 36 i think in

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:27.710 
bothered see ya there's 36 i think in
total<00:03:20.140> clones<00:03:21.570> reinforcing<00:03:22.980> forward

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.630 

yeah<00:03:30.110> Anakin<00:03:31.110> Starfighter<00:03:31.710> is<00:03:32.190> going<00:03:32.520> to

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
yeah Anakin Starfighter is going to

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.760 
yeah Anakin Starfighter is going to
attack<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.970> bomber<00:03:33.210> that<00:03:33.540> was<00:03:34.260> on<00:03:34.380> stilts

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
attack the bomber that was on stilts

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.800 
attack the bomber that was on stilts
secondly<00:03:35.900> buildings<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.140> back<00:03:39.410> 8080

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
secondly buildings in the back 8080

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:49.550 
secondly buildings in the back 8080
gunship<00:03:44.390> net<00:03:45.390> Rex<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.380> gunship<00:03:46.920> with<00:03:48.560> to

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
gunship net Rex and the gunship with to

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.520 
gunship net Rex and the gunship with to
clone<00:03:50.550> troopers<00:03:50.940> they're<00:03:51.540> probably<00:03:51.660> more<00:03:52.170> but

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
clone troopers they're probably more but

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.080 
clone troopers they're probably more but
I<00:03:52.560> put<00:03:52.770> them<00:03:52.890> on<00:03:53.010> then<00:03:53.190> I<00:03:53.310> put<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.580> gunship<00:03:53.940> on

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
I put them on then I put the gunship on

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.450 
I put them on then I put the gunship on
the<00:03:54.210> stills<00:03:54.540> then<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.800> was<00:03:55.920> quite<00:03:56.100> hard<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.310> put

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
the stills then it was quite hard to put

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.100 
the stills then it was quite hard to put
the<00:03:56.520> figures<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:57.030> he<00:03:57.210> kept<00:03:57.450> wobbling<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.020> I

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
the figures in he kept wobbling and I

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.470 
the figures in he kept wobbling and I
thought<00:03:58.290> it's<00:03:58.380> going<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.590> fall<00:03:58.770> so<00:03:59.240> every<00:04:00.240> more

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
thought it's going to fall so every more

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.090 
thought it's going to fall so every more
in<00:04:00.690> there<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:02.850> other<00:04:02.970> thing<00:04:03.209> is<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:03.860> guys<00:04:04.860> get

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
in there the other thing is you guys get

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.330 
in there the other thing is you guys get
to<00:04:05.250> decide<00:04:05.340> what<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.720> vehicle<00:04:07.170> goes<00:04:07.380> in<00:04:07.740> the

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
to decide what the vehicle goes in the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.940 
to decide what the vehicle goes in the
middle<00:04:08.670> what's<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.180> main<00:04:09.390> vehicle<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:10.560> could

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
middle what's the main vehicle it could

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.800 
middle what's the main vehicle it could
be<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:13.040> 8080<00:04:14.040> which<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.120> think<00:04:15.330> looks<00:04:15.360> quite

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
be the 8080 which I think looks quite

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:24.800 
be the 8080 which I think looks quite
cool<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:19.709> 8080<00:04:20.720> or<00:04:22.850> just<00:04:23.850> like<00:04:24.330> us<00:04:24.480> down<00:04:24.690> the

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
cool the 8080 or just like us down the

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.049 
cool the 8080 or just like us down the
set

00:04:31.049 --> 00:04:31.059 

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:42.069 

Wolfie<00:04:37.539> hte<00:04:38.889> at<00:04:39.889> the<00:04:40.039> moment<00:04:40.369> the<00:04:40.689> HT<00:04:41.689> looks<00:04:41.989> a

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:42.079 
Wolfie hte at the moment the HT looks a

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:44.469 
Wolfie hte at the moment the HT looks a
lot<00:04:42.199> better<00:04:42.409> because<00:04:42.889> I<00:04:43.369> design<00:04:43.819> I<00:04:44.059> put<00:04:44.389> the

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
lot better because I design I put the

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.109 
lot better because I design I put the
clones<00:04:45.039> obsession<00:04:46.039> the<00:04:46.129> clones<00:04:46.369> around<00:04:46.999> the

00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:47.119 
clones obsession the clones around the

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:50.129 
clones obsession the clones around the
HT<00:04:47.569> but<00:04:48.529> I<00:04:48.559> prob<00:04:48.769> for<00:04:48.979> more<00:04:49.189> clones<00:04:49.489> in<00:04:49.699> if<00:04:49.849> the

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
HT but I prob for more clones in if the

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.329 
HT but I prob for more clones in if the
8080<00:04:51.139> was<00:04:51.469> in<00:04:51.649> um<00:04:53.349> yeah<00:04:54.349> I<00:04:54.469> won't<00:04:54.709> put<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:55.009> ATO

00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:55.339 
8080 was in um yeah I won't put the ATO

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:58.809 
8080 was in um yeah I won't put the ATO
team<00:04:55.669> because<00:04:56.149> of<00:04:56.839> them<00:04:57.399> Christophsis<00:04:58.399> gets<00:04:58.699> a

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819 
team because of them Christophsis gets a

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:00.699 
team because of them Christophsis gets a
lot<00:04:58.969> of<00:04:59.089> aerial<00:04:59.689> assault<00:05:00.049> so<00:05:00.289> there'd<00:05:00.499> be<00:05:00.589> no

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:00.709 
lot of aerial assault so there'd be no

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:03.369 
lot of aerial assault so there'd be no
protection<00:05:01.249> and<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:02.479> turbo<00:05:02.779> tanks<00:05:03.139> don't

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:03.379 
protection and the turbo tanks don't

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.179 
protection and the turbo tanks don't
really<00:05:03.529> go<00:05:03.649> through<00:05:03.860> cities<00:05:04.429> so<00:05:05.419> yeah<00:05:06.289> a<00:05:06.529> tte

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:07.189 
really go through cities so yeah a tte

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:13.659 
really go through cities so yeah a tte
or<00:05:08.259> 8080<00:05:09.789> see<00:05:10.789> that's<00:05:10.999> the<00:05:11.889> mocked<00:05:12.889> outside<00:05:13.519> to

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
or 8080 see that's the mocked outside to
