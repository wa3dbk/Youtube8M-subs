00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.300
 a 'gunner' patricians 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.690
 in the same way 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.040
 and also 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.750
 a lot of paperwork 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.310
 I remind him of life since I met him on the side of the restaurants in 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.530
 the bars were not not 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.350
 with papers with skins and cartoonists of papers with what was with the conagua 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.490
 del del este with beer continent 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.350
 the pen with ink 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.610
 he puts coffee with milk he used everything 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.610
 what he had around him with trains to center 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.480
 pl had one in a huge uneasiness by the sides by the raw materials 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.290
 linear 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.240
 non-figurative painting the exception he found a freedom 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.590
 Yes of course it is an effort the opposite Santander 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.940
 a very big freedom 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.750
 to be able to carry out 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.169
 all that desire this invitation and search that felt 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:13.639
 and without work with all kinds 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.319
 what sands 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.529
 and sands of the sea 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.809
 daily marble powder 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:22.989
 and industrial polymers 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.009
 your country all 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.169
 Asier clay older and that older 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:29.869
 with hahahaha 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:31.010
 began to grow 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.000
 I grew up with old formulas with a game you know because that, of course, 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.960
 that the painting of the 13th century the Romanesque era already prepared such tables 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.739
 The cohesion power of the game is very 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.269
 is very powerful 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.469
 flaxseed oil chiotis 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.099
 I started to feel exclaimed 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.509
 people who have spent so many years 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:58.209
 and paintings painted with experimental materials of this type are those that have 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.509
 supported better than any other over time 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:05.499
 May marks the twentieth anniversary of Joseph's death 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:06.839
 gentleman 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:10.299
 but when walking through the halls of the circle of fine arts dedicated to the 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.589
 exhibition seems very alive to us through his work 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.529
 the paper work is the most alive 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.209
 because it is the least perfect 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.559
 the most dynamic 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:22.839
 the one in which we observe the experimenting eagerness of the artist 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:24.689
 a curiosity 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:26.759
 that almost childish optimism 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.059
 to discover 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:29.389
 by zones 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.389
 bedroom suspicion before knowledge 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:35.339
 everything starts with the drawing 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:37.880
 this beginning of the first figurative stage 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.319
 in the wanted decorations and posters for Ionian GarcÃ­a Lorca 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.219
 figuration that moves towards abstraction 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.759
 a disfigured figuration 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:50.029
 the 50's sun 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.029
 yes anyway as in the electorate 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.659
 all this with the effectiveness of teaching all these cities 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.429
 the one that has not dealt with the thirty years of the dictatorship 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.009
 but that looks 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.679
 the very good the beta brava of the Spanish tradition are the colors 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:15.389
 quite sober its the palette that is adapting in the end you until the end of 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:16.279
 his days 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.499
 and it is a work that sends us 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:22.460
 the classics of Spanish painting to the great masters will act 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.580
 even supports 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.319
 in the late 60's 50 pesos of the 60 plus gestural labor is more is 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:30.559
 informalist 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:36.089
 and what doubt until here explains prince prince the 70 this one in which the work 

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:41.489
 It is being purified by practicing the letter of foundation of wood materials on 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.529
 the circle appears 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:50.419
 way more to if kate detests 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.029
 experimentation rather of space 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:56.990
 the funds start to do 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.110
 percent more and more 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.900
 clearer and this will continue to the end you 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.900
 of his aunts the work is being purified 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:08.999
 meanwhile stroke 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:11.999
 earthquakes 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:14.669
 Henry had a color palette 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.800
 pretty reduced 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.430
 and I think it's very Spanish 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.430
 especially because they were fundamentally land 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.120
 i also 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.729
 red black and white 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.059
 but 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:31.249
 only time to use blue 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:34.249
 when he had to refer directly to the sea 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:54.900
 there are installed all over the world 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.790
 and in some families and friends pass by there 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.610
 immediate 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.669
 i min at that time 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.240
 they had and juvenile 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.719
 and that wanted me to make me complex 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:14.249
 then I gave myself a generation and had sent the foundation doctor in 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:15.789
 the pharmacy 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.279
 that they put me face with a laugh 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:22.349
 because he did not have the voluntary nature of ministers 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:25.770
 interior has insisted banker 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.189
 well muÃ±oz 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:28.479
 and then expensive 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:29.789
 I had an aspect 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:33.099
 sanchez 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:34.279
 wore 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.400
 very white very well white face 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.110
 It was a cream that I was afraid of suffering 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.029
 the region 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:42.029
 and then it was common bluish white 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:45.939
 I remember that I robbed them that same time of the lipsticks 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.819
 ii because they do not let me tempt month and then I went out to the street 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:55.520
 intimate agency that the bluish white background irastorza summered with him 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.520
 with the virus 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.039
 odd gerard quintana squares 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:02.580
 they were not enough 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.580
 and that seems to have caught his attention 

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:09.149
 4
