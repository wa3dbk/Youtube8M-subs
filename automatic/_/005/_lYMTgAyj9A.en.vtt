00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
go through the stitch grab now you have

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.280 
go through the stitch grab now you have
three<00:03:36.220> you're<00:03:37.220> going<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.430> wrap<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:38.290> pull

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
three you're going to wrap and pull

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.330 
three you're going to wrap and pull
through<00:03:39.530> all<00:03:39.829> of<00:03:39.859> them<00:03:41.769> so<00:03:42.769> it's<00:03:42.920> like<00:03:43.010> that

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
through all of them so it's like that

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.680 
through all of them so it's like that
now<00:03:43.970> when<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.359> go<00:03:44.569> back<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.109> forth<00:03:45.200> on<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.709> half

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
now when you go back and forth on a half

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.789 
now when you go back and forth on a half
double<00:03:47.690> pattern<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.470> creates<00:03:49.040> almost<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:50.000> ridge

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
double pattern it creates almost a ridge

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.800 
double pattern it creates almost a ridge
when<00:03:51.799> you<00:03:51.920> switch<00:03:52.250> back<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:52.790> forth

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
when you switch back and forth

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.890 
when you switch back and forth
so<00:03:54.319> it<00:03:54.709> almost<00:03:55.130> makes<00:03:55.430> like<00:03:55.730> stripes<00:03:56.180> in<00:03:56.480> your

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
so it almost makes like stripes in your

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.640 
so it almost makes like stripes in your
pattern<00:03:57.319> which<00:03:57.709> I<00:03:58.160> kind<00:03:58.580> of<00:03:58.610> like<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:59.560> think<00:04:00.560> it

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
pattern which I kind of like I think it

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.220 
pattern which I kind of like I think it
looks<00:04:00.860> pretty<00:04:01.010> neat<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:02.000> I'll<00:04:02.750> show<00:04:02.990> you<00:04:03.080> a
