scalpels

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
scalpels

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.270 
scalpels
which<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:43.729> plastic<00:01:45.319> handles<00:01:46.319> and<00:01:46.619> plastic

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
grips for the blade because it tends to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.999 
grips for the blade because it tends to
break<00:01:52.310> as<00:01:53.310> these<00:01:53.670> things<00:01:53.910> are<00:01:54.239> often<00:01:55.009> screwed

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009

forcefully you know to hold the blade in

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.940 
forcefully you know to hold the blade in
place<00:02:02.220> tends<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.270> break<00:02:03.479> pretty<00:02:04.020> easily<00:02:04.200> so

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
place tends to break pretty easily so

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.210 
place tends to break pretty easily so
that's<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:06.479> know<00:02:06.599> not<00:02:06.989> not<00:02:07.200> too<00:02:07.440> good<00:02:07.709> this

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
interesting for for fiddly bits and I've

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.130 
interesting for for fiddly bits and I've
been<00:02:55.560> using<00:02:55.740> a<00:02:55.890> pair<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.240> similar<00:02:57.240> implements
