00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:07.379
 Hello everyone 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:11.580
 today we find ourselves 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.870
 I explained to you that I have 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.699
 found really interesting to you 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.420
 share a started early June when 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.890
 I started 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.230
 it takes May 13 , 1914 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.510
 I wanted to start a good team 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.660
 and all but as as know it's 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.360
 really very hard but these monique 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 and I'm very lucky to have 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.020
 tried in a pact it's theirs 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.879
 ways of your credit or 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.170
 players who are very expensive for 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.469
 can you not bathe important no 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.760
 the packs still pretty expensive this 7500 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.809
 credit for the luck we can have 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.610
 good days in it I find that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.110
 really worth it 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.469
 his temperament to put the money in 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.480
 the game so I see you especially well 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.609
 beautiful way of buying resale is everything 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.129
 beautiful except that I found it really 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.820
 too long too complicated as I have 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.810
 really bad luck 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:14.390
 well if that's so I asked my friends 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.530
 there is a technique to have several 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.799
 for playing the players we want 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:25.500
 so since I really like paris 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.119
 he gave me jews 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.540
 I explain the method I have 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.960
 did it all to have him he gave me 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.850
 thiago silva 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.579
 so we can see here of those who are 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.060
 so see you in the hundred thousand 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.290
 a hundred and twenty thousand crazy so I 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.540
 confirms an interesting fact of having 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.710
 100 but important credit because we 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.479
 can all have a very good team 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.159
 so that 's the technique I did 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.950
 but here's what told me to go 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.049
 so we are welcomed on the said 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.939
 that we could have but if we have twelve 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.600
 days we're seeing a focus on 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:10.280
 duplicator so if it's very easy 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.840
 open just received the instructions 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.340
 something in space is but he 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.319
 I had to mark in the code of 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.379
 Pilar answer to the secret question 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.330
 we know that web application so 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.510
 to mark the code well and after the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.989
 secret question in space but here 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.079
 we put the e-mail that it takes to get 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.959
 connect to the web application m in the 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.879
 10sport objected if we put the name of the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.930
 players explained because we can 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:46.140
 to have more but less seen than at 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.299
 picked but does it for the fans I 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.209
 want to see it just works a fashion and the 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:55.410
 salt or Chinese then in the big 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.489
 rectangle if we put the number of times 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.140
 we want to play as I could have 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.430
 score three times to mock var 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.530
 where the number of credits 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.560
 we send the message is normally 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.940

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:16.019
