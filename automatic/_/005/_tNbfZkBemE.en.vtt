I<00:05:35.639> spent<00:05:36.240> close<00:05:36.659> to<00:05:37.819> 14,000<00:05:38.819> building<00:05:39.150> it<00:05:39.300> I

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
I spent close to 14,000 building it I

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.749 
I spent close to 14,000 building it I
thought<00:05:40.169> only<00:05:40.379> the<00:05:40.530> best<00:05:40.860> parts<00:05:41.189> I<00:05:41.310> could<00:05:41.490> find

thought only the best parts I could find

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.450 
thought only the best parts I could find
this<00:05:42.240> is<00:05:42.389> why<00:05:42.539> it<00:05:42.599> performs<00:05:43.169> very<00:05:43.259> well<00:05:43.500> most

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
this is why it performs very well most

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.809 
this is why it performs very well most
conversions<00:05:44.819> are<00:05:45.180> done<00:05:45.389> so<00:05:45.750> half-assedly
