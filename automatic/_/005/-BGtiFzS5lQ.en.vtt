00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
hoist wise this has to be frustrating it

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.140 
hoist wise this has to be frustrating it
is<00:02:32.870> frustrating<00:02:33.709> because<00:02:34.099> this<00:02:34.310> terminal<00:02:34.639> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
is frustrating because this terminal the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.290 
is frustrating because this terminal the
team

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.240 

shots<00:02:39.680> fired<00:02:39.920> everywhere
