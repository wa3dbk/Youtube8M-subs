00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
bases oh my gosh this is not looking

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.860 
bases oh my gosh this is not looking
good<00:01:38.070> at<00:01:38.220> all<00:01:38.370> this<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.270> looking<00:01:39.540> good<00:01:39.720> at

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
good at all this is not looking good at

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.210 
good at all this is not looking good at
all<00:01:40.020> he<00:01:40.230> still<00:01:40.470> got<00:01:40.560> all<00:01:40.710> those<00:01:40.830> drones<00:01:41.100> he

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
all he still got all those drones he

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.070 
all he still got all those drones he
hasn't<00:01:41.430> lost<00:01:41.580> many<00:01:41.820> drones<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:42.900> you<00:01:42.960> get

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
hasn't lost many drones so if you get

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.020 
hasn't lost many drones so if you get
those<00:01:43.200> hatcheries<00:01:43.680> going<00:01:43.920> pretty<00:01:44.130> quickly<00:01:44.370> he

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
those hatcheries going pretty quickly he

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.910 
those hatcheries going pretty quickly he
can<00:01:45.150> come<00:01:45.300> back<00:01:45.360> into<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.870> hopefully<00:01:46.650> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
can come back into it hopefully and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.340 
can come back into it hopefully and
maybe<00:01:47.100> get<00:01:47.250> another<00:01:47.280> base<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.210> well<00:01:48.450> but

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
maybe get another base going as well but

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.070 
maybe get another base going as well but
this<00:01:49.410> is<00:01:49.680> really<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.310> bad<00:01:50.510> jamie<00:01:51.510> has<00:01:51.540> five

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
this is really really bad jamie has five

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.470 
this is really really bad jamie has five
bases<00:01:52.710> he's<00:01:53.370> just<00:01:53.550> macaran<00:01:54.030> off<00:01:54.120> these<00:01:54.300> five

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
bases he's just macaran off these five

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.620 
bases he's just macaran off these five
bases<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.130> oh<00:01:56.130> my<00:01:57.000> gosh<00:01:57.120> he's<00:01:57.300> got<00:01:57.480> he's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
bases and oh my gosh he's got he's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.510 
bases and oh my gosh he's got he's
building<00:01:58.290> such<00:01:58.470> huge<00:01:58.800> armies<00:02:01.160> we<00:02:02.160> do<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.370> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
building such huge armies we do have the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.950 
building such huge armies we do have the
filers<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:02.970> play<00:02:03.090> now<00:02:03.120> it's<00:02:03.420> been<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> plague<00:02:03.750> oh

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
filers in play now it's been a plague oh

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660 
filers in play now it's been a plague oh
I<00:02:04.350> was<00:02:04.650> hoping<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.160> was<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.430> plague<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
I was hoping it was going to plague that

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.700 
I was hoping it was going to plague that
huge<00:02:06.090> group<00:02:06.300> of<00:02:06.390> zealots<00:02:06.510> getting<00:02:07.500> some

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
huge group of zealots getting some

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.390 
huge group of zealots getting some
swarms<00:02:08.100> down<00:02:08.340> now<00:02:09.710> to<00:02:10.710> try<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:10.950> protect<00:02:11.280> those

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
swarms down now to try and protect those

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.190 
swarms down now to try and protect those
lurkers<00:02:11.850> and<00:02:12.030> he's<00:02:12.120> got<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.360> lot<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.690> guys<00:02:12.990> he's

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
lurkers and he's got a lot of guys he's

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.540 
lurkers and he's got a lot of guys he's
pretty<00:02:13.440> genuine<00:02:13.650> heavy<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.100> it's<00:02:14.250> going<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.460> be

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
pretty genuine heavy so it's going to be

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.220 
pretty genuine heavy so it's going to be
pretty<00:02:14.670> good<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.390> he<00:02:15.480> doesn't<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.960> ton<00:02:16.170> of

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
pretty good but he doesn't have a ton of

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.990 
pretty good but he doesn't have a ton of
lurkers<00:02:16.500> anymore<00:02:16.980> he's<00:02:17.160> lost<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.610> lot<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.790> them

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
lurkers anymore he's lost a lot of them

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.330 
lurkers anymore he's lost a lot of them
and<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.080> storms<00:02:19.470> are<00:02:19.590> also<00:02:19.770> obviously<00:02:20.220> gonna

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
and the storms are also obviously gonna

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.670 
and the storms are also obviously gonna
be<00:02:20.430> able<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.610> deal<00:02:20.760> with<00:02:20.880> those<00:02:21.000> lurkers<00:02:21.330> he<00:02:22.290> in

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
be able to deal with those lurkers he in

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.650 
be able to deal with those lurkers he in
fact<00:02:22.800> hits<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.700> one<00:02:23.910> lurker<00:02:24.210> a<00:02:24.240> couple<00:02:24.510> times

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
fact hits that one lurker a couple times

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.000 
fact hits that one lurker a couple times
of<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.900> zealot<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.170> then<00:02:25.320> storms<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:25.920> to

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
of the zealot and then storms it to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.670 
of the zealot and then storms it to
finish<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.340> off<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.640> look<00:02:26.760> like<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.260> is

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
finish it off it look like so this is

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.500 
finish it off it look like so this is
really<00:02:29.040> really<00:02:29.250> bad<00:02:29.340> 40<00:02:29.910> he's<00:02:30.120> going<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.360> pull

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
really really bad 40 he's going to pull

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.420 
really really bad 40 he's going to pull
something<00:02:30.780> out<00:02:30.959> very<00:02:31.290> quickly<00:02:31.500> here<00:02:31.890> he's

gotta bees in real trouble it's gonna

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.290 
gotta bees in real trouble it's gonna
play<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.920> those<00:02:35.010> units<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:35.489> not<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.790> terribly

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
play in those units but not a terribly

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.870 
play in those units but not a terribly
good<00:02:36.390> plague<00:02:36.750> storms<00:02:37.709> are<00:02:37.830> going<00:02:37.980> off<00:02:38.070> slowly

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
good plague storms are going off slowly

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.250 
good plague storms are going off slowly
taking<00:02:39.300> out<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.480> units<00:02:39.750> underneath<00:02:40.110> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
swarm is going to do another plague no

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.350 
swarm is going to do another plague no
not<00:02:44.190> catching<00:02:44.580> as<00:02:44.670> much<00:02:44.850> this<00:02:44.970> time<00:02:45.030> but

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
hydras from behind storms are gonna go

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.229 
hydras from behind storms are gonna go
off<00:03:40.540> nine<00:03:40.810> storms<00:03:41.200> on<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:41.380> hydras<00:03:41.770> um<00:03:42.400> not

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
off nine storms on the hydras um not

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.760 
off nine storms on the hydras um not
many<00:03:43.450> storms<00:03:43.780> left<00:03:43.959> also<00:03:44.260> it's<00:03:44.380> just<00:03:44.650> two

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
many storms left also it's just two

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.880 
many storms left also it's just two
goons<00:03:45.010> just<00:03:45.730> chew<00:03:45.880> goons<00:03:46.120> versus<00:03:46.660> hydras<00:03:47.020> but

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
goons just chew goons versus hydras but

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.040 
goons just chew goons versus hydras but
where<00:03:48.099> is<00:03:48.280> his<00:03:48.430> army<00:03:48.880> oh<00:03:49.060> it<00:03:49.390> wasn't<00:03:49.600> as<00:03:49.810> big<00:03:50.020> of

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
where is his army oh it wasn't as big of

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.479 
where is his army oh it wasn't as big of
an<00:03:50.170> army<00:03:50.440> as<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:50.650> thought<00:03:50.860> it<00:03:51.040> was<00:03:51.130> I<00:03:51.160> thought<00:03:51.250> he

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
an army as I thought it was I thought he

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.070 
an army as I thought it was I thought he
had<00:03:51.580> a<00:03:51.610> huge<00:03:51.910> army<00:03:52.120> coming<00:03:52.390> in<00:03:52.540> for<00:03:52.690> that<00:03:52.780> flank

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
had a huge army coming in for that flank

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.080 
had a huge army coming in for that flank
but<00:03:53.770> it<00:03:53.860> turned<00:03:54.250> out<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.489> was<00:03:54.670> just<00:03:54.700> two

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
but it turned out it was just two

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.960 
but it turned out it was just two
lurkers<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.660> a<00:03:55.720> few<00:03:55.900> hydras<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:57.250> so<00:03:57.790> I<00:03:57.819> think

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
lurkers and a few hydras and so I think

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.960 
lurkers and a few hydras and so I think
that<00:03:58.270> Jane<00:03:58.690> be<00:03:58.810> is<00:03:58.930> going<00:03:59.140> to<00:03:59.260> kill<00:03:59.470> off<00:03:59.970> zero

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
that Jane be is going to kill off zero

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.930 
that Jane be is going to kill off zero
here<00:04:01.239> in<00:04:01.450> just<00:04:01.660> a<00:04:01.810> moment<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:03.160> sad<00:04:03.519> to<00:04:03.760> see

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
here in just a moment and so sad to see

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.910 
here in just a moment and so sad to see
him<00:04:04.000> go<00:04:04.120> down<00:04:04.269> he's<00:04:04.900> got<00:04:05.080> so<00:04:05.290> many<00:04:05.440> bases

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
him go down he's got so many bases

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.229 
him go down he's got so many bases
morphing<00:04:06.280> around<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:06.610> map<00:04:06.790> right<00:04:07.000> now<00:04:07.120> as

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
morphing around the map right now as

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.030 
morphing around the map right now as
well<00:04:07.450> that<00:04:08.019> he<00:04:08.050> could<00:04:08.350> theoretically<00:04:08.680> come

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
well that he could theoretically come

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.530 
well that he could theoretically come
back<00:04:09.190> into<00:04:09.400> this<00:04:09.489> if<00:04:09.640> this<00:04:09.760> attack<00:04:09.940> had<00:04:10.269> failed

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
back into this if this attack had failed

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.360 
back into this if this attack had failed
but<00:04:11.110> it<00:04:11.200> looks<00:04:11.380> like<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.650> sack<00:04:11.830> is<00:04:12.069> going<00:04:12.310> to

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
but it looks like the sack is going to

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.240 
but it looks like the sack is going to
push<00:04:12.549> in<00:04:12.700> slowly<00:04:13.049> or<00:04:14.049> well<00:04:14.620> not<00:04:15.010> slowly

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
push in slowly or well not slowly

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.770 
push in slowly or well not slowly
actually<00:04:15.640> this<00:04:15.760> tech<00:04:15.970> is<00:04:16.120> going<00:04:16.329> to<00:04:16.389> push<00:04:16.600> in

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
actually this tech is going to push in

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.629 
actually this tech is going to push in
towards<00:04:17.049> his<00:04:17.169> expansion<00:04:17.590> it's<00:04:18.280> got<00:04:18.400> a<00:04:18.430> couple

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
towards his expansion it's got a couple

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.009 
towards his expansion it's got a couple
more<00:04:18.760> Templar<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.239> mix<00:04:19.389> now<00:04:19.450> as<00:04:19.660> well<00:04:19.840> he's

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
more Templar the mix now as well he's

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.420 
more Templar the mix now as well he's

coming<00:04:39.130> from<00:04:39.250> zero<00:04:39.550> at<00:04:39.700> man<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.600> is

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
coming from zero at man that is

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.500 
coming from zero at man that is
disappointing<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:41.500> thought<00:04:41.770> zero<00:04:42.160> was<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.510> pad

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
disappointing I thought zero was a pad

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.990 
disappointing I thought zero was a pad
it<00:04:43.720> was<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:43.870> contender<00:04:44.590> for<00:04:44.800> going<00:04:45.430> far<00:04:45.669> in<00:04:45.820> both

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
it was a contender for going far in both

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.140 
it was a contender for going far in both
starlings<00:04:46.450> he<00:04:46.600> has<00:04:46.720> consistently<00:04:47.289> been<00:04:47.530> in<00:04:48.150> in

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
starlings he has consistently been in in

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.820 
starlings he has consistently been in in
both<00:04:49.510> star<00:04:49.840> leagues<00:04:50.050> for<00:04:50.289> the<00:04:50.350> last<00:04:50.560> two

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
both star leagues for the last two

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.710 
both star leagues for the last two
seasons<00:04:51.100> and<00:04:51.520> so<00:04:51.760> it's<00:04:51.910> really<00:04:52.150> sad<00:04:52.450> to<00:04:52.600> see

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
seasons and so it's really sad to see

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.320 
seasons and so it's really sad to see
him<00:04:52.780> go<00:04:52.840> out<00:04:53.080> in<00:04:53.260> an<00:04:53.350> early<00:04:53.650> stage<00:04:53.680> of<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.850> msl
