00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 hello everyone in this little blog vi 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:10.830
 let's see how it's done 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.840
 water detox is basically water 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.969
 very refreshing made with the sitra 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.830
 not ginger the lemon and help 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.900
 this can deflate you a lot 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.269
 did I become the flat flat 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.390
 I discovered it through some of my friends 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:30.599
 you hear me on buzz move forward but many 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.079
 so many wonderful girls and that there 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.809
 we made this water this detox water 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.070
 which is the same model models do 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.649
 of fitness 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.320
 obviously it's not that they become that 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.670
 become between received steel the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.430
 marble name but helps and eliminates many 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.020
 slag then i would really be 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.629
 very easy we would like it online 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.469
 in reality however we deserve the lemon but 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.059
 well the same 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.609
 I put everything on its skin 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.550
 We are done we filled cucumber 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.719
 inside we put a nice little piece of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.390
 this is ginger too 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.439
 I give you life someone who goes a long way 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.850
 taste very taste this with this water 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.189
 it is once that the water runs out 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.530
 reloaded and left in one of the 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.600
 cucumber and I also do two days 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.530
 so why then still continue to 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.500
 throw their happen 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.750
 perfumes especially ginger not 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.200
 will try not to cut it too much 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.140
 small because they are ticking and therefore if yes 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.240
 leaves inter I have not even less strong 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.409
 then we also make lemon a 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.300
 always pieces of organic lemons 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.670
 if you want to finish the peel if it doesn't have 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:52.460
 made the rooms online a nice method 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.820
 because maybe a little lazy on the web and that 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.420
 obviously not being simple water and 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.759
 fresh and aromatic moment something pete 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.619
 who does him good 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.800
 you drink it much more willingly 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.810
 water from normal water and maybe 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.840
 upgrade the two liters too 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.750
 of water without noticing it 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.150
 however, then putting the water back often 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.360
 when it ends even if the jug that 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.190
 you have little at home, it doesn't matter 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.170
 in seriality we go to fill it with 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.880
 water you can put mineral water 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.880
 use water from the tap 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.549
 now our saying if ready and before 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.730
 drink it by soaking done or too much 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.950
 at least half an hour is good 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.010
 loretta in 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.260
 refrigerator and I hope I am 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.519

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.519
