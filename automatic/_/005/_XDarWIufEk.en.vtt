00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
I was feeling quite confident I was

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.070 
I was feeling quite confident I was
feeling<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.390> could<00:01:03.600> win<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.780> game

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080

fairly<00:01:04.589> easily<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.159> Pogba<00:01:05.970> when<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.210> nice<00:01:06.510> run

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
fairly easily and Pogba when a nice run

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.260

played it outside too alessio curtsy I

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.219 
played it outside too alessio curtsy I
think<00:01:09.600> that's<00:01:09.750> how<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.869> say<00:01:10.110> his<00:01:10.140> name

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
think that's how you say his name

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.990 
think that's how you say his name
because<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.830> guys<00:01:10.979> usually<00:01:11.220> gun<00:01:11.610> him<00:01:11.760> about

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
because you guys usually gun him about

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.240 
because you guys usually gun him about

plays it across to marry Oh Balotelli
and<00:01:25.920> Balotelli<00:01:26.460> really<00:01:26.909> should<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.210> scorned

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and Balotelli really should be scorned

and Balotelli really should be scorned
just<00:01:28.020> about<00:01:28.170> over<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> bar<00:01:28.680> anyway<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.189> we

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
just about over the bar anyway and we

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.399 
just about over the bar anyway and we
were<00:01:29.670> very<00:01:29.700> unlucky<00:01:30.180> there<00:01:30.479> anyway<00:01:30.930> late<00:01:31.140> into

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
were very unlucky there anyway late into

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.929 
were very unlucky there anyway late into
the<00:01:31.439> game<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.890> he<00:01:31.920> managed<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.610> get<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.759> goal

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the game and he managed to get a goal

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.420 
the game and he managed to get a goal
back<00:01:33.119> obviously<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> rebound<00:01:34.320> goal<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.340> be

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
back obviously a rebound goal and to be

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.740 
back obviously a rebound goal and to be
honest<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.759> would<00:01:35.939> say<00:01:36.119> he<00:01:36.240> deserved<00:01:36.600> it

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
honest I would say he deserved it

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.940 
honest I would say he deserved it
because<00:01:36.810> towards<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.350> end<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.619> game<00:01:37.650> he

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
because towards the end of the game he

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.560 
because towards the end of the game he
was<00:01:38.070> pushing<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> bit<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.060> as<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.390> see

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
was pushing on a bit but as you can see

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.330 
was pushing on a bit but as you can see
in<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.990> game<00:01:40.170> overall<00:01:40.470> total<00:01:40.979> domination

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
in the game overall total domination

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.130 
in the game overall total domination
look<00:01:41.880> at<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.060> stats<00:01:42.299> we<00:01:42.659> had<00:01:42.810> more<00:01:42.990> possession

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
look at the stats we had more possession

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.569 
look at the stats we had more possession
and<00:01:43.530> more<00:01:43.799> shots<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.189> everything<00:01:44.369> and

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
and more shots and everything and

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.280 
and more shots and everything and
overall<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.240> felt<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.689> really<00:01:46.020> really

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
overall I felt that we really really

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.960 
overall I felt that we really really
deserved<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.829> anyway<00:01:46.979> we're<00:01:47.520> gonna<00:01:47.610> move<00:01:47.820> into

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
deserved it anyway we're gonna move into

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.490 
deserved it anyway we're gonna move into
the<00:01:48.090> next<00:01:48.149> game<00:01:48.420> now<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.020> against

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the next game now and this is against

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.859 
the next game now and this is against
the<00:01:49.619> real<00:01:49.829> SMA<00:01:50.369> when<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.939> faced<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.360> guy<00:01:51.600> there

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the real SMA when I faced this guy there

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.749 
the real SMA when I faced this guy there
is<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> lot<00:01:52.259> more<00:01:52.290> than<00:01:52.470> 50k<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> line<00:01:53.399> this

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
is a lot more than 50k on the line this

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.179 
is a lot more than 50k on the line this
is<00:01:54.000> pride<00:01:54.630> because<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.799> like<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.100> have

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
is pride because we just like to have

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.950 
is pride because we just like to have
bent<00:01:56.490> about<00:01:56.759> who<00:01:57.149> wins<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.600> stuff<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:57.899> that

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
bent about who wins and stuff like that

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.899 
bent about who wins and stuff like that
and<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.469> usually<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.860> tight<00:01:59.100> game<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.490> as<00:01:59.790> you

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
and it's usually a tight game and as you

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.550 
and it's usually a tight game and as you
can<00:02:00.060> see<00:02:00.090> early<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> game<00:02:00.810> Luis<00:02:01.259> Suarez

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
can see early on in the game Luis Suarez

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.319 
can see early on in the game Luis Suarez
doesn't<00:02:01.890> hold<00:02:02.009> back<00:02:02.100> roulettes<00:02:02.820> my<00:02:02.939> defender

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
doesn't hold back roulettes my defender

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.179 
doesn't hold back roulettes my defender
and<00:02:03.479> finishes<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.990> into<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.439> far<00:02:04.649> corner<00:02:04.680> and

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
and finishes it into the far corner and

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.609 
and finishes it into the far corner and
at<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.119> point<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.509> felt<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.350> was<00:02:07.439> pretty

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
at that point I felt that it was pretty

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.169 
at that point I felt that it was pretty
much<00:02:07.770> game<00:02:08.039> over<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.369> just<00:02:08.640> didn't<00:02:08.910> think<00:02:08.940> it'd

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
much game over I just didn't think it'd

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.729 
much game over I just didn't think it'd
be<00:02:09.330> my<00:02:09.479> game<00:02:09.660> look<00:02:10.020> at<00:02:10.110> what<00:02:10.200> my<00:02:10.229> defenders

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
be my game look at what my defenders

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.290 
be my game look at what my defenders
doing<00:02:10.979> there<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.340> Luis<00:02:11.610> Suarez<00:02:11.910> finds<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
doing there and Luis Suarez finds the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.400 
doing there and Luis Suarez finds the
net<00:02:12.420> again<00:02:12.540> which

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
game because it's just really what he

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.570 
game because it's just really what he
does<00:02:21.870> he's<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.320> an<00:02:22.440> absolute<00:02:22.890> tank<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.310> as
