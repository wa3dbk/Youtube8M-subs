what you're seeing in the real world and

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.960 
what you're seeing in the real world and
you<00:00:17.380> look<00:00:17.500> through<00:00:17.680> the<00:00:17.740> place<00:00:17.890> of<00:00:18.039> invita<00:00:18.490> you

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
you look through the place of invita you

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.130 
you look through the place of invita you
see<00:00:19.150> you<00:00:19.240> don't<00:00:19.390> see<00:00:19.539> your<00:00:19.660> desk<00:00:19.869> to<00:00:20.019> see

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.650 

so<00:00:28.880> what<00:00:29.540> exactly<00:00:29.660> is<00:00:30.260> augmented<00:00:30.980> reality

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
so what exactly is augmented reality

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.240 
so what exactly is augmented reality
PlayStation<00:00:32.660> Vita<00:00:32.870> has<00:00:33.350> two<00:00:33.560> cameras<00:00:33.980> one<00:00:34.010> on

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.500 

we<00:00:50.900> look<00:00:51.170> through<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.620> device<00:00:51.950> and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
we look through the device and

you see this new world layered on top

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.900 
you see this new world layered on top
there's<00:00:57.590> a<00:00:57.650> kind<00:00:57.800> of<00:00:57.980> magic<00:00:58.220> there<00:00:58.700> with

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
there's a kind of magic there with

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.120 
there's a kind of magic there with
augmented<00:00:59.300> reality<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:00.650> it's<00:01:00.830> only<00:01:01.040> what

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
augmented reality and it's only what

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.560 
augmented reality and it's only what
we're<00:01:01.280> really<00:01:01.430> using<00:01:01.730> with<00:01:02.120> something<00:01:02.420> like

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
we're really using with something like

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.810 
we're really using with something like
reality<00:01:03.050> photo<00:01:04.750> we<00:01:05.750> are<00:01:05.810> trying<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.440> kind<00:01:06.680> of

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
reality photo we are trying to kind of

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.719 
reality photo we are trying to kind of
create<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.390> world<00:01:08.660> between<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:10.460> real<00:01:10.700> world

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
create the world between the real world

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.430 
create the world between the real world
versus<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.990> kind<00:01:12.200> of<00:01:12.290> virtual<00:01:12.500> world<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:15.350> as

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
versus the kind of virtual world so as

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.520 
versus the kind of virtual world so as
an<00:01:15.560> example<00:01:15.680> if<00:01:16.430> you<00:01:16.850> want<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.150> play<00:01:17.390> look<00:01:18.380> at

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
an example if you want to play look at

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.800 
an example if you want to play look at
the<00:01:18.590> characters<00:01:19.070> in<00:01:19.100> close<00:01:19.490> proximity<00:01:20.000> we

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
the characters in close proximity we

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.900 
the characters in close proximity we
allow<00:01:21.080> you<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.350> do<00:01:21.500> that<00:01:21.530> by<00:01:21.979> using<00:01:22.040> a<00:01:22.580> single

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
allow you to do that by using a single

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.359 
allow you to do that by using a single
AR<00:01:23.240> car<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:23.869> you<00:01:23.930> can<00:01:24.110> really<00:01:24.619> zoom<00:01:24.650> in<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.280> the

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
AR car so you can really zoom in to the

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.400 
AR car so you can really zoom in to the
characters<00:01:25.880> but<00:01:26.630> if<00:01:26.780> you're<00:01:26.960> out<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.320> about

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
characters but if you're out and about

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.620 
characters but if you're out and about
and<00:01:27.830> somewhere<00:01:28.130> interesting<00:01:28.430> like<00:01:29.030> maybe

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
and somewhere interesting like maybe

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.660 
and somewhere interesting like maybe
going<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.080> spy<00:01:30.350> scraper<00:01:30.680> you<00:01:31.310> can<00:01:31.490> actually

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
going a spy scraper you can actually

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.300 
going a spy scraper you can actually
project<00:01:32.300> your<00:01:32.780> fighters<00:01:33.380> from<00:01:33.920> top<00:01:34.130> of<00:01:34.250> a

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
project your fighters from top of a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.210 
project your fighters from top of a
skyscraper<00:01:34.630> onto<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.750> ground<00:01:35.990> level<00:01:36.170> now<00:01:37.160> the

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
skyscraper onto the ground level now the

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.430 
skyscraper onto the ground level now the
character<00:01:37.910> size<00:01:38.149> will<00:01:38.750> be<00:01:38.780> scaled<00:01:39.290> up

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
character size will be scaled up

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.249 
character size will be scaled up
accordingly<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:40.790> if<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:40.940> do<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.690> higher<00:01:41.899> of

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
accordingly so if you do the higher of

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.200 
accordingly so if you do the higher of
the<00:01:42.320> building<00:01:42.950> ago<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.550> bigger<00:01:43.820> character

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
the building ago the bigger character

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.600 
the building ago the bigger character
gets<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.200> end<00:01:45.320> result<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:46.009> that<00:01:46.040> you<00:01:46.369> could

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
gets so the end result is that you could

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.540 
gets so the end result is that you could
have<00:01:46.910> a<00:01:47.210> giant<00:01:47.830> godzilla-sized<00:01:48.830> character

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
have a giant godzilla-sized character

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.580 
have a giant godzilla-sized character
fighting<00:01:50.210> on<00:01:50.300> top<00:01:50.450> of<00:01:50.540> a<00:01:50.570> skyscraper<00:01:50.690> so<00:01:51.470> it's

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
fighting on top of a skyscraper so it's

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.520 
fighting on top of a skyscraper so it's
really<00:01:51.920> really<00:01:52.220> exciting

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.830 

for<00:01:58.530> me<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.950> think<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.399> mental<00:01:59.759> reality<00:02:00.119> it's

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
for me I think of mental reality it's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.319 
for me I think of mental reality it's
made<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.649> portable<00:02:02.219> devices<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:03.149> look

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
made for portable devices you look

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.029 
made for portable devices you look
through<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.869> device<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> augmented

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
through the device and the augmented

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.039 
through the device and the augmented
reality<00:02:05.429> is<00:02:05.490> layered<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> world<00:02:06.420> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
reality is layered on the world and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.839 
reality is layered on the world and
there's<00:02:07.289> there's<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.710> kind<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.099> magic<00:02:08.399> with

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
there's there's a kind of magic with

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
different buttons as well so it's like

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.850 
different buttons as well so it's like
you<00:03:14.239> know<00:03:14.299> lift<00:03:14.690> its<00:03:14.840> air<00:03:15.019> brakes<00:03:15.349> or<00:03:15.590> fire

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.110 
you know lift its air brakes or fire
weapons<00:03:20.049> so<00:03:21.049> reality<00:03:21.709> fighters<00:03:22.099> now<00:03:22.519> support

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
weapons so reality fighters now support

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.220 
weapons so reality fighters now support
both<00:03:23.569> the<00:03:23.750> traditional<00:03:24.489> er<00:03:25.489> marker<00:03:26.180> method<00:03:26.690> as

both the traditional er marker method as

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.280 
both the traditional er marker method as
well<00:03:27.500> as<00:03:27.730> more<00:03:28.730> colors<00:03:29.120> these<00:03:29.510> technology

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
well as more colors these technology

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.990 
well as more colors these technology
this<00:03:30.590> is<00:03:30.650> industry<00:03:31.280> first<00:03:32.799> on<00:03:33.799> this<00:03:33.980> genre<00:03:34.519> so

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
this is industry first on this genre so

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.140 
this is industry first on this genre so
what<00:03:35.989> basically<00:03:36.170> means<00:03:36.769> is<00:03:37.010> we<00:03:37.220> don't<00:03:37.430> have

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
what basically means is we don't have

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.229 
what basically means is we don't have
the<00:03:38.450> need<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.720> actually<00:03:38.989> use<00:03:39.530> air<00:03:40.400> markers<00:03:41.090> at

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
the need to actually use air markers at

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.690 
the need to actually use air markers at
