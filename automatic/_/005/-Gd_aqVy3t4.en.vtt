whatever youtuber takes forever my

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:47.709 
whatever youtuber takes forever my
editing<00:05:45.919> takes<00:05:46.129> 35<00:05:46.729> 20<00:05:47.000> minutes<00:05:47.449> to<00:05:47.509> an<00:05:47.629> hour

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:47.719 
editing takes 35 20 minutes to an hour

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.260 
editing takes 35 20 minutes to an hour
once<00:05:48.379> I<00:05:48.500> grow<00:05:48.649> bigger<00:05:48.889> than<00:05:48.979> up<00:05:49.189> or<00:05:49.339> more<00:05:49.490> thing

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
once I grow bigger than up or more thing

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.459 
once I grow bigger than up or more thing
into<00:05:50.479> my<00:05:50.509> editing<00:05:50.990> and<00:05:51.139> these<00:05:51.289> are<00:05:51.409> the

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469 
into my editing and these are the

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:52.899 
into my editing and these are the
players<00:05:51.680> ago<00:05:51.949> that<00:05:52.279> are<00:05:52.370> left<00:05:52.490> in<00:05:52.610> the<00:05:52.669> trade
