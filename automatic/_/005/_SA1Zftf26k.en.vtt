behind<00:00:50.200> our<00:00:50.500> sled<00:00:50.710> I<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:55.420> no<00:00:55.690> idea<00:00:55.989> what's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
behind our sled I have no idea what's

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.740 
behind our sled I have no idea what's
under<00:00:56.410> here<00:00:56.620> Jimmy<00:00:56.980> Hoffa's<00:00:57.489> body<00:00:57.760> this<00:00:58.480> could

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
under here Jimmy Hoffa's body this could

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.650 
under here Jimmy Hoffa's body this could
be<00:00:59.020> awesome<00:00:59.350> or<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.160> could<00:01:00.399> be<00:01:00.609> the<00:01:01.210> end<00:01:01.359> of<00:01:01.570> the

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
be awesome or it could be the end of the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.150 
be awesome or it could be the end of the
project<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:04.600> would<00:01:04.720> be<00:01:04.839> really<00:01:05.080> good<00:01:05.379> if<00:01:05.619> we

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
project what would be really good if we

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.790 
project what would be really good if we
had<00:01:06.520> four<00:01:06.940> things<00:01:07.930> that<00:01:08.170> we<00:01:08.259> could<00:01:08.440> put<00:01:08.590> enough

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
had four things that we could put enough

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.430 
had four things that we could put enough
right<00:01:09.039> in<00:01:09.220> like<00:01:09.580> that<00:01:09.759> what<00:01:10.570> would<00:01:10.750> be<00:01:10.869> bad<00:01:11.110> is

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
right in like that what would be bad is

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.070 
right in like that what would be bad is
a<00:01:12.119> lot<00:01:13.119> of<00:01:13.390> heavy<00:01:13.690> heavy<00:01:14.050> metal<00:01:15.570> I'm<00:01:16.570> really

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.910 

a<00:01:31.130> fifties<00:01:31.910> antique<00:01:32.360> downhill<00:01:32.840> skis<00:01:33.200> managed

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
a fifties antique downhill skis managed

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.470 
a fifties antique downhill skis managed
to<00:01:34.040> find<00:01:34.220> four<00:01:34.460> that<00:01:34.730> are<00:01:34.790> exactly<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.450> same

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
to find four that are exactly the same

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.730 
to find four that are exactly the same
should<00:01:38.480> we<00:01:38.540> pre-drill<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.110> skis<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.560> think

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
should we pre-drill the skis you think

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.900 
should we pre-drill the skis you think
yeah<00:01:40.250> we<00:01:40.310> got<00:01:40.550> a<00:01:40.580> countersink<00:01:42.580> there's<00:01:43.580> a<00:01:43.670> lot

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
yeah we got a countersink there's a lot

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.610 
yeah we got a countersink there's a lot
riding<00:01:44.360> on<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.600> attachment<00:01:45.080> points<00:01:45.440> of<00:01:45.530> the

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
riding on the attachment points of the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.980 
riding on the attachment points of the
ski<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.370> shanty<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.330> we<00:01:47.510> need<00:01:47.690> to<00:01:47.810> make

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
ski to the shanty so we need to make

00:01:47.990 --> 00:02:01.670 
ski to the shanty so we need to make
sure<00:01:48.050> that<00:01:48.380> those<00:01:48.560> are<00:01:48.620> really<00:01:48.950> solid

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.670 

Wow<00:02:02.740> let's<00:02:03.520> take<00:02:03.700> this<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.060> hill<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.540> know

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
Wow let's take this to the hill you know

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.320 
Wow let's take this to the hill you know
next<00:02:05.680> we've<00:02:05.860> got<00:02:05.980> to<00:02:06.070> put<00:02:06.190> a<00:02:06.220> floor<00:02:06.550> in<00:02:06.580> it<00:02:09.330> then

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
next we've got to put a floor in it then

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.760 
next we've got to put a floor in it then
we're<00:02:10.479> gonna<00:02:10.600> build<00:02:10.869> our<00:02:11.080> benches<00:02:11.470> at<00:02:11.620> either

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
we're gonna build our benches at either

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.100 
we're gonna build our benches at either
end<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:13.120> reason<00:02:13.480> this<00:02:13.570> is<00:02:13.630> going<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.900> work<00:02:14.080> so

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
end the reason this is going to work so

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.500 
end the reason this is going to work so
well<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.740> because<00:02:14.770> these<00:02:15.520> are<00:02:15.760> integrated

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
well is because these are integrated

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.790 
well is because these are integrated
