in there just to make it look like the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.130 
in there just to make it look like the
card<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:42.870> uh<00:00:44.510> first<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> show<00:00:46.079> you

card so uh first I'm going to show you

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.819 
card so uh first I'm going to show you
what<00:00:46.620> exactly<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:47.399> supposed<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.789> do<00:00:48.559> as<00:00:49.559> you

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
what exactly it's supposed to do as you

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:58.240 
what exactly it's supposed to do as you
can<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:52.379> grappling<00:00:52.860> hook<00:00:55.760> pull<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.879> out

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
can see the grappling hook pull it out

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:06.530 
can see the grappling hook pull it out
this<00:00:59.250> switch<00:00:59.699> right<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:04.970> it<00:01:05.970> goes<00:01:06.150> back<00:01:06.360> in

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
this switch right here it goes back in

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.859 
this switch right here it goes back in
so<00:01:07.470> uh<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.400> car<00:01:08.670> goes<00:01:08.850> through<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.720> it's

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
so uh the car goes through here it's

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.020 
so uh the car goes through here it's
really<00:01:10.110> difficult<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.619> get<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.700> that's<00:01:11.820> why

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
really difficult to get in so that's why

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.600 
really difficult to get in so that's why
I<00:01:12.060> prefer<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:13.110> know<00:01:13.310> push<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.460> into

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
I prefer to just you know push it into

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
I prefer to just you know push it into
the<00:01:14.850> top<00:01:15.259> so<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:17.119> you<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.420> hook<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.350> other

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the top so on you can hook on to other

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.950 
the top so on you can hook on to other
cars<00:01:19.920> or<00:01:20.340> onto<00:01:21.000> other<00:01:21.150> things<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.659> make<00:01:21.780> it

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
cars or onto other things to make it

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.810 
cars or onto other things to make it
move<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.470> by<00:01:22.680> itself<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:24.210> uh<00:01:25.189> let's<00:01:26.189> try<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.640> it

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
move up by itself so uh let's try on it

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:37.440 
move up by itself so uh let's try on it
slow<00:01:27.090> really<00:01:29.689> three<00:01:30.689> two<00:01:31.020> one
