 Good day, excellent, let's have a wonderful day, bastards, great, today 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.529
 we have a very nice recipe famous cooking a fisherman type veracruzano 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.060
 because we were using the original ingredients we will see from 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.790
 what it's about for now we're going to obviously use volleyball 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.420
 affection told him we are going to use also 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.190
 ac the fisherman asks for a bahrain credit 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.890
 will chop chopped onion 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.220
 tomato puree 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.240
 with a little sugar because to be able to tender 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:56.180
 the acidity we are going to use josé co polino also from iniesta negra bolivia 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.950
 and a teaspoon of salt this is just for the processed 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.560
 for the rest to be able to make the sauce then the funds use 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.180
 the chopped onion he can take from the tomatoes 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.750
 capers 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.970
 let's also use chile sera by peter chin iss my people perceive is 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.730
 because maybe they go against the güeros but they were witnesses yesterday and 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.520
 apart we will use olives 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.540
 the film directed all very simple simple and obviously everything is going to 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.340
 merge with controversial oil for now what are we going to do omni tarapoto 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.740
 affected law with spray 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.549
 let's go to russia like these art 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.859
 and we're going to put our fish once and took it off I'm going to use two 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.499
 fish fillets a bit more obnoxious and above because what 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:44.299
 I want to do torrico is that I want 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.210
 in salt and pepper wait as it should be 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.740
 I'm full list of catfish normally 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.400
 you can use other fishing and you can use for example percent rovira 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.940
 you can use a pail something you can use moca ratito steak as long as 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.149
 traditional in this case it seems pescaito definitely has to be 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.670
 the circuit joaquin b year from this side we will use law aspect as 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.020
 in abundance because what we want is to make the sauce 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.680
 for the complicated idea the onion and while 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.140
 the onion is being asked and I want it to go grabbing it transparent color 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.509
 and also a little bit of gold 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:22.620
 we pepper 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.219
 and we will also contribute the tomato 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.609
 the tomato what will help us along with the tomato puree in giving us apart from the 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.009
 body we give a very special favor 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:36.249
 and somehow killing the strong flavor of the saleh fish is what we're going to 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:37.939
 do 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.649
 Who are we battling with lovers we are looking for very large tomatoes 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:46.149
 did not always look for the roma tomato or the saladet tomato and the smaller the 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:49.709
 tomato maybe fumigate something this tomato has not been treated 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.270
 so that it grows 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.309
 and therefore its flavor is more natural 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:55.819
 and more intense 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.709
 when using these tomatitos 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.149
 what I'm looking for is also finding 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:01.690
 and look against and muscat 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.049
 the tomato that we are softer 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.070
 between softer more mature 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.420
 and between more mature kepa spend more lack more juice will go loosing 100 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.970
 singles 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.120
 the ces is that because the foolishness of two things a smaller tomato and two 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.300
 they're filtering the most ripe tomato it's about that of letting go 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:25.219
 already when we are supporting it so to speak as we are mixing it 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.840
 we are giving the favor the texture that we are looking for that is letting go 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:32.849
 then it's going to be easier, we're going to have a very 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:33.620
 simple 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.470
 not very bitch pia because if after this we will give it back and in this 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.079
 punto liu xiabo the prank incorporate him or once the capers 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.449
 and at once very incorporating what thing 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:50.239
 the olives to the last but the olives of a time of chili warhol u 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.810
 oppose the latter because 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.360
 because generally in good chile we are finding ourselves from the cross let's go 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.569
 finding bottle and it's a bit difficult to keep it like the stretches 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.300
 baking 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.640
 that is kept whole we are going to fight pupi 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.139
 why I put it lutin 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:12.239
 and now we are going to put the puree tomato once eye in this case I look 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.079
 that the one of the tomato is cold desbarate does not depend much generally I want that 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.959
 you can see that they are actually using fresh tomato and I want this to go 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.189
 giving me that flavor even though I'm giving that texture 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.050
 that there was a fresh tomato 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.870
 after this that eyes remember that we have also japan powder we are going to 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.070
 put it to powder 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.090
 let's go asphaltic let's see it very well 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.830
 last salt and pepper 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.930
 and the last one to put the parsley 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.029
 what's the matter with the fish? 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.629
 with this nice little dorado and from here what we are going to want is salt and mental 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:47.419
 eye 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.419
 Suddenly enough of circus and love and everything you burn the fish 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.069
 what we call it in the kitchen is the caramelized one that means this 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:59.150
 the same taste of fish the same meat and fish is not being sealed 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.530
 and here what seems charred is not the coal hoisted is not as if not 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.390
 we would have totally burned it is a candy and sadop and that is a 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.250
 term that we will be listening to every time in the caramel kitchen 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.819
 means what is being 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:17.409
 about tank camps sesták browning our our patients 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:18.950
 and our salts 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.159
 d the little fishes 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:22.520
 it's almost ready 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.900
 and the only thing that we would lack was our rice rice normally 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.389
 we buy a small bag and the big big pile the big club great moment of 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.220
 its principle was estimated this is a bag with rice 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.830
 of studies I recommend them a lot because it's worth being able to use 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.710
 we do it in three minutes 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.120
 and we do not have ready 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.460
 it's going to look very rough but I want to present 0% of the secrets that 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.300
 many times we drive in the kitchen 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.090
 and we do not tell anyone 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.430
 we are using myself yes I want to share 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.219
 because it's something that we can use and that will help us make our dish 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:57.610
 I'm ready in two minutes three minutes 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.760
 what's next, see how to get out 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.960
 our sauce and the only thing we have to do these turn our 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.550
 tomato our sauce i our lack to be already there is a mere point 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.969
 let's see some mashed victims 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:13.669
 and after this we are going to spin 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.290
 and here and the most interesting this step for the fish 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.060
 see how it is sealing this as well as to see if it is already cooked 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.850
 you are going to put the spatula inside if the spatula enters here you can live and the 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:25.530
 fish 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.650
 this is telling me that this pescaíto 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.919
 is already ready very carefully let's plant up 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:34.189
 how many loaned by people depends a lot on the size 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:38.810
 If the fish is small I recommend you use two fish fillets 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.740
 we are going to make it very simple that wave kyi this is almost ready 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.069
 to hear hear it 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:48.409
 and we are going to put what thing the Tacuara parsley that we had to use 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:49.270
 parsley 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.469
 we are going to cut it 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:51.999
 while I cut the parsley 

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:56.180
 If you want this recipe, remember where you have to write, they're going to write me 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.520
 to stop your point 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.620
 oleic chef 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.580
 @ dot com multimedia and ready these groups to put in here 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:06.509
 let's go back very well 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.999
 We were going to empty it 

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:10.680
 it finishes more than rich smells the 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.820
 parsley and let's cover it with the sauce 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.460
 we're going to put an end to that 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.849
 slowly so on top 

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:19.240
 well pretty 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.899
 if you want you can completely cover the fish 

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:26.949
 and so just the oligarchy honda text becomes clear that yes clear that you 

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:28.650
 contract with your hand at the waist 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.470
 the crisis and I can do it because anyone can make efforts to 

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.569
 raise to the senate 

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:35.790
 Write a controversial car step by step 

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.560
