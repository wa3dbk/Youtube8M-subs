00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
I mean so I think anybody in the pop

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.730 
I mean so I think anybody in the pop
world<00:04:54.910> should<00:04:55.480> drive<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:55.780> want<00:04:56.140> to<00:04:56.290> be<00:04:56.320> like

her<00:04:57.700> far<00:04:58.060> as<00:04:58.150> longevity<00:04:58.390> not<00:04:59.080> be<00:04:59.290> like<00:04:59.500> her

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
her far as longevity not be like her

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.230 
her far as longevity not be like her
literally<00:05:00.040> like<00:05:00.340> they<00:05:00.460> tried<00:05:00.670> to<00:05:00.730> a<00:05:00.880> lady<00:05:01.120> Gaga

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240
