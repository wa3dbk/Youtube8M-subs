Oh

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.160 

I<00:02:37.880> think<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.030> innovation<00:02:39.570> in<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.720> celica

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
I think the innovation in the celica

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.050 
I think the innovation in the celica
segment<00:02:40.590> will<00:02:40.770> will<00:02:41.040> come<00:02:41.280> from<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.670> end<00:02:41.910> via

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
segment will will come from this end via

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.420 
segment will will come from this end via
nose<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.630> this<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.800> where<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.130> mva

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
nose and this is this is where the mva

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.880 
nose and this is this is where the mva
knows<00:02:44.610> me<00:02:44.850> so<00:02:45.180> it's<00:02:45.750> natural<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.740> is

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
knows me so it's natural that this is

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.550 
knows me so it's natural that this is
interesting<00:02:47.430> place<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.670> be<00:02:47.970> if<00:02:48.330> it's<00:02:49.290> possible

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
interesting place to be if it's possible

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.120
