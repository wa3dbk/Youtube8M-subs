00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.460
 speak it guys beauty here're talking 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.680
 welcome to another one 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.449
 video and world was crazy to make video 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.330
 How was you crazy about making video? 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.980
 commented but as a place it took time 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.539
 which I did not do much to tell you 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.640
 But it's ok, let's go there and make a 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.199
 video displayed by overwhelming and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.149
 First, I want to say that the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.160
 gameplay guy that I picked up from the bottom not 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.050
 It's not cool, it's because I got it. 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.480
 It's when I went to see the smasher if that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.910
 16 hours with him so I had to 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.530
 run is and so is time to do 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.180
 other things and I'm in the middle of 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.860
 So I have to study more 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.079
 sorry for the game play but let's go 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.850
 I'm going to talk here first 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.309
 damage to dana I'll take in 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.680
 consideration is for example slash from you 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.780
 to give a click it gives two punches is the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.850
 left then I'll take it is in 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.489
 consider slash as both worlds 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.869
 beauty then there slash on the head strip 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:11.400
 always we are made in 77 in 77 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.220
 arms 71 on legs 55 and feet 55 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.390
 Send him his rights in every 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.590
 body parts 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.960
 It's okay, you can get it, it's mine. 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.360
 God you can get him by defeating the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.280
 paulista with five times you will win 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.040
 a box inside those boxes nine 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.079
 other pms within those prizes there 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.549
 everyone is the smashing leap then you 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.930
 have to hit the ball and five times 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.490
 it's a rather complicated business but 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.619
 it's worth telling you that my opinion 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.780
 About him I really liked it but that was 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.299
 one business I won per event was by 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.369
 that defeat can not do anything I won by 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.979
 Everton but I really liked caring. 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.049
 so in my opinion the hand it is 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.270
 along with cut the second weapon of the game 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.270
 by the fact if not him the distance of it 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.880
 not very big but it is so damage 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.040
 They in general are very good with the slash 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.710
 everything I liked very human was a 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.810
 business there is how I said it is he is a 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.640
 with easy-to-play weapon too 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.890
 I played I think it was three or two 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.039
 same thing from the water wall already 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.989
 August got used to slash his showing 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.010
 the slash at his right you can see the 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.709
 slash he is 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.120
 is it you see by the way the guy is 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.670
 make a move 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.829
 you see it's strong it 's even strong slash 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.760
 his right also because of what I 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.799
 I say he stays 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.689
 it is sace disputing the same with 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.379
 cookie dude I think he's the second 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:33.090
 better in the game I really liked him and 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.209

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.700
