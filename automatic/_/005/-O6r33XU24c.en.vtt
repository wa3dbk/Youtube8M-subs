00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
then the only thing Suarez had to do was

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.569 
then the only thing Suarez had to do was
pass<00:02:51.599> across<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.170> goal<00:02:52.409> and<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:52.980> was<00:02:53.129> one<00:02:53.340> nil

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
to Barcelona and that was pretty much

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.729

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
that that meant by munich had to score

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.280 
that that meant by munich had to score
four<00:02:59.069> goals<00:02:59.120> to<00:03:00.120> go<00:03:00.299> through<00:03:00.629> without<00:03:00.959> even

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
four goals to go through without even

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.800 
four goals to go through without even
conceding<00:03:01.650> another<00:03:02.129> goal<00:03:02.540> ridiculous<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.720> know

another<00:03:10.230> goal<00:03:10.349> from<00:03:10.739> pretty<00:03:11.129> much<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.519> same
