00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:09.090
 another year point about 45 years I 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.720
 I offer to offer you free seeds 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.059
 this year because of the weather 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.750
 there are very few maple seeds then 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.540
 I'm going to give 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.430
 as I say for the high availability 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.910
 of maple seeds in palm tuna 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.710
 small sheet if I can upload to the blog 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.180
 that the photos so you can see the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.800
 copies 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.469
 and seeds of 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.180
 I will also give a few 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.950
 seeds that I have left from last year's 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.660
 software 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.100
 in good condition because the 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.100
 keep in places 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.989
 away from moisture and these seeds the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.350
 latest software maple seeds 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.890
 They will be for the first people 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.590
 how good 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.620
 you already know how is the method you will have to 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.600
 send me a letter with envelope with yours 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.430
 address in that envelope that will go inside 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:09.610
 the letter and a stamp of 50 cents 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.890
 stuck on that letter that will in turn go 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.330
 inside the other one and that's where I 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.330
 I will send to your address 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.149
 It is paramount that he sends me and they 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.090
 because even though they give me the seeds 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.670
 I'm not going to stamp many times 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.630
 people forget and I do not usually send 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.460
 letters 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.219
 then you remember an envelope 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.770
 with your address a seal between a 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.990
 letter to the address that I will tell you in my 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.549
 blog where you know the block is 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.869
 a baby of or in a and d 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.729
 wandering and there 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.010
 Look at our instructions for 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.190
 what can you 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.770
 I received the signals 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.180
 When there are doubts, it can be explained that 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.730
 When the seeds arrive, you have to 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.340
 stratify the three tables 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.440
 for those who do not know you can see in the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.050
 stratification method in my channel 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.940
 Youtube 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.110
 also another one of the doubts that is the 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.940
 seeds of 5 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.740
 you have to shells already at the time of 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.830
 put them in the fridge to sanctify 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.450
 and with all this I say goodbye 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.010
 looking at our letters to be able 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.010
 give away the seeds until soon
