00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.430
 Good morning, good afternoon, Good afternoon, I'm 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.860
 artur and I'll comment quickly about 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.619
 the second teaser trailer for avengers 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.840
 aerial of a second trailer more legal 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.910
 it is that he is new without 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.789
 necessarily be new because I 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.320
 I explain the trailer does not show anything that 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.600
 the first workout has not already shown 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.660
 have virtually no such consensus 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.180
 that you've seen from another angle and 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.220
 This is very good because a lot of people 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.170
 claims that the land nowadays is 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.970
 Advertising is playing a lot 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.100
 information on the face of the 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.690
 viewer who wants to watch it goes 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.610
 end up also looking for that parcel 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.589
 of guilt and such but the three end up 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.839
 delivering the entire film as is the case 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.030
 of the last increased in us you stop 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.640
 God damn you, can you film the movie? 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.799
 The cool of this stretch of the second workout 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.500
 the golden age is that it is a trailer 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:08.110
 with unpublished scenes without necessarily 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.760
 be unprecedented that shows the same thing as 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.560
 Have you seen in the first one by another? 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.390
 having some scenes and that ends 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.490
 very interesting if you stop 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.920
 to analyze the second training as a 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.619
 all and nothing more than parents who 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.390
 were missing in the first game the tone 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.969
 it's the same the scenes are the same and not 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.200
 shows nothing you do not already know but 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.719
 You can still do one thing. 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.549
 different if you join the 23 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.229
 next to each other so you do something 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.299
 will see that complement the other this 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.859
 ends up being really cool because it generates 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.619
 enough expectation without necessarily 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.719
 show really new things from a 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.759
 generates expectation so you know what 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.570
 in fact going to happen in the movie was 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.799
 It's very cool. 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.109
 some things I do not have to 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.759
 government on the other side so but thing 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:50.409
 different that it really has is a scene 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.270
 where a woman from 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.090
 back can not know what is right 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.679
 can be the woman the mother of the pantaneiro 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.479
 which will play an important role in the film 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:02.619
 can be like any other 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.240
 character but if you put one on the side 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.009
 on the other side to see similar things 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.140
 happens in the new aid that had the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.850
 first trailer that complements what 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.819
 appears I started yesterday helping 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.920
 some people have emerged in the 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.420
 party in the first training and in the second 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.130
 he said I do not think that if Brazil 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.500
 He benefited at all and just quoting 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.750
 characters or trunks that are 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.220
 appearing and know who the character is 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.230
 maybe it's some kind of maybe 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.890
 is another part of the film but can be 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.140
 also a thing 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.220
 he helped the country create this and 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.290
 Do you know who is 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.050
 has that part of the year looks like a 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.120
 airplane is making him a black widow 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.500
 the captain america and the hulk as it was 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.790
 going bad on the first and second 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.200
 service then transforming 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.570
 probably there that begins to 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.340
 to make every battle happen 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.870
 inside the city there meets the bust 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.459
 first that appears to have to face 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.260
 Someone you do not know who the 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.090
 according to what the hulk is that 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.050
 respected controlled by the witch 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.360
 scarlet 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.190
 I'm already crazy about throwing a car with the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.170
 cops at first looks like a monkey 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.390
 flashback of the black widow something like this 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.130
 someone who will be operated and second longer 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.380
 shows that it may be a flashback 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.300
 even because it appears with long hair 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.220
 being that in the late afternoon hair course 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.190
 must have a connection and finally the 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.810
 The band appears in the hulk band. 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.390
 arriving with everything was imposing all 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.510
 culture so I'm going to destroy the hulk and 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.580
 a second loan that would have them than 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.580
 you what you value very crazy 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.490
 that 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.950
 This is what I appear in a 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.320
 There's no god, God, it's going to leave. 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.420
 very important is not more of the same 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.040
 even though it's cooler and if you 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.020
 liked the video of the crisis down here if 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.360
 insert put up to see one 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.770
