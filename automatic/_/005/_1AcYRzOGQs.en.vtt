00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.219
 we are back from the special 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.050
 of a good goal and we are exploring 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.810
 The best sad images and share 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:23.130
 at a lot of speed a lot of speed 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:26.250
 from manny pacquiao good is 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.980
 truly solid 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.240
 at the beginning he truly lacked 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.520
 respect 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.320
 banif middle action hands do not 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.440
 I was afraid the guard was going down 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.550
 he or in Canada stood in front of them and 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.379
 Manny could not take advantage of it too 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.379
 pacquiao connectable before 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.869
 too much to manny pacquiao too many 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.869
 human incidents too 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.549
 or not 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:25.560
 at the level where we can look for it as 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.560
 one of the best in history 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.460
 but more fair to say is 19 years old in 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.010
 the sport of the Jews inhabit two 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.770
 great battles against great fighters 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.870
 when you look at manny's record 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.970
 pacquiao historically only goes to 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.500
 missing a name and it is not your fault 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.120
 Santiago BarÃ³n said to tell me about him 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.110
 there is no problem we want the fight 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.390
 but it's not going to happen, though, that's not 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.729
 it removes that manny pacquiao is still 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.770
 an elite fighter we talked about the 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.950
 that could be presented in tiffany this 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.160
 night as far as position did what 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.160
 could 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:32.890
 and he never stopped trying the typical no 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.890
 he gave it but 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:47.300
 because for me he did it or allowed him to 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:49.010
 whoever wants to finish had no other 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.620
 option before me as they were 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.850
 physically when the condition does not go 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.860
 I think it was a condition I think in 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.600
 actually he was hurt and he can not 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.000
 find what surprised me the most 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.280
 and he told me about it in the ring 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.530
 I could find my distance nor my 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.930
 legs when I tried there was no 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.670
 balance and these the tubes that try 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.959
 with those blows too but see nothing 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.959
 we were sitting 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.260
 in the first 52 kilos of pills already 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.450
 it is a more transparent without 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.730
 Justification about the injury the same 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.459
 you have already passed it and they had 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.230
 Ankle injuries had no air 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.499
 I did not have physical condition and I was 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.989
 truly loose earth 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:43.049
 and also his performance july or manny 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:45.150
 pacquiao return to the point the courage of 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:49.019
 that the dance team because it's a 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.889
 fighter that although he was always 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.889
 looking for a fight 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:08.310
 at 5 rounds 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.900
 I'm awesome 5 round in a fight 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.750
 with a lot of speed 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.370
 the western weights franchise in the 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.440
 story with more speed because there was 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.539
 thank you very much the two fell many 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:25.820
 blows but in the end and after 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:28.070
 that is standing 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.170
 and always about lojas stores but I do not know 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.200
 fall in the seventh round was an assault 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:36.260
 that manny pacquiao looked for him had it 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.780
 on the ropes and that failure 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.610
 very much with assault in which the 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.100
 Waist and head movement 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.770
 this rally was something impressive not what 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.020
 he could hold up because manny pacquiao was 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.750
 on top of any connector the hand 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.940
 left but ultimately you are not 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.890
 you can scream what he did he gets and for 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.590
 me on this occasion more taking into account 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.210
 that were activated but still if 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.540
 they improve and he's not a common fighter and 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.490
 current today he did not have his best night that 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.860
 yes but it is not can be a rival 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.770
 dangerous not after being a rival that 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.180
 he got to touch manny pacquiao and that 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.370
 tried against all the 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.300
 discredited currents that 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.010
 they got a great victory 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.010
 regained his world title
