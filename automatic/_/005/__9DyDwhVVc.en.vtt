so<00:05:01.050> but<00:05:01.949> I<00:05:02.220> thought<00:05:02.370> it<00:05:02.460> was<00:05:02.550> fitting<00:05:02.910> I<00:05:03.090> liked

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
so but I thought it was fitting I liked

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.640 
so but I thought it was fitting I liked
the<00:05:03.330> way<00:05:03.419> it<00:05:03.449> looked<00:05:03.539> on<00:05:03.750> him<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.259> that's<00:05:04.410> it

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
the way it looked on him and that's it

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.920 
the way it looked on him and that's it
you<00:05:05.639> see<00:05:05.849> his<00:05:06.000> arms<00:05:06.120> a<00:05:06.300> little<00:05:06.389> flimsy<00:05:06.660> we'll

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
you see his arms a little flimsy we'll

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.480 
you see his arms a little flimsy we'll
get<00:05:07.020> to<00:05:07.110> that<00:05:07.139> in<00:05:07.259> articulation<00:05:07.979> but<00:05:08.160> for<00:05:08.310> pain

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
get to that in articulation but for pain

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.650 
get to that in articulation but for pain
apps<00:05:08.669> only<00:05:08.789> given<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.090> four<00:05:09.300> out<00:05:09.419> of<00:05:09.449> five<00:05:09.599> I

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
apps only given a four out of five I

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.270 
apps only given a four out of five I
think<00:05:09.900> they<00:05:09.990> did<00:05:10.139> a<00:05:10.169> really<00:05:10.259> really<00:05:10.500> good<00:05:10.710> job

the only thing that you know he is a
smaller<00:05:13.710> looking<00:05:14.039> figure<00:05:14.460> because<00:05:14.610> they<00:05:14.699> use

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
smaller looking figure because they use

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.909 
smaller looking figure because they use
a<00:05:14.849> smaller<00:05:15.240> older<00:05:15.690> mold<00:05:15.990> but<00:05:16.289> we'll<00:05:16.770> talk

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.149 
waist articulation well no nothing there
he's<00:05:43.860> got<00:05:44.009> a<00:05:44.070> double<00:05:44.370> jointed<00:05:44.789> knees<00:05:45.650> and<00:05:46.650> then

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
he's got a double jointed knees and then

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.170 
he's got a double jointed knees and then
rotates<00:05:47.550> at<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.759> foot<00:05:48.090> all<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.240> way<00:05:48.360> around

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
rotates at the foot all the way around

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.709 
rotates at the foot all the way around
but<00:05:52.340> yeah<00:05:53.340> I<00:05:53.699> mean<00:05:54.060> not<00:05:54.210> the<00:05:54.360> greatest

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:54.719 
but yeah I mean not the greatest

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.290 
but yeah I mean not the greatest
articulation<00:05:55.469> you<00:05:56.430> know<00:05:56.550> because<00:05:56.909> it<00:05:57.030> is<00:05:57.150> an

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
articulation you know because it is an

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.680 
articulation you know because it is an
older<00:05:57.599> figure<00:05:58.020> I<00:05:58.639> mean<00:05:59.639> I<00:05:59.699> don't<00:05:59.849> in<00:06:00.360> turn<00:06:00.539> the

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
older figure I mean I don't in turn the

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.420 
older figure I mean I don't in turn the
grading<00:06:01.050> it<00:06:01.139> would<00:06:01.320> be<00:06:01.409> unfair<00:06:01.800> to<00:06:01.949> compare<00:06:02.099> it

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
grading it would be unfair to compare it

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.760 
grading it would be unfair to compare it
to<00:06:02.460> the<00:06:02.610> new<00:06:02.820> new<00:06:03.210> figures<00:06:03.630> but<00:06:04.139> I<00:06:04.409> still<00:06:04.620> have

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
to the new new figures but I still have

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.600 
to the new new figures but I still have
to<00:06:04.860> give<00:06:04.979> him<00:06:05.070> a<00:06:05.099> three<00:06:05.310> out<00:06:05.400> of<00:06:05.430> five

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
to give him a three out of five

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.339 
to give him a three out of five
unfortunately<00:06:06.360> his<00:06:06.539> head<00:06:06.690> does<00:06:06.870> rotate<00:06:07.229> all

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
unfortunately his head does rotate all

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:09.020 
unfortunately his head does rotate all
the<00:06:07.380> way<00:06:07.469> around<00:06:07.740> as<00:06:07.860> well<00:06:07.889> no<00:06:08.610> up<00:06:08.789> and<00:06:08.969> down

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
the way around as well no up and down

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.659 
the way around as well no up and down
hinge<00:06:09.389> it's<00:06:09.599> just<00:06:09.750> a<00:06:09.840> simple<00:06:10.169> ball<00:06:10.409> joint<00:06:12.199> but

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
hinge it's just a simple ball joint but

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.469 
hinge it's just a simple ball joint but
yeah<00:06:14.900> overall<00:06:15.900> final<00:06:16.530> score<00:06:16.889> on<00:06:16.979> this<00:06:17.099> bad<00:06:17.280> boy

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
yeah overall final score on this bad boy

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.760 
yeah overall final score on this bad boy
I'm<00:06:18.479> gonna<00:06:18.570> give<00:06:18.750> him<00:06:18.810> a<00:06:18.870> 4<00:06:19.050> out<00:06:19.169> of<00:06:19.229> 5<00:06:19.320> I<00:06:19.620> don't

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
I'm gonna give him a 4 out of 5 I don't

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.950 
I'm gonna give him a 4 out of 5 I don't
think<00:06:19.919> this<00:06:19.979> is<00:06:20.039> a<00:06:20.130> bad<00:06:20.400> figure<00:06:20.820> um<00:06:21.030> this

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
think this is a bad figure um this
