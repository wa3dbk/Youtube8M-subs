going<00:02:08.890> if<00:02:09.790> I<00:02:09.880> knew<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.269> frequency<00:02:10.450> of

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
going if I knew that the frequency of

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.510 
going if I knew that the frequency of
service<00:02:11.049> is<00:02:11.230> there

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.690 

it's<00:02:17.120> it's<00:02:17.420> really<00:02:17.720> vital<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.620> critical<00:02:18.950> if

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
it's it's really vital and critical if

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.360 
it's it's really vital and critical if
you<00:02:19.990> commute<00:02:20.990> down<00:02:21.200> college<00:02:21.710> drive<00:02:22.010> on<00:02:22.340> a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
you commute down college drive on a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.500 
you commute down college drive on a
daily<00:02:22.610> basis<00:02:23.090> today<00:02:23.390> at<00:02:24.070> 250,000<00:02:25.070> people

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
daily basis today at 250,000 people

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.970 
daily basis today at 250,000 people
that's<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.660> long<00:02:26.870> drive<00:02:27.230> it's<00:02:27.530> not<00:02:27.680> pleasant

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
that's a long drive it's not pleasant

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.470 
that's a long drive it's not pleasant
and<00:02:28.460> I<00:02:28.550> think<00:02:28.610> there's<00:02:28.940> maybe<00:02:29.090> even<00:02:29.360> an

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
and I think there's maybe even an

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.270 
and I think there's maybe even an
opportunity<00:02:30.140> this<00:02:30.320> summer<00:02:30.590> with<00:02:31.190> the

opportunity this summer with the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.920 
opportunity this summer with the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
university bridge being shut down that

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.990 
university bridge being shut down that
is<00:02:33.230> going<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.530> force<00:02:34.160> people<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.490> take<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.790> look

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
is going to force people to take a look

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.400 
is going to force people to take a look
at<00:02:35.120> other<00:02:35.300> options<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.900> how<00:02:35.930> do<00:02:36.110> they<00:02:36.290> get

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
at other options of how do they get

downtown in the morning to work some

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.910 
downtown in the morning to work some
opportunity<00:02:38.870> for<00:02:39.050> them<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.230> get<00:02:39.410> on<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.710> bus
