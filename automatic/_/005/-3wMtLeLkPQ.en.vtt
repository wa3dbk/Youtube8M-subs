00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.670
 devil may cry 4 the most chingón of this 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.859
 game are the bosses that are huge and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.289
 very powerful the next 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.539
 littlebigplanet 2 a very funny game 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.050
 to hang out with a multiplayer 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.350
 very good the next 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.960
 the one who follows naruto ultimate ninja storm 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.370
 generations very pimp the game 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.310
 they should buy it 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.650
 the one that follows dead space 2 a game 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.930
 bloody and too entertaining the 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.300
 that follows and one of my favorites 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.700
 'resident evil' all resident evil 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.160
 they are very good but personally I do not 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.210
 like 5 and it seems that 6 will be 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.250
 very chingón the following is watch box se 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.440
 It looks very interesting especially because it is 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.320
 a sandbox for those who do not know what is 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.480
 A sandbox is an open world game 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.470
 as the big one missing the next one is 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.230
 lost planet 3 the truth this game good 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.880
 the 2 is very bad the monkey is very heavy 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.190
 and it is neither entertaining nor mode 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.640
 multiplayer but the 3 looks pretty 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.590
 better the next one is splinter be a 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.920
 perfect game for lovers of 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.530
 espionage the following is murderous crit 3 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.890

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.050
 next is silent hill this game in 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.060

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.890
 Charge you with fear but the new ones 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.250
 generation does not cause you the same 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.000

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.060
 true beauty the next is sky 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.580
