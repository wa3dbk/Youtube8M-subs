00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 and hello to all the boys here that I invite 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.839
 one I speak to you today we are here with a 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.120
 another video and we returned to call of 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.250
 duty ghost with another video let's say 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.340
 tutorials no always advice 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.859
 this time we are the video of how to do it 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.680
 team points quickly enough 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.359
 as you can see I don't know if yes 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.460
 you see you are in 154 and therefore and I wanted you 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.429
 talk about the various tips how to do 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.960
 these things quickly 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.510
 team just then we start immediately 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.040
 from here there is from the menu as always 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.719
 also done the other time and you have to 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.180
 going is a very important thing but 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.309
 that many underestimate you have to go to 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.230
 what 's up with guys 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.489
 written operations and there are these 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.739
 Various things 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.180
 and when you see you see down there at 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.329
 right where it says 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 e 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.699
 5 da mou lit 45 then he wants 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.899
 say I completed four or five 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.359
 of these challenges 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.500
 there is in all of them are really not so many 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.330
 are these five parades ie each 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.229
 everything and say, that is, of these 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.090
 five there are various challenges as you see is 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.759
 just I don't complete 5 so if 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.490
 now I do square that for 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.560
 getting the new operations will cost 1 e 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.930
 look at 154 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.180
 now I make this square 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.950
 what here and points 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.340
 increase there is I spend 1 but gains 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.299
 4 so thus already an institution or a 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:37.940
 so there are 157 boys 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:40.490
 but now there are no le 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.729
 challenges because there are some boys but not 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.580
 because like those very long ones I'm not 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.100
 saying this bullshit 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.020
 yes i'm saying something nanny and yes not 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.549
 they can still be there and not yes not 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.250
 they dare not like this I don't know why not 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.610
 it came true 33 of 120 blasts 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.549
 kills 120 enemies using agility and how 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.890
 see, however, each of these this is 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.579
 has resorted to challenge operations is called 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.140
 earth as you like will give you one there is a 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.109
 point team you see there is written point 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.740
 team 1 500p and then goes to the various emblems 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:17.220
 those things there 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.140
 and so so there is now all of you then 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.510
 if you do complete type series this challenge 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.750
 here not only cold home gets had 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.640
 a revenge and visual death and it will give me 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.220
 a team point immediately and then yes 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.530
 will add these here to make coeli 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.270
 where there is written 12 those bones things 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.220
 completed operations when 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.430
 arrived 45 ness take a nenÃ¨ 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.580
 Earn 4 what quite useful 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.140
 in my opinion, however, the boys though 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.470
 these are always tips I don't know if 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.020
 you don't want to listen to them, don't listen to them 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.910
 anyway he has you guys anyway 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.090
 something like I think I understood 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.820
 that when he entered a typical game 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.620
 if you make a first kill down 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.540
 that is, not the first killing the first 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.310
 kill who you do even if you are a 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.670
 enter halfway through the party even if it is not the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.680
 first blood gives you a team point 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.630
 so if you are really short of 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.040
 these team funds go into one 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.450
 match did in a kill or 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.640
 maximum two three seems to me anyway 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.860
 however I am sure in the first two or 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.230
 three kills will give you a point 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.970
 point team do this this point 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.830
 teams won and meanwhile in one 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.080
 where you find yourself so far 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.820
 you agree that a type 45 is needed 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.920
 to make an accessory that I know as well 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.770
 to buy a weapon because at the beginning 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.050
 there are few tastes of team points 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.260
 to Mr Danti because I am from prestige 1 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.060
 level 30 so I 'm already in front of them 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.710
 weapons that I already know so I have unlocked 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.180
 only those that interest me then 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.900
 it's not true because cars almost locked 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.579
 all the more you see a jump like 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.860
 because they are at that time I did it 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.060
 I already knew them at arms but not 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.370
 I knew which one to use so he blocked it 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.750
 all in the base however still so much of 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.750
 team points I do not do anything to 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.810
 keep them all there and with those kids there 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.780
 I wanted to thank and for the 113 subscribers 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.150
 we are now yes when when i load 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.069
 I don't know what this video is 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.870
 when i will upload this video when not 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.159
 I know how many members we will still be thinking 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.659
 113 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.230
 I hope we are more obviously 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.189
 but I know we're still at 113 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.090
 however not for this video it is 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.729
 all 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.609
 and if this was useful put a nice one 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:25.000
 I like and subscribe and comment with 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.740
 written I feel good or even if 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.100
 you have another method to make the point 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.020
 in the team and then write to me precisely 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.699
 like this better than I will try and if 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.130
 they work maybe they also load it on 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.110
 channel if the game simply does not 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.479
 I know maybe hitting it doesn't have e 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.759
 anyway it's for this video it's all like 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.720
 I repeat and we feel but from 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.720
 next beautiful
