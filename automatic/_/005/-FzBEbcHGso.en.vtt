00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.080 
about religion it's about relationship
with<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.650> person<00:02:18.250> man

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
with that person man

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.520 
with that person man
and<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.630> what<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.780> think<00:02:19.840> is<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.230> different

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
and this is what I think is so different

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.560 
and this is what I think is so different
about<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.790> old<00:02:21.970> testament<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.480> the

divination religions which are based on
righteousness<00:02:25.540> i<00:02:26.290> studied<00:02:26.770> what<00:02:26.890> is<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.010> long

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
righteousness i studied what is a long

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.550
