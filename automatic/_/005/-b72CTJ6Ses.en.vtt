00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.119
 yes 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:28.179
 There is no doubt that the Fiat 500 has evolved the segment of 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:29.140
 utilities 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.559
 but is that now you can make an interesting bet versions 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:33.920
 convertible 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.690
 signed by the clothing brand yesil 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.740
 this model will only sell 150 units per year in three colors 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.120
 blue and this dark green in true gator 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.120
 Well, let's try it 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.429
 the jersey finish 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:57.010
 has come to reinforce an excellent retro aesthetic the 16-inch wheels with 

00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:01.600
 the logo of the mark barea played with the knob of the gear lever i on the 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.109
 back we also find that this same anagram is highlighted in one of 

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:10.720
 its many tested also perfectly combines with the rear view mirrors 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.750
 the moldings of the doors the sills and the own dashboard 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.840
 where it is reflected that we are facing the 500 t version 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.890
 sci 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.550
 one of the most exclusive details of this model that its hood of the most 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.830
 traditional and as you see they were perfectly collected on the top of the 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.700
 boot is back on track until a speed of 60 kilometers 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.900
 hour which is very practical and took to perform the entire operation only 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.760
 25 seconds also if we want access to the trunk we just have to press 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.240
 let's see how the hood death to the second position of the three that has 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.430
 and it enables us a space in 180 and 200 is not bad at all there are only three 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.730
 liters capacity - that the closed version performance 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.980
 1500 of his nights slaughter 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.989
 at the same time driving in a city that we can find right now in the 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.520
 market I would even say that it is the closest thing there is to a four-wheeler 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.549
 wheels because after the first thing for its engine of only 900 cubic centimeters 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.129
 and two cylinders achieves however thanks to the use of turbo 85 horses 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.510
 of power that is noticeable and a lot apart especially the three thousand 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.520
 turns and its consumption because relatively low can be around 5 liters 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.760
 in quiet driving and like a lot of gold or we can take up to 6 6 and 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.379
 half a somewhat more aggressive driving 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.060
 otherwise it stands out a lot from the gentle handling of its address allows 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:54.139
 maneuver easily plus an aircraft style between trades is very 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:54.870
 little 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.989
 this allows us to turn around on any street or for example gestha 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:02.939
 a really ashes in which the moment is handled very well 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.919
 the change also that was very handy 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.409
 think of five-speed manual transmission with a handling also 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.189
 pretty accurate 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.129
 defects because some also in itself that it is certain that we find as per 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.019
 example very little visibility on its back especially in this 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.609
 convertible version thanks to the fact that the derivative presets quintÃ¡s practically 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.230
 all the space to achieve acts in front we find a lot 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.129
 of last generation that yes but that occupies practically in the totality of 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.359
 the frontal view in some curves 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:42.059
 In short the 550i complete but although that with some the defect very 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:45.059
 own 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.279
 on the road they are also satisfying cars 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:04:00.469
 our society anyway endesa a little delay very behavior 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.889
 characteristic of 500 fiarte of the court 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.889
 something more fun 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:11.959
 good afternoon as of now we have no rules 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.829
 much more margin of the videos this summer in our water park 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.730
 favorite now well northeast be cheated by the size of this one 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.069
 small toy was its price start 18 thousand 600 euros 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:30.590
 will be two thousand euros less to give up that cabriolet and 200 meters 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:36.009
 you want it to be convertible but it is not so idiotic and diesel we know the 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.549
 next video facing the eventual
