flash<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.570> over<00:00:31.109> here<00:00:31.320> as<00:00:31.410> well<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
flash we have it over here as well and

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.270 
flash we have it over here as well and
it's<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.489> nice<00:00:32.690> 5.5<00:00:33.690> inch<00:00:33.899> device<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:35.070> has<00:00:35.130> a

it's a nice 5.5 inch device it has a
nice<00:00:35.520> IPS<00:00:36.000> screen<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:36.530> beautiful<00:00:37.530> viewing

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
nice IPS screen with beautiful viewing

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.430 
nice IPS screen with beautiful viewing
angles<00:00:38.309> very<00:00:38.820> nice<00:00:39.000> colors<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.600> might<00:00:39.750> say<00:00:39.960> but

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
angles very nice colors I might say but

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.459 
angles very nice colors I might say but
it's<00:00:40.559> not<00:00:40.710> very<00:00:40.829> first<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.870> 1280<00:00:42.870> by

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
it's not very first it's just 1280 by

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.190 
it's not very first it's just 1280 by
800<00:00:43.770> pixels<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.539> definitely<00:00:45.719> see

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
800 pixels so you can definitely see

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.950 
800 pixels so you can definitely see
pixels<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:46.710> then<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.789> let<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.390> emulate<00:00:48.809> it

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
pixels but then it's let to emulate it

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.319 
pixels but then it's let to emulate it
doesn't<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.829> too<00:00:50.100> much<00:00:50.219> player<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:51.180> is

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
doesn't have too much player that is

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.840 
doesn't have too much player that is
quite<00:00:51.570> bright<00:00:51.809> as<00:00:52.020> well<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.370> device<00:00:53.640> is

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
quite bright as well so this device is

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.020 
quite bright as well so this device is

the volume rocker over here as I speak

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.179 
the volume rocker over here as I speak
here<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> bottom<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.439> also<00:01:25.560> microphone

here on the bottom and also microphone

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:26.850 
here on the bottom and also microphone
and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
and

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.370 
and
microUSB<00:01:27.580> port<00:01:27.820> ID<00:01:28.420> recipe<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:29.050> a<00:01:29.080> happier

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
microUSB port ID recipe and a happier

microUSB port ID recipe and a happier
way<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.620> Jack<00:01:29.860> in<00:01:30.010> a<00:01:30.100> second<00:01:30.460> microphone<00:01:30.610> on

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
way to Jack in a second microphone on

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.180 
way to Jack in a second microphone on
the<00:01:31.930> top<00:01:32.410> so<00:01:33.250> this<00:01:34.050> backside<00:01:35.050> is<00:01:35.380> made<00:01:36.040> out<00:01:36.160> of

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
the top so this backside is made out of

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.690 
the top so this backside is made out of
glass<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:38.380> can<00:01:38.530> also<00:01:38.680> remove<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.490> let's

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
glass and you can also remove it let's

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.090 
glass and you can also remove it let's
let's<00:01:39.910> see<00:01:40.150> if<00:01:40.240> we<00:01:40.330> can<00:01:40.480> do<00:01:40.600> it<00:01:40.750> right<00:01:40.780> here

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
let's see if we can do it right here

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.480 
let's see if we can do it right here
it<00:01:42.370> also<00:01:42.550> says<00:01:42.940> DTS<00:01:43.570> HD<00:01:44.140> premium<00:01:44.680> sound<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:45.400> it

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
it also says DTS HD premium sound so it

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.660 
it also says DTS HD premium sound so it
has<00:01:45.640> some<00:01:45.820> nice<00:01:46.320> speakers<00:01:47.320> as<00:01:47.530> well<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.400> let's

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
has some nice speakers as well so let's

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.980 
has some nice speakers as well so let's
try<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:48.910> remove<00:01:49.300> this<00:01:49.900> backside<00:01:51.300> no<00:01:52.300> it's<00:01:52.750> not

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
try to remove this backside no it's not

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.630 
try to remove this backside no it's not
possible<00:01:53.350> right<00:01:53.650> now<00:01:53.830> probably<00:01:54.490> they<00:01:54.610> just

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
possible right now probably they just

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.450 
possible right now probably they just
glued<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.240> on<00:01:55.390> so<00:01:56.020> there<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.260> huge<00:01:57.010> four

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
glued it on so there is a huge four

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.550 
glued it on so there is a huge four
thousand<00:01:58.030> milliamp<00:01:58.300> power<00:01:58.570> battery<00:01:58.750> in<00:01:59.320> South

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
thousand milliamp power battery in South

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.460 
thousand milliamp power battery in South
Bay<00:01:59.800> which<00:02:00.520> probably<00:02:01.119> should've<00:02:01.509> yeah<00:02:02.110> take

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
Bay which probably should've yeah take

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.999 
Bay which probably should've yeah take
you<00:02:02.650> through<00:02:03.400> two<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:04.150> three<00:02:04.479> days<00:02:05.009> because

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
you through two to three days because

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.710 
you through two to three days because
the<00:02:06.100> display<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.550> not<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:06.910> fine<00:02:07.119> resolution

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
the display is not that fine resolution

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.499 
the display is not that fine resolution
so<00:02:08.009> probably<00:02:09.009> more<00:02:09.520> than<00:02:09.670> enough<00:02:09.970> for<00:02:10.330> two

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
so probably more than enough for two

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.470 
so probably more than enough for two
