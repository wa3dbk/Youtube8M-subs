to the first x shape so we've got a nice

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.209 
to the first x shape so we've got a nice
clean<00:01:53.180> clean<00:01:54.180> palette<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> work<00:01:54.990> from<00:01:55.259> so

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
clean clean palette to work from so

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.999 
clean clean palette to work from so
they're<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> same<00:01:56.610> now<00:01:57.979> ok<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.979> first

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
they're all the same now ok so the first

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.830 
they're all the same now ok so the first
trick<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.610> when<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.090> mouth<00:02:03.240> shapes<00:02:03.600> i

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
trick is when you do mouth shapes i

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.010 
trick is when you do mouth shapes i
always<00:02:04.530> prefer<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:05.280> change<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.060> mouth<00:02:06.270> one

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
always prefer to change the mouth one

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.499 
always prefer to change the mouth one
frame<00:02:07.409> before<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:08.250> actually<00:02:08.580> changes<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
frame before it actually changes on the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.660 
frame before it actually changes on the
voice<00:02:09.660> track<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.259> for<00:02:10.410> example<00:02:10.470> down<00:02:11.280> here<00:02:11.340> you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
voice track so for example down here you

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.149 
voice track so for example down here you
can<00:02:11.790> see<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.420> where<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.660> starts

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.440 

but<00:02:16.159> I<00:02:16.189> would<00:02:16.459> like<00:02:16.579> to<00:02:16.610> change<00:02:16.849> the<00:02:17.060> mouth<00:02:17.209> on

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
but I would like to change the mouth on

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.210 
but I would like to change the mouth on
this<00:02:17.629> frame<00:02:17.959> so<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:18.260> gives<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:18.980> your<00:02:19.099> eyes

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
this frame so that gives so your eyes

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.399 
this frame so that gives so your eyes
can<00:02:19.430> kind<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.670> catch<00:02:19.879> up<00:02:20.120> with<00:02:20.299> the<00:02:20.420> mouth<00:02:20.599> so

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
can kind of catch up with the mouth so

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:22.809 
can kind of catch up with the mouth so
basically<00:02:21.769> just<00:02:21.980> dragged<00:02:22.280> through<00:02:22.610> your

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
basically just dragged through your

as a verse SF so I'll move that on one
closer<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.209> think<00:04:16.639> then<00:04:17.639> you<00:04:18.000> is<00:04:18.329> 0<00:04:22.820> as<00:04:23.820> an<00:04:24.090> S<00:04:28.220> so

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
closer I think then you is 0 as an S so

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.290 
closer I think then you is 0 as an S so
let<00:04:29.310> me<00:04:29.370> go<00:04:29.460> see<00:04:29.520> better<00:04:29.729> just<00:04:29.910> go<00:04:30.030> through
