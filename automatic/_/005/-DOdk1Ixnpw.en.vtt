box<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.649> some<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.219> accessories

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
box we have some of the accessories

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.239 
box we have some of the accessories
including<00:01:48.569> the<00:01:48.600> manuals<00:01:49.079> or<00:01:49.350> actually<00:01:50.130> this

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249 
including the manuals or actually this

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:52.639 
including the manuals or actually this
is<00:01:50.429> going<00:01:50.609> to<00:01:50.729> be<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> flip<00:01:51.299> cover<00:01:51.569> case<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.350> came

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
is going to be a flip cover case it came

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.859 
is going to be a flip cover case it came
in<00:01:52.770> white<00:01:52.950> color<00:01:53.219> so<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> think<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:54.659> gonna

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
in white color so I think that's gonna

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.230 
in white color so I think that's gonna
make<00:01:55.259> up<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.249> little<00:01:56.399> bit<00:01:56.579> for<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.819> black<00:01:56.999> color

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
make up a little bit for the black color

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.879 
make up a little bit for the black color
version<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:57.929> here<00:01:58.079> we<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.289> see<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.740> is

00:01:58.879 --> 00:01:58.889 
version but here we can see that this is

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:01.429 
version but here we can see that this is
some<00:01:59.069> sort<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.369> flip<00:01:59.909> case<00:02:00.179> and<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:01.289> is

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
popularity of this phone so here we have

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300 
popularity of this phone so here we have
the<00:02:18.450> flip<00:02:18.630> case<00:02:18.900> very<00:02:19.290> nice<00:02:19.530> we<00:02:19.950> also<00:02:20.070> have

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
the flip case very nice we also have

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.210 
the flip case very nice we also have
here<00:02:20.520> inside<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.150> micro<00:02:21.870> USB<00:02:22.410> cable

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
here inside the micro USB cable

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.240 
here inside the micro USB cable
we<00:02:23.670> have<00:02:23.910> some<00:02:24.330> sort<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.660> earphones<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.800> they

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
we have some sort of earphones and they

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.130 
we have some sort of earphones and they
look<00:02:26.400> already<00:02:26.730> very<00:02:27.120> nice<00:02:27.330> but<00:02:27.720> they<00:02:27.840> kind<00:02:28.080> of

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
look already very nice but they kind of

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.900 
look already very nice but they kind of
light<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:28.620> I'm<00:02:28.740> assuming<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.220> they<00:02:29.460> could<00:02:29.760> be

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
light so I'm assuming that they could be

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.810 
light so I'm assuming that they could be
of<00:02:30.240> cheap<00:02:30.960> quality<00:02:31.200> here<00:02:32.100> we<00:02:32.190> have<00:02:32.340> also<00:02:32.640> the

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
so I can say that just by looking at the

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:32.630 
so I can say that just by looking at the
thinness<00:04:31.650> of<00:04:31.710> this<00:04:31.860> device<00:04:32.160> is<00:04:32.340> going<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.550> be

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
thinness of this device is going to be

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.490 
thinness of this device is going to be
about<00:04:32.850> eight<00:04:33.120> point<00:04:33.570> eight<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:34.080> eight<00:04:34.229> point

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
about eight point eight to eight point

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.740 
about eight point eight to eight point
five<00:04:34.620> millimeters<00:04:35.190> but<00:04:35.550> again<00:04:36.390> check<00:04:36.600> the

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
five millimeters but again check the

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.040 
five millimeters but again check the

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.330 
link
and<00:04:37.470> it's<00:04:37.620> going<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.770> give<00:04:37.949> you<00:04:38.039> all<00:04:38.190> the

and it's going to give you all the
details<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:39.060> it<00:04:39.599> is<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:39.750> dual<00:04:40.080> sim<00:04:40.440> dual

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
details and it is a dual sim dual

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.800 
details and it is a dual sim dual
standby<00:04:40.770> here<00:04:41.639> we<00:04:41.759> have<00:04:41.909> the<00:04:42.090> battery<00:04:42.449> and<00:04:42.659> the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
standby here we have the battery and the

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.219 
standby here we have the battery and the
battery<00:04:42.840> comes<00:04:43.349> covered<00:04:43.860> for<00:04:44.639> this<00:04:44.759> tape<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:45.449> I

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
battery comes covered for this tape so I

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.260 
battery comes covered for this tape so I
think<00:04:46.500> this<00:04:46.620> is<00:04:46.770> for<00:04:47.069> customs<00:04:47.580> they<00:04:48.060> only

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
think this is for customs they only

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.210 
think this is for customs they only
allow<00:04:48.690> one<00:04:49.139> battery<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.860> has<00:04:49.979> to<00:04:50.099> be

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
allow one battery and it has to be

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.339 
allow one battery and it has to be
integrated<00:04:50.490> in<00:04:50.909> the<00:04:51.030> phone<00:04:51.270> but<00:04:51.990> I<00:04:52.020> don't<00:04:52.289> know

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
integrated in the phone but I don't know

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.619 
integrated in the phone but I don't know
why<00:04:52.530> they<00:04:52.680> put<00:04:52.889> that<00:04:52.919> little<00:04:53.400> cover<00:04:54.150> around

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
why they put that little cover around

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.960 
why they put that little cover around
the<00:04:54.750> terminals<00:04:55.289> because<00:04:55.949> I<00:04:56.220> don't<00:04:56.699> know<00:04:56.789> maybe

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
the terminals because I don't know maybe

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.999 
the terminals because I don't know maybe
so<00:04:57.270> that<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.539> battery<00:04:57.870> doesn't<00:04:58.259> get<00:04:58.500> ruined<00:04:58.650> I

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
so that the battery doesn't get ruined I

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:00.409 
so that the battery doesn't get ruined I
don't<00:04:59.220> know<00:04:59.310> what's<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.580> reason<00:05:00.000> but<00:05:00.150> here<00:05:00.330> we

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
don't know what's the reason but here we

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.180 
don't know what's the reason but here we
can<00:05:00.539> see<00:05:00.720> that<00:05:00.900> yes<00:05:01.110> it<00:05:01.259> is<00:05:01.379> a<00:05:01.409> dual<00:05:01.710> sim<00:05:01.979> dual

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
can see that yes it is a dual sim dual

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.490 
can see that yes it is a dual sim dual
standby<00:05:02.220> device<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.780> build<00:05:04.020> quality<00:05:04.169> is

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
standby device the build quality is

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.469 
standby device the build quality is
looks<00:05:05.009> very<00:05:05.370> nice<00:05:05.550> already<00:05:05.940> has<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.210> whole

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
looks very nice already has a whole

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.839 
looks very nice already has a whole
bunch<00:05:06.690> of<00:05:06.780> screws<00:05:07.050> around<00:05:07.259> the<00:05:07.530> frame<00:05:07.770> here<00:05:08.759> we

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
bunch of screws around the frame here we

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.850 
bunch of screws around the frame here we
can<00:05:08.970> see<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.300> loudspeaker<00:05:09.990> now<00:05:10.139> on<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.590> back

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
can see the loudspeaker now on the back

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.279 
can see the loudspeaker now on the back
it<00:05:11.669> shows<00:05:11.699> us<00:05:12.180> if<00:05:12.509> it<00:05:12.629> was<00:05:12.659> a<00:05:12.780> very<00:05:13.110> long

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
it shows us if it was a very long

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.050 
it shows us if it was a very long
speaker<00:05:13.800> but<00:05:14.009> it's<00:05:14.190> actually<00:05:14.520> not<00:05:14.550> I<00:05:14.729> think

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
speaker but it's actually not I think

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.360 
speaker but it's actually not I think
that's<00:05:15.270> just<00:05:15.569> for<00:05:15.750> style<00:05:16.050> you<00:05:16.889> can<00:05:17.039> see<00:05:17.190> that

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
that's just for style you can see that

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.219 
that's just for style you can see that
it<00:05:17.460> comes<00:05:17.669> with<00:05:17.759> two<00:05:18.000> IMEI<00:05:18.479> s<00:05:18.599> and<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:18.930> model

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
it comes with two IMEI s and the model

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.369 
it comes with two IMEI s and the model
yes<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:19.680> is<00:05:19.770> they<00:05:19.919> see<00:05:20.190> 1000<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.599> battery<00:05:21.930> has

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.379 
yes it is they see 1000 the battery has

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.369 
yes it is they see 1000 the battery has
great<00:05:22.800> power<00:05:23.129> we<00:05:23.430> can<00:05:23.580> see<00:05:23.729> here<00:05:23.969> it<00:05:24.180> is<00:05:24.419> a<00:05:24.599> 3200

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:25.379 
great power we can see here it is a 3200

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:27.770 
great power we can see here it is a 3200
milliamp<00:05:25.860> battery<00:05:25.919> so<00:05:26.849> I'm<00:05:27.180> assuming<00:05:27.539> that

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
milliamp battery so I'm assuming that

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.240 
milliamp battery so I'm assuming that
this<00:05:27.960> is<00:05:28.020> going<00:05:28.289> to<00:05:28.440> last<00:05:28.620> a<00:05:28.770> very<00:05:28.800> long<00:05:29.069> time

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
this is going to last a very long time

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.330 
this is going to last a very long time
and<00:05:29.849> even<00:05:30.389> though<00:05:30.539> it's<00:05:30.780> flat<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:31.379> thin<00:05:31.979> it's

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
and even though it's flat and thin it's

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.420 
and even though it's flat and thin it's
very<00:05:32.789> wide<00:05:33.090> so<00:05:33.569> it<00:05:33.900> is<00:05:34.080> credible<00:05:34.889> that<00:05:35.099> it

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
very wide so it is credible that it

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.950 
very wide so it is credible that it
could<00:05:35.759> be<00:05:35.879> a<00:05:35.909> thirty<00:05:36.300> two<00:05:36.509> hundred<00:05:36.539> million

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
could be a thirty two hundred million

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.659 
could be a thirty two hundred million
battery<00:05:37.409> but<00:05:37.620> of<00:05:37.740> course<00:05:38.009> that's<00:05:38.219> why<00:05:38.370> we<00:05:38.550> do

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
battery but of course that's why we do

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.029 
battery but of course that's why we do
reviews<00:05:39.120> so<00:05:39.330> that<00:05:39.449> we<00:05:39.539> can<00:05:39.719> test<00:05:39.930> that<00:05:40.080> so<00:05:40.919> now

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
reviews so that we can test that so now

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.110 
reviews so that we can test that so now
we're<00:05:41.250> going<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.430> go<00:05:41.550> ahead<00:05:41.669> and<00:05:41.789> power<00:05:41.909> on<00:05:42.090> the

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
we're going to go ahead and power on the

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.749 
we're going to go ahead and power on the
device<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:42.810> see<00:05:43.229> what<00:05:43.409> kind<00:05:43.620> of<00:05:43.710> logo<00:05:44.279> we<00:05:44.580> have

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
device and see what kind of logo we have

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.249 
device and see what kind of logo we have
here<00:05:45.000> at<00:05:45.090> the<00:05:45.150> very<00:05:45.300> front<00:05:45.569> we<00:05:45.840> can<00:05:45.960> see<00:05:46.110> here

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
here at the very front we can see here

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:48.439 
here at the very front we can see here
the<00:05:46.380> android<00:05:46.770> logo<00:05:46.919> so<00:05:47.729> here<00:05:47.940> we<00:05:48.029> have<00:05:48.210> the

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
the android logo so here we have the

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.930 
the android logo so here we have the
theme<00:05:49.259> on<00:05:49.469> it<00:05:49.620> it<00:05:49.830> looks<00:05:50.039> like<00:05:50.190> just<00:05:50.520> basic

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
theme on it it looks like just basic

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
Android first thing I'm going to check

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:55.100 
Android first thing I'm going to check
let's<00:05:53.340> go<00:05:53.490> here<00:05:53.669> to<00:05:53.699> settings<00:05:53.930> let's<00:05:54.930> scroll

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
let's go here to settings let's scroll

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.709 
let's go here to settings let's scroll
all<00:05:55.319> the<00:05:55.349> way<00:05:55.469> to<00:05:55.620> the<00:05:55.800> bottom<00:05:56.009> and<00:05:56.370> so<00:05:57.300> far<00:05:57.509> it

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:57.719 
all the way to the bottom and so far it

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:00.529 
all the way to the bottom and so far it
is<00:05:57.750> showing<00:05:58.139> as<00:05:58.319> it<00:05:58.560> is<00:05:58.680> Android<00:05:59.039> 4.4.2<00:05:59.940> but<00:06:00.419> of

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
is showing as it is Android 4.4.2 but of

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.390 
is showing as it is Android 4.4.2 but of
course<00:06:00.779> I<00:06:00.990> gotta<00:06:01.199> check<00:06:01.469> my<00:06:01.500> root<00:06:01.830> tools<00:06:02.130> and

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
course I gotta check my root tools and

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.519 
course I gotta check my root tools and
then<00:06:02.550> if<00:06:02.789> I'm<00:06:02.940> able<00:06:03.150> to<00:06:03.389> root<00:06:03.599> it<00:06:03.750> but<00:06:04.289> the<00:06:04.380> old

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:04.529 
then if I'm able to root it but the old

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.140 
then if I'm able to root it but the old
tools<00:06:04.800> that<00:06:04.979> I've<00:06:05.099> used<00:06:05.279> before<00:06:05.460> that<00:06:05.940> means

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
tools that I've used before that means

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.050 
tools that I've used before that means
that<00:06:06.360> it<00:06:06.539> is<00:06:06.659> most<00:06:06.960> likely<00:06:07.110> not<00:06:07.650> Android<00:06:08.250> 4.4.2

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
that it is most likely not Android 4.4.2

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.990 
that it is most likely not Android 4.4.2
but<00:06:09.419> if<00:06:09.509> I<00:06:09.629> do<00:06:09.690> get<00:06:09.960> a<00:06:09.990> hard<00:06:10.229> time<00:06:10.500> or<00:06:11.490> I<00:06:11.550> just

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
but if I do get a hard time or I just

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.200 
but if I do get a hard time or I just
tested<00:06:12.360> with<00:06:12.449> Android<00:06:12.779> SDK<00:06:13.349> for<00:06:13.770> the<00:06:14.120> for<00:06:15.120> the

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
tested with Android SDK for the for the

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.510 
tested with Android SDK for the for the
software<00:06:15.539> that<00:06:15.750> we<00:06:15.870> use<00:06:16.050> on<00:06:16.259> the<00:06:16.289> computer

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
software that we use on the computer

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.070 
software that we use on the computer
then<00:06:17.520> I<00:06:17.819> can<00:06:18.000> definitely<00:06:18.120> confirm<00:06:18.419> this<00:06:18.930> is

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
then I can definitely confirm this is

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.279 
then I can definitely confirm this is
going<00:06:19.289> to<00:06:19.379> be<00:06:19.500> Android<00:06:19.979> 4.4.2<00:06:20.819> but<00:06:21.719> I<00:06:21.900> can<00:06:22.080> say

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
going to be Android 4.4.2 but I can say

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.320 
going to be Android 4.4.2 but I can say
that<00:06:22.500> the<00:06:22.620> overall<00:06:22.979> quality<00:06:23.219> looks<00:06:23.699> very<00:06:24.090> nice
