 ccleaner 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.150
 if in Italy it is unlikely to have to face a hippopotamus but also i 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.150
 our small animals can become dangerous 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.060
 ok i'm man's best friend but in certain situations their attitudes 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.849
 they can change however their attacks are never free water 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.839
 70% of dog attacks in the family is due to our mistakes in the 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.149
 their education uahahah failure to respect the hierarchical role that must be 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.149
 man 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.390
 to avoid problems we don't pay attention with a stick on the gates we don't start to 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.350
 run vice we have a baby or another dog we don't take them in our arms 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.530
 easter passion stemware will face the first piece of advice and not shoot in Rome 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.550
 back away slowly without giving back the essence look into his eyes 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.250
 we do not give signs of weakness and at the same time try to understand why 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.620
 he wants to attack us can be for the territory or to defend food 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.990
 let's try to ignore him away we have a bunch in front of us we have to 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.410
 locate the field 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.360
 is what you put in front of the PC speed up and who leaves first in the case 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.340
 and with him that we must fight in case of attack we must remain in the square 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.990
 falling to the ground is extremely dangerous 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.649
 a tip always valid for those who own a dog made to socialize 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.210
 with other dogs at the park or in specialized centers this will make it a 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.210
 animal balanced and therefore not dangerous 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.510
 we are sure that the cows do not attack 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.000
 actually they are you have the calf do not feel street in a 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.690
 angle 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.770
 Accident deaths occur simply because they get scared 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.670
 the vet shows us how very curious they are, they come close to any 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.670
 good thing a uniform color attracts them more 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.380
 but at our first abrupt movement panic starts 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:13.879
 if you are attacked by a pile corn story throw yourself on the ground 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.210
 bees are not aggressive 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.809
 but they strenuously defend their hive 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:27.009
 they are attracted by dark colors with strong odors from cold sweat 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:31.439
 when preparing to attack with milk, lift the woman's back 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.279
 thanks 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:38.249
 news never approach the weather frontally but always sideways to remove 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:38.949
 slowly
