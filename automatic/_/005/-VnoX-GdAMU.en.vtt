wondering<00:05:27.510> how<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:27.990> performances<00:05:30.290> tip<00:05:31.290> that

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
wondering how the performances tip that

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.010 
wondering how the performances tip that
last<00:05:31.920> one<00:05:32.100> out<00:05:32.220> and<00:05:32.490> there's<00:05:33.450> still<00:05:33.660> a<00:05:33.690> big

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
last one out and there's still a big

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.660 
last one out and there's still a big
piece<00:05:34.320> of<00:05:34.350> plastic<00:05:34.830> all<00:05:35.100> the<00:05:35.220> way<00:05:35.280> on<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.430> back

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
piece of plastic all the way on the back

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:41.750 
piece of plastic all the way on the back
so<00:05:36.630> I'll<00:05:36.840> just<00:05:36.870> peel<00:05:37.440> all<00:05:37.710> of<00:05:37.860> this<00:05:38.070> out<00:05:40.760> get

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
so I'll just peel all of this out get

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.660 
so I'll just peel all of this out get
all<00:05:41.970> of<00:05:42.000> these<00:05:42.210> little<00:05:42.540> tapes<00:05:42.750> out<00:05:43.670> throw

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
all of these little tapes out throw

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.250 
all of these little tapes out throw
everything<00:05:44.970> on<00:05:45.150> the<00:05:45.270> floor<00:05:45.360> and<00:05:45.660> I'll<00:05:45.930> get<00:05:46.170> to

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
everything on the floor and I'll get to

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.500 
everything on the floor and I'll get to
that<00:05:46.290> later

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.380 

is<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.140> a<00:05:50.320> plastic<00:05:50.950> covering<00:05:51.400> over<00:05:52.000> here<00:05:52.330> in

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
is it a plastic covering over here in

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:58.770 
is it a plastic covering over here in
the<00:05:52.450> back<00:05:52.630> and<00:05:53.040> just<00:05:54.040> one<00:05:54.310> more<00:05:54.490> and<00:05:57.690> let<00:05:58.690> me

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
the back and just one more and let me

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.180 
the back and just one more and let me
just<00:05:58.810> bring<00:05:59.140> the<00:05:59.290> camera<00:05:59.620> a<00:05:59.650> little<00:05:59.800> bit

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
just bring the camera a little bit

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.340 
just bring the camera a little bit
closer<00:06:00.430> so<00:06:01.300> you<00:06:01.330> can<00:06:01.450> get<00:06:01.690> a<00:06:01.750> real<00:06:01.960> view<00:06:02.230> of

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
closer so you can get a real view of

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.020 
closer so you can get a real view of
what<00:06:02.500> you<00:06:02.560> can<00:06:02.710> see<00:06:02.890> here<00:06:05.910> currently<00:06:06.910> on<00:06:07.000> a

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
what you can see here currently on a

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.910 
what you can see here currently on a
tripod<00:06:07.300> so<00:06:07.660> it<00:06:07.750> might<00:06:07.930> be<00:06:08.050> a<00:06:08.080> little<00:06:08.260> hard<00:06:10.920> now

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:11.920 
tripod so it might be a little hard now

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.350 
tripod so it might be a little hard now
let<00:06:12.130> me<00:06:12.160> show<00:06:12.310> you<00:06:12.340> the<00:06:12.520> port's<00:06:12.790> I<00:06:12.880> was<00:06:13.000> talking

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
let me show you the port's I was talking

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.410 
let me show you the port's I was talking
about<00:06:17.460> might<00:06:18.460> have<00:06:18.640> a<00:06:18.700> little<00:06:18.820> trouble<00:06:18.940> seeing

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 
about might have a little trouble seeing

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.800 
about might have a little trouble seeing
but<00:06:20.080> you<00:06:20.170> can<00:06:20.320> see<00:06:20.500> here<00:06:20.800> is<00:06:20.920> the<00:06:21.040> CD<00:06:21.370> Drive

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
but you can see here is the CD Drive

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.940 
but you can see here is the CD Drive
here<00:06:22.810> are<00:06:22.900> some<00:06:23.050> other<00:06:23.200> ports<00:06:23.620> I<00:06:23.740> believe

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
here are some other ports I believe

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.160 
here are some other ports I believe
that's<00:06:24.070> the<00:06:24.190> power<00:06:24.460> button<00:06:24.700> the<00:06:25.600> volume<00:06:25.990> up

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.170 
that's the power button the volume up

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.600 
that's the power button the volume up
and<00:06:26.350> down<00:06:26.440> and<00:06:27.660> the<00:06:28.660> brightness<00:06:29.400> now<00:06:30.400> that's

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
and down and the brightness now that's

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.000 
and down and the brightness now that's
on<00:06:30.880> the<00:06:31.150> right<00:06:31.360> side<00:06:31.630> now<00:06:32.290> let<00:06:32.470> me<00:06:32.500> just<00:06:32.590> go<00:06:32.920> on

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
on the right side now let me just go on

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.440 
on the right side now let me just go on
the<00:06:33.100> left<00:06:33.280> side<00:06:33.490> and<00:06:34.410> this<00:06:35.410> is<00:06:35.590> pretty<00:06:35.830> heavy

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
the left side and this is pretty heavy

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.030 
the left side and this is pretty heavy
so<00:06:37.450> I<00:06:37.510> guess<00:06:37.690> 20<00:06:37.900> pounds<00:06:38.350> maybe<00:06:38.470> maybe<00:06:38.920> a

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040 
so I guess 20 pounds maybe maybe a

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.740 
so I guess 20 pounds maybe maybe a
little<00:06:39.190> more<00:06:40.320> right<00:06:41.320> here<00:06:42.420> here<00:06:43.420> you<00:06:43.570> have<00:06:43.690> a

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:51.960 
little more right here here you have a
couple<00:06:44.110> ports<00:06:46.110> this<00:06:47.110> is<00:06:47.350> for<00:06:47.680> the<00:06:49.050> h-60<00:06:50.970> here's
