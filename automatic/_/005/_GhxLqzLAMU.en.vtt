 That limited edition series Guarding 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:37.300
 The ink of this silver is 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:40.640
 When I use this imp and absorb the sun's light and bring it to a dark place 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.690
 That light has lived 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.430
 It feels like something a bit erotic 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:52.650
 It is said that this can also be enjoyed in that playful room 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.650
 Oh Nante rice also enjoy Hishiko 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:02.580
 Shimada bell is zero one one 11 years 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.550
 Increasing it in size variation in the models from the first year Tettemafu 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.000
 A model that is easy to ride 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.930
 If there is no best habit in the zero Doggy 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.610
 Well, the first time Zeller ride people want to have first from here 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:20.930
 It is had 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:23.510
 Toka really press Nde really the best software in zero that without waiting for this habit 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.510
 As it can comfortably Toka spin 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.870
 The first one you recommend this 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.349
 Another belt from Japan 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:39.260
 There is a model called double spin and this is 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:44.629
 Label is camber and double spinner pet is a double camber 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:52.130
 There are just two cambers with double cambers, so it's a rocker shape. 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:56.350
 That 's why I was able to play a little loosely how to use press or press 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.470
 It 's all that double camper that spins up 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.190
 So 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.180
 The remix double chamber is a remix spin 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:11.150
 Double double camber becomes double sp 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:16.160
 The difference between the after camber and the double camber is easier with less power than the double camber 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:20.010
 Especially recommended for people without legs that can be turned 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:25.470
 Reverse that spin 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:31.170
 If you are confident about your high-speed spins and after-legs, ride a camber 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:34.110
 The Tteyuu or increasing the rotation speed of the spin of the high-speed rotation and out of the height in the Holy is Well 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:39.590
 Law but it is I think the system 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:42.360
 The big difference is that Camber and Double Camber are different. 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.440
 It's easy to get on 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.220
 Oh dear 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.790
 Fine off 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.360
 Wow even easier without the habit expired turn that 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:55.540
 First of all, we recommend this because high rotation is also possible 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:59.410
 My spirit is different though 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.770
 double spin double spanish well double camber 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:07.160
 why 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:09.889
 Wet to loose than what's a wind Tteyuu Well play in the free-run whether terrain 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.980
 Recommended for people who ride in style 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:19.890

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:22.050
 Well I said at the beginning of the 8 but I'm in the morning or a trumpet of Made in Japan 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:26.090
 The quality is good 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:30.560
 Snowboarding is really fun 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.820
 Well, depending on the style, is it a camber or a double camber ? 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.729
 Well I want you to decide on your own 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.589
