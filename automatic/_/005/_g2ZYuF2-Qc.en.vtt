stuffy<00:00:16.020> nose<00:00:16.199> sore<00:00:16.859> throat<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.430> think<00:00:17.760> two

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
stuffy nose sore throat and I think two

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.640 
stuffy nose sore throat and I think two
nights<00:00:18.270> ago<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.539> had<00:00:18.779> like<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.990> hundred<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.470> four

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
nights ago I had like a hundred and four

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.650 
nights ago I had like a hundred and four
degree<00:00:19.859> fever<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:21.060> was<00:00:21.150> almost<00:00:21.330> at<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
degree fever and it was almost at the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.580 
degree fever and it was almost at the
point<00:00:21.689> where<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.020> was<00:00:22.080> going<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.350> go<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
point where I was going to go to the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.200 
point where I was going to go to the
hospital<00:00:22.710> because<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.369> think<00:00:23.519> if<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.880> gets<00:00:24.029> up

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
hospital because I think if it gets up

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.689 
hospital because I think if it gets up
to<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.570> 106<00:00:25.230> degrees<00:00:25.560> he<00:00:26.039> can<00:00:26.189> start<00:00:26.430> causing

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
to like 106 degrees he can start causing

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.160 
to like 106 degrees he can start causing
like<00:00:27.000> brain<00:00:27.269> damage<00:00:27.630> or<00:00:27.750> something<00:00:28.019> like<00:00:28.109> that

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
like brain damage or something like that
