verification<00:01:05.450> because<00:01:06.450> essentially<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.080> is

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
verification because essentially this is

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.920 
verification because essentially this is
a<00:01:07.320> almost<00:01:07.920> like<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> Visa<00:01:08.400> card<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.750> will

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
a almost like a Visa card so there will

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.280 
a almost like a Visa card so there will
be<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:11.000> card<00:01:12.000> number<00:01:12.270> associated<00:01:12.780> with<00:01:13.110> this

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
be a card number associated with this

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.880 
be a card number associated with this
virtual<00:01:13.860> gift<00:01:14.509> Visa<00:01:15.509> card<00:01:15.840> number<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
virtual gift Visa card number and so the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.410
