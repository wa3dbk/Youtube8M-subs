00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.550
 good eyes a milking parlor not the goats entered 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.300
 early in the morning 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.090
 to be milked 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.950
 they are eating little and concentrated 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.210
 they calmly let themselves be milked 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.250
 being 5-3 depending on the amount of milk they produce 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.339
 3 4 minutes can milking and that way all in the form of x 100 yk 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.330
 we are owners in a different environment to the corral 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.140
 that is something important to highlight to set a pattern of important hygiene and 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.910
 also so that the milk in the salt 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.980
 free from undesirable odors 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.660
 and of course more hygienic 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.489
 We therefore recommend all producers to use a room 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:03.969
 milking 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.979
 I hope I can do high like this 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.899
 for greater ease the Chinese operator on the ground goes well on a floor with 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.360
 cement that allows a cleaning there is a varied very well 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.649
 to bring a very good hygiene of the milk that is such a delicate product 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:18.720
 and so predictable 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.050
 allowed at the same time we were in the dairy plant to protect us cañete 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.340
 here the procedure begins with the reception of the milk by the 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.520
 producers 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.890
 from the producer of goat's milk on this scale the prologue or the 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.750
 container that the producer in day for based on the weight 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.530
 make the corresponding payment for your milk 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.430
 once registered who sent the milk and what is the weight that is sent 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.770
 all milk 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.210
 that enters this plant necessarily has to be analyzed in the 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.030
 laboratory 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.290
 where based on certain assets and analysis equipment 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.540
 we can determine 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.190
 the ideas of that milk we can determine the density we can measure the 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.380
 stay of the protein in such a way that we can know if that milk is 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.420
 adequate to be that that to make yogurt by ap en díaz is not inadequate 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.859
 nor for any given things 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:12.680
 all this has done goes through its quality control 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.920
 in this laboratory 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.389
 simple but quite useful and practical 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:21.139
 is the most important after the analysis of the milk and we pass it to the 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:25.839
 processing room the asal processing consists of an aria 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:30.889
 mostly with equipment and stainless steel what will not allow 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.919
 First sterilize the milk in a specialized kettle 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:38.249
 correct at right temperature temperatures with certain time and we are 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:39.260
 visualizing 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.959
 the kettle 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.910
 once the milk is authorized 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.909
 and it was already proceeded to be that wasser yogurt 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.860
 that's why we have different crops 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.260
 different based on different containers 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.890
 various utensils 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.010
 That allow us 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.209
 produce a fresh weight 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.439
 and a balloon 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:57.879
 of goat's milk 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.609
 of the highest quality and of the highest value 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:01.680
 Right 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.960
 so everything as seen in surgical steel there is a need to 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.090
 this for the majority has for a greater and adequate cleaning 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.010
 once the processing and the time that a dairy derivative demanded 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.979
 we finish with the final product 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.919
 we are in the dairy plant 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.729
 of santa barbara cañete 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.699
 where we can appreciate in this table the products that are produced today in 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:25.329
 day 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.189
 like sonic youth 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.759
 fermented milk 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:33.139
 that turns into yogurt based on certain dairy crops 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.730
 in this case in guanabacoa domic in mango 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.949
 in the same way 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.370
 all with pasteurized milk of course 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.439
 Fresh cheese Fresh cheese made with goat's milk 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:48.369
 which is quite tasty and much more digestible 

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:53.099
 These dairy products have the advantage of causing o'toole to be more 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.769
 digestible for the human being 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.510
 And on the other hand they have the faculty 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.500
 in eighths to digestive problems there are people who are 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.370
 lactose intolerant and accurate with this type of dairy products 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.310
 They are quite easy to consume because the lactose has been transformed 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.529
 He has withdrawn him 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:14.179
 so that they are very tasty and very nutritious products 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:19.049
 the particularity of goat cheese or goat's milk in contrast to 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.809
 labaka for example its color 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:25.969
 you were observing what this this goat cheese is whiter than cow 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:30.479
 the debate is a little bit more yellowish and that's because of the presence of vitamin in 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.069
 Goat milk, instead of cow's milk, has beta carotenes 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.860
 is the precursor of the vitamin 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.340
 he is important so that I go to the vitamin 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.420
 Transforms ready to use instead the cow the body has to transform 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.419
 that vitamin pro-vitamin in vitamin 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.289
 another difference in this cheese 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.480
 It's a texture 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.660
 and a fairly final culture when it fell short they observe fine finite was 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.550
 null arm is very small 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.960
 that means that digests more easily than cow 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.990
 then we are facing a product 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.210
 of very high quality of very high value
