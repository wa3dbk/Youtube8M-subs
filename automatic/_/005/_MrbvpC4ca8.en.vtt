 Claudia Gurisatti 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.869
 if you are considering yourself as the 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.209
 Latin American tigers those countries that 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.680
 they believe in market conditions in 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.140
 the rules of the market with states 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.940
 regulators unlike others that are 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.160
 they were left in the old ideologies of 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.019
 passed like dawn for example look 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.239
 claudia we are countries that we have a 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.459
 shared vision regarding the free 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.769
 trade we believe that the free 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.900
 trade is a way to enhance the 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.879
 development of our towns for 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.459
 enhance trade among our 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.920
 villages to contribute to the integration 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.549
 of our peoples we oppose that no 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.310
 they have a place 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.099
 let's say countries that at this time like 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.930
 own genes is the message for the 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.880
 investor have to meet those 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.049
 concrete characteristics that you 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.510
 has explained well are several 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.580
 features first have 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.860
 clarity in that free trade is a 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.540
 way for development has to occur 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.799
 among the requirements the countries 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.890
 that make it up 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.349
 concluded a free trade agreement 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.349
 between the countries that integrate it and the 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.970
 eliminate visa barriers to 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.769
 who want to move from a country to 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.019
 other besides the economic benefits 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.180
 that will bring life to the Pacific without 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.510
 doubt comes to make this an important 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.519
 contribution to greater integration 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.040
 cultural cooperation for the 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.170
 political dialogue among the countries that 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.849
 we integrate this peaceful alliance is a 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.400
 alliance that is not closed is a 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.920
 alliance that precisely by its own 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.620
 nature and essence in favor of the free 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.840
 trade and a greater opening 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.599
 is open to other countries that 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.170
 eventually meeting the requirements and 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.579
 being part of this vision in favor of 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.200
 free trade in the future 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.970
 eventually they can incorporate between 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.010
 concept this economic policy 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.389
 obviously opening markets is like 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.709
 you propose that the 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.879
 development but is not more sensitive and 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.680
 obviously it has to do with the issues 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.120
 for agricultural versus those sectors 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.480
 sensitive posed you the 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.300
 mandate 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.909
 and so give more gradualness 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.500
 precisely for the relief of 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.560
 these products of the field which 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.970
 we understand is our production 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.519
 I believe that in all the 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.010
 countries and in certain products has 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.989
 that to become more competitive we give 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.060
 space for public policies 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.220
 that governments continue to raise 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.729
 competitiveness the ability to 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.400
 production of these countries 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.290
 then join fully to 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.660
