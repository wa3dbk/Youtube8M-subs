00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.859
 I have always believed that polaroid is such 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.870
 camera 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:07.490
 press and immediately snapshot creeps out 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.769
 and ready 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:15.360
 it turns out that this is also a turn 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.539
 if the camera saves for us 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.990
 history then these points turn out to be too 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.590
 keep that they keep our sight 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.810
 and even our health turns out to be good 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.539
 sunglasses are different from the sun 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.500
 just like a good car is different 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:43.110
 bad you wonder what is it and we 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:45.510
 you will be happy to explain the sun 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.719
 the source of life on earth 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.140
 the more its warmer on the street and 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.309
 better mood even our loved ones we 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.710
 affectionately call the sun however bright 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.850
 sun rays can play man 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.870
 bad joke of our cyclist 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.870
 traitorous blinded glare 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.540
 black is the reflection of light reflected 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.630
 smooth surface for example water or 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.450
 asphalt at night is the same 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.820
 a gleam is created by oncoming automobiles 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.100
 headlights 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.170
 human eyes are able to defend against 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.560
 the sun 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.259
 well, while squinting , the pupil narrows and 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.350
 reduces the amount of falling on it 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.560
 light is true so eyes get tired quickly 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.619
 start to hurt and watery comes out 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.899
 our cyclist needs not only 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.810
 elbow pads and knee pads but the most 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.770
 main means to prevent 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.780
 dips good sunglasses 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.220
 however ordinary sunglasses with 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.610
 glare can not cope 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.280
 they only darken the image but 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.750
 eyes still dazzle sharp reflected 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.729
 shine 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.520
 so drivers who cares well 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:09.759
 anti-glare recommended 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:14.470
 glasses they can cut off the blinding rays 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.269
 this ability is called polarization 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.100
 reflected light propagates in two 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.560
 directions 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.239
 vertical and horizontal 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.650
 vertical rays carry a useful eye 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.769
 information such as color and contrast and 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.180
 horizontal 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.160
 this is the very glare that prevents us 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.950
 lenses of polarized glasses are not 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.930
 skip glare and through them we see 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.220
 only clear clear picture we decided 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.310
 set up an experiment 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.250
 our task in practice is to prove or 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.910
 refute the action of polarization 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.690
 points behind the wheel we offered to sit down 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.209
 professional racer 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.049
 Yegor at our hero will blind 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.420
 illuminator with a capacity of 12 thousand watts 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.359
 conditions the participant will go to the meeting 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.090
 artificial sun with a speed of 50 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.489
 kilometers per hour in the first test of Egor 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.430
 will go without glasses 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.450
 spotlights mercilessly blinded the eyes of the rays and 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.750
 already bright 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.380
 reflected from the pavement and here 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.500
 dirty trick baby stroller 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.400
 Pros have a pro and a few meters 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.490
 from the stroller 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.380
 Yegor stops his car 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.410
 let's see how much visibility improves 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.410
 ordinary glasses without polarization on the way 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.840
 car rolls out the stroller egor 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.780
 reacts instantly but see what 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.130
 happened in ordinary glasses car 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.010
 stopped even closer to the wheelchair blinding 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:53.140
 the light became smaller but the carriage itself became 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.860
 worse see the last test we ask 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.600
 our hero to wear a polaroid 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.600
 instant reaction stroller 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:09.190
 you look at how far from 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.800
 the stroller stopped our racer muffled 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.250
 all polaroid glare made dangerous 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.920
 the obstacle visible to the driver here's to you 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.260
 for an example of the action of ordinary points they 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.780
 direct sunlight was darkened 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.840
 but can do nothing with highlights and 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.570
 here again the action of polarization 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:33.580
 points but how tamed the glare light 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.190
 the doctor did it first and the length and 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.500
 unknown to the world as an inventor and 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.590
 instant photography and founder 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.640
 polaroid corporations here produce 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.530
 polarizing lenses are almost 80 years old and 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.129
 keep their technology in the strictest 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:54.409
 the secret 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:57.309
 but something we managed to peep the tape 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:05:00.889
 in the reel is the future of lenses for glasses 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:03.919
 internally already protection film polarizer 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.839
 That is, what cuts unnecessary to the eye 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.029
 rays 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:11.179
 look visually in such a standard 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:13.219
 position everything is visible but it is worth crossing 

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:16.879
 two vertical polarizers at an angle 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:22.189
 90 degrees and the whole image completely 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:25.129
 blocked however polaroid lenses are not valuable 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:26.029
 only the brand effect of polarization in 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.459
 ordinary glasses 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:29.689
 often sewn monolithic that is 

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:32.149
 single layer lens 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:34.999
 black plastic with ultraviolet 

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:37.879
 polaroid lens filter unlike them 

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:40.909
 consists of seven laminated ie 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:44.300
 glued together layers each of 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:46.729
 which solves its important task such 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.429
 sandwich of polarizers filters and 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:50.029
 protective layers also makes glasses 

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:53.449
 polaroid 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:54.740
 impact resistant let's check those 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:58.240
 more our hero today already 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.240
 practiced in the fall 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.610
 points like our cyclist 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:09.630
 had a hard time but despite this they 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:12.120
 both safe and sound so that the glasses 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:17.280
 polaroid on all counts received 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:20.340
 great but here is the vehicle 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:28.110
 and you can change to match something 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:31.050
 Well, our wonderful glasses 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:35.720
 of all that is provided here 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:38.280
 very glasses well done correctly says 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.940
 although I would wear these glasses 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.350
 one more function added function 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:47.639
 homing come to the beach 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:50.840
 put the glasses on immediately 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:53.840
 pretty girl is very comfortable and 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.840
 effectively
