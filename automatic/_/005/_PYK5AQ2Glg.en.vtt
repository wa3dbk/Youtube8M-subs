table it's our second final table this

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.490 
table it's our second final table this
season<00:00:16.609> saw<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.210> Barcelona<00:00:19.020> me<00:00:19.140> pretty

far<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.460> one<00:00:21.330> sorry<00:00:21.900> 8.5<00:00:22.590> million<00:00:23.010> chips<00:00:23.689> well

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
far and one sorry 8.5 million chips well

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.080 
far and one sorry 8.5 million chips well
I<00:00:24.869> mean<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.170> can't<00:00:25.490> can't<00:00:26.490> be<00:00:26.550> unhappy<00:00:26.880> about

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
I mean I can't can't be unhappy about

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.300 
I mean I can't can't be unhappy about
that<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.480> mean<00:00:27.869> I'm<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.109> I'm<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.890> chip<00:00:29.070> leader

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
that I mean I'm the I'm the chip leader

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.189 
that I mean I'm the I'm the chip leader
I<00:00:29.429> think<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> average<00:00:30.060> for<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.539> final<00:00:30.869> table

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
I think the average for the final table

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.530 
I think the average for the final table
is<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.859> little<00:00:32.610> maybe<00:00:33.090> four<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> half

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
is like a little maybe four and a half

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.660 
is like a little maybe four and a half
million<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.200> got<00:00:34.380> almost<00:00:34.710> double<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.130> so

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
million I got almost double that so

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.020 
million I got almost double that so
that's<00:00:36.540> obviously<00:00:37.140> very<00:00:37.500> very<00:00:37.950> good<00:00:38.160> I'm<00:00:38.550> just

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
that's obviously very very good I'm just

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.260 
that's obviously very very good I'm just
a<00:00:39.420> little<00:00:39.960> bit<00:00:40.110> unhappy<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.610> really<00:00:41.610> really

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
a little bit unhappy I really really

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.670 
a little bit unhappy I really really
made<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> bad<00:00:43.230> play<00:00:43.530> against<00:00:44.719> Cory<00:00:45.719> seconds
