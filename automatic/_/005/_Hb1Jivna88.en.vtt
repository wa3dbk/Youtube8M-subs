thing<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.499> I've<00:01:25.590> noticed<00:01:25.799> about<00:01:26.039> it<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.840> I've

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
thing that I've noticed about it is I've

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.450 
thing that I've noticed about it is I've
had<00:01:28.170> great<00:01:28.979> workouts<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.149> and<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:31.560> don't

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
had great workouts with it and I don't

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.099

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
know if it's just meat off this rail

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:35.840 
know if it's just meat off this rail
because<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.530> lot<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.009> pre-workout<00:01:35.579> say

the<00:02:47.750> Shelf<00:02:47.960> where<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.350> you<00:02:48.950> purchase<00:02:49.370> it

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
the Shelf where you you purchase it

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.150 
the Shelf where you you purchase it
you're<00:02:50.540> hoping<00:02:50.960> and<00:02:51.140> assuming<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:51.770> is<00:02:51.890> full

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
and it's not my thing is it's not enough

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.210 
and it's not my thing is it's not enough
because<00:02:55.490> you<00:02:55.580> do<00:02:55.790> get<00:02:55.970> 44<00:02:56.480> servings<00:02:57.020> but<00:02:57.230> I

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
because you do get 44 servings but I

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.310
