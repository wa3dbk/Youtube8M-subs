00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.910

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.400
 Today we came to try Marika 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.340
 to catch about an alibi not themselves and here at all 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.779

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.810
 Our same tank there he fact that almost 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.460
 the company flies and flies 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.470
 a thing called a crochet load 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.450
 I have it near the shore for some reason all 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.780

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.540

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.899
 the guide must pay one hundred and fifty dollars 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.260
 but better of course everything is more complicated with 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.360
 shore here but we still smells 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.050

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.740

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.429
 normal fishermen come early 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.110
