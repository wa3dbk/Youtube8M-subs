00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.720 
feel the bottom if you aren't feeling
the<00:00:13.760> bottom<00:00:13.910> you<00:00:14.660> aren't<00:00:14.900> in<00:00:14.990> the<00:00:15.080> fish<00:00:15.289> zone

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
the bottom you aren't in the fish zone

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.340 
the bottom you aren't in the fish zone
so<00:00:16.730> most<00:00:17.000> of<00:00:17.150> the<00:00:17.240> time<00:00:17.480> around<00:00:17.779> here<00:00:18.170> what

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
so most of the time around here what

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.330 
so most of the time around here what
you're<00:00:18.470> going<00:00:18.590> to<00:00:18.619> be<00:00:18.740> looking<00:00:18.980> at<00:00:19.130> is<00:00:19.310> a

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
you're going to be looking at is a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.109 
you're going to be looking at is a
quarter<00:00:19.939> or<00:00:20.420> maybe<00:00:20.600> a<00:00:20.690> 3/8<00:00:21.230> ounce<00:00:21.440> jig<00:00:21.970> you<00:00:22.970> got

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
quarter or maybe a 3/8 ounce jig you got

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.000 
quarter or maybe a 3/8 ounce jig you got
to<00:00:23.240> go<00:00:23.330> a<00:00:23.360> lot<00:00:23.600> heavier<00:00:24.020> than<00:00:24.289> that<00:00:24.350> you're

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
to go a lot heavier than that you're

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.830 
to go a lot heavier than that you're
probably<00:00:25.280> in<00:00:25.610> a<00:00:25.730> little<00:00:25.970> too<00:00:26.119> much<00:00:26.270> current<00:00:26.690> or

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
probably in a little too much current or

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.180 
probably in a little too much current or
you're<00:00:26.960> probably<00:00:27.199> having<00:00:27.680> problems<00:00:28.070> with

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
you're probably having problems with

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.630 
you're probably having problems with
that<00:00:28.310> bolt<00:00:28.580> control<00:00:29.050> so<00:00:30.050> 1/4<00:00:30.590> or<00:00:30.800> 3/8<00:00:31.250> is<00:00:31.460> going

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
that bolt control so 1/4 or 3/8 is going

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.080 
that bolt control so 1/4 or 3/8 is going
to<00:00:31.699> be<00:00:31.820> good<00:00:33.219> the<00:00:34.219> reason<00:00:34.399> we<00:00:34.640> don't<00:00:34.820> want<00:00:35.000> to

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
to be good the reason we don't want to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.329 
to be good the reason we don't want to
go<00:00:35.180> to<00:00:35.239> a<00:00:35.359> real<00:00:35.600> real<00:00:35.809> heavy<00:00:36.079> jig<00:00:36.440> is<00:00:36.649> again

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
go to a real real heavy jig is again

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:38.619 
go to a real real heavy jig is again
because<00:00:37.670> of<00:00:37.789> the<00:00:37.850> way<00:00:37.940> that<00:00:38.089> fish<00:00:38.329> bites

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
because of the way that fish bites

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.200 
because of the way that fish bites
walleyes<00:00:39.589> really<00:00:39.890> don't<00:00:40.069> bite<00:00:40.309> a<00:00:40.339> bait<00:00:40.640> what

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
walleyes really don't bite a bait what

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.509 
walleyes really don't bite a bait what
they<00:00:41.329> do<00:00:41.390> is<00:00:41.600> suck<00:00:41.839> it<00:00:42.019> in<00:00:42.199> so<00:00:43.069> if<00:00:43.159> you're<00:00:43.280> using

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
they do is suck it in so if you're using

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.059 
they do is suck it in so if you're using
a<00:00:43.729> great<00:00:43.999> big<00:00:44.030> jig<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:44.929> they<00:00:45.289> try<00:00:45.530> to<00:00:45.559> suck<00:00:45.920> it

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:46.069 
a great big jig and they try to suck it

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:48.219 
a great big jig and they try to suck it
in<00:00:46.159> their<00:00:46.339> mouth<00:00:46.519> it<00:00:47.149> won't<00:00:47.389> get<00:00:47.629> in<00:00:47.749> there<00:00:47.989> and

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
so maybe your jig was too heavy maybe

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.220 
so maybe your jig was too heavy maybe
you<00:01:13.580> had<00:01:13.760> you<00:01:14.090> know<00:01:14.210> as<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.540> pulled<00:01:14.810> up<00:01:15.020> and

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
you had you know as you pulled up and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.690 
you had you know as you pulled up and
you<00:01:15.290> started<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.680> feel<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.070> fish<00:01:16.280> you<00:01:16.430> put<00:01:16.580> too

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
you started to feel the fish you put too

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.340 
you started to feel the fish you put too
much<00:01:16.730> tension<00:01:17.090> on<00:01:17.420> he<00:01:17.540> just<00:01:17.750> opened<00:01:18.080> his<00:01:18.140> mouth

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
much tension on he just opened his mouth

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.560 
much tension on he just opened his mouth
maybe<00:01:19.040> you<00:01:19.220> got<00:01:19.370> some<00:01:19.580> gas<00:01:19.760> on<00:01:20.060> your<00:01:20.210> hands<00:01:20.390> in

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
maybe you got some gas on your hands in

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.600 
maybe you got some gas on your hands in
the<00:01:20.630> morning<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.200> he<00:01:21.350> tasted<00:01:21.830> that<00:01:21.980> and<00:01:22.550> he

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
the morning and he tasted that and he

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.000 
the morning and he tasted that and he
spits<00:01:22.940> it<00:01:23.120> out<00:01:23.240> light<00:01:23.960> bites<00:01:24.260> a<00:01:24.470> lot<00:01:24.650> of<00:01:24.800> times

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
spits it out light bites a lot of times

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.620 
spits it out light bites a lot of times
are<00:01:25.190> just<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.580> fish<00:01:25.820> not<00:01:26.000> getting<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:26.510> all

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
are just that fish not getting it all

are just that fish not getting it all
the<00:01:26.660> way<00:01:26.870> in<00:01:27.050> we're<00:01:27.500> not<00:01:27.650> holding<00:01:27.920> it<00:01:28.190> long

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
the way in we're not holding it long

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.670 
the way in we're not holding it long
enough<00:01:28.490> for<00:01:28.760> you<00:01:28.850> to<00:01:28.880> set<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.300> hook<00:01:29.530> so<00:01:30.530> by

down on the bottom what happens is when
this<00:01:54.680> jig<00:01:54.950> hits<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.340> bottom<00:01:55.670> it's<00:01:55.820> actually<00:01:56.150> a

this jig hits the bottom it's actually a
stand-up<00:01:56.750> jig<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:57.680> for<00:01:57.950> river<00:01:58.130> fishing

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
stand-up jig and for river fishing

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.450 
stand-up jig and for river fishing
stand-up<00:01:59.210> or<00:01:59.420> semi<00:01:59.720> stand-up<00:02:00.229> jigs<00:02:00.590> or<00:02:00.800> a<00:02:00.890> real

stand-up or semi stand-up jigs or a real

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.550 
stand-up or semi stand-up jigs or a real
good<00:02:01.729> choice<00:02:02.030> because<00:02:02.840> when<00:02:03.170> they<00:02:03.260> hit<00:02:03.409> the

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
good choice because when they hit the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.280 
good choice because when they hit the
bottom<00:02:04.010> that<00:02:04.640> hook<00:02:04.970> will<00:02:05.210> actually<00:02:05.570> be<00:02:05.750> up<00:02:05.960> off

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
bottom that hook will actually be up off

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.380 
bottom that hook will actually be up off
the<00:02:06.530> bottom<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:07.340> it'll<00:02:07.520> be<00:02:07.640> standing<00:02:08.119> upright

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
the bottom and it'll be standing upright

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.290 
the bottom and it'll be standing upright
and<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:09.349> will<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.619> bait<00:02:09.890> I'll<00:02:10.879> think<00:02:11.239> that

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
and so will the bait I'll think that

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.149 
and so will the bait I'll think that
walleyes<00:02:11.750> will<00:02:11.930> do<00:02:12.049> a<00:02:12.079> lot<00:02:12.319> of<00:02:12.349> times<00:02:12.709> is<00:02:13.010> they

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
walleyes will do a lot of times is they

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.920 
walleyes will do a lot of times is they
will<00:02:13.280> actually<00:02:13.370> suck<00:02:13.819> baits<00:02:14.150> off<00:02:14.359> the<00:02:14.540> bottom

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
will actually suck baits off the bottom

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.870 
will actually suck baits off the bottom
so<00:02:15.499> when<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.680> jig<00:02:16.099> down

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
so when you jig down

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.720 
so when you jig down
and<00:02:17.780> go<00:02:17.990> to<00:02:18.050> lift<00:02:18.320> up<00:02:18.560> when<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.070> dig<00:02:19.310> down<00:02:19.490> in

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
and go to lift up when you dig down in

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.220 
and go to lift up when you dig down in
that<00:02:19.850> jig<00:02:20.180> is<00:02:20.300> just<00:02:20.510> sitting<00:02:20.720> on<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.050> bottom

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
that jig is just sitting on the bottom

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.590 
that jig is just sitting on the bottom
they'll<00:02:21.950> suck<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.430> right<00:02:22.580> off<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.820> bottom<00:02:23.180> and

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
they'll suck it right off the bottom and

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.030 
they'll suck it right off the bottom and
when<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:23.810> pick<00:02:24.020> up<00:02:24.170> all<00:02:24.380> you'll<00:02:24.530> feels<00:02:24.800> like<00:02:25.010> a
