job<00:00:25.109> with<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.590> controller<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.750> what<00:00:27.750> I

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
job with this controller and what I

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.439 
job with this controller and what I
wanted<00:00:28.080> them<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.380> do<00:00:28.500> with<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.449> basically

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
before you change anything on the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.860 
before you change anything on the
controller<00:00:32.520> if<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.300> want<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.660> buy<00:00:33.840> it

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
controller if you want to just buy it

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.360 
controller if you want to just buy it
right<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:34.530> how<00:00:34.770> they<00:00:34.920> show<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
right your how they show it on the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.970 
right your how they show it on the
website<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:36.000> says<00:00:36.329> temper<00:00:36.780> right<00:00:36.989> here<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:37.950> I

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
website it says temper right here but I

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.130 
website it says temper right here but I
got<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.370> change<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.969> say<00:00:39.270> scopes<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.020> then<00:00:40.110> I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
got that change to say scopes and then I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.229 
got that change to say scopes and then I
there<00:00:40.620> was<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.860> phase<00:00:41.190> logo<00:00:41.670> right<00:00:41.820> here<00:00:41.850> if<00:00:42.210> you

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
there was a phase logo right here if you

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.869 
there was a phase logo right here if you
go<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.540> website<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.309> go<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.430> controller

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
go to the website and go this controller

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.020 
go to the website and go this controller
you'll<00:00:45.090> see<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.020> had<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.379> taken<00:00:46.410> off

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
you'll see but I had that taken off

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.490 
you'll see but I had that taken off
because<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.870> didn't<00:00:49.079> want<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> phase

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
because I just didn't want the phase

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.619 
because I just didn't want the phase
logo<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.940> controller<00:00:51.300> forward

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
logo and I like the controller forward

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.069 
logo and I like the controller forward
it<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.289> uh<00:00:53.219> yeah<00:00:54.149> there's<00:00:54.390> green<00:00:54.809> thumb

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
it was so uh yeah there's green thumb

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.950 
it was so uh yeah there's green thumb
sticks<00:00:55.410> right<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:56.100> green<00:00:56.460> d-pad<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.090> all

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960

white<00:00:58.590> letter<00:00:59.070> buttons<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.969> like<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.960> they

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
white letter buttons I like that they

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
white letter buttons I like that they
don't<00:01:01.260> say<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> letters<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.309> because

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
don't say the letters on it because

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.670 
don't say the letters on it because
you're<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.660> looking<00:01:03.899> down<00:01:04.290> at<00:01:04.530> them

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
you're not really looking down at them

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.149 
you're not really looking down at them
when<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:06.090> you're<00:01:06.240> playing<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.159> you

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
when you when you're playing so you

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.800 
when you when you're playing so you
don't<00:01:08.340> actually<00:01:08.549> need<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.970> see<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.510> letters

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
don't actually need to see the letters

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.030 
don't actually need to see the letters
if<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.110> learn<00:01:10.350> them<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.930> you<00:01:12.930> see<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.560> top

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
if you learn them and you see the top

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.660 
if you learn them and you see the top
with<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> bumpers<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.350> also<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:17.130> also<00:01:17.520> that

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
with the bumpers is also is also that

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.060 
with the bumpers is also is also that
green<00:01:17.909> color<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.479> then<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.229> triggers<00:01:19.650> are

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
green color and then the triggers are

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.090 
green color and then the triggers are
that<00:01:20.460> green<00:01:20.670> color<00:01:20.850> too<00:01:21.530> but<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> base<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
that green color too but the base of the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.179 
that green color too but the base of the
controller<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:24.090> lightish<00:01:24.750> blue<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
controller is a lightish blue and the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.969 
controller is a lightish blue and the
center<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.729> actually<00:01:27.299> chrome<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:28.860> you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
center is actually chrome I think you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.380 
center is actually chrome I think you
guys<00:01:29.100> will<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.460> able<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.790> pick<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
guys will be able to pick up on the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.910 
guys will be able to pick up on the
difference<00:01:30.750> between<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.380> which<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
difference between this which is a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.490 
difference between this which is a
regular<00:01:32.490> xbox<00:01:32.729> controller<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.200> see<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
regular xbox controller you can see the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.010 
regular xbox controller you can see the
regular<00:01:34.650> gray<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.430> then<00:01:36.090> how<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.570> center<00:01:36.990> of

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
regular gray and then how the center of

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.969 
regular gray and then how the center of
this<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.380> chrome<00:01:38.390> like<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.509> said<00:01:39.720> guys<00:01:39.979> sweet
