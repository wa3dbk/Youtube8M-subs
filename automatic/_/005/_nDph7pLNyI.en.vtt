weren't selected because I think that

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.080 
weren't selected because I think that
they<00:01:55.259> should<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:56.159> congratulated<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.000> how

six<00:02:20.310> weeks<00:02:20.550> if<00:02:20.819> they<00:02:20.940> were<00:02:21.420> weren't<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:21.989> the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
six weeks if they were weren't in the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.740 
six weeks if they were weren't in the
squad<00:02:22.610> even<00:02:23.610> if<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.790> was<00:02:23.910> very<00:02:24.090> bad<00:02:24.330> news<00:02:24.690> for

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
squad even if it was very bad news for

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.780 
squad even if it was very bad news for
the<00:02:25.230> players<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.590> weren't<00:02:25.830> selected<00:02:26.069> they

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
the players that weren't selected they

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.850 
the players that weren't selected they
were<00:02:27.599> telling<00:02:27.989> me<00:02:28.019> that<00:02:28.290> they<00:02:28.380> understood<00:02:28.800> it

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
were telling me that they understood it

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.729 
were telling me that they understood it
was<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.099> difficult<00:02:29.340> decision<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:31.200> then<00:02:31.380> very

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
was a difficult decision and then very

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.440 
was a difficult decision and then very
quickly<00:02:31.950> after<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.489> other<00:02:32.670> maybe<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.239> couple

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
quickly after the other maybe a couple

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.330 
quickly after the other maybe a couple
of<00:02:33.569> days<00:02:33.750> just<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.050> kind<00:02:34.349> of<00:02:34.440> simulate<00:02:35.190> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
of days just to kind of simulate the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.860 
of days just to kind of simulate the
information<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:35.910> they<00:02:36.090> came<00:02:36.360> back<00:02:36.569> wanting

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
information that they came back wanting

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.009 
information that they came back wanting
to<00:02:37.050> know<00:02:37.200> what<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.440> do<00:02:37.590> next<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:39.269> for<00:02:39.780> some<00:02:39.900> of

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
to know what to do next and for some of

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.420 
to know what to do next and for some of
them<00:02:40.170> some<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.590> them<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.890> they<00:02:41.130> still<00:02:41.310> might

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
them some of them is they still might

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.680 
them some of them is they still might
have<00:02:41.549> an<00:02:41.640> opportunity<00:02:41.850> for<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.360> Olympics

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
have an opportunity for the Olympics

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.809 
have an opportunity for the Olympics
because<00:02:42.840> hockey<00:02:43.500> does<00:02:43.709> have<00:02:43.950> injury<00:02:44.610> problems

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
because hockey does have injury problems

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.449 
because hockey does have injury problems
inherent<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.480> our<00:02:45.569> game<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:47.010> they've<00:02:47.280> got<00:02:47.430> a

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
inherent in our game and they've got a

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.710 
inherent in our game and they've got a
chance<00:02:47.760> for<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.120> they<00:02:48.150> understand<00:02:48.540> that

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
chance for that and they understand that

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.240 
chance for that and they understand that
but<00:02:48.870> also<00:02:48.989> there's<00:02:49.319> there's<00:02:49.769> other<00:02:50.130> things

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
but also there's there's other things

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.009 
but also there's there's other things
for<00:02:50.580> them<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:50.850> hockey<00:02:51.330> or<00:02:51.510> for<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.810> rest<00:02:51.989> of

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
for them in hockey or for the rest of

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.229 
for them in hockey or for the rest of
their<00:02:52.140> life<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.620> hope<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:53.730> way<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.120> we

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
their life and I hope the way that we

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.720 
their life and I hope the way that we
operate<00:02:54.390> as<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.750> group<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.730> exemplified

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
operate as a group of this exemplified

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.910 
operate as a group of this exemplified
by<00:02:56.760> all<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.480> our<00:02:57.720> 27<00:02:58.350> really<00:02:58.620> will<00:02:58.739> progress

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
by all of our 27 really will progress

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.000 
by all of our 27 really will progress
them<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.370> their<00:02:59.489> lives<00:03:00.319> we<00:03:01.319> had<00:03:01.799> a<00:03:01.830> lot<00:03:01.980> of

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
them in their lives we had a lot of

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.470 
them in their lives we had a lot of
injury<00:03:02.280> trouble<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.700> last<00:03:02.880> sort<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.239> six

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
injury trouble the last sort of six

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.940 
injury trouble the last sort of six
weeks<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:03.959> we've<00:03:04.140> instead<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.650> having<00:03:04.799> an

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
weeks so we've instead of having an

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.650 
weeks so we've instead of having an
election<00:03:05.160> announcement<00:03:06.060> internally<00:03:06.540> we've

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
election announcement internally we've

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.089 
election announcement internally we've
kind<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.930> drip<00:03:07.110> fed<00:03:07.290> information<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.980> the

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
kind of drip fed information to the

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.220 
kind of drip fed information to the
players<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:09.299> it's<00:03:09.420> been<00:03:09.569> emotionally

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
players so it's been emotionally

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.720 
players so it's been emotionally
challenging<00:03:10.709> for<00:03:11.100> those<00:03:11.250> who<00:03:11.489> haven't

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
challenging for those who haven't

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.729 
challenging for those who haven't
thought<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.420> haven't<00:03:12.720> gotten<00:03:12.959> in<00:03:13.109> because

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
thought you haven't gotten in because

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.310 
thought you haven't gotten in because
they've<00:03:14.070> had<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.250> difference<00:03:14.730> x<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.840> y

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
they've had a difference x and y

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.840 
they've had a difference x and y
consequence<00:03:16.890> they<00:03:17.040> can<00:03:17.220> kind<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.489> figure<00:03:17.640> out

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
consequence they can kind of figure out

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.420 
consequence they can kind of figure out
where<00:03:18.000> they<00:03:18.150> SAT<00:03:18.859> but<00:03:19.859> you<00:03:20.010> know<00:03:20.100> this<00:03:20.250> week

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
where they SAT but you know this week

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.710 
where they SAT but you know this week
we've<00:03:20.579> been<00:03:20.609> training<00:03:20.970> everybody<00:03:21.390> knew<00:03:21.540> their

we've been training everybody knew their
situation<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.560> then<00:03:22.769> there<00:03:22.920> was<00:03:23.010> real<00:03:23.250> kind

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
situation and then there was real kind

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.729 
situation and then there was real kind
of<00:03:23.790> togetherness<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:25.200> felt<00:03:25.410> like<00:03:25.560> there's

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
of togetherness and it felt like there's

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.500 
of togetherness and it felt like there's
real<00:03:25.920> force<00:03:26.220> behind<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.790> team<00:03:27.000> doing<00:03:27.239> what<00:03:27.420> at
