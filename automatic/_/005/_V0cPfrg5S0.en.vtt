00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.710
 Slowly it gets serious with the autumn 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.250
 every now and then if you look out 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.690
 it is getting grayer tristan nasa around there 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.850
 Do not get into a bad mood 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.859
 helps everything before all things 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.449
 many colorful colors either in the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.789
 flat or outside in bed or 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.279
 on the balcony for example with whole 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.480
 great colorful autumn flowers and this 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.610
 I'm standing here now where we were wearing 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.570
 yard with the floristry experts of the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.670
 andrea riemer 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.219
 you have a very colorful selection here 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.870
 I brought habs grad gewerkt in 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.489
 bed and in the balcony box that goes 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.200
 actually in autumn or leaves 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.300
 actually also in the autumn mainly 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.739
 old with asters and chrysanthemums what 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.840
 today our topic is because that is really 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.850
 autumn plants are also up in the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.260
 november rain still flourish the relative 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.760
 are insensitive if you have a few 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.110
 followed and then came 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.789
 really let stand until winter 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.190
 and I can actually do that now 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.870
 In the middle of autumn, it still looks easy 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.559
 purely in the earth with the seeds or how 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.940
 does it work 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.920
 He is already as a plant are all 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.960
 preferred over several years preferred 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.790
 and it is now up plants from 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.650
 You should note that despite everything 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.790
 get some sunny cookies 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.770
 that he is not too wet 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.270
 jam moisture they may not all only 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.040
 on kristan themes so the ground should 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.619
 be translucent that it really is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.270
 just not getting too wet when she is three 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.130
 blooming four hours of sunshine in the day 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.869
 so until november through there 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.330
 actually one time at 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.790
 when it is too late to suspend or 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.560
 Can I do that from now to the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.579
 Winter rows always make him should 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.229
 so already wander this now 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.970
 time that one really says 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.009
 september are the last or is the last 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.509
 last time where is planted if 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.740
 I do not want to plant anymore 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.000
 actually sometimes quite useful 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.479
 is that you say you wait until the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.380
 spring then sets it out then then 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.759
 you should hibernate this 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.320
 for a garage is high 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.020
 window inside is to like it actually 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.250
 likes to keep cool 8 degrees is perfect can 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.570
 it can also be the winter garden 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.799
 easily be the staircase 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.210
 we're doing that we too 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.920
 plant the baskets or in 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.299
 planting the first frost comes 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.740
 you can just pick them over 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.149
 winter indoors and plant in the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.000
 spring as soon as the deadlines are over 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.110

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.060
 The whole summer have the 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.350
 plant time to root vigorously 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.000
 become and then bloom again in autumn 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.080
 in all its glory 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.580
 that's what it looks like 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.200

 There are different varieties there 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.040
 any good in the wet, it is not 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.540
 quite so much that it's basically the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.400
 selection we have here that's just 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.840
 These strong colors are there

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.330
 differ from each other 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.590
 it is actually more of the bloom 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.270
 how they differ from each other 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.130

 that's a whole lot in what makes 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.820
 because these flowers are special 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.350
 It makes a special difference when 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.900

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.690

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.489
 in the beet then cut in and always 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.769
 Fresh water is exactly in the water 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.090
 cut double it as cut flowers in 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.530

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.440
 scary long you can dry it 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.180
 cut flowers are some fresh flowers 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.070

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.239
 small scarecrow with pure and beautiful 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.690
 you have a bit of autumnal mood in it 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.579
 the apartment 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.959
 otherwise there are the tips and tricks 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.280
 I have to pay attention to this out there 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.420
 is above all things the pitch or 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.600
 There's something else I know 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.890
 It should be in the reason you should in the 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.900
 winter so planted before the inter 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.160
 it really is really important to do that 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.690
 note that he was doing something 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.489
 it is protected in a bucket 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.110
 they should just stand at the 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.129
 house wall to be attracted a bit 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.230
 to protect her a bit 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.780
 you really get in the beet 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.180
 It's really important for the winter 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.860
 when the first frost slowly approaches 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.780
 Cover a bit with foliage cover 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.610
 a bit traveling around that helps 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.140
 ever important would be synonymous with the 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.610
 last bloom so if really 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.960
 buds are not blooming 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.700
 cut out what you actually so 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.320
 always makes this easy to let in there 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.610
 they withered out that it was a self-protection 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.900
 the plant and then helps too 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.670
 wonderful to come over the winter 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.290
 that is , they survive on the 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.210
 winter and can be in the next year 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.260
 flourish again how it is flourishing 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.240
 actually only one autumn plant 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.560
 which blooms again in autumn and holds 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.670
 how many years if that once 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.590
 then survived the winter 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.210
 if she has a good location 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.160
 many years of it joy yes 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.840
