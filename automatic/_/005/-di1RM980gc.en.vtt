00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.240
 he 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.680
 this is the moment it's your turn 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.450
 France and I noticed that every 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.369
 runners he was wearing a bah helmet yeah 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.140
 but it's for not shown that actually 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.580
 they use all this in the urine of 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.840
 jalabert they managed to prove he 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.739
 had doped during the tour de France 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.439
 98 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.450
 but how did he do to restrain himself 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.649
 since so long 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.559
 well if science she did as many 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.739
 progress I would like to control the 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.790
 urine of phileas fogg because me 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.370
 I would like to know how he did 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.530
 Around the world in 80 days 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.030
 it's not so bad when he wins a 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.210
 step the cyclists they take the 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.320
 champagne like that and throws it 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.940
 yeah that's normal they throw it because 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.269
 that they are already taking drugs 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.999
 so in addition if they drink knows it takes 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.050
 absolutely avoid blends launches 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:03.280
 armstrong he said it was 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.030
 impossible to win the tour de france 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.080
 without getting dope 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.480
 but superman he doped himself and he did 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.830
 never won tour de france 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.240
 the consequences of doping 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.689
 dramatic superman for example he is 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.689
 become quadriplegic 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.649
 there they will open a shoot room at 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.500
 paris and ben well here everyone 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.570
 will make doped velib now launches 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.960
 armstrong he had cancer and he has 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.420
 defeated 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.000
 yeah but what was not doped for 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.590
 do that sometimes in the steps the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.200
 runners they are running against the 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.759
 watch it's good already they're 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.829
 doped in addition he runs against a watch 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.479
 it's going everyone wins against watch 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.079
 one month I put the watch I leave in 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.759
 current it's me who wins the round of 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.530
 france if it was done in germany bah 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.820
 it would be a lot faster because 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.520
 there on the left lane has no 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.600
 speed limit but I'm con 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.890
 and the iron curtain 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.890
 a lease could not pass
