00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.290 
take this into too long but um yeah I
think<00:05:24.190> that's<00:05:24.580> as<00:05:24.700> far<00:05:24.820> just<00:05:25.000> because<00:05:25.150> I

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
think that's as far just because I

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.680 
think that's as far just because I
merged<00:05:25.720> it<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:26.830> want<00:05:27.040> to<00:05:27.130> get<00:05:27.310> your<00:05:28.090> name<00:05:28.120> and

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
merged it you want to get your name and

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.770 
merged it you want to get your name and
your<00:05:28.950> initial<00:05:30.270> exactly<00:05:31.270> where<00:05:31.420> you<00:05:31.510> want<00:05:31.690> it

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
your initial exactly where you want it

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.510 
your initial exactly where you want it
before<00:05:31.960> you<00:05:32.320> merge<00:05:32.590> everything<00:05:32.860> once<00:05:33.400> you

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
before you merge everything once you

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.020 
before you merge everything once you
merge<00:05:33.700> everything<00:05:33.970> there's<00:05:34.450> no<00:05:34.690> moving<00:05:34.960> it

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
merge everything there's no moving it

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.400 
merge everything there's no moving it
unless<00:05:37.030> you<00:05:37.180> go<00:05:37.330> through<00:05:37.570> an<00:05:37.660> extra<00:05:37.990> process

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
unless you go through an extra process

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.590 
unless you go through an extra process
which<00:05:38.650> is<00:05:38.830> a<00:05:38.860> little<00:05:39.190> lengthy<00:05:39.610> but<00:05:40.120> that<00:05:40.360> is

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
which is a little lengthy but that is

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.700 
which is a little lengthy but that is
actually<00:05:40.810> your<00:05:41.470> monogram<00:05:42.900> tag<00:05:43.900> right<00:05:44.440> there

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
and you can print that out to whatever

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.820 
and you can print that out to whatever
size<00:05:46.690> you<00:05:46.960> choose<00:05:47.520> and<00:05:48.520> you<00:05:49.320> cannot<00:05:50.320> mount<00:05:50.590> it
