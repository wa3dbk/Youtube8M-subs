00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
with a major concert event on a college

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.950 
with a major concert event on a college
campus<00:00:10.440> as<00:00:11.040> we<00:00:11.849> follow<00:00:12.090> along<00:00:12.389> with<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.719> video

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.930 
campus as we follow along with the video
you're<00:00:13.230> about<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.440> see<00:00:13.620> you'll<00:00:14.460> see<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.759> this

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
you're about to see you'll see that this

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.760 
you're about to see you'll see that this
concert<00:00:15.389> was<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> fairly<00:00:15.870> massive<00:00:16.139> venture

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
concert was a fairly massive venture

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.620 
concert was a fairly massive venture
that<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.190> typical<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:18.029> most<00:00:18.180> college

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
that is a typical of most college

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.050 
that is a typical of most college
concerts<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.920> key<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.220> remember<00:00:20.640> though<00:00:20.820> is

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
concerts the key to remember though is

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.849 
concerts the key to remember though is
that<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.390> premise<00:00:21.779> for<00:00:21.810> all<00:00:22.080> concerts<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.710> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
that the premise for all concerts is the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.130 
that the premise for all concerts is the
same<00:00:23.210> producing<00:00:24.210> them<00:00:24.330> as<00:00:24.480> time<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.900> labor

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
same producing them as time and labor

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140 
same producing them as time and labor
intensive<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.580> something<00:00:27.119> that

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
intensive and it's not something that

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.089 
intensive and it's not something that
one<00:00:27.390> or<00:00:27.539> two<00:00:27.570> people<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.019> do<00:00:28.320> themselves<00:00:28.529> and

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
one or two people can do themselves and

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.349 
one or two people can do themselves and
be<00:00:29.490> successful

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
be successful

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.459 
be successful
not<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.869> mention<00:00:31.080> stay<00:00:31.769> sane<00:00:33.290> so<00:00:34.290> we're<00:00:34.380> gonna

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
not to mention stay sane so we're gonna

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.130 
not to mention stay sane so we're gonna
watch<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.890> video<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.670> Kanye<00:00:36.149> West<00:00:36.180> show<00:00:36.930> we

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
watch this video of a Kanye West show we

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.590 
watch this video of a Kanye West show we
did<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> few<00:00:37.590> years<00:00:37.649> ago<00:00:38.149> it's<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.239> much<00:00:39.390> bigger

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
did a few years ago it's a much bigger

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.040 
did a few years ago it's a much bigger
show<00:00:39.960> than<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.800> lot<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.340> schools<00:00:41.610> do<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.210> again

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
show than a lot of schools do but again

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.690 
show than a lot of schools do but again
this<00:00:43.290> all<00:00:43.469> works<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.890> scale<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> good

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
this all works to scale so it's a good

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.700 
this all works to scale so it's a good
example

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
example

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.380 
example
Loden<00:00:46.710> usually<00:00:47.129> begins<00:00:47.550> either<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.210> night

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
Loden usually begins either the night

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.950 
Loden usually begins either the night
before<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.899> show<00:00:49.110> or<00:00:49.379> early<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.039> morning<00:00:50.070> of

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
before the show or early the morning of

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.360 
before the show or early the morning of
and<00:00:51.960> often<00:00:52.230> times<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> first<00:00:52.710> step<00:00:53.160> is

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
and often times the first step is

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.220 
and often times the first step is
covering<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.120> floor<00:00:54.270> especially<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:55.079> you're

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
covering the floor especially if you're

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.490 
covering the floor especially if you're
in<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.410> gym<00:00:55.820> grounds<00:00:56.820> crew<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.500> operations

in a gym grounds crew or operations

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.770 
in a gym grounds crew or operations
people<00:00:58.829> will<00:00:58.949> want<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.250> cover<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.670> floor<00:00:59.940> in

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
people will want to cover the floor in

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900 
people will want to cover the floor in
this<00:01:00.989> instance<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.770> two-tier<00:01:02.280> covering

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
this instance it's a two-tier covering

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.600 
this instance it's a two-tier covering
you<00:01:03.390> see<00:01:03.600> there's<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> tarp<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.979> down<00:01:05.189> first

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
you see there's a tarp going down first

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.359 
you see there's a tarp going down first
and<00:01:05.970> then<00:01:06.350> they<00:01:07.350> put<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> layer<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:08.040> plywood

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
and then they put a layer of plywood

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.870 
and then they put a layer of plywood
over<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.600> floor<00:01:09.930> they<00:01:10.740> use<00:01:10.979> multiple<00:01:11.250> crews

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
over the floor they use multiple crews

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.270 
over the floor they use multiple crews
to<00:01:12.299> cover<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> floor<00:01:12.930> which<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.770> important<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
to cover the floor which is important to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.370 
to cover the floor which is important to
note<00:01:14.520> since<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.119> lessens<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> strain<00:01:16.049> on

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
note since this lessens the strain on

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.080 
note since this lessens the strain on
any<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.729> group<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.950> theme<00:01:20.549> that

concert production process the more
people<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.439> hand<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.759> easier<00:01:27.119> it

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
people you have on hand the easier it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.899 
people you have on hand the easier it
will<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.900> complete<00:01:28.560> load<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.579> complete

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.380 

you<00:01:34.590> see<00:01:34.800> they<00:01:34.980> start<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.670> build<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.090> stage

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you see they start to build the stage

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.890 
you see they start to build the stage
here<00:01:37.010> most<00:01:38.010> stages<00:01:38.580> are<00:01:38.790> built<00:01:39.090> directly<00:01:39.450> on

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
here most stages are built directly on

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.770 
here most stages are built directly on
the<00:01:40.080> location<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.010> will<00:01:41.130> stay<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.780> other

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the location that it will stay in other

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.150 
the location that it will stay in other
words<00:01:43.020> they're<00:01:43.290> gonna<00:01:43.440> build<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.890> stage

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
words they're gonna build the stage

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.280 
words they're gonna build the stage
where<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.670> stage<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:44.910> supposed<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.780> in

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
where the stage is supposed to be in

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.370 
where the stage is supposed to be in
this<00:01:47.280> case<00:01:47.550> the<00:01:48.270> artist<00:01:48.630> provided<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.140> stage

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
this case the artist provided the stage

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.200 
this case the artist provided the stage
and<00:01:49.620> it<00:01:49.710> was<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.830> moving<00:01:50.100> stage<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.820> they<00:01:50.940> built

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and it was a moving stage so they built

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.390

there are two points on the beam that

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.410 
there are two points on the beam that
they<00:02:37.290> use<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.770> create<00:02:38.070> one<00:02:38.459> point<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:39.000> hang<00:02:39.209> and

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
they use to create one point to hang and

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.890 
they use to create one point to hang and
this<00:02:39.540> distributes<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.590> weight<00:02:40.910> between<00:02:41.910> two
