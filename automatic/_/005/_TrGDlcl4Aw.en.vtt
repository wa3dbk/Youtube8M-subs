on a steep road if your handbrake fails
the<00:00:35.420> cars<00:00:35.690> going<00:00:35.930> to<00:00:35.989> roll<00:00:36.230> forwards<00:00:36.710> so<00:00:37.400> if

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
the cars going to roll forwards so if

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.280 
the cars going to roll forwards so if
you<00:00:37.820> turn<00:00:38.090> your<00:00:38.270> wheels<00:00:38.480> towards<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.050> curb

the car will hit the curb and then

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.729 
the car will hit the curb and then
hopefully<00:00:42.800> will<00:00:42.980> stop<00:00:43.480> so<00:00:44.480> a<00:00:44.660> is<00:00:44.989> one<00:00:45.379> correct

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
car on the left-hand side of the road so

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.390 
car on the left-hand side of the road so
the<00:02:44.580> answer<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:44.940> C

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.640 

how<00:02:49.909> close<00:02:50.239> can<00:02:50.269> you<00:02:50.480> park<00:02:50.780> your

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
how close can you park your

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.380 
how close can you park your
section<00:02:52.099> where<00:02:52.310> no<00:02:52.489> broken<00:02:52.790> yellow<00:02:53.150> lines

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
section where no broken yellow lines

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.470 
section where no broken yellow lines
have<00:02:53.599> been<00:02:53.720> marked

have been marked

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.380 
have been marked
so<00:02:55.629> here<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:55.959> six<00:02:56.260> meters<00:02:56.610> six<00:02:57.610> meters<00:02:57.700> gives

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
so here is six meters six meters gives

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.660 
so here is six meters six meters gives

it's a one-way street so the answer here
is<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:45.280> now<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.340> exception<00:03:46.850> would<00:03:47.150> be<00:03:47.209> if<00:03:48.200> there

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
is a now the exception would be if there

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.670 
is a now the exception would be if there
