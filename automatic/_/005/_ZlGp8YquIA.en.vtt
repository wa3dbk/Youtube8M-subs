00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.829
 shit 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.139
 very well now we can continue with today's topic 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:15.969
 what is the anime 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:20.489
 first thing first let's contradict all those nonsense that I went through the 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:20.989
 ass 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.579
 of those who say that 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.979
 the statewide anime has subliminal messages 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.060
 the avilés by 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.109
 if you watch the anime the devil is going to grant you 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:31.950
 fuck 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.579
 shit and more shit 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.589
 I shit on all those bastards 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:41.089
 Well you have to be very asshole to think that because there are worse things than 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:45.529
 see how the gringo drawings like south park that say rudeness and their movies 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:46.849
 gore with hostel 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.849
 that should be controlled and not in the cloud 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.379
 i agree with you 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.499
 but you know how people are 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:03:00.269
 some are old and closed-minded something new arrives and they do not like it just 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.289
 Because they do not like 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:05.469
 and others just want to make the anime a bad name 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:09.799
 to be able to promote their religion by making it look like something evil or 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.849
 satanic to anime 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.299
 hughes fuck because I do nothing bad watching me not me 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:21.209
 I also there are many who say that series like dragon wolf zeta are 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.239
 satanic and that incite violence and perversion in young people 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.670
 pure shit I've seen anime since I can remember 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.370
 and never in fucking life has made me do things like that. 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.370
 sense of honor and decency that you can not imagine 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.829
 That people are so pendeja x I equal one thing is in tahir and another in chone in 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.309
 Closed-minded people think it's the same 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:50.529
 that people so pendeja x if it is just 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:55.079
 I remember watching anime on my pc and a friend of my mom told me in the 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:55.869
 ear 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.289
 enough of that 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:58.529
 that mattered to me 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:03.059
 as you have no idea it is more he told me as if I were in Bardas to pay attention to him 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:08.069
 for just telling me that and then I started arguing with her until she left but 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.790
 she kept saying that this is what makes children violent 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.900
 and other shit 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.950
 piece of whore if you were smart you would know that 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.229
 Japan is a first world country and has the index of 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.479
 criminality 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.210
 under the whole world and that's where it comes from that your payroll like 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.810
 violent and perverted to see what you have to say about it now 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.810
 it is also possible that some animes have adult content on occasion 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.840
 but that is a matter of genres 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.770
 and animes acts for teenagers and others that are suitable for children 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.220
 but actually more than blood 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.940
 the bad words or the macabre and tenebrous things that our elders can 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.640
 find in unanimous to criticize it lose sight of the most important thing that 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.800
 are the values ​​that teach such series each series of anime has its 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.680
 own kind of personal value 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.680
 that teaching your audience is not true and chih 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.699
 very true it is better not to make false accusations 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.530
 remember the anime is good for the mind 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.780
 and has many values ​​to teach the children 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.789
 in dragon goal you learn self-improvement 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.750
 and to try your best 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.710
 to overcome your limitations 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.180
 the same with bleach and naruto in the knights of the zodiac you learn about 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.960
 the value of friendship and of life for the cause that they consider fair and 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.460
 never give up 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.700
 and also do not get obsessed with a series be anime fans and not fanboys 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:39.780
 biendicho and chih and since we played that theme 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.199
 I must confess that I also had my past as a fan dragon balls gol 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.220
 but then I started to explore the huge diversity of stories 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.259
 to which I was closing 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.809
 but well that does not matter anymore 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:57.669
 well now yes we ran out of time and it's time to go once again 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.859
 I thank you for this time you dedicate to this lychee 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:04.539
 you're welcome and the animal alive ica 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:05.789

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.080
 olga lillo that 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.860
 I do not have to say lines in this video, what am I going to do the rest of the money 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.369

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:30.749
