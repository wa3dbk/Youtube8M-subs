them warm extra blood flows to the nose

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.020 
them warm extra blood flows to the nose
giving<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.290> reddish<00:01:31.770> glow<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.880> it

males have this as well but also
consider<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.700> may<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> little

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
consider this and it may get a little

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.859 
consider this and it may get a little

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
weird fruit off wasn't a girl the only

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.830 
weird fruit off wasn't a girl the only
other<00:01:43.049> possible<00:01:43.649> outcome<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.509> he<00:01:45.659> was

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
other possible outcome is that he was

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.240 
other possible outcome is that he was
eunuch

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
eunuch

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.490 
eunuch
yep<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:49.640> heard<00:01:49.850> me<00:01:50.030> right<00:01:50.060> Rangers<00:01:51.020> can

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
yep you heard me right Rangers can

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.400 
yep you heard me right Rangers can
become<00:01:51.980> eunuch<00:01:52.490> all<00:01:53.090> of<00:01:53.360> this<00:01:53.510> is<00:01:53.750> really<00:01:54.170> cool

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
become eunuch all of this is really cool

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.620 
become eunuch all of this is really cool
and<00:01:54.800> a<00:01:55.700> little<00:01:56.000> gross

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
and a little gross

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.630 
and a little gross
this<00:01:57.230> theory<00:01:57.470> makes<00:01:57.770> quite<00:01:58.010> a<00:01:58.070> lot<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.310> sense

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
this theory makes quite a lot of sense
