pretending to be girls

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.570 
pretending to be girls
this<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.200> blackouts<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.830> fashion<00:00:14.190> reviews

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
this is blackouts and fashion reviews

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.550 
this is blackouts and fashion reviews
with<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.820> review<00:00:15.240> on<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.690> dual<00:00:15.839> Uzis<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
with the review on the dual Uzis in the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.730 
with the review on the dual Uzis in the
game<00:00:16.710> crossfire<00:00:17.390> now<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.779> really<00:00:19.410> like<00:00:19.560> these

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
game crossfire now I really like these

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.500 
game crossfire now I really like these
guns<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.310> think<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:20.699> one<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.029> best<00:00:21.240> guns

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
guns I think it's one of the best guns

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.480 
guns I think it's one of the best guns
that<00:00:21.750> crossfire<00:00:22.289> has<00:00:22.769> added<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> last

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
that crossfire has added in the last

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.370 
that crossfire has added in the last
couple<00:00:23.730> patches<00:00:24.029> not<00:00:24.630> because<00:00:25.170> they

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
couple patches not because they

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.470 
couple patches not because they
outperform<00:00:26.160> every<00:00:26.460> other<00:00:26.550> gun<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:27.269> because

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
outperform every other gun just because

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.210 
outperform every other gun just because
they're<00:00:27.660> freaking<00:00:28.349> amazing<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.010> they<00:00:29.130> are

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
they're freaking amazing and they are

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.120 
they're freaking amazing and they are
pretty<00:00:29.490> good<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.910> by<00:00:30.750> amazing<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.289> mean<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.679> love

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
pretty good and by amazing I mean I love

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.880 
pretty good and by amazing I mean I love
them<00:00:32.309> anyways<00:00:33.180> power<00:00:33.750> power<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.800> obviously

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
them anyways power power is obviously

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.290 
them anyways power power is obviously
not<00:00:35.370> gonna<00:00:35.520> be<00:00:35.730> too<00:00:35.880> good

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
not gonna be too good

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.030 
not gonna be too good
it's<00:00:36.450> an<00:00:36.600> Uzi<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.200> can't<00:00:37.440> do<00:00:37.559> much<00:00:37.710> about<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
it's an Uzi you can't do much about it

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.979 
it's an Uzi you can't do much about it
but<00:00:38.520> there's<00:00:38.969> two<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.210> them<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.600> they<00:00:39.930> shoot

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
but there's two of them and they shoot

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.799 
but there's two of them and they shoot
have<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.860> fast<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:42.030> means<00:00:42.300> people<00:00:42.690> are

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
have the fast that means people are

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.290 
have the fast that means people are
gonna<00:00:42.930> die<00:00:43.140> pretty<00:00:43.350> quick<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:44.280> about<00:00:44.489> twenty

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
gonna die pretty quick it's about twenty

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.190 
gonna die pretty quick it's about twenty
damage<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.140> each<00:00:46.579> body<00:00:47.579> shots<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.270> five<00:00:48.899> shots

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
damage for each body shots so five shots

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.490 
damage for each body shots so five shots
and<00:00:49.760> two<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.879> them<00:00:51.059> with<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.899> firing<00:00:52.170> rate

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
and two of them with that firing rate

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.410 
and two of them with that firing rate
people<00:00:53.160> are<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.760> down<00:00:53.910> pretty<00:00:54.120> quick<00:00:54.890> now

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
people are going down pretty quick now

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.479 
people are going down pretty quick now
the<00:00:57.420> accuracy<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.170> these<00:00:58.469> are<00:00:58.739> actually<00:00:59.129> way

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the accuracy on these are actually way

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.000 
the accuracy on these are actually way
higher<00:00:59.850> than<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.270> expected<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.170> normal<00:01:01.469> easy<00:01:01.649> I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
higher than I expected the normal easy I

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.429 
higher than I expected the normal easy I
hated<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.609> can't<00:01:02.969> use<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.359> obviously<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:04.199> fun

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
hated it can't use it obviously it's fun

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.410 
hated it can't use it obviously it's fun
to<00:01:04.559> run<00:01:04.680> around<00:01:04.860> screw<00:01:05.729> around<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:06.030> people

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
to run around screw around with people

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.690 
to run around screw around with people
but<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:07.080> not<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> practical<00:01:07.890> weapon<00:01:08.010> these

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
but it's not a practical weapon these

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.640 
but it's not a practical weapon these
things<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.630> shoot<00:01:10.110> from<00:01:10.380> halfway

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
things you can like shoot from halfway

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.070 
things you can like shoot from halfway
across<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.220> map<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:12.090> three<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:12.720> four<00:01:12.900> shots

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
across the map just three or four shots

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.080 
across the map just three or four shots
bursting<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.890> you're<00:01:14.580> gonna<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:14.909> your

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
bursting and you're gonna get your

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.249 
bursting and you're gonna get your
people<00:01:15.409> I<00:01:17.180> not<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> hundred<00:01:18.689> percent<00:01:18.869> sure

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
people I not a hundred percent sure

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.050 
people I not a hundred percent sure
whether<00:01:19.619> or<00:01:19.799> not<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.460> hit<00:01:20.670> headshot

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
whether or not it's a one hit headshot

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.580 
whether or not it's a one hit headshot
but<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.540> think<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:21.900> gonna<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.200> pretty<00:01:22.350> close

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
but I think it's gonna be pretty close

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.789 
but I think it's gonna be pretty close
like<00:01:22.979> eighty<00:01:23.250> or<00:01:23.430> ninety<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:25.380> know<00:01:25.500> if

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
like eighty or ninety so you know if

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.530 
like eighty or ninety so you know if
you're<00:01:26.159> taking<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.520> three<00:01:26.820> round<00:01:27.000> burst<00:01:27.330> you

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
you're taking a three round burst you

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.940 
you're taking a three round burst you
just<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.990> hit<00:01:28.200> them<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.409> one<00:01:28.770> other

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
just have to hit them with one other

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.950 
just have to hit them with one other
bullet<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.579> gonna<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.939> pretty<00:01:30.299> easy<00:01:30.450> with

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
bullet it's gonna be pretty easy with

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.190 
bullet it's gonna be pretty easy with
dual<00:01:31.530> Uzis<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:33.060> firing<00:01:33.360> rate<00:01:33.540> obviously<00:01:34.079> is

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
dual Uzis the firing rate obviously is

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.469 
dual Uzis the firing rate obviously is
gonna<00:01:34.409> be<00:01:34.560> amazing<00:01:34.799> because<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.640> goosies

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
gonna be amazing because it's goosies

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.560 
gonna be amazing because it's goosies
again<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.890> reload<00:01:38.280> rate<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.759> gonna<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.540> a

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
again and the reload rate is gonna be a

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.179 
again and the reload rate is gonna be a
little<00:01:39.869> bit<00:01:39.990> slower<00:01:40.229> because<00:01:40.470> there's<00:01:40.890> two<00:01:41.040> of

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
little bit slower because there's two of

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.280 
little bit slower because there's two of
them<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> sacrifice<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.990> make

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
them it's the sacrifice that you make

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.850 
them it's the sacrifice that you make
when<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.649> want<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.430> dual<00:01:45.030> weapon<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:46.590> think

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
when you want a dual weapon and I think

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.920 
when you want a dual weapon and I think
it's<00:01:47.009> pretty<00:01:47.220> fair<00:01:47.399> for<00:01:47.610> these<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.240> think<00:01:48.509> that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
it's pretty fair for these I think that

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.190 
it's pretty fair for these I think that
for<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.430> fault<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.450> reload<00:01:51.780> rate<00:01:51.990> there

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
for the fault of the reload rate there

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.569 
for the fault of the reload rate there
is<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.350> lot<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.740> positives<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.310> could

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
is a lot of positives that could

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.389 
is a lot of positives that could
reinforced<00:01:54.090> again<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.560> thought<00:01:56.189> those

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
reinforced again so I thought those

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.670 
reinforced again so I thought those
these<00:01:56.820> guns<00:01:57.119> actually<00:01:57.329> looked<00:01:57.810> pretty<00:01:57.899> cool

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
