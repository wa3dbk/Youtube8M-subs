one<00:01:26.050> more<00:01:26.290> over<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:26.950> edge<00:01:27.070> again<00:01:27.490> I<00:01:27.700> mean<00:01:28.150> this

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
one more over the edge again I mean this

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.680 
one more over the edge again I mean this
a<00:01:28.840> 2x2<00:01:29.380> square<00:01:29.980> and<00:01:30.370> that<00:01:30.820> is<00:01:30.880> just<00:01:31.330> gonna<00:01:31.480> be

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
a 2x2 square and that is just gonna be

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.219 
a 2x2 square and that is just gonna be
acting<00:01:32.200> as<00:01:32.380> like<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:33.040> actual<00:01:33.720> fin<00:01:34.720> for<00:01:35.110> this

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
acting as like the actual fin for this

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.760 
acting as like the actual fin for this
model<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.450> then<00:01:37.600> what<00:01:37.840> we<00:01:37.990> can<00:01:38.140> then<00:01:38.350> do<00:01:38.530> is

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
model so then what we can then do is

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.550 
model so then what we can then do is
from<00:01:39.040> here<00:01:39.540> all<00:01:40.540> of<00:01:40.720> this<00:01:40.810> has<00:01:40.990> be<00:01:41.110> filled<00:01:41.380> in

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
from here all of this has be filled in

from here all of this has be filled in
we'll<00:01:42.280> bring<00:01:42.460> it<00:01:42.610> out<00:01:42.670> one<00:01:42.970> here<00:01:43.300> all<00:01:43.840> this

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
we'll bring it out one here all this

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.540 
we'll bring it out one here all this
will<00:01:44.260> be<00:01:44.380> filled<00:01:44.619> in<00:01:44.830> so<00:01:45.100> as<00:01:45.280> you're<00:01:45.460> looking

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550

will be filled in so as you're looking
at<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.910> side<00:01:46.180> you<00:01:46.900> should<00:01:46.930> see<00:01:47.220> something<00:01:48.220> you

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
at the side you should see something you

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.310 
at the side you should see something you
can<00:01:48.490> along<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.850> lines<00:01:49.090> of<00:01:49.330> that<00:01:49.869> for<00:01:50.350> now<00:01:50.470> so

so<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:30.130> row<00:02:30.610> free<00:02:30.940> single<00:02:31.330> then<00:02:31.870> two<00:02:32.110> rows<00:02:32.350> of

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
so a row free single then two rows of

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.920 
so a row free single then two rows of
free<00:02:32.769> then<00:02:33.250> another<00:02:33.580> two<00:02:33.910> rows<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.180> free<00:02:34.600> and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
free then another two rows of free and

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.530 
free then another two rows of free and
then<00:02:35.650> at<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.130> middle<00:02:36.489> block<00:02:36.760> at<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.090> top<00:02:37.300> here

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
then at the middle block at the top here

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.770 
then at the middle block at the top here
you<00:02:37.570> want<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.930> then<00:02:38.080> place<00:02:38.350> one<00:02:38.680> block<00:02:38.980> like<00:02:39.430> so

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
you want to then place one block like so

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.420 
you want to then place one block like so
so<00:02:40.780> from<00:02:41.110> there<00:02:41.350> then<00:02:41.680> what<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:41.980> can<00:02:42.100> do<00:02:42.280> is

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
so from there then what you can do is

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.460 
so from there then what you can do is
start<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:42.910> bring<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.269> in<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.200> want

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
start to bring it in so you want

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.830 
start to bring it in so you want
diagonal<00:02:45.190> backwards<00:02:45.670> here<00:02:45.940> here<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.510> here

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
diagonal backwards here here and here

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.990 
diagonal backwards here here and here
or<00:02:47.019> literally<00:02:47.560> all<00:02:47.890> around<00:02:48.340> this<00:02:48.519> square<00:02:48.760> you

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
or literally all around this square you

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.170 
or literally all around this square you
want<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.239> place<00:02:49.450> one<00:02:49.480> here<00:02:49.900> here<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.440> here

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
want to place one here here and here

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.990 
want to place one here here and here
back<00:02:52.360> side<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:53.320> you<00:02:53.380> end<00:02:53.620> up<00:02:53.799> looking<00:02:54.730> at<00:02:54.880> it

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
back side so you end up looking at it

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.600 
back side so you end up looking at it
like<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.440> once<00:02:56.650> you've<00:02:56.860> been<00:02:57.070> done<00:02:57.370> that

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
like that so once you've been done that

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.100 
like that so once you've been done that
you<00:02:57.880> then<00:02:58.060> want<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:58.360> come<00:02:58.540> back<00:02:58.720> an<00:02:58.900> extra

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
you then want to come back an extra

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.860 
you then want to come back an extra
layer<00:02:59.350> again<00:02:59.739> so<00:03:00.010> back<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.340> here<00:03:00.750> once<00:03:01.750> you

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
layer again so back to here once you

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.420 
layer again so back to here once you
place<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.140> block<00:03:02.590> there<00:03:02.830> then<00:03:03.100> you<00:03:03.190> want<00:03:03.370> to

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
place that block there then you want to

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.550 
place that block there then you want to
do<00:03:03.610> is<00:03:03.820> bring<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.269> all<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.690> way<00:03:04.810> around<00:03:04.870> like<00:03:05.500> a

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
do is bring it all the way around like a

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.729 
do is bring it all the way around like a
giant<00:03:05.980> N<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.910> down<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:07.930> there<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.410> go<00:03:08.560> that's

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
giant N and down so there you go that's

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.400 
giant N and down so there you go that's
like<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.010> giant<00:03:09.340> any<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.880> then<00:03:10.810> add<00:03:11.079> another

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
like a giant any and then add another

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.009 
like a giant any and then add another
Center<00:03:12.100> block<00:03:12.310> in<00:03:12.639> the<00:03:12.850> middle<00:03:13.120> there<00:03:13.329> like<00:03:13.690> so

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
Center block in the middle there like so

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.810 
Center block in the middle there like so
so<00:03:14.769> now<00:03:14.920> you've<00:03:15.070> done<00:03:15.280> that<00:03:15.519> we're<00:03:15.760> gonna

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
so now you've done that we're gonna

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.110 
so now you've done that we're gonna
repeat<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:16.989> same<00:03:17.320> pattern<00:03:17.829> again<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:18.820> from

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
repeat that same pattern again so from

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.629 
repeat that same pattern again so from
here<00:03:19.420> you<00:03:19.810> want<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.079> do<00:03:20.260> like<00:03:20.799> an<00:03:21.040> end<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:21.519> it

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
here you want to do like an end so it

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.970 
here you want to do like an end so it
goes<00:03:21.820> around<00:03:22.389> that<00:03:23.049> block<00:03:23.290> which<00:03:23.530> is<00:03:23.709> sticking

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
goes around that block which is sticking

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.460 
goes around that block which is sticking
up<00:03:24.250> like<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.510> goes<00:03:25.660> around<00:03:25.810> this<00:03:26.230> one

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
up like that so it goes around this one

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.400 
up like that so it goes around this one
and<00:03:26.680> then<00:03:27.340> not<00:03:27.670> forgetting<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.389> one<00:03:28.989> in<00:03:29.230> the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
and then not forgetting the one in the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.190 
and then not forgetting the one in the
center<00:03:29.620> like<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:31.450> it's<00:03:31.690> coming<00:03:31.930> along

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
center like so so it's coming along

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.500 
center like so so it's coming along
we're<00:03:32.769> slowly<00:03:33.010> getting<00:03:33.459> our<00:03:33.760> seal<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.329> look

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
we're slowly getting our seal to look

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.379 
we're slowly getting our seal to look
the<00:03:34.690> part<00:03:35.430> okay<00:03:36.430> so<00:03:36.489> now<00:03:36.850> we've<00:03:37.030> done<00:03:37.209> that

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
the part okay so now we've done that

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:38.849 
the part okay so now we've done that
what<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.660> can<00:03:37.780> do<00:03:37.989> is<00:03:38.139> come<00:03:38.350> down<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.590> this

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
what you can do is come down to this

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:45.780 
what you can do is come down to this
block<00:03:39.100> here<00:03:39.310> 1<00:03:39.669> 2<00:03:40.570> 3<00:03:42.389> 4<00:03:43.389> 5<00:03:44.290> 6<00:03:44.650> 7<00:03:45.100> so<00:03:45.519> you<00:03:45.609> want

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
block here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so you want

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.140 
block here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so you want
this<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.120> be<00:03:46.150> 7<00:03:46.630> blocks<00:03:46.810> long<00:03:47.109> so<00:03:47.350> from<00:03:47.590> here<00:03:47.769> 1

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
this to be 7 blocks long so from here 1

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.920 
this to be 7 blocks long so from here 1
2<00:03:49.150> 3<00:03:49.180> 4<00:03:49.959> 5<00:03:50.260> 6<00:03:50.620> 7<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:51.340> that's<00:03:51.519> 7<00:03:52.030> long<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.540> then

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
2 3 4 5 6 7 so that's 7 long and then

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.409 
2 3 4 5 6 7 so that's 7 long and then
what<00:03:53.109> we<00:03:53.230> can<00:03:53.350> do<00:03:53.500> is<00:03:53.680> bring<00:03:53.799> this<00:03:54.010> extra<00:03:54.489> 1<00:03:54.669> so

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
what we can do is bring this extra 1 so

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.379 
what we can do is bring this extra 1 so
it<00:03:55.540> sticks<00:03:55.780> out<00:03:55.989> there<00:03:56.380> like<00:03:56.799> so<00:03:57.070> and<00:03:57.389> this

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
it sticks out there like so and this

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.180 
it sticks out there like so and this
next<00:03:58.870> row<00:03:59.049> here<00:03:59.320> what<00:03:59.530> you<00:03:59.590> do<00:03:59.799> is<00:03:59.829> fill<00:04:00.040> this

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
next row here what you do is fill this

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.599 
next row here what you do is fill this
all<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:01.120> way<00:04:01.239> in<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:02.109> it<00:04:02.320> sticks<00:04:02.590> out<00:04:02.829> 1<00:04:03.160> here

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
all the way in so it sticks out 1 here

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.849 
all the way in so it sticks out 1 here
like<00:04:03.850> that<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.450> we'll<00:04:04.810> do<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.079> exact<00:04:05.410> same<00:04:05.500> on

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
like that and we'll do the exact same on

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.710 
like that and we'll do the exact same on
this<00:04:06.010> side<00:04:06.070> so<00:04:06.459> from<00:04:06.609> here<00:04:06.970> we<00:04:07.299> want<00:04:07.389> to<00:04:07.540> bring

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
this side so from here we want to bring

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.259 
this side so from here we want to bring
this<00:04:07.840> all<00:04:08.079> the<00:04:08.590> way<00:04:08.709> out<00:04:08.739> so<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.549> sticks<00:04:09.760> out<00:04:09.940> 1

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
this all the way out so it sticks out 1

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.370 
this all the way out so it sticks out 1
like<00:04:10.930> so<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:13.180> as<00:04:13.419> you<00:04:13.540> can<00:04:13.660> see<00:04:13.720> it's<00:04:14.049> slowly

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
like so so as you can see it's slowly

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.220 
like so so as you can see it's slowly
coming<00:04:14.709> along<00:04:14.859> it's<00:04:15.250> really<00:04:15.820> looking<00:04:16.230> decent

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
coming along it's really looking decent

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.009 
coming along it's really looking decent
so<00:04:18.190> now<00:04:18.489> now<00:04:18.790> what<00:04:19.239> we<00:04:19.359> do<00:04:19.570> is<00:04:19.630> we<00:04:19.810> continue

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
so now now what we do is we continue

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.470 
so now now what we do is we continue
with<00:04:20.410> doing<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.829> back<00:04:21.040> of<00:04:21.250> this<00:04:21.370> model<00:04:21.730> here

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
with doing the back of this model here

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.450 
with doing the back of this model here
so<00:04:23.230> then<00:04:23.380> what<00:04:23.560> you<00:04:23.680> could<00:04:23.830> do<00:04:23.980> is<00:04:24.100> bring<00:04:24.280> it

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
so then what you could do is bring it

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.910 
so then what you could do is bring it
out<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.880> then<00:04:25.360> you<00:04:25.510> want<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.780> do<00:04:25.960> like<00:04:26.140> arrow

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
out and then you want to do like arrow

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.830 
out and then you want to do like arrow
marker<00:04:27.520> like<00:04:27.700> that<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:28.090> it<00:04:28.150> sticks<00:04:28.390> out<00:04:28.600> as

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
marker like that so it sticks out as

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.840 
marker like that so it sticks out as
you're<00:04:29.320> looking<00:04:29.410> at<00:04:29.620> it<00:04:29.770> I'll<00:04:29.950> just<00:04:29.980> go<00:04:30.520> back

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
you're looking at it I'll just go back

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.160 
you're looking at it I'll just go back
there<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.330> can<00:04:31.540> see<00:04:31.690> what<00:04:31.900> you're<00:04:32.080> looking

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
there so you can see what you're looking

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.960 
there so you can see what you're looking
at<00:04:32.470> so<00:04:35.010> then<00:04:36.010> once<00:04:36.280> you've<00:04:36.430> done<00:04:36.580> that<00:04:36.640> what

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
at so then once you've done that what

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.730 
at so then once you've done that what
you<00:04:37.090> want<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.330> do<00:04:37.450> is<00:04:37.570> come<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.050> back<00:04:38.230> place

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
you want to do is come to the back place

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.650 
you want to do is come to the back place
a<00:04:38.770> block<00:04:39.070> on<00:04:39.310> directly<00:04:39.910> on<00:04:40.030> top<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.450> one

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
a block on directly on top and one

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.890 
a block on directly on top and one
either<00:04:40.960> side<00:04:41.290> so<00:04:41.320> it's<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.740> row<00:04:41.920> of<00:04:42.100> three<00:04:42.130> on

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
either side so it's a row of three on

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.390 
either side so it's a row of three on
that<00:04:43.900> sort<00:04:44.260> of<00:04:44.290> arrow<00:04:44.530> mark<00:04:44.890> you've<00:04:45.160> made

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
that sort of arrow mark you've made

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.060 
that sort of arrow mark you've made
there<00:04:45.930> then<00:04:46.930> what<00:04:47.170> we<00:04:47.320> can<00:04:47.470> do<00:04:47.620> is<00:04:47.710> come<00:04:47.950> back

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
there then what we can do is come back

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.820 
there then what we can do is come back
diagonally<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.030> here<00:04:49.540> delete<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.590> the

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
diagonally and here delete that the

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.260 
diagonally and here delete that the
blocks<00:04:51.070> we<00:04:51.220> placed<00:04:51.490> at<00:04:51.670> the<00:04:51.760> front<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.180> then

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
blocks we placed at the front and then

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.440 
blocks we placed at the front and then
bring<00:04:52.510> it<00:04:52.540> out<00:04:52.720> one<00:04:53.230> this<00:04:53.470> way<00:04:53.710> and<00:04:53.740> one<00:04:54.450> this

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
bring it out one this way and one this

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.330 
bring it out one this way and one this
way<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:55.960> that's<00:04:56.350> just<00:04:56.560> gonna<00:04:56.680> act<00:04:56.920> as<00:04:57.130> like

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
way and that's just gonna act as like

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.000 
way and that's just gonna act as like
the<00:04:57.550> flipper<00:04:57.970> for<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.360> as<00:04:58.900> you<00:04:59.710> can<00:04:59.830> see<00:04:59.920> it

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
the flipper for this as you can see it

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.140 
the flipper for this as you can see it
looks<00:05:00.190> really<00:05:00.280> cool<00:05:01.030> so<00:05:02.460> then<00:05:03.460> what<00:05:03.730> we<00:05:03.850> can<00:05:03.970> do

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
looks really cool so then what we can do

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.330 
looks really cool so then what we can do
is<00:05:04.210> come<00:05:04.540> down<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:05.050> back<00:05:05.290> all<00:05:05.920> this<00:05:06.160> will

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
is come down to the back all this will

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.300 
is come down to the back all this will
be<00:05:06.460> filled<00:05:06.730> in<00:05:07.470> well<00:05:08.470> we'll<00:05:08.620> do<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:08.890> roughly

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
be filled in well we'll do it roughly

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.400 
be filled in well we'll do it roughly
all<00:05:09.640> the<00:05:09.790> way<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.210> front<00:05:10.420> for<00:05:10.780> now<00:05:13.200> so<00:05:14.200> now

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
all the way to the front for now so now

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.500 
all the way to the front for now so now
we've<00:05:14.650> done<00:05:14.680> that<00:05:14.890> what<00:05:15.520> we<00:05:15.670> can<00:05:15.850> then<00:05:16.000> do<00:05:16.240> is

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
we've done that what we can then do is

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.480 
we've done that what we can then do is
place<00:05:16.870> one<00:05:17.170> two<00:05:17.410> three<00:05:17.680> here<00:05:17.950> and<00:05:18.160> then<00:05:18.310> an

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
place one two three here and then an

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.990 
place one two three here and then an
extra<00:05:18.850> one<00:05:19.030> there<00:05:19.300> like<00:05:19.570> so<00:05:20.550> place<00:05:21.550> free

then<00:06:08.290> bring<00:06:08.530> it<00:06:08.590> out<00:06:08.650> either<00:06:08.920> side<00:06:09.280> like<00:06:09.580> this

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
then bring it out either side like this

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.420 
then bring it out either side like this
and<00:06:10.150> then<00:06:10.420> down<00:06:10.720> an<00:06:10.900> extra<00:06:11.050> one<00:06:11.470> and<00:06:11.800> that<00:06:12.280> is

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
and then down an extra one and that is

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.370 
and then down an extra one and that is
pretty<00:06:12.820> much<00:06:12.940> your<00:06:13.420> still<00:06:13.690> complete<00:06:14.140> just

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
pretty much your still complete just

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.440 
pretty much your still complete just
fill<00:06:14.560> in<00:06:14.710> these<00:06:15.010> two<00:06:15.250> holes<00:06:15.430> at<00:06:15.700> the<00:06:15.820> sides<00:06:16.120> and

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
fill in these two holes at the sides and

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.130 
fill in these two holes at the sides and
then<00:06:17.080> all<00:06:17.470> this<00:06:17.860> bit<00:06:18.130> here<00:06:18.430> and<00:06:18.750> then<00:06:19.750> we'll<00:06:19.990> go

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
then all this bit here and then we'll go

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.510 
then all this bit here and then we'll go
around<00:06:20.380> to<00:06:20.500> the<00:06:20.590> other<00:06:20.710> side<00:06:20.800> making<00:06:21.280> sure

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
around to the other side making sure

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.510 
around to the other side making sure
that's<00:06:21.730> done<00:06:22.060> so<00:06:22.960> we<00:06:23.110> fill<00:06:23.350> that<00:06:23.530> in<00:06:23.770> there<00:06:24.370> we

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
that's done so we fill that in there we

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.060 
that's done so we fill that in there we
go<00:06:24.790> so<00:06:25.330> that<00:06:25.360> is<00:06:25.510> pretty<00:06:26.080> much<00:06:26.260> your<00:06:26.710> seal

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
go so that is pretty much your seal

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.980 
go so that is pretty much your seal
complete<00:06:27.610> we're<00:06:27.760> gonna<00:06:27.850> add<00:06:28.060> some<00:06:28.090> eyes<00:06:28.540> to<00:06:28.870> it

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.830 
out diagonally here here basically on
each<00:06:58.440> tip<00:06:58.950> of<00:06:59.250> this<00:06:59.730> cross<00:07:00.210> you<00:07:00.390> want<00:07:00.600> to<00:07:00.690> come

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 
each tip of this cross you want to come

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.710 
each tip of this cross you want to come
out<00:07:00.990> diagonal<00:07:01.530> and<00:07:01.710> then<00:07:02.130> do<00:07:02.460> another<00:07:02.760> cross

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
out diagonal and then do another cross

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.110 
out diagonal and then do another cross
like<00:07:04.440> so<00:07:04.740> and<00:07:05.010> the<00:07:05.190> same<00:07:05.370> with<00:07:05.580> here<00:07:05.790> bring<00:07:06.090> it

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 
like so and the same with here bring it

like so and the same with here bring it
up<00:07:06.300> and<00:07:06.540> out<00:07:06.660> and<00:07:06.960> as<00:07:07.110> you<00:07:07.290> can<00:07:07.410> see<00:07:07.470> it's

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 
up and out and as you can see it's

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:24.620 
up and out and as you can see it's
slowly<00:07:08.760> meeting<00:07:09.570> up<00:07:10.370> there<00:07:11.370> we<00:07:11.520> go

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.480 

and<00:07:24.780> then<00:07:25.290> what<00:07:25.470> we<00:07:25.590> could<00:07:25.710> do<00:07:25.860> I'm<00:07:26.100> just<00:07:26.160> gonna

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:26.490 
and then what we could do I'm just gonna

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.840 
and then what we could do I'm just gonna
fill<00:07:26.970> in<00:07:27.120> all<00:07:27.360> these<00:07:27.570> ones<00:07:27.980> we've<00:07:28.980> read<00:07:29.460> just

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:29.850 
fill in all these ones we've read just

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.610 
fill in all these ones we've read just
to<00:07:29.940> give<00:07:30.180> the<00:07:30.300> ball<00:07:30.510> a<00:07:30.540> bit<00:07:30.870> more<00:07:31.080> different

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 
to give the ball a bit more different

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.550 
to give the ball a bit more different
sort<00:07:31.860> of<00:07:31.980> color<00:07:32.700> into<00:07:33.150> it<00:07:33.180> so<00:07:33.900> all<00:07:34.080> these<00:07:34.290> ones

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 
sort of color into it so all these ones

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.950 
sort of color into it so all these ones
in<00:07:34.770> the<00:07:34.920> diagonals<00:07:35.550> here<00:07:35.670> you<00:07:36.390> just<00:07:36.600> fill<00:07:36.780> it

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 
in the diagonals here you just fill it

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.440 
in the diagonals here you just fill it
all<00:07:37.140> them<00:07:37.380> in<00:07:37.590> just<00:07:38.100> to<00:07:38.250> complete<00:07:38.640> your<00:07:39.090> quite

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:39.450

all them in just to complete your quite
a<00:07:39.480> simple<00:07:40.020> board<00:07:40.340> so<00:07:41.340> once<00:07:42.330> we've<00:07:42.480> done<00:07:42.510> this

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 
a simple board so once we've done this

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.990 
a simple board so once we've done this
I'll<00:07:43.260> just<00:07:43.620> zoom<00:07:43.830> back<00:07:44.100> so<00:07:44.310> you<00:07:44.400> can<00:07:44.580> see<00:07:44.790> what

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 
I'll just zoom back so you can see what

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.630 
I'll just zoom back so you can see what
we're<00:07:45.180> we're<00:07:45.480> looking<00:07:45.810> at<00:07:46.010> there<00:07:47.010> we<00:07:47.130> go<00:07:47.370> and

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:47.640 
we're we're looking at there we go and

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.680 
we're we're looking at there we go and
last<00:07:48.180> but<00:07:48.390> not<00:07:48.510> least<00:07:48.810> one<00:07:49.260> here
