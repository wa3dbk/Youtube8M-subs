that natural expansion which is I almost

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.969 
that natural expansion which is I almost
kind<00:05:33.050> of<00:05:33.080> wish<00:05:33.200> they'd<00:05:33.349> take<00:05:33.530> it<00:05:33.680> out<00:05:33.800> of<00:05:33.830> this

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.740 
kind of wish they'd take it out of this
map<00:05:34.190> like<00:05:34.400> maybe<00:05:34.580> a<00:05:34.669> new<00:05:34.969> match<00:05:35.120> point<00:05:35.479> they

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
map like maybe a new match point they

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.209 
map like maybe a new match point they
would<00:05:35.930> they<00:05:36.229> would<00:05:36.260> add<00:05:36.590> on<00:05:36.740> some<00:05:36.979> more

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:37.219 
would they would add on some more

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:38.830 
would they would add on some more
cliffside<00:05:37.729> there<00:05:37.969> so<00:05:38.120> that<00:05:38.270> there's<00:05:38.630> not<00:05:38.810> a

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
cliffside there so that there's not a
