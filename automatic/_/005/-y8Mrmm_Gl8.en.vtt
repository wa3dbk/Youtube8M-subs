really recede now I was getting widow's
Peaks<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.140> wanted<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.529> try<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.039> figure<00:00:29.460> out

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
Peaks and I wanted to try and figure out

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.209 
Peaks and I wanted to try and figure out
how<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.880> remedy<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.619> thought<00:00:31.980> well

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
how to remedy that and I thought well

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.220 
how to remedy that and I thought well
the<00:00:32.340> best<00:00:32.369> way<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.850> try<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.690> solve<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the best way to try and solve the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.350 
the best way to try and solve the
problem<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.739> understand<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.940> went<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
problem is understand it so I went to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.080 
problem is understand it so I went to
set<00:00:36.540> about<00:00:36.780> learning<00:00:37.110> about<00:00:37.350> hair<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.129> first

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
set about learning about hair and first

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.119 
set about learning about hair and first
of<00:00:39.239> all<00:00:39.360> there<00:00:39.600> are<00:00:39.750> three<00:00:39.780> phases<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
of all there are three phases to the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.540 
of all there are three phases to the
hairs<00:00:41.370> growth<00:00:41.850> cycle<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.870> first<00:00:43.110> phase<00:00:43.379> is

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
hairs growth cycle the first phase is

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.920 
hairs growth cycle the first phase is
anagen<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.879> there's<00:00:45.030> catagen<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.780> then

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
anagen and there's catagen and then

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.170 
anagen and there's catagen and then
there's<00:00:46.110> two<00:00:46.289> legion<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.700> first<00:00:47.940> phase

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
there's two legion and the first phase

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.630 
there's two legion and the first phase
is<00:00:48.450> when<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.020> growing<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.160> lasts<00:00:50.430> for

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
is when it's growing and this lasts for

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.130 
is when it's growing and this lasts for
a<00:00:50.700> few<00:00:50.730> weeks<00:00:51.120> when<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> hair<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:51.870> its

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
a few weeks when the hair is in its

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.110 
a few weeks when the hair is in its
growth<00:00:52.379> phase<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.250> follicle<00:00:53.789> is

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
growth phase and the follicle is

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.600 
growth phase and the follicle is
producing<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.840> hair<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.590> once<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.100> follicle<00:00:56.280> is

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
producing a hair and once a follicle is

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.369 
producing a hair and once a follicle is
produced<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.030> hair<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.420> shed<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.260> will

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
produced that hair and shed it it will

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.049 
produced that hair and shed it it will
actually<00:00:58.710> produce<00:00:58.920> another<00:00:59.399> one<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.940> it'll

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
actually produce another one and it'll

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.660 
actually produce another one and it'll
do<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.480> about<00:01:00.629> 20<00:01:01.289> times<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:02.250> after<00:01:02.370> its

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
do so about 20 times but after its

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.579 
do so about 20 times but after its
produced<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.149> hair<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.750> hair<00:01:03.960> goes<00:01:04.170> into<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
produced a hair the hair goes into the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.010 
produced a hair the hair goes into the
resting<00:01:05.040> phase<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.700> will<00:01:06.090> last<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.750> few

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
resting phase and that will last a few

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.969 
resting phase and that will last a few
months<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.360> then<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:09.810> into<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.799> two

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
months and then we go into the two

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.219 
months and then we go into the two
virgin<00:01:11.280> phase<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.939> that's<00:01:12.420> where<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:12.840> go<00:01:13.020> into

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
virgin phase and that's where we go into

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.060 
virgin phase and that's where we go into
the<00:01:14.130> hair<00:01:14.369> shedding<00:01:15.049> not<00:01:16.049> all<00:01:16.200> hair<00:01:16.470> shed<00:01:16.950> at

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the hair shedding not all hair shed at

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.890 
the hair shedding not all hair shed at
the<00:01:17.159> same<00:01:17.369> time<00:01:17.670> different<00:01:18.000> follicles<00:01:18.659> will

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the same time different follicles will

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.960 
the same time different follicles will
be<00:01:19.049> producing<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.159> others<00:01:20.340> will<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.549> shedding

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
be producing and others will be shedding

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.609 
be producing and others will be shedding
so<00:01:21.360> you're<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.630> going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.900> get<00:01:22.020> anything<00:01:22.229> like

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
so you're not going to get anything like

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.740 
so you're not going to get anything like
a<00:01:22.680> dramatic<00:01:23.280> effect<00:01:23.670> it'll<00:01:24.390> take<00:01:24.600> about

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
a dramatic effect it'll take about

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.109 
a dramatic effect it'll take about
another<00:01:24.869> 3<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:25.860> 4<00:01:26.130> months<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.729> hair

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
another 3 or 4 months for that hair

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.120 
another 3 or 4 months for that hair
cycle<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.990> go<00:01:28.140> through<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> shedding<00:01:28.710> phase

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
cycle to go through the shedding phase

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.760 
cycle to go through the shedding phase
and<00:01:29.430> then<00:01:29.520> we'll<00:01:29.820> start<00:01:30.119> all<00:01:30.390> over<00:01:30.420> again<00:01:30.780> now

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and then we'll start all over again now

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.800 
and then we'll start all over again now
in<00:01:31.920> case<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.250> were<00:01:32.340> wondering<00:01:32.600> what<00:01:33.600> about

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
have much shorter phases I mean this is

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.289 
have much shorter phases I mean this is
going<00:01:38.009> through<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.250> blink<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.790> an<00:01:38.909> eye<00:01:39.030> by

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.730 
going through a blink of an eye by
comparison<00:01:39.960> your<00:01:40.079> eyebrows<00:01:40.409> are<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
comparison your eyebrows are going to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.969 
comparison your eyebrows are going to
take<00:01:40.920> about<00:01:41.070> 60<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.150> 70<00:01:42.180> days<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.200> eyelashes

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
take about 60 to 70 days and eyelashes

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.999 
take about 60 to 70 days and eyelashes
will<00:01:44.159> take<00:01:44.340> about<00:01:44.579> 4<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.060> 6<00:01:45.299> weeks

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
will take about 4 to 6 weeks

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.530 
will take about 4 to 6 weeks
now<00:01:47.009> what<00:01:47.220> about<00:01:47.490> what<00:01:47.729> happens<00:01:48.090> as<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.390> get

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
now what about what happens as we get

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.260 
now what about what happens as we get
older<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.380> shedding<00:01:50.040> phase<00:01:50.310> speeds<00:01:50.909> up

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
older is that shedding phase speeds up

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.440 
older is that shedding phase speeds up
so<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.380> whole<00:01:52.560> cycle<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.520> much<00:01:54.270> much

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
so if the whole cycle is much much

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.240 
so if the whole cycle is much much
faster<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.200> therefore<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.100> you're

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
faster and therefore you know you're

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.740 
faster and therefore you know you're
producing<00:01:56.729> some<00:01:56.939> hair<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.420> you're<00:01:57.540> shedding

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
producing some hair but you're shedding

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.630 
producing some hair but you're shedding
much<00:01:58.049> more<00:01:58.259> quickly<00:01:58.500> because<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.009> cycle<00:01:59.610> has

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
much more quickly because that cycle has

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.580 
much more quickly because that cycle has
speeded<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.750> all<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.409> see

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
speeded up and you know all you can see

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.200 
speeded up and you know all you can see
is<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.159> you've<00:02:02.549> got<00:02:02.729> less<00:02:02.939> hair

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
is that you know you've got less hair

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.149 
is that you know you've got less hair
than<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.509> used<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.899> have<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.469> also<00:02:04.740> when<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
than you used to have and also when the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.280 
than you used to have and also when the
follicle<00:02:05.610> produces<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> hair<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.869> going<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.170> be

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
follicle produces a hair is going to be

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.339 
follicle produces a hair is going to be
weaker<00:02:07.860> thin<00:02:08.640> not<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.660> be<00:02:09.750> as<00:02:09.840> strong<00:02:10.140> as

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
weaker thin not going to be as strong as

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.589 
weaker thin not going to be as strong as
it<00:02:10.410> was<00:02:10.619> when<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:11.039> were<00:02:11.160> younger<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.730> what<00:02:12.450> can

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
it was when you were younger so what can

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.070 
it was when you were younger so what can
we<00:02:12.660> do<00:02:12.840> about

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
we do about

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.200 
we do about
this<00:02:13.260> well<00:02:13.650> there<00:02:14.010> are<00:02:14.190> products<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.090> will

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
this well there are products that will

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.750 
this well there are products that will
help<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.690> hair<00:02:15.900> grow<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.470> even<00:02:16.920> they<00:02:17.610> will

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
help the hair grow and even they will

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.380 
help the hair grow and even they will
bring<00:02:18.090> back<00:02:18.420> life<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.870> dormant<00:02:19.770> follicles<00:02:20.390> one

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
bring back life to dormant follicles one

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.630 
bring back life to dormant follicles one
of<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.600> surprising<00:02:22.170> ones<00:02:22.320> is<00:02:22.500> emu<00:02:22.860> oil<00:02:22.890> but

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
of the surprising ones is emu oil but

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.220 
of the surprising ones is emu oil but
there's<00:02:23.820> been<00:02:23.970> some<00:02:24.210> great<00:02:24.390> research<00:02:24.870> done

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
there's been some great research done

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.990 
there's been some great research done
out<00:02:25.380> at<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.650> University<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.190> Boston<00:02:26.700> on<00:02:26.820> emu

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
out at the University of Boston on emu

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.720 
out at the University of Boston on emu
oil<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:28.020> actually<00:02:28.200> will<00:02:28.830> wake<00:02:29.430> up

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
oil and it actually will wake up

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.150 
oil and it actually will wake up
follicles<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.840> have<00:02:31.050> been<00:02:31.290> dormant<00:02:31.710> and

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
follicles that have been dormant and

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160 
follicles that have been dormant and
they'll<00:02:32.610> start<00:02:32.850> producing<00:02:33.480> hair<00:02:33.900> again

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
they'll start producing hair again

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.800 
they'll start producing hair again
another<00:02:34.740> great<00:02:35.090> active<00:02:36.090> ingredient<00:02:36.660> is

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
another great active ingredient is

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.720 
another great active ingredient is
copper<00:02:37.080> peptides<00:02:37.620> copper<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> trace

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
copper peptides copper is a trace

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.610 
copper peptides copper is a trace
element<00:02:38.940> that's<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.540> our<00:02:39.690> bodies<00:02:40.050> that

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
element that's in our bodies that

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.980 
element that's in our bodies that
diminishes<00:02:41.130> as<00:02:41.430> we<00:02:41.580> get<00:02:41.820> older<00:02:42.240> but<00:02:42.810> what

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
diminishes as we get older but what

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.320 
diminishes as we get older but what
copper<00:02:43.380> does<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.980> signals<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.180> hair

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
copper does is it signals to the hair

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.150 
copper does is it signals to the hair
follicles<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.930> grow<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.350> produce<00:02:46.770> healthy

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
follicles to grow to produce healthy

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.650 
follicles to grow to produce healthy
hair<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:48.210> if<00:02:48.300> we<00:02:48.420> can<00:02:48.600> restore<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:50.070> copper

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
hair so if we can restore the copper

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.660 
hair so if we can restore the copper
then<00:02:51.660> we<00:02:51.870> will<00:02:52.020> have<00:02:52.200> stronger<00:02:52.890> healthier

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
then we will have stronger healthier

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.150 
then we will have stronger healthier
follicles<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.170> will<00:02:55.290> produce<00:02:55.470> stronger

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
follicles and that will produce stronger

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.850 
follicles and that will produce stronger
healthier
