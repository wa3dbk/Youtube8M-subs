I<00:02:23.160> didn't<00:02:23.610> really<00:02:23.880> like<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.540> first<00:02:24.750> thing<00:02:25.020> is

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
I didn't really like the first thing is

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.340 
I didn't really like the first thing is
this<00:02:25.590> cover<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.400> mean<00:02:26.670> come<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.090> it's<00:02:27.810> not<00:02:27.959> good

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
this cover I mean come on it's not good

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.830 
this cover I mean come on it's not good
in<00:02:28.590> no<00:02:28.860> way<00:02:29.100> would<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.490> call<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:30.060> an<00:02:30.330> effective

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.199 
in no way would I call this an effective
cover<00:02:31.110> but<00:02:31.830> it's<00:02:32.010> really<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.400> pity<00:02:32.760> when<00:02:33.180> a

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
cover but it's really a pity when a

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.960 
cover but it's really a pity when a
cover<00:02:33.569> can<00:02:33.989> scare<00:02:34.350> people<00:02:34.380> off<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.489> from<00:02:35.760> me<00:02:35.940> to
