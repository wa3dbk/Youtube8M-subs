00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.059
 every year more and more people 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.340
 prefer to let their homes down 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.289
 Canadian technology program today 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.100
 we must take has decided to leave the essence and 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.720
 advantage of this type of construction 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.250
 Canadian technology is a kind of volume 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.820
 low-rise modular construction 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.590
 housing 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.090
 it consists in applying as 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.130
 main building material 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.020
 sandwich panels sip panels 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.899
 now we are in production 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.739
 this unique construction business 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.399
 sandwich panel consists of two 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.220
 of materials 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.660
 oriented strand board and 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.690
 polystyrene foam 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.270
 oriented strand board 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.280
 made from softwood chips and 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.470
 birch based on natural resin 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.180
 it is completely environmentally friendly 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.340
 Styrofoam material 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.829
 used special very dense and 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.750
 at the same time breathable also 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.450
 it is fireproof because it refers to 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.489
 discharge itself fading to production 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.469
 component of the sandwich panel comes on 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.149
 separately here they are connected between 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.909
 yourself on special equipment when 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.680
 polyurethane adhesive glue then cooker 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.869
 gets under the press where under high 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.229
 pressure all its components firmly 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.850
 interconnect plate size 280 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.490
 one hundred and twenty five centimeters weight 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.680
 about 40 kilograms for walls are used 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.140
 150 mm wide plates for the floor 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.729
 200 millimeters directly in production 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.680
 all plates are cut according to 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.869
 project of your house which is essential 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.580
 facilitates its assembly in this workshop we 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.500
 We are engaged in the production of roofing 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.450
 designs for our homes we 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.130
 we use technology that allows 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.720
 for skies make all 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.170
 wooden roof systems for 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.210
 roofing 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.250
 start roof design special 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.900
 the program allows it very accurately 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.090
 calculate with all future 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.810
 roof loads and and optimal 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.939
 construction 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.650
 then based on the project prepared 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.780
 the timber is sawn into necessary 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.700
 fragment and blanks are laid out on 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.100
 assembly table form made 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.079
 designs on each node are placed 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.450
 gear plate according to 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.040
 specification of a specific project each 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.110
 the node is pressurized movable 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.880
 hydraulic press that guarantees 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.250
 reliable connection of all parts 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.140
 designs so all major 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.450
 roof construction systems are going to 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.430
 directly on the production and the whole 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.439
 roof assembly process at the construction site 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.999
 comes down only to installing these systems and 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.680
 fixing them to the base 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:23.290
 technologies we figured out now 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.969
 it's time to figure out the advantage 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.599
 houses built by Canadian 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.599
 technology 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.430
 first is the speed of construction 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.950
 assembly of the average house of the total area of ​​st 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.439
 approximately takes you square meters 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.790
 about 10 days on the finished foundation 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.069
 building a house from 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.809
 construction and insulation panels 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.849
 reminds assembly designer Lego 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:45.579
 each panel connects with the rest 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.829
 according to the Shipp method from using a bar or 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.169
 special thermal inserts as a result 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.150
 a volume module is obtained as a floor 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.980
 or even the whole house following 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.079
 significant advantage of the vulture houses 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.329
 panels it is considered that they are the most 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.340
 warm unlike traditional 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.680
 house building technology from 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.809
 sandwich panels do not need to heat the thermos 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.059
 from polystyrene foam you immediately warm 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.949
 air and the shortest time you get 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.659
 comfortable temperature 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:12.999
 it only remains to support her on 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.849
 the necessary level is also an advantage 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:16.930
 houses from the vulture panels that houses do not give 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.150
 shrinkage 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.310
 you can immediately proceed sheet 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.319
 season volume ease of construction 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.150
 low thermal conductivity absence 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.890
 shrinkage is not all virtues 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.170
 sandwich panel houses 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.000
 It is also worth noting that such houses are not 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.890
 than not inferior to brick on such 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.939
 indicators like fire safety and 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.680
 environmental friendliness 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:37.599
 Our company for over 10 years 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.969
 specializes in this kind of build 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.049
 our sets of houses we substitute not 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.090
 only in Tatarstan 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.489
 Well, throughout Russia, our technology 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.049
 so affordable that everyone possessing 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.700
 minimal construction skills 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.220
 can build a house yourself 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.319
 all our technologies are patented 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.120
 cost per square meter begins 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:00.970
 from 12,000 rubles a square meter 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.799
 come we will build a house more important want 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.569
 own house but builders ask 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.659
 expensive to contact us
