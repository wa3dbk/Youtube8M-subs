00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.039 

so<00:00:01.650> I<00:00:01.680> made<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:01.979> simplified<00:00:02.689> jewel<00:00:03.689> thief

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
so I made a simplified jewel thief

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.680 
so I made a simplified jewel thief
charger<00:00:05.330> out<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.750> one<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.470> these<00:00:08.450> these<00:00:09.450> little

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
charger out of one of these these little

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.799 
charger out of one of these these little
garden<00:00:10.200> lights<00:00:10.940> let<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.090> put<00:00:12.330> outside<00:00:14.809> they

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
garden lights let you put outside they

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.109 
garden lights let you put outside they
each<00:00:16.320> one<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.619> these<00:00:16.710> come<00:00:16.980> with<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.550> jewel

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
each one of these come with a jewel

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.340 
each one of these come with a jewel
thief<00:00:18.420> basically<00:00:19.170> already<00:00:19.350> built<00:00:20.010> into<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.609> so

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
thief basically already built into it so

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.000 
thief basically already built into it so
you<00:00:22.850> don't<00:00:23.850> have<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.300> worry<00:00:24.539> about<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.529> coils

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
you don't have to worry about the coils

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.509 
you don't have to worry about the coils
and<00:00:26.400> what<00:00:27.359> transient<00:00:28.080> transistor<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.830> use<00:00:29.039> or

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
and what transient transistor to use or

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:38.810 
and what transient transistor to use or
any<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.679> because<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:32.130> neatly<00:00:32.759> combed<00:00:37.820> and

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
any of that because it neatly combed and

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.709 
any of that because it neatly combed and
I<00:00:39.270> made<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> battery<00:00:40.110> charge<00:00:40.350> around<00:00:40.500> it

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
I made a battery charge around it

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.720 
I made a battery charge around it
double-a<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.379> charging<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.250> Doubleday

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
double-a here is charging this Doubleday

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.130 
double-a here is charging this Doubleday
right<00:00:44.969> here<00:00:47.899> and<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.140> still<00:00:49.410> produces<00:00:49.950> light

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
right here and it still produces light

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.040 
right here and it still produces light
it's<00:00:52.140> much<00:00:52.320> brighter<00:00:52.710> than<00:00:53.239> that<00:00:54.239> camera<00:00:54.930> is

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
it's much brighter than that camera is

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.069 
it's much brighter than that camera is
putting<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.730> because<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.360> see<00:00:57.570> clearly

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
putting on because I can see clearly

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.700 
putting on because I can see clearly
right<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.859> can't<00:00:59.190> really<00:00:59.399> see<00:00:59.489> it

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
right here and you can't really see it

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.650 
right here and you can't really see it
but<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.219> some<00:01:02.460> modifications<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.359> had<00:01:03.539> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
but there is some modifications I had to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.700 
but there is some modifications I had to
do<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:05.180> like<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.510> had<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.939> one<00:01:08.939> in

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
do to it like I had a one in

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.679 
do to it like I had a one in
double-oh-seven

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
double-oh-seven

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:20.929 
double-oh-seven
diode<00:01:16.520> right<00:01:17.520> there<00:01:18.560> where<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.799> positive<00:01:20.759> of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
diode right there where the positive of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.789 
diode right there where the positive of
the<00:01:21.119> LED<00:01:21.750> output<00:01:22.259> would<00:01:23.040> normally<00:01:23.520> go<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.810> I

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the LED output would normally go and I

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.929 
the LED output would normally go and I
replace<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:27.470> LED<00:01:28.470> at<00:01:28.590> Ike<00:01:28.770> home<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.700> a

red LED from Radio Shack right there is

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.980 
red LED from Radio Shack right there is
the<00:01:34.710> LED<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.280> comes<00:01:35.610> with<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.360> replaced<00:01:36.810> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the LED it comes with and I replaced it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.590 
the LED it comes with and I replaced it
with<00:01:37.049> one<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.680> guys<00:01:38.570> come<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.990> unpack

with one you guys come with to unpack

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.880 
with one you guys come with to unpack
there's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.750> bowl<00:01:43.229> number<00:01:45.049> there's<00:01:46.049> aspects<00:01:46.619> of

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
there's a bowl number there's aspects of

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.830 
there's a bowl number there's aspects of
it

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.350 

and<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.050> does<00:01:52.410> a<00:01:52.440> really<00:01:52.620> good<00:01:53.250> job<00:01:56.060> right<00:01:57.060> here

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
and it does a really good job right here

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:09.699 
and it does a really good job right here
is<00:01:57.480> the<00:02:00.290> is<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.550> schematic<00:02:02.550> of<00:02:03.000> it

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.580 

very<00:02:10.580> simple<00:02:11.150> it's<00:02:11.750> pretty<00:02:12.019> much<00:02:12.110> already

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
very simple it's pretty much already

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.240 
very simple it's pretty much already
made<00:02:12.860> all<00:02:13.129> you<00:02:13.250> need<00:02:13.489> is<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.959> new<00:02:14.959> ID<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.950> new

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
made all you need is a new ID and a new

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.619 
made all you need is a new ID and a new
diet<00:02:16.909> and<00:02:18.040> for<00:02:19.040> convenience<00:02:19.640> I'll<00:02:20.390> suggest

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
diet and for convenience I'll suggest

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.020 
diet and for convenience I'll suggest
picking<00:02:21.049> up<00:02:21.290> on<00:02:21.470> these<00:02:21.620> battery<00:02:22.040> holders<00:02:22.430> too

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.509

you want to freeze it you can and yeah
the<00:02:35.299> little<00:02:35.540> store<00:02:35.750> lights<00:02:36.019> are<00:02:36.170> about<00:02:36.319> two

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
the little store lights are about two

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.140 
the little store lights are about two
dollars<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.890> fifty<00:02:37.099> cents<00:02:37.370> at<00:02:37.549> my<00:02:37.819> local

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
charge of area it's pretty good I lost

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.349 
charge of area it's pretty good I lost
point<00:03:17.780> zero<00:03:18.139> zero<00:03:18.230> eight<00:03:18.620> but<00:03:19.099> I<00:03:19.400> gained<00:03:19.940> point

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
point zero zero eight but I gained point

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.699 
point zero zero eight but I gained point
zero<00:03:20.780> three<00:03:21.109> two<00:03:21.549> that's<00:03:22.549> all<00:03:23.500> those<00:03:24.500> are<00:03:24.680> very

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
zero three two that's all those are very

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.610 
zero three two that's all those are very
good<00:03:25.099> results<00:03:25.810> I'm<00:03:26.810> still<00:03:27.139> doing<00:03:27.349> photo

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
good results I'm still doing photo

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.059 
good results I'm still doing photo
testing<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.389> have<00:03:29.389> only<00:03:29.660> done<00:03:30.319> it<00:03:30.680> on<00:03:33.069> this

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
testing I have only done it on this

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.289 
testing I have only done it on this
setup<00:03:34.569> again<00:03:35.569> I<00:03:35.660> did<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:36.230> priest

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
setup again I did you a priest

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.000 
setup again I did you a priest
another<00:03:38.299> testing<00:03:38.780> on<00:03:38.900> Barry<00:03:39.410> just<00:03:39.620> like<00:03:39.829> this

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
another testing on Barry just like this

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.710 
another testing on Barry just like this
one<00:03:40.250> but<00:03:40.940> this<00:03:41.030> is<00:03:41.180> pretty<00:03:41.299> much<00:03:41.389> what<00:03:41.629> I've

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
one but this is pretty much what I've

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.189 
one but this is pretty much what I've
done<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:44.199> did<00:03:45.199> add<00:03:45.379> a<00:03:45.410> on/off<00:03:46.220> switch<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:46.849> it

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
done I did add a on/off switch to it

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.509 
done I did add a on/off switch to it
just<00:03:48.199> to<00:03:48.349> make<00:03:48.650> my<00:03:48.799> life<00:03:48.980> a<00:03:49.010> little<00:03:49.220> simpler

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
just to make my life a little simpler

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.460 
just to make my life a little simpler
and<00:03:49.790> this<00:03:49.879> is<00:03:50.030> a<00:03:50.060> case<00:03:50.419> from<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.870> whole<00:03:50.989> CD<00:03:51.790> Drive

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
and this is a case from a whole CD Drive

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.110 
and this is a case from a whole CD Drive
so<00:03:54.470> nothing<00:03:55.359> hidden<00:03:56.359> about<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:57.019> it's<00:03:57.849> it<00:03:58.849> works

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
so nothing hidden about it it's it works

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.680 
so nothing hidden about it it's it works
it<00:03:59.569> it<00:04:00.530> works<00:04:01.099> so<00:04:01.370> good<00:04:01.400> it<00:04:01.940> actually<00:04:02.329> puts<00:04:02.540> off

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
it it works so good it actually puts off

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.599 
it it works so good it actually puts off
enough<00:04:02.989> light<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.530> be<00:04:03.650> used<00:04:03.919> as<00:04:04.069> a<00:04:04.099> nightlight

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
enough light to be used as a nightlight

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.240 
enough light to be used as a nightlight
so<00:04:04.940> I'm<00:04:05.090> thinking<00:04:05.389> about<00:04:05.480> making<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:06.250> night

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
so I'm thinking about making a night

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.610 
so I'm thinking about making a night
light<00:04:07.489> version<00:04:07.940> of<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.239> that<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:09.199> can<00:04:09.410> have

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
light version of it that I can have

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.180 
light version of it that I can have
night<00:04:10.040> light<00:04:10.930> light<00:04:11.930> at<00:04:12.079> night<00:04:12.260> in<00:04:12.530> my<00:04:12.949> hallway

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
night light light at night in my hallway

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.280 
night light light at night in my hallway
and<00:04:13.639> charge<00:04:14.030> batteries<00:04:14.540> too<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:15.049> I'm<00:04:15.139> also

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
and charge batteries too and I'm also

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.330 
and charge batteries too and I'm also
thinking<00:04:15.500> about<00:04:15.650> making<00:04:15.859> a<00:04:15.980> flashlight

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
thinking about making a flashlight

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.580 
thinking about making a flashlight
version<00:04:16.880> too<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:17.840> as<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.109> use<00:04:18.200> a<00:04:18.229> flashlight

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
version too so as you use a flashlight

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.620 
version too so as you use a flashlight
charges<00:04:19.340> on<00:04:19.669> that

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
charges on that

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.130 
charges on that
so<00:04:21.630> it's<00:04:22.260> very<00:04:22.560> simple<00:04:23.720> you<00:04:24.720> just<00:04:24.750> take<00:04:25.020> the

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
so it's very simple you just take the

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.670 
so it's very simple you just take the
circuit<00:04:25.470> board<00:04:25.650> out<00:04:26.030> solder<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.390> diode<00:04:28.020> onto

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
circuit board out solder the diode onto

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.760 
circuit board out solder the diode onto
little<00:04:29.400> legs<00:04:29.820> that<00:04:30.060> comes<00:04:30.330> out<00:04:30.570> of<00:04:30.770> whether

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
little legs that comes out of whether

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.770 
little legs that comes out of whether
you're<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.100> old<00:04:32.280> LED<00:04:32.760> used<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:33.030> be<00:04:33.180> disorder

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
you're the old LED used to be disorder

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.050 
you're the old LED used to be disorder
some<00:04:34.320> connections<00:04:34.950> on<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:35.520> you<00:04:35.610> connect<00:04:35.970> your

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
some connections on so you connect your

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.270 
some connections on so you connect your
batteries<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:37.470> run<00:04:37.680> battery<00:04:37.920> connects

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
batteries the run battery connects

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.480 
batteries the run battery connects
directly<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.880> where<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.680> original<00:04:40.680> barrier

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
directly to where the original barrier

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.140 
directly to where the original barrier
was<00:04:41.700> so<00:04:41.880> if<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.060> want<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.270> keep<00:04:43.760> if<00:04:44.760> you<00:04:44.820> want

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
was so if you want to keep if you want

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.120 
was so if you want to keep if you want
to<00:04:45.210> keep<00:04:45.450> it<00:04:45.660> like<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.080> was<00:04:46.290> you<00:04:46.590> can't<00:04:46.860> here's

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
to keep it like it was you can't here's

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.030 
to keep it like it was you can't here's
on<00:04:48.080> it<00:04:49.080> so<00:04:49.170> basically<00:04:49.350> if<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:49.680> want<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.890> still

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
on it so basically if you want to still

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.340 
on it so basically if you want to still
want<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.220> use<00:04:50.280> this<00:04:50.870> Barrett<00:04:51.870> as<00:04:51.990> a<00:04:52.020> battery

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
want to use this Barrett as a battery

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.560 
want to use this Barrett as a battery
holder<00:04:52.700> burners<00:04:53.700> keep<00:04:53.880> in<00:04:53.970> mind<00:04:54.120> is<00:04:54.330> still<00:04:54.510> a

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
holder burners keep in mind is still a

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.270 
holder burners keep in mind is still a
long<00:04:54.780> slow<00:04:55.440> panel<00:04:55.770> there<00:04:55.860> so<00:04:55.980> that's<00:04:56.130> all

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
long slow panel there so that's all

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.920 
long slow panel there so that's all
probably<00:04:56.550> still<00:04:56.820> used<00:04:57.180> for<00:04:57.330> something<00:04:57.750> but

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
probably still used for something but

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.840 
probably still used for something but
you<00:04:58.590> can<00:04:58.740> still<00:04:58.980> keep<00:04:59.160> this<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.400> same<00:04:59.640> keep

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
you can still keep this the same keep

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.070 
you can still keep this the same keep
your<00:04:59.970> positive<00:05:00.420> negative<00:05:00.630> it's<00:05:00.900> still

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
your positive negative it's still

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.630 
your positive negative it's still
connected<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:02.070> just<00:05:02.190> use<00:05:03.000> that<00:05:04.250> if<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.340> want

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
connected and just use that if you want

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.160 
connected and just use that if you want
and<00:05:07.220> try<00:05:08.220> to<00:05:08.280> bury<00:05:08.670> it<00:05:08.910> it's<00:05:09.240> very<00:05:09.540> simple<00:05:09.660> it

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
and try to bury it it's very simple it

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.370 
and try to bury it it's very simple it
just<00:05:10.890> have<00:05:11.040> a<00:05:11.070> try<00:05:11.340> it<00:05:11.570> it<00:05:12.570> won't<00:05:12.690> cost<00:05:13.020> you<00:05:13.200> no

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
just have a try it it won't cost you no

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.980 
just have a try it it won't cost you no
more<00:05:13.620> than<00:05:13.740> five<00:05:14.010> dollars<00:05:14.250> so<00:05:15.000> what<00:05:15.840> do<00:05:15.930> you

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
more than five dollars so what do you

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:24.070 
more than five dollars so what do you
have<00:05:16.140> to<00:05:16.260> lose

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.139
