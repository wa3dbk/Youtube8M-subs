00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
about for at least a few minutes so I've

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.240 
about for at least a few minutes so I've

that<00:00:44.430> question<00:00:44.700> alone<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.690> let's<00:00:46.140> get<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.530> it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that question alone so let's get to it

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.619 
that question alone so let's get to it
what's<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> difference<00:00:47.789> between<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.390> I

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
what's the difference between as I

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.360 
what's the difference between as I
affectionately<00:00:49.020> call<00:00:49.350> them<00:00:49.739> Mouse's<00:00:50.340> and

rattie's the easiest way to tell the
difference<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.480> rats<00:00:54.719> are<00:00:54.930> way<00:00:55.579> way<00:00:57.050> way

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
difference is that rats are way way way
