00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
like to use in fact it does it very very

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.850 
like to use in fact it does it very very
quickly<00:01:42.000> pretty<00:01:42.299> much<00:01:42.450> instantaneously<00:01:43.229> it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
quickly pretty much instantaneously it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.980 
quickly pretty much instantaneously it
will<00:01:44.100> convert<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.939> five<00:01:45.360> megapixel

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
will convert it to a five megapixel

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.450 
will convert it to a five megapixel
image<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.060> will<00:01:48.270> scan<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.170> at<00:01:49.350> 1,800<00:01:50.100> dpi

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
image and it will scan it at 1,800 dpi

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.149 
image and it will scan it at 1,800 dpi
so<00:01:50.820> you've<00:01:50.939> got<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.360> nice<00:01:51.750> high<00:01:52.380> resolution

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
so you've got a nice high resolution

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.389 
so you've got a nice high resolution
image<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.880> comes<00:01:54.090> from<00:01:54.810> your<00:01:55.170> original
