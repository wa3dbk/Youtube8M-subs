00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.540
 we return to the day of the little crush 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.090
 before the end of the boiling I got myself 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.490
 went to the sterile room used for 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.700
 sanitation or the process of home 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.980
 mine and succeeds in quato again and again the 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.770
 fermenter then or saints given with 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.529
 metabisulfite in the now well tested 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.710
 quantity the five teaspoons of shopping 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.629
 2 liters of water at room temperature 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.120
 I usually use one liter for the 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.430
 fermenter the other liter is a bit like 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.130
 a courtesan disputed by a rich man 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.930
 set of suitors accessories 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.210
 in fact this unworthy liter of water e 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.520
 bisulfite will be used for saints 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.010
 give all the accessories that way 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.440
 via I will need to use the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:57.140
 Sanitization is a serious thing and should be done 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.879
 in a careful and austere way after several 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.410
 I left the fermenter shaking 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.360
 to drain and then I closed 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.920
 tightly with the lid so as to 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.899
 do not blow up all the work of 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.390
 washing and sanitizing done up to 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:11.060
 that moment to avoid risks 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.640
 of infections taking advantage of boiling 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.200
 of the must five minutes from the end 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.600
 of the boiling has been inserted 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.119
 slowly in the pot 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.330
 the copper coil so that too 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.450
 this underwent a sanitization the 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.430
 gesture happened on the magic moment to the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.740
 order to avoid that the monster suffered a 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.700
 sudden drop in temperature 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.009
 risking to stop boiling 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.140
 having an excellent conductor of 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.210
 heat the coil much colder 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.380
 some must have taken away quickly 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.700
 heat 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.710
 at the end of the total time of 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.869
 boiling we have extinguished the fire is 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.630
 closed the relative valve of the donut 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.369
 for this kind of thing I am manic 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.009
 I admit I prefer it that way 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.720
 the tap water was opened 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.420
 flowing in the narrow cavities of the 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.360
 serpentine subtracted heat from the must 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.090
 this operation lasts about 25 30 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.350
 minutes making me impatient 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.689
 once you reach 30 degrees 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.939
 centigrade or a little less we have opened the 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.190
 great emotion of the pot 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.170
 at that juncture because it had arrived 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.299
 time to test for the first time 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.620
 the bazooka filter that with all its 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.510
 pantheistic determines 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.360
 the action blocked the passage e 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.819
 hops the first gushed drops of the 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.480
 tap were dark and were 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.040
 discarded 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.920
 this is proof of my theory 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.569
 exposed is the previous video about 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.370
 burning of the remaining must 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.129
 stagnant and inside the hose 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.450
 as you can see the must yes also 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.159
 well oxygenated 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.060
 the phenomenon was favored by this 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.060
 abundant flow 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.010
 this would have encouraged others 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.319
 future a profitable activity by 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.480
 of yeast whose no ass would be 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.549
 happened a little later so we have 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.140
 could check the level in liters 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.510
 that he had reached the must in the 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.730
 fermenter from this we have deduced that 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.040
 on average the boiling moon made us 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.440
 lose about 6 7 liters of water 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.329
 that is a little less than 30 percent of the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.489
 volume of the must present in the pot 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.739
 at the beginning of this boiling 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.859
 factor I will take into account for future cooked 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.769
 in all grain to the newborn hopped must 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.480
 that is to say the hopped tournament boss was 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.260
 adding the missing water up to 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.040
 reaching the expected 25 liters 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.450
 used water in bottles from 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.609
 refrigerator so that the temperature 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.500
 which was a little below 30 degrees 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.169
 centigrade fell more 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.910
 it was immediately passed to the inoculum 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.829
 of the leaven that a few hours before was 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.959
 was brought to room temperature 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.090
 having been kept in the fridge like 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.980
 of good practice to do as often as I do 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.480
 opened the sachet and was paid the 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.099
 yeast in the must leaving it 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.980
 initially on the surface and without 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.319
 mix up for a tragic misunderstanding 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.849
 between me and venerating the leaven was 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.099
 paid exclusively in the area 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.780
 central part of the must surface 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.730
 while it would be a good idea to a 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.359
 distribute it evenly over the whole 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.639
 surface 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.319
 despite this the fermentation does not have 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.660
 had no problem catching on 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.090
 in the following hours we closed the 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.310
 fermenter is expected about 30 minutes 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.319
 this waiting gave way to the taste of 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.569
 cool down a little more and allow 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.400
 to the yeast to rehydrate and to 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.070
 to settle in its new habitat 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.750
 finally the monster was stirred 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.269
 vigorously and therefore further 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.580
 oxygenated I found this 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.120
 system suggested by the famous lievi the 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.160
 ria 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.530
 for mentis has always given me good 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.810
 results in fermentation phase for 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.190
 me maybe in some unfortunate case in 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.500
 which yeast abstained 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.990
 completely from being collaborative 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.310
 after oxygenation of the must and was 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.710
 done the density reading 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.990
 using the refractometer for the 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.570
 first cooked the density read was of 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.530
 slightly less than expected for 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.600
 precision is 1,048 instead of 1050 one 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.060
 almost negligible difference despite 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.010
 I wondered why this 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.130
 discrepancy for very simple reason 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.990
 my dear the verifier now exhausted 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.150
 from these videos, in short, the reason was 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.160
 very trivial but caused by a factor 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.260
 that I had not taken into consideration 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.660
 after having poured the taste from the 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.520
 fermenter pot for strength of 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.990
 things a small amount of monster is 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.060
 remained in the pot 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.800
 now I ignore the precise amount of must 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.110
 held against his will in 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.000
 pot together with him but then I think 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.190
 that it was around a liter 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.870
 clean and half 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.570
 evidently this small amount of 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.120
 the must that escaped the pouring was the 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.280
 because of the significant discrepancy in the 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.840
 density values what I should have 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.450
 would have been to add 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.979
 less water to the fermenter or 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.400
 make a must from the density 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.349
 slightly higher 12 points more 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.360
 that's why for the second crush we have 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:46.520
 used a larger amount of 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.710
 extract light in this way we have 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.750
 obtained a slightly denser must 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.520
 which diluted the water we added 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.710
 a fermenter allowed us to 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.810
 get a density that matches that 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.789
 prescribed by the recipe is reasonable 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.010
 think that the compensatory speech 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:03.320
 corrective done for the value of 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.430
 density should also be done for the index 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.199
 of bitter 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.120
 that's why for the hopping of the 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:10.460
 Second course were chosen 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.590
 timing different amounts 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.660
 well sure this also in relation to 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.910
 fact that we had decided to carry out 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.010
 a slightly less bitter beer 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.599
 with respect to first crush the quantities 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.669
 modified to correct these 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:24.830
 parameters were certainly not chosen 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.780
 to the carlona but studied 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.630
 previously ad hoc with the help of 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.729
 software you homebrewing all in all 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.120
 we were satisfied with how they were 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:36.770
 things go but an unknown evil was 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.839
 at the door and would have shaken 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.839
 irremediably our souls
