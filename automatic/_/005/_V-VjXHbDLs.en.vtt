 buenos aires sea 

00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:03.870
 We'll see that 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.290
 efe this time more important 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.219
 we have seen the match 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.599
 p because a pleonasm 4 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:20.249
 is where on March 13 this year Latinos 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.749
 like dessert weights 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.749
 we will support those who tan 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:34.539
 gasoline after several hours this is what the towns do 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.820
 and in the extreme 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.820
 of the movement let's see 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.350
 on the other hand 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.580
 to name a few 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.420
 You have to ask yourself why we are doing very well 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.740
 and if you look, they are like photographers 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.040
 united by death 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.310
 well, that's for 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.310
 a bit to counter digital forces 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.070
 that's why what he does is central 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.420
 we wait for the goods 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.450
 and so it has been an absolute madness to paint them 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.570
 service members 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.050
 the dismissal 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.720
 the montÃ¡s management party is right 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.080
 foxconn 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.259
 a camshaft 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.610
 with little use as it is so new the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.610
 and between those terms 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.340
 a little used with which arrived 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.340
 as this team already did in his work 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.110
 these are the counterweights 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.000
 without energy counterweights 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.490
 when 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.119
 photo and several ports what they thought putting out fires 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.150
 so that the criteria 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.290
 n the summit will do 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.020
 for rescue 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.860
 that if you look here here is where lean in Argentina is where he supports the 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.890
 tomorrow the bulge 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.680
 what you do is very low labor 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.530
 apart 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.350
 we have won 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.350
 there are four problems 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.280
 ambitions chaplains in this one at the opposite end of bullet the black bomb
