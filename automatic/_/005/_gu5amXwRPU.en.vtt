00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 my sports mates start in this 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.509
 video is about how to do his 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.710
 body fat percentage finds out and many 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.480
 have asked me how do I get mine 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.190
 hangover out I want to go here 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.769
 there is a rule two 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.440
 typical or classic variation 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.150
 probably the classic and oldest method 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.859
 is actually the body fat 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.060
 caliber his skin forceps 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.949
 there you actually measure the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.630
 Fold body fat over the skin 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.670
 Dense one has certain points where one 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.380
 this pliers attaches then there is such a 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.179
 art scala and that's how you can be 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.040
 body fat fraction find out that 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.750
 simply the cheapest variation and 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.130
 maybe one of the best 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.899
 but there are also many 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.960
 body fat dare and is europe 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.000
 internet wlan body fat and so on 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.570
 on and on and on and on, especially 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.090
 About the biometric impedance analysis 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.430
 I determine the body fat, so to speak 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.160
 have one here the whole time too 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.520
 present and disadvantages 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.260
 filter out 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.000
 that we now have a normal balance 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.160
 the advantage was that they were on the body 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.109
 Finding fat can do that 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.270
 she at this like electric nikon dax 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.100
 Analysis of two electrodes that are 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.450
 in here at the end of football like 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 you do not see now and the whole 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.540
 you do not realize that means when I am 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.939
 especially now barefoot I have to 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.010
 I put myself on it and 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.810
 then here comes in the end about this 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.509
 two electrons small alternating current 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.659
 entering the body and detecting 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.970
 in the end, by the ratio of 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.860
 fat and muscle mass so to speak my 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.049
 Body fat percentage there you have this 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.000
 know that for example electrical 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.869
 Stream through the water is especially good 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.509
 is headed and fat has about 13 percent 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.270
 water muscle mass, however, 70 percent 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.040
 Water that means if I have more now 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.570
 Of course, I have muscle mass 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.100
 a better body fat percentage because 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.320
 this AC is my body 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.689
 I am better guided 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.670
 because I have more resistance that is 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.409
 my or this AC is going very well 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.290
 bad through the body and then shows 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.680
 listen to the level of 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.270
 body fat percentage 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.030
 So the problem is with the whole 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.460
 history in any case yes if I 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.170
 now at different times of the day me 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.750
 I have drunk more on that 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.170
 or 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.820
 water lost so yes influenced 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.200
 so to speak, my water balance was me 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.970
 also to take me daily if I am now 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.320
 lost a lot of water after the sport 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.210
 or have drunk a lot 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.710
 that influences this , so to speak 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.500
 messegebnis yes because as I said that 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.090
 water then a point is why in 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.100
 this alternating current is better conducted 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.020
 and with seawater in it 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.209
 of course, the body fat in this 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.070
 body fat percentage after that better 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.959
 that is why there are many inaccurate ones 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.520
 home therefore definitely the first 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.590
 point to note that in this 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.360
 Body fat scale makes it in any case 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.520
 always at the same time of day 'nen tip 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.620
 always in the morning in any case where 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.510
 example water balance relative 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.160
 is identical then there's still disadvantage 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.730
 in this body fat scale now also in 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.340
 room 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.930
 yes, we measure here only to share the foot 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.250
 that means you are becoming alternating current 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.860
 over the feet into the body 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.780
 Guided and sometimes goes well 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.520
 not upwards but before 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.320
 everything in the lower extremities becomes 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.000
 the body fat percentage determined over it 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.530
 now there are even better ones 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.940
 maybe even expensive where I still dare 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.560
 a hand partakers which means I have 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.810
 once the electrons on the feet and 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.250
 on the hands and so on the stream 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.570
 of course, throughout the body and so on 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.260
 maybe we have a better one 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.549
 Result 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.200
 I want to have you all 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.360
 Above all, is also presented as 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.950
 cool gadget just is the whole thing 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.530
 for example, with the ipad here 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.720
 is synonymous in mobile or im also synonymous 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.900
 a laptop computer the format 30 can 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.190
 Now this wlan was connect over 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.660
 Of course it's great that they are 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.519
 now on white as I'm done or 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.900
 how full I lie but now one too 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.430
 funny story to determine that 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.019
 the advantage of the whole story is 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.070
 now, of course, a lot 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.019
 but I have it for example 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.510
 also a kind of chart analysis i can 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.400
 For example, the course over several 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.350
 weeks or months yes so to speak 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.540
 control yes and I do the whole thing 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.340
 times before that means I give you first 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.700
 all my data one of these app to 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.049
 for now I'm here to start 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.040
 and now he tells me to go 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.490
 within the next five minutes 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.390
 draufstellen to this level 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.800
 my body weight we set the scales 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.810
 now I am told this 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:10.240
 AC 's feet are routed and 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:15.720
 I'm used to body fat again 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.720
 I am now at about 76 kilos at the moment 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.810
 sony shows who while I'm on him 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:29.050
 That way it is sometimes said 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:30.040
 also about other apps 76 1 gram more 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.220
 kilogram fat 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.960
 yes and now I'm going back to this 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.500
 and now he shows me here 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.620
 I'm currently at 10 2 percent 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:45.130
 body fat 61 5% water balance 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.160
 muscle mass at 47 6 percent the demi 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.930
 since then also at 23 5 what to say 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.400
 now the values as I said my body 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.080
 changed a currently I am also 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.460
 while it could, of course, is it true one 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.600
 is a little worse with 10.2 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.910
 right now because I'm really one 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.300
 little muscle mass tries to hang up 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.560
 and of course it is not possible with 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.960
 without the fat a bit of 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.090
 the gain is just very clear 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.290
 Facts of course, but funny too 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.850
 know how that would not be 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.580
 especially if my drink then 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.470
 Body fat percentage here about this analysis 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.790
 that would normally have to be changed 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.110
 if I drink a liter of water now 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.280
 that maybe I'll get a percent or something 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.840
 come as far as that 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.300
 That's probably possible at most 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.190
 sometimes in different daily pokes 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.110
 try so clearly makes 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.970
 that at the same time of day then have 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.800
 We here still water to home 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.930
 of course very good muscle mass 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:37.030
 at 47 6 percent 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.500
 bmi So body mass index at 23 5 is 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.780
 actually a kind of ghana where we are 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.450
 can see if we are overweight 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.990
 or not usually is with men 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.940
 the scale so you at about 25 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.870
 overweight or obese are now 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.970
 Of course you have to say that 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.140
 the body mass index is really only valid 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.610
 on body weight that means we 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.280
 athletes who really do weight training 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.360
 this bmi is not really 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.520
 meaningfully gives the bodybuilder the 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.350
 100 kilos but not really fat 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.780
 then 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.730
 the display that they are often the 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.740
 since the evil really nonsense in 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.720
 on the one hand, if your baby 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.920
 want to find out without this vague since 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.350
 you do not need expensive cars for 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.150
 entry it would have to be his body weight 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.040
 divided by body size to the square 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.300
 then you can simply bmi 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.750
 calculate the balance does not need 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:24.720
 once that is short for a Conclusion 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.920
 body fat scales it's a cool gadget 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.420
 to control yourself 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.220
 you have to say if you really want to 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.930
 bodybuilding or professional sports 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.020
 Of course, this is not accurate 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.730
 analysis we have but it can be done in 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.070
 you want to motivate my eyes to 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:40.350
 same daytime we have one 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.670
 Hard guideline was finding out 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.280
 can like our body fat percentage 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.360
 is about bmi we need in that 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.230
 if not, we can do it ourselves 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.840
 find out 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.180
 in terms of price they are now just this 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.860
 web connect cars at about 100 to 120 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.980
 Euro I can kick it to you the link 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.140
 yes recommendation who is really 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.120
 be professional as I said that one 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.800
 Wlan receiver who really 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.560
 Be professional in body fat 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.180
 do not want to find out who this 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.380
 really want to have a motivation 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.630
 would like to have a guide 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.220
 and of course a kind of diagram

 my technique cool gadget and yes me 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.950
 I'll test it every now and then 

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.530

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.610
 different body tatzeiten is her 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.600
