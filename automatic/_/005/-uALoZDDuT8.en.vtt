00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
runs point I'm old-fashioned so do a

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.459 
runs point I'm old-fashioned so do a
quick<00:00:12.179> videos<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:13.019> what<00:00:13.200> they<00:00:13.320> look<00:00:13.440> like

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
quick videos and what they look like

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.029 
quick videos and what they look like
when<00:00:13.650> they<00:00:13.920> hat<00:00:14.240> how<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.299> clean<00:00:15.570> them<00:00:15.839> what<00:00:16.800> we

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
when they hat how to clean them what we

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.220 
when they hat how to clean them what we
would<00:00:17.250> say<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.760> have<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> second<00:00:20.900> well<00:00:21.900> i<00:00:22.050> got

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
would say and have a second well i got

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.560 
would say and have a second well i got
the<00:00:22.320> set<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.590> points<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.880> oer<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.539> a

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the set of points that the oer is a

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.500 
the set of points that the oer is a
little<00:00:24.869> mechanical<00:00:25.439> switch<00:00:26.060> just<00:00:27.060> open<00:00:27.390> and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
little mechanical switch just open and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.500 
little mechanical switch just open and
close<00:00:28.130> is<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.369> rubbing<00:00:29.730> block<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.119> rubs<00:00:30.330> on

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
close is the rubbing block that rubs on

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.120 
close is the rubbing block that rubs on
a<00:00:30.539> distributor<00:00:31.289> can<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:32.250> open<00:00:34.070> let's<00:00:35.070> just

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
a distributor can it open let's just

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.000 
a distributor can it open let's just
charged<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> toil<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.540> when<00:00:36.719> they<00:00:36.840> open<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
charged the toil and when they open the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.190 
charged the toil and when they open the
primary<00:00:38.520> winding<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.120> coil<00:00:39.420> induces<00:00:40.170> a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
primary winding of the coil induces a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.110 
primary winding of the coil induces a
voltage<00:00:40.320> into<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> secondary<00:00:41.370> widening<00:00:41.879> and

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
voltage into the secondary widening and

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.540 
voltage into the secondary widening and
if<00:00:42.270> they<00:00:42.450> get<00:00:42.629> your<00:00:42.780> spark<00:00:43.129> and<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.280> open

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
if they get your spark and the open

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.500 
if they get your spark and the open
about<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.940> much<00:00:46.910> these<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.180> been<00:00:48.450> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
about that much these have been a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.389 
about that much these have been a
burning<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.140> contacts<00:00:49.620> which<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.010> can

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
burning on the contacts which you can

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.979 
burning on the contacts which you can
see<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.969> camera<00:00:52.489> think<00:00:53.489> nope<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:54.870> can

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
see on this camera think nope so we can

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.840 
see on this camera think nope so we can
do<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.350> some<00:00:55.500> sandpaper<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.460> not<00:00:56.670> too

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
do you get some sandpaper it's not too

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.959 
do you get some sandpaper it's not too
bad<00:00:57.030> file<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.140> very<00:00:58.379> bad<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.820> just

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
bad file if it's very bad and you just

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.970

follow us it's all nice flat plain
surface<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:03.359> contact<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.080> very<00:01:04.350> nice<00:01:05.689> way<00:01:06.689> to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
surface the contact is very nice way to

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.289 
surface the contact is very nice way to
do<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.110> paper<00:01:08.689> quick<00:01:09.689> demo<00:01:10.820> get<00:01:11.820> points

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
do this paper quick demo get points

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.630 
do this paper quick demo get points
Stoke<00:01:13.170> them<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:15.799> put<00:01:16.799> sand<00:01:17.100> paper<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.520> between

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
Stoke them up put sand paper in between

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:28.280 
Stoke them up put sand paper in between
the<00:01:17.970> contact<00:01:26.869> need<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.960> add<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> little

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the contact need to add a little

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.160 
the contact need to add a little

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
the condenser back in again all right I

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.609 
the condenser back in again all right I
pleated<00:02:07.700> potatoes<00:02:08.060> at<00:02:08.180> all<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.080> nice<00:02:09.380> new

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
pleated potatoes at all and so nice new

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.760 
pleated potatoes at all and so nice new
distributor<00:02:10.100> cap<00:02:10.340> on<00:02:10.520> it<00:02:11.350> I'll<00:02:12.350> put<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.590> cap

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
distributor cap on it I'll put the cap

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.420 
distributor cap on it I'll put the cap
back<00:02:12.800> on<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.220> start<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.700> up<00:02:13.760> again<00:02:13.880> oh<00:02:15.430> they're
