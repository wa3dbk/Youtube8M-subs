planets but the two other ones I'll get

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.950 
planets but the two other ones I'll get
to<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.570> second<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.950> one<00:02:02.210> really<00:02:03.210> see<00:02:03.630> I

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
to in a second this one really see I

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.190 
to in a second this one really see I
guess<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.590> can't<00:02:04.829> really<00:02:05.070> miss<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.930> if<00:02:06.930> you

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
guess you can't really miss it if you

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.650 
guess you can't really miss it if you
try<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.649> get<00:02:08.129> it

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
try to get it

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.070 
try to get it
titanium<00:02:10.660> bolt<00:02:10.810> number<00:02:10.930> six<00:02:11.670> same<00:02:12.670> planets

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
titanium bolt number six same planets

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.200 
titanium bolt number six same planets
but<00:02:14.080> tear<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.620> got<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.130> have<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.790> magnetic

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
but tear you got to have the magnetic

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.680 
but tear you got to have the magnetic

going base nothing required for the
first<00:06:31.599> one<00:06:31.779> but<00:06:31.990> here<00:06:32.289> you<00:06:32.830> need<00:06:32.919> a<00:06:32.979> slingshot

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
first one but here you need a slingshot

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.040 
first one but here you need a slingshot
to<00:06:33.610> get<00:06:33.909> over<00:06:34.210> this<00:06:34.479> gap<00:06:34.870> River<00:06:36.330> and<00:06:37.330> go<00:06:37.360> in

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
to get over this gap River and go in

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.679 
to get over this gap River and go in
here<00:06:38.259> it's<00:06:38.860> kind<00:06:39.370> of<00:06:39.460> you<00:06:40.029> know<00:06:40.089> obvious

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:40.689 
here it's kind of you know obvious

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:42.059 
here it's kind of you know obvious
because<00:06:41.080> you<00:06:41.259> can<00:06:41.379> see<00:06:41.560> there's<00:06:41.740> a<00:06:41.860> tunnel

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069 
because you can see there's a tunnel

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:45.119 
because you can see there's a tunnel
inside<00:06:42.460> there<00:06:42.930> which<00:06:43.930> is<00:06:44.589> kind<00:06:44.919> of<00:06:44.949> suspicious

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:45.129 
inside there which is kind of suspicious

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.959 
inside there which is kind of suspicious
and<00:06:46.199> then<00:06:47.199> you<00:06:47.379> can<00:06:47.560> go<00:06:48.339> in<00:06:48.460> there<00:06:48.580> catched

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:48.969 
and then you can go in there catched

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:50.550 
and then you can go in there catched
holes<00:06:49.270> if<00:06:49.569> you<00:06:49.689> have<00:06:49.810> slingshots<00:06:50.259> which<00:06:50.469> you

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
holes if you have slingshots which you

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.920 
holes if you have slingshots which you
acquire<00:06:50.800> at<00:06:51.129> starship<00:06:51.729> Phoenix<00:06:52.029> this<00:06:52.719> one

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
acquire at starship Phoenix this one

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.489 
acquire at starship Phoenix this one
requires<00:06:53.199> nothing<00:06:54.539> the<00:06:55.539> slingshot<00:06:56.229> thing

00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:56.499 
requires nothing the slingshot thing

00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:00.059 
requires nothing the slingshot thing
whatever<00:06:57.990> but<00:06:58.990> I<00:06:59.259> guess<00:06:59.379> if<00:06:59.499> you<00:06:59.589> got<00:06:59.710> air<00:06:59.889> you

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:00.069 
whatever but I guess if you got air you

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:02.189 
whatever but I guess if you got air you
already<00:07:00.399> have<00:07:00.580> it<00:07:00.729> so<00:07:00.909> a<00:07:01.120> kind<00:07:01.899> of<00:07:01.930> tricky

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 
already have it so a kind of tricky

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:06.689 
already have it so a kind of tricky
course<00:07:02.500> you<00:07:02.770> have<00:07:02.889> to<00:07:03.449> SAP<00:07:04.449> these<00:07:05.699> platforms

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:06.699 
course you have to SAP these platforms

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:08.779

while<00:07:06.969> you're<00:07:07.180> in<00:07:07.270> the<00:07:07.389> air<00:07:07.539> and<00:07:07.689> stuff<00:07:07.870> but<00:07:08.080> I

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:08.789 
while you're in the air and stuff but I

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:11.159 
while you're in the air and stuff but I
mean<00:07:09.789> you<00:07:09.909> gotta<00:07:10.060> be<00:07:10.120> stupid<00:07:10.360> sooo<00:07:10.870> not<00:07:10.990> make

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 
it so nothing required as I said I think

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.689 
it so nothing required as I said I think
