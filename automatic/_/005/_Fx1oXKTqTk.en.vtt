00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.759
 that's wrong 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.529
 the day is ok 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.889
 it may be that cut into pieces why all these operations 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:16.129
 so they are 1 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.580
 for its part a problem it will be just a little more forget complement a little more 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:21.820
 constructively 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.159
 find the right solution 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:25.239
 of two the bill 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.689
 to be able to get the balloon one layer 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:29.669
 a diaper 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.669
 So it's my friends who is unique 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.060
 fred couples 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.210
 it's really when we see everything 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.050
 Tuesday 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.480
 no matter the cost 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.000
 group 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.880
 a very good team on the 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.420
 m a little bit of things Sunday but a second row 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.190
 it's not serious it's something that is done 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.500
 another who will be caught on fire with powders 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.730
 so there will be a lot of importance to us the second base in 2007 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.040
 ankle 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.040
 andrÃ© ok 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.160
 I found that it turns 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.510
 the paint is enough to the tray we have a little the same color 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.480
 now he's gone she's clear 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.300
 maximum thinning 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.840
 1 at the airport 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.000
 Unusable the color board 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.680
 a color 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.730
 on the waterfront where to go 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.200
 a little bit of agreement we can indeed base with the first base afp 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.780
 that's why the first glance 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.760
 the report is about a minute in Brussels for a meeting with the 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.490
 highest colors 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.230
 not content to be able to possibly one is unique the best delays 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.190
 agreed 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.130
 thereafter 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.240
 ok i wanted to change but change buses and eat better a refreshment 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.740
 the number of our competition work a little later 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.460
 women who die 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.460
 before you start 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.010
 I worked on the net 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.209
 but this is the place that wants to understand who is supposed to take the light 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.649
 maximum 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.889
 our cause 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:26.960
 on a lawn 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.960
 the nail 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.669
 after 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.899
 to not be too much theory 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:51.979
 it is unique in the world 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.899
 these copies no visibility 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:57.409
 it's about ten seconds 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.249
 that's why he said 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.909
 we can understand that we find in products 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.260
 so here is the word that is far from the account how the means of relief 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.949
 to others can very well be tempted to storm knew that we 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.459
 had a little 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.459
 multiple like that 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.469
 despres 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.269
 the color a bit diluted but hey it's still 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.749
 besides the many rumors% 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.269
 ten million pounds 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:43.869
 the light 

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:50.669
 to appreciate more than others will spend December a few names 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.779
 snoring more than an hour and a half a little bit of a polemic that mine 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:57.209
 this Friday on the skin colors of this world 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.439
 they took control of one or the other 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.349
 and for 100 m 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:04.349
 and all that well 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.310
 so that now euros here is the result with basic color of 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.879
 first clearings first thinning 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.079
 say so 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.529
 he believes he sees 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:17.319
 to have some thinning 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:21.829
 the water comes light a little bit by the judge for catching on the top 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:22.729
 of range 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.159
 on the saga edge the city 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:27.539
 it's called like that 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.710
 a little bit on the folds 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.559
 we will go now 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.559
 laying the paint a little darker first string 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:41.819
 many have believed in me I wear for more than 18 years or more or less romero 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.329
 google the first day of league the commune close to us 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.779
 so it's a it's a court of accounts 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.300
 Tunisia counts 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.659
 this level 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:10.369
 so inside the country the worst is the place where chuck troops 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.080
 It's good news 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.279
 the founder steve jobs is a bit more complex 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.210
 football tournament in addition to 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
 c 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.520
 once 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.229
 more than planned 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
 same curve 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:07.629
 both of tendinitis 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.300
 but what goes around in common areas that are very tight 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.349
 the blue color like laid a rabbit or not a penny 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:21.240
 besides a very french color 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.240
 I think that basically it is that we wish all horizons 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.330
 it's good news so take only a few days 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
 both groups need 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.139
 no big idea that however 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:09.699
 windows 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.659
 ok so the opportunity 

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:17.569
 maintain 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:20.599
 the most likely renault worker is that the more you do not know 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:21.010
 really 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.010
 the ccrb 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:28.999
 boulogne 

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:31.059
 Yes 

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:33.680
 we will not be able 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.479
 these are things 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:38.699
 that we will take over the reins of the asse where she worked 

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:40.990
 she works 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.340
 as well as a swimming pool 

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.080
 on that plane
