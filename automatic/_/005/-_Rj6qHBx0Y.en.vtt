 tan tan 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:20.310
 Yes, also I would like doing it with the right hand side of the swing when it is this time cutting 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:24.980
 I 'm going to try cutting now or practice cutting now, but something 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:32.879
 It has become a video you want to see by all means to those who say that it does not work well 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:43.760
 I think booby prize 1 ante ring's Sauer in the first Let's go in tomorrow or faction Doudou Iide 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:43.760
 If you would hear you You're the top right corner of the pretend sludge put away the Masu quite often O in Kyuu 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.530
 Do 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:52.870
 This Nde that it is this 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.800
 A good sound of cutting 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:02.930
 I can't play with fast-paced cutting 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:08.780
 Become Shindoku come dripping in addition and are listening quite a long period of time the right hand 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:12.200
 It is the capital of whether I should How Well you become of how you play not so good in the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.100
 I will use this wrist and put on my wrist 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.400
 This I bend I'm a mean go but wrist 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:25.690
 With your arms straight 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:28.690
 When I bend it, I don't bend so much, and I wonder what to do 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.710
 In a state in which the bending of the wrist 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.710
 When I bend my wrist 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:43.480
 Then the range of movement becomes quite wide 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:48.650
 At this time it is the point, but if you shake it to the left and right with the wrist bent, 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:53.300
 I think I can feel that the arm itself is rotating Arm itself school 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:57.770
 I think you feel like you're meeting like this 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:05.240
 The Tteyuu de cutting is it is rather than swing the arm 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:08.640
 Toka'm nice off and play with the allocated points to play you in the arm with the rotation of the arm 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:14.190
 It will be able to go even Toka say fast-paced selfish to an extended period of time 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.430
 I don't get tired even if I listen, I actually do not move my arm so much when I pull the cutting with this 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.430
 right 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.950
 The arm is not moving so much 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.930
 I want to do my best 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:39.450
 By all means is anyone who wants the right hand of the swing of the cutting is the Do not go What do very much well 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:46.380
 Without Hikunja in the arm after the Please try to try to the Tteyuu play in this rotation 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:52.430
 Because that would withstand either the later years when the power is on and in academic achievement and weakness 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.430
 Thank you for trying it out and it will be over this time 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.850
 Hmm 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.420
 Yup
