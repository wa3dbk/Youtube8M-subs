III<00:00:59.799> personally<00:01:00.309> believe<00:01:00.820> that<00:01:01.059> given<00:01:02.049> the

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
III personally believe that given the

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.960 
III personally believe that given the
old<00:01:02.320> motto<00:01:02.680> especially<00:01:03.250> in<00:01:03.309> Jurassic<00:01:03.760> world

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
old motto especially in Jurassic world

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.870 
old motto especially in Jurassic world
bigger<00:01:04.570> louder<00:01:05.229> and<00:01:05.680> more<00:01:05.799> teeth<00:01:06.130> I<00:01:06.400> think<00:01:06.700> it

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
bigger louder and more teeth I think it

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.270 
bigger louder and more teeth I think it
doesn't<00:01:07.090> come<00:01:07.390> any<00:01:07.600> bigger<00:01:08.070> than<00:01:09.070> the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
doesn't come any bigger than the

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.919 
doesn't come any bigger than the
Megalodon<00:01:09.579> now<00:01:09.939> for<00:01:10.149> me<00:01:10.240> personally<00:01:10.509> I<00:01:10.780> think

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929 
Megalodon now for me personally I think

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:12.690 
Megalodon now for me personally I think
that<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.350> Megalodon<00:01:11.649> should<00:01:12.039> be<00:01:12.159> introduced

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
that the Megalodon should be introduced

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.749 
that the Megalodon should be introduced
um<00:01:12.909> especially<00:01:13.689> to<00:01:14.109> have<00:01:14.289> something<00:01:14.829> you<00:01:15.640> know

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
being contained in a very large pool it

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.149 
being contained in a very large pool it
was<00:01:25.420> an<00:01:25.539> absolute<00:01:26.140> monster<00:01:26.409> in<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:26.829> of<00:01:26.890> itself

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
was an absolute monster in and of itself

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.499 
was an absolute monster in and of itself
but<00:01:27.340> what<00:01:27.460> if<00:01:27.549> they<00:01:27.640> decided<00:01:27.999> to<00:01:28.030> add<00:01:28.240> and

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.389 
but what if they decided to add and
resurrect<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.380> Megalodon<00:01:29.740> like<00:01:30.100> now<00:01:30.219> I<00:01:30.249> I

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
resurrect the Megalodon like now I I

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.910 
resurrect the Megalodon like now I I
personally<00:01:31.119> think<00:01:31.270> bringing<00:01:31.659> back<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:32.109> 70<00:01:32.799> to

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
personally think bringing back a 70 to

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.039 
personally think bringing back a 70 to
80<00:01:33.100> foot<00:01:33.369> shark<00:01:33.640> is<00:01:34.030> just<00:01:34.299> terrifying<00:01:34.569> enough

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
80 foot shark is just terrifying enough

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.959 
80 foot shark is just terrifying enough
and<00:01:35.289> of<00:01:35.710> course<00:01:35.979> they<00:01:36.249> can<00:01:36.399> always<00:01:36.640> have<00:01:36.850> the

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
and of course they can always have the

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:38.730 
and of course they can always have the
Moses<00:01:37.329> or<00:01:37.479> battle<00:01:37.840> Dimetrodon<00:01:38.319> and<00:01:38.499> one<00:01:38.590> like

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
Moses or battle Dimetrodon and one like

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.840 
Moses or battle Dimetrodon and one like
that<00:01:38.799> like<00:01:39.039> that<00:01:39.069> that<00:01:39.369> would<00:01:39.490> be<00:01:39.609> absolutely

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
that like that that would be absolutely

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.179 
that like that that would be absolutely
amazing<00:01:40.210> um<00:01:40.539> they<00:01:41.140> could<00:01:41.200> always<00:01:41.439> go<00:01:41.799> down<00:01:42.130> a

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
amazing um they could always go down a

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.559 
amazing um they could always go down a
different<00:01:42.609> path<00:01:42.850> where<00:01:43.179> you<00:01:43.210> know<00:01:43.450> the

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569

or escapes from like its captivity and
whatnot<00:01:47.499> and<00:01:47.770> then<00:01:48.100> then<00:01:48.249> we<00:01:48.369> get<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.179> see<00:01:49.299> like

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
whatnot and then then we get to see like

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:50.819 
whatnot and then then we get to see like
the<00:01:49.509> Moses<00:01:49.840> or<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.109> the<00:01:50.170> Megalodon<00:01:50.439> throw

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
the Moses or and the Megalodon throw

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.039 
the Moses or and the Megalodon throw
down<00:01:51.039> as<00:01:51.249> they<00:01:51.729> meet<00:01:51.880> up<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.240> know<00:01:52.359> since<00:01:52.899> to

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
down as they meet up you know since to

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.149 
down as they meet up you know since to
give<00:01:53.139> them<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.289> fact<00:01:53.439> that<00:01:53.560> both<00:01:53.649> pools<00:01:53.979> or

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
give them the fact that both pools or

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.289 
give them the fact that both pools or
you<00:01:54.219> know<00:01:54.340> pretty<00:01:54.520> much<00:01:54.670> broken<00:01:54.939> right<00:01:55.179> now

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
you know pretty much broken right now

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.059 
you know pretty much broken right now
we're<00:01:55.479> not<00:01:55.630> it<00:01:55.960> would<00:01:56.499> have<00:01:56.590> been<00:01:56.829> absolutely

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
we're not it would have been absolutely

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.819 
we're not it would have been absolutely
amazing<00:01:57.789> to<00:01:58.060> see<00:01:58.240> now<00:01:58.389> of<00:01:58.450> course<00:01:58.630> um<00:01:58.929> given

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
amazing to see now of course um given

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.590 
amazing to see now of course um given
that<00:01:59.950> fact<00:02:00.219> I<00:02:00.490> think<00:02:00.549> that<00:02:00.819> personally<00:02:01.299> for<00:02:01.450> me

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
that fact I think that personally for me

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.969 
that fact I think that personally for me
the<00:02:01.780> Megalodon<00:02:02.170> should<00:02:02.560> definitely<00:02:02.889> be

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
the Megalodon should definitely be

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.219 
the Megalodon should definitely be
introduced<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.759> perhaps<00:02:04.119> maybe<00:02:04.569> even<00:02:04.959> feed

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
introduced and perhaps maybe even feed

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.830 
introduced and perhaps maybe even feed
the<00:02:05.409> Megalodon<00:02:05.740> other<00:02:06.729> dinosaurs<00:02:07.359> I<00:02:07.479> mean<00:02:07.689> you

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
the Megalodon other dinosaurs I mean you

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.240 
the Megalodon other dinosaurs I mean you
know<00:02:07.959> like<00:02:08.080> baby<00:02:08.319> dinosaurs<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.009> whatnot

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
know like baby dinosaurs and whatnot

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.590 
know like baby dinosaurs and whatnot
like<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.490> would<00:02:09.610> be<00:02:09.670> absolutely<00:02:09.970> awesome<00:02:10.179> to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
like that would be absolutely awesome to

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.350 
like that would be absolutely awesome to
see<00:02:10.780> if<00:02:11.200> they<00:02:11.440> decide<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.240> know

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
see if they decide to have you know

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.690 
see if they decide to have you know
aquatic<00:02:13.930> monsters<00:02:14.410> throwdown<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.190> think<00:02:15.610> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
aquatic monsters throwdown I think the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.220 
aquatic monsters throwdown I think the
Moses<00:02:16.060> or<00:02:16.240> should<00:02:16.540> throw<00:02:16.810> down<00:02:16.990> with<00:02:17.140> the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
Moses or should throw down with the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.710 
Moses or should throw down with the

if if given circumstances come about

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.190 
if if given circumstances come about
like<00:02:20.030> let's<00:02:20.180> say<00:02:20.330> for<00:02:20.510> example<00:02:20.870> they<00:02:20.990> both

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
like let's say for example they both

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.990 
like let's say for example they both
escape<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.800> they<00:02:22.130> end<00:02:22.310> up<00:02:22.460> crossing<00:02:22.700> each

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
escape and they end up crossing each

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.340 
escape and they end up crossing each
other's<00:02:23.210> paths<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.660> stuff<00:02:23.840> like<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:24.110> like

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
other's paths and stuff like that like

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.320 
other's paths and stuff like that like
that<00:02:24.680> would<00:02:24.800> be<00:02:24.830> awesome<00:02:25.250> or<00:02:25.340> for<00:02:25.520> if<00:02:25.910> for

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
that would be awesome or for if for

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.210 
that would be awesome or for if for
example<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.840> know<00:02:26.960> they<00:02:27.410> decide<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.770> have<00:02:28.040> the

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
example you know they decide to have the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.890 
example you know they decide to have the
spinosaurus<00:02:28.940> in<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.150> movie<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.570> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
and the next thing you know like the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.920 
and the next thing you know like the
Megalodon<00:02:40.610> just<00:02:41.000> like<00:02:41.120> grabs<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.720> whole<00:02:41.900> and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
Megalodon just like grabs it whole and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.300 
Megalodon just like grabs it whole and
just<00:02:42.200> like<00:02:42.320> tears<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.710> apart<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:43.070> stuff<00:02:43.220> like

just like tears it apart and stuff like
that<00:02:43.670> like<00:02:43.850> that<00:02:44.000> would<00:02:44.090> be<00:02:44.120> absolutely

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
that like that would be absolutely

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.020 
that like that would be absolutely
amazing<00:02:45.050> um<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.710> sheer<00:02:45.950> power<00:02:46.280> of<00:02:46.490> the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
amazing um the sheer power of the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.510 
amazing um the sheer power of the
Megalodon<00:02:47.330> jaws<00:02:47.930> are<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:48.740> so<00:02:48.950> immense<00:02:49.340> it

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
Megalodon jaws are just so immense it

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.130 
Megalodon jaws are just so immense it
will<00:02:49.640> be<00:02:49.700> able<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:50.030> crush<00:02:50.300> any<00:02:50.510> dinosaur<00:02:51.080> in

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
will be able to crush any dinosaur in

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.320 
will be able to crush any dinosaur in
its<00:02:51.260> path<00:02:51.410> so<00:02:51.650> for<00:02:51.830> me<00:02:51.920> personally<00:02:51.950> um<00:02:52.610> I<00:02:53.180> think

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
its path so for me personally um I think

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.850 
its path so for me personally um I think
if<00:02:53.600> they<00:02:53.690> if<00:02:53.930> they<00:02:54.080> want<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.470> do<00:02:54.620> something

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
if they if they want to do something

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.390 
if they if they want to do something
different

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
different

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.460 
different
I<00:02:55.490> think<00:02:56.030> introducing<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.810> Megalodon<00:02:57.140> would

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
I think introducing the Megalodon would

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.840 
I think introducing the Megalodon would
definitely<00:02:57.800> be<00:02:57.860> something<00:02:58.100> awesome<00:02:58.370> because

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
definitely be something awesome because

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.060 
definitely be something awesome because
like<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.510> said<00:02:59.570> guys<00:02:59.890> realistically<00:03:00.890> people

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
like I said guys realistically people

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.670 
like I said guys realistically people
fear<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.490> sharks<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.930> just<00:03:03.260> doesn't<00:03:03.590> get

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
fear of sharks and it just doesn't get

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.150 
fear of sharks and it just doesn't get
any<00:03:03.740> more<00:03:04.040> terrifying<00:03:04.700> than<00:03:04.880> having<00:03:05.240> a<00:03:05.360> grown

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
any more terrifying than having a grown

any more terrifying than having a grown

like<00:03:12.890> have<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.250> battle<00:03:13.580> other<00:03:13.700> dinosaurs<00:03:14.240> and

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
like have it battle other dinosaurs and

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.610 
like have it battle other dinosaurs and
whatnot<00:03:14.600> perhaps<00:03:14.930> maybe<00:03:15.170> there<00:03:15.380> can<00:03:15.500> be<00:03:15.530> a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
whatnot perhaps maybe there can be a

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.500 
whatnot perhaps maybe there can be a
scene<00:03:15.920> where<00:03:16.130> certain<00:03:16.850> dinosaurs<00:03:17.360> are

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
scene where certain dinosaurs are

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.940 
scene where certain dinosaurs are
getting<00:03:17.690> knocked<00:03:17.870> off<00:03:18.050> into<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.410> pool<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:18.860> it

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
getting knocked off into the pool and it

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.740 
getting knocked off into the pool and it
becomes<00:03:19.250> like<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.520> feeding<00:03:19.730> frenzy<00:03:19.850> for<00:03:20.660> the

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
becomes like a feeding frenzy for the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.330 
becomes like a feeding frenzy for the
Moses<00:03:21.110> or<00:03:21.290> for<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.530> Megalodon<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.160> stuff

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
Moses or for the Megalodon and stuff

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.280 
Moses or for the Megalodon and stuff
like<00:03:22.459> that<00:03:22.670> so<00:03:22.940> even<00:03:23.540> though<00:03:23.660> we<00:03:23.810> already<00:03:23.959> know

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
like that so even though we already know

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.290 
like that so even though we already know
that<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.830> Megalodon<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.550> a<00:03:25.580> shark<00:03:26.000> there's

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
that the Megalodon is a shark there's

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.270 
that the Megalodon is a shark there's
absolutely<00:03:26.989> no<00:03:27.230> way<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.470> can<00:03:27.680> go<00:03:27.830> on<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.040> land

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
absolutely no way you can go on the land

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.640 
absolutely no way you can go on the land
you<00:03:29.239> know<00:03:29.360> scratching<00:03:29.840> off<00:03:29.959> sharknado<00:03:30.530> of

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
you know scratching off sharknado of

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.470 
you know scratching off sharknado of
course<00:03:30.920> but<00:03:31.190> uh<00:03:31.220> you<00:03:31.730> know<00:03:31.820> like<00:03:31.880> big<00:03:32.330> they

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
course but uh you know like big they

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.970 
course but uh you know like big they
could<00:03:32.630> have<00:03:32.780> other<00:03:32.959> dinosaurs<00:03:33.530> that<00:03:33.739> are<00:03:33.830> to

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
could have other dinosaurs that are to

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.640 
could have other dinosaurs that are to
have<00:03:34.130> both<00:03:34.340> land<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:35.450> you<00:03:35.870> know<00:03:35.959> oceanic<00:03:36.530> you

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
have both land and you know oceanic you

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.410 
have both land and you know oceanic you
know<00:03:36.790> characteristics<00:03:37.790> come<00:03:37.880> about<00:03:38.090> like<00:03:38.270> the

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
know characteristics come about like the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.050 
know characteristics come about like the
Spinosaurus<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.620> Spinosaurus<00:03:40.220> can<00:03:40.730> actually

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
Spinosaurus the Spinosaurus can actually

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.390 
Spinosaurus the Spinosaurus can actually
go<00:03:41.209> in<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.420> water<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.870> travel<00:03:42.739> on<00:03:42.860> land<00:03:43.160> so

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
go in the water and travel on land so

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.040 
go in the water and travel on land so
maybe<00:03:43.580> that<00:03:43.820> right<00:03:44.000> there<00:03:44.150> could<00:03:44.270> be<00:03:44.330> some

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
maybe that right there could be some

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.750 
maybe that right there could be some
sort<00:03:45.200> of<00:03:45.290> key<00:03:45.530> feature<00:03:45.830> to<00:03:46.010> where<00:03:46.340> it's<00:03:46.519> it's

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
sort of key feature to where it's it's

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.280 
sort of key feature to where it's it's
you<00:03:47.000> know<00:03:47.030> resurrected<00:03:47.630> once<00:03:47.810> again<00:03:48.080> and

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
you know resurrected once again and

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.870 
you know resurrected once again and
something<00:03:48.890> happens<00:03:49.250> to<00:03:49.430> where<00:03:49.550> like<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:49.790> know

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
something happens to where like you know

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.860 
something happens to where like you know
the<00:03:50.000> spine<00:03:50.209> is<00:03:50.330> sort<00:03:50.450> of<00:03:50.480> gets<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:50.780> know

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
the spine is sort of gets you know

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.330 
the spine is sort of gets you know
knocked<00:03:51.140> into<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.380> water<00:03:51.650> or<00:03:51.860> it<00:03:52.010> goes<00:03:52.160> into

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
knocked into the water or it goes into

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.100 
knocked into the water or it goes into
the<00:03:52.489> water<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:52.880> then<00:03:53.269> it<00:03:53.360> becomes<00:03:53.570> like<00:03:53.750> food

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
the water and then it becomes like food

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.270 
the water and then it becomes like food
for<00:03:54.320> the<00:03:54.380> Megalodon<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:54.860> stuff<00:03:54.980> like<00:03:55.070> that<00:03:55.220> or

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
for the Megalodon and stuff like that or

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.560 
for the Megalodon and stuff like that or
maybe<00:03:55.430> even<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.730> Spinosaurus<00:03:56.209> tries<00:03:56.420> to

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
maybe even the Spinosaurus tries to

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.970 
maybe even the Spinosaurus tries to
fight<00:03:56.750> off<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.050> Megalodon<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:57.709> the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
fight off the Megalodon and the

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.560 
fight off the Megalodon and the
Megalodon<00:03:58.220> just<00:03:58.519> tears<00:03:58.670> it<00:03:58.730> apart<00:03:58.910> like<00:03:59.420> that

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
Megalodon just tears it apart like that

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.490 
Megalodon just tears it apart like that
right<00:03:59.750> there<00:03:59.870> would<00:03:59.959> be<00:03:59.989> absolutely<00:04:00.440> awesome

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
right there would be absolutely awesome

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.810 
right there would be absolutely awesome

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
creature by the name of Moses or

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.350 
creature by the name of Moses or
swimming<00:04:33.980> around<00:04:34.280> in<00:04:34.460> its<00:04:34.610> own<00:04:34.760> pool<00:04:35.030> I<00:04:35.090> mean

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
swimming around in its own pool I mean

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.000 
swimming around in its own pool I mean
it<00:04:35.480> was<00:04:35.750> only<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:35.990> matter<00:04:36.170> of<00:04:36.260> time<00:04:36.530> before<00:04:36.680> he

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
it was only a matter of time before he

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.040 
it was only a matter of time before he
had<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.160> spotlight<00:04:37.730> because<00:04:38.000> we<00:04:38.210> knew<00:04:38.450> that

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
had the spotlight because we knew that

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.630 
had the spotlight because we knew that
there<00:04:39.200> wasn't<00:04:39.470> any<00:04:39.770> other<00:04:39.980> creature<00:04:40.340> out

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
there wasn't any other creature out

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.580 
there wasn't any other creature out
there<00:04:40.940> that<00:04:41.360> could<00:04:41.510> rival<00:04:41.840> it<00:04:42.140> in<00:04:42.230> terms<00:04:42.470> of

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
there that could rival it in terms of

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.800 
there that could rival it in terms of
being<00:04:42.800> in<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:43.070> ocean<00:04:43.250> so<00:04:43.670> why<00:04:43.820> not<00:04:44.000> have<00:04:44.240> you

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
being in the ocean so why not have you

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.740 
being in the ocean so why not have you
know<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.740> anonymous<00:04:46.190> wrecks<00:04:46.460> be<00:04:47.330> forced

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
know the the anonymous wrecks be forced

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.690 
know the the anonymous wrecks be forced
fed<00:04:47.930> into<00:04:48.290> the<00:04:48.380> mosasaurs<00:04:48.920> I<00:04:49.040> mean<00:04:49.160> like<00:04:49.400> even

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
fed into the mosasaurs I mean like even

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.980 
fed into the mosasaurs I mean like even
though<00:04:49.790> it<00:04:49.880> was<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.060> really<00:04:50.210> cool<00:04:50.450> scene<00:04:50.750> I

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
though it was a really cool scene I

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.660 
though it was a really cool scene I
think<00:04:51.650> that<00:04:51.830> they<00:04:51.980> should<00:04:52.190> build<00:04:52.370> off<00:04:52.640> that

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
think that they should build off that

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.490 
think that they should build off that
and<00:04:53.030> possibly<00:04:53.390> have<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.720> Moses<00:04:54.080> or<00:04:54.230> throw

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
and possibly have the Moses or throw

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.290 
and possibly have the Moses or throw
down<00:04:54.710> with<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.860> Megalodon<00:04:55.190> who<00:04:55.790> knows<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.150> mean

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
down with the Megalodon who knows I mean

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.910 
down with the Megalodon who knows I mean
the<00:04:56.390> possibilities<00:04:56.570> are<00:04:57.230> endless<00:04:57.260> I<00:04:57.680> just

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
the possibilities are endless I just

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.080 
the possibilities are endless I just
think<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.130> Megalodon<00:04:58.370> should<00:04:58.670> be<00:04:58.760> added

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
think the Megalodon should be added

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.170 
think the Megalodon should be added
because<00:04:59.180> again<00:05:00.050> it<00:05:00.290> was<00:05:00.440> one<00:05:00.620> of<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.770> largest

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
because again it was one of the largest

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.480 
because again it was one of the largest
known<00:05:02.180> sharks<00:05:02.720> ever<00:05:02.960> to<00:05:03.230> live<00:05:03.530> in<00:05:03.830> our<00:05:04.430> world

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
known sharks ever to live in our world

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.430 
known sharks ever to live in our world
and<00:05:05.060> I<00:05:05.090> think<00:05:05.420> like<00:05:05.660> having<00:05:06.050> that<00:05:06.170> come<00:05:06.320> about

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
and I think like having that come about

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.870 
and I think like having that come about
would<00:05:06.650> be<00:05:06.740> absolutely<00:05:07.190> awesome<00:05:07.400> so<00:05:07.670> let<00:05:07.820> me
