 kojima who says that the game looks 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.090
 slightly better on playstation 4 than 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.190
 my xbox one

 interview published by gamer reports 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.879
 about ground si jobs and their differences 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:59.550

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:02.430

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.500

 confirms it from kojima 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.310
 does not explain is not yet clear why 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.650
 this difference but it could be about 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.840
 the resolution different as always 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.940
 issues of resolution or simply of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.500
 textures but does not clarify it take more 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.310
 it simply says that it looks better in 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.860
 Playstation 4 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.900
 let's see it attracts me to the sun and 5 great 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.910
 been will be launched on March 18 in 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.610
 North America and March 20 in Europe 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.850

 finally when it comes out we will not give those 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:53.260
 differences whether they are texture graphics 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.700
 but I think that this is that kind of 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.560
 statements should not do them 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.720
 when time is short so that 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.610
 leave if you want the game to sell well in 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.920
 the two consoles so that 's my 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.330
