 this New Year's Eve 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.950
 we have to take into account three tricks 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.590
 so that this New Year's Eve you go to the 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.869
 last mainly show off legs a 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.380
 has some brightness so that 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.979
 dazzle is to get shine leg 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.540
 mainly the trend is 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.850
 very short dress does not see it or skirt 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.770
 is with him is with right now comes 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.350
 with platform that is much more comfortable 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.470
 that can go much higher and much more 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.930
 sure and shine for something some cycle 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.010
 jewel some extra earrings something that 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.010
 give you light in the face 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.390
 ah 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.390
 ah 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.140
 girls you have to go super pretty and 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.960
 super elegant here we have the key 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.090
 to make it easier and more practical 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.710
 a black blazer that today does not have 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.570
 a black blazer you can take it to your 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.120
 boyfriend to your father whatever it is because he has 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.210
 it is also called the blazer over 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.210
 here we have it 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.180
 being black we have added what is the 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.160
 brooch that will give you a lot of light and that 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.690
 will impact much more when you arrive and 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.940
 about this basic that all visas here 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.880
 We are going to build two looks completely 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.850
 different from party so you can see everything 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.810
 what can be done with such a garment 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.810
 basic as simple as this one 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.819
 then number one thought for a woman 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.550
 much more elegant more refined a 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.490
 little bit more conservative and it's about 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.959
 for example the skirt a skirt a tube 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.720
 tube skirt that is very easy to find 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.750
 what's left that you already have in the closet 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.750
 loui a blouse a blouse can you 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.360
 look a little at what is in the trunk of 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.959
 the memories because it 's very 80 and it's very 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.520
 easy to get too the let's say the 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.910
 trick to carry all this is the 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.160
 jewel belt and the shirt open a little 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.690
 and put on our lace bra 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.330
 we analyze the shoe also has 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.960
 lace that goes very well complemented with 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.750
 what is he about him 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.450
 and then for some pending services 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.070
 to complete what is a bit the 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.070
 silhouette of all of the whole look 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.560
 good girls and finally we are going to 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.590
 place the closet bottom that 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.180
 we were that we had seen before for 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.180
 see how good it is 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.610
 7 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.610
 black blazer with his brooch 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.290
 super stylish the man trend was 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.170
 that this season very much and for 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.459
 latest 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.459
 the kind of hand 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.340
 look how pretty she is 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.340
 and elegant 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.330
 good girls, here we have the look 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.259
 number 2 for a much younger girl 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:56.259
 much more rocker with more decision and 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.050
 make up with this very short black dress 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.580
 You have to wear a lot of leg that is very 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.949
 trend and then it goes all the veined by 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.920
 these metallic beads that gives you what 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:08.080
 it's the rocker point 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.240
 all the designers this season what 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.430
 they have done is to be inspired by the role in 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.060
 the bank then we have also we have 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.540
 placed the booty from before in color 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.240
 purple to give a little bit of color 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.740
 when going with the very short leg is very 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.520
 well that we take the booty that remains 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:31.110
 much younger and much more fun and 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.730
 finally the class s in tornasol makes 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.390
 various colors and they go very well 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:38.400
 combined with what is the loot and the 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.090
 truth that everything is very very very 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.650
 juvenile very disco and is a look that is 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:50.490

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.170
 we had spoken before today sorry for 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.020
 that you see that although it is a garment 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:04.170
 little bit more classic with the dress 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.040
 it also looks super good as you see it 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.040
 I think it 's amazing 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.390

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:40.240
