hence the fires flaring up again in the
different<00:01:18.420> areas<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.409> think<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
different areas do you think the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.740 
different areas do you think the
situation<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.490> gonna<00:01:20.790> get<00:01:20.939> worse<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.600> day

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
situation is gonna get worse as the day

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.960 
situation is gonna get worse as the day
proceeds<00:01:22.229> oh<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:23.159> almost<00:01:23.310> impossible<00:01:23.670> to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
proceeds oh it's almost impossible to

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
proceeds oh it's almost impossible to
predict<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.600> RT<00:01:24.960> but<00:01:25.140> what<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.680> tell<00:01:25.920> you

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
predict that RT but what I can tell you

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.190 
predict that RT but what I can tell you
is<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:27.600> not<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.020> we're

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
is that we think and not that we're

once<00:01:52.049> again<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.979> area<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.460> Newark<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.000> I

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
once again in this area in Newark but I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.609 
once again in this area in Newark but I
think<00:01:54.299> another<00:01:54.689> thing<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.170> note<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.590> that

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
think another thing to note is that

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.280 
think another thing to note is that
officials<00:01:56.460> are<00:01:56.640> now<00:01:56.969> focusing<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.689> protecting

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
officials are now focusing on protecting

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.889 
officials are now focusing on protecting
the<00:01:58.409> properties<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.369> are<00:01:59.520> nearby<00:01:59.780> where<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
the properties that are nearby where the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.810 
the properties that are nearby where the
fire<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.170> breaking<00:02:01.890> out<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.310> think<00:02:02.399> that's

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
fire is breaking out so I think that's

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.880 
fire is breaking out so I think that's
where<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.570> focus<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.110> lying<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.770> Bhavna

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.950
