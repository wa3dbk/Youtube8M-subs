using<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.150> props<00:00:51.650> was<00:00:52.650> different<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
using the props was different in the

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.910 
using the props was different in the
very<00:00:53.580> first<00:00:53.910> rehearsal<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.630> didn't<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.650> them

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
very first rehearsal we didn't have them

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.190 
very first rehearsal we didn't have them
so<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:56.790> learned<00:00:56.970> the<00:00:57.090> choreography<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:58.020> he's

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
so we learned the choreography and he's

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.720 
so we learned the choreography and he's
like<00:00:58.380> I<00:00:58.470> had<00:00:58.560> this<00:00:58.650> idea<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.280> look<00:00:59.400> at<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
like I had this idea but look at the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.700 
like I had this idea but look at the
video<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.330> these<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.540> the<00:01:00.630> proper<00:01:00.870> using<00:01:01.410> so

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
video and these are the proper using so

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.100 
video and these are the proper using so
we're<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.950> little<00:01:02.130> bit<00:01:02.490> like<00:01:02.700> but<00:01:03.690> then<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.960> was
