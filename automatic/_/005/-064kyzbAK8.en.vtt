00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.719
 hello to all lovers x trail of each 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.559
 sometimes trying to check off-road 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.770
 properties of your x-trail and found yourself in 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.789
 unsuccessful situation that he stupidly stuck 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.660
 but as for evil 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.189
 there is nobody nearby and there is no tractor or 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:30.720
 he is but very far away as an alternative 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:32.250
 chains and other rescue equipment 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.309
 I will try to do today 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.989
 I will not try more precisely I already did and it seems 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.110
 they even work want to put 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.290
 share so let's say recipes with you 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.489
 mean so-called bracelets 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.760
 anti-skid 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.660
 on the Internet a lot of offers for the price 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.719
 enough 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.879
 let's say it can be said with regard to 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.239
 Again, the taste and color of comrades is not 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.850
 for this making me 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.989
 it took i acquired your not 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:08.700
 set of belts for loads in set 2 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.220
 Buckle and ribbons are the most interesting 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.030
 buckle that this is now the steel it 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.900
 pretty powerful it suits us 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:23.189
 Next chain was bought means a chain of 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.220
 calculating 80 rubles well, somewhere like meter 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.909
 we need a little more somewhere 30 meter well 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.259
 let's say in the region of 100 rubles means 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.579
 177 rubles worth belts 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:40.110
 100 rubles a chain and that 200 but groups a row 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.170
 80 but let the nuts and bolts on by 20 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:48.240
 rubles and that is a pair of bracelets 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:51.420
 cost 300 rubles so everything is here 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.960
 very simple ribbon we cut the letter 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.600
 which is bundled on here such pieces 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.649
 about 80-90 centimeters to more convenient 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.680
 was to mount 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:06.170
 and tighten we fold on the end with us 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.509
 it turns out such a loop here 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.720
 so I already thought that in principle 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.900
 if not like sewing machines 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.150
 Here either she is there to campaign things somewhere 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.580
 tear leave 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.150
 the stock of this tape she will love 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.150
 you can stupidly tie a knot 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:30.770
 I think that also fits further 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:35.750
 we cut a chain of 15 teeth of links 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:39.580
 we have our 215 tires 225 also I 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.230
 I think this is suitable but the bolts Gadget 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.769
 further than we do begin 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:50.120
 collect that is, we can see here that 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:53.090
 bolt washer inserted chain knocks nuts 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.299
 for contrat or law is required there as 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.989
 that means at the end of the circuit itself all 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.430
 gadget 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:06.980
 Roscosmos here is the same fix 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:09.890
 the other edge is here to be thicker i 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.680
 gaechek clocked up there, and so the same 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.900
 self-locking nut 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.140
 it turns out like this 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.650
 construction time assembly 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.870
 in general there is 15 minutes 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:29.269
 stuck on the car it looks like this 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.900
 means that it is good that the buckle Nell 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:37.400
 sits on the disk and does not scratch it from 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.670
 hanging on the rubber on the wheel here's the tail 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.670
 Of course dangles but it can somehow 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.100
 there folded I still work on it 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.420
 then some kind of rezinochku probably will 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.200
 this one so that these tails are chosen 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.230
 in principle, as shown 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.510
 today's little test thing 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.209
 pretty useful here and so 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.190
 everything starts to get clogged with mud 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.160
 then accordingly if not 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.190
 possibility of washing immediately means for 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.380
 this will need to be applied 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.769
 some bag where to put it all 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.380
 Well, I think it opens 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.200
 nothing complicated and the most important thing is 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.669
 costs much cheaper than that 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:31.050
 offered in the accessories store for 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:36.050
 SUVs and the Internet means well 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.050
 it is clear that this construction is not 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.630
 designed to participate in pokatushki 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.470
 replacing the real let's say so chains 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.220
 does not serve 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.680
 but I think if you ended up somewhere in 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.630
 situations where you are stuck pushing you away 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.090
 nowhere are your chances let's say so in the fight against 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.430
 off-road rises so why 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.680
 and there is no more to make it 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:08.270
 absolutely easy so all good luck 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.270
 try my say so recipe
