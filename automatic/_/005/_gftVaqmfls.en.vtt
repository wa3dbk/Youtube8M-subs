00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
have to be perfect at all because these

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.320 
have to be perfect at all because these
are<00:02:37.690> going<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.870> go<00:02:37.989> right<00:02:38.260> in<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.909> I'm<00:02:39.909> just

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
going to start mixing them until they're

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.960 
going to start mixing them until they're
just<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:44.319> bad<00:02:44.519> incorporated<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.700> then<00:02:45.790> we'll

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
just a bad incorporated and then we'll

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.210 
just a bad incorporated and then we'll
add<00:02:46.090> in<00:02:46.239> our<00:02:46.299> buttermilk<00:02:48.060> now<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.150> looks<00:02:49.330> great

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
add in our buttermilk now it looks great

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.630 
add in our buttermilk now it looks great
we're<00:02:51.220> going<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.430> add<00:02:51.549> in<00:02:51.700> our<00:02:51.790> buttermilk<00:02:52.209> and

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
we're going to add in our buttermilk and

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.520 
we're going to add in our buttermilk and
just<00:02:54.640> mix<00:02:54.940> this<00:02:55.120> whole<00:02:55.390> thing<00:02:55.810> together<00:02:55.989> until

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
just mix this whole thing together until

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.119 
just mix this whole thing together until
it's<00:02:56.860> all<00:02:57.040> combined<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:59.110> looks<00:02:59.349> perfect<00:02:59.620> it

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
it's all combined that looks perfect it

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.440 
it's all combined that looks perfect it
has<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.370> few<00:03:00.670> lumps<00:03:00.849> in<00:03:01.030> there<00:03:01.180> but<00:03:01.329> that's

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
has a few lumps in there but that's

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.809 
has a few lumps in there but that's
perfectly<00:03:02.110> fine<00:03:02.379> because<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:02.860> good<00:03:03.160> cupcake<00:03:03.640> is

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
perfectly fine because a good cupcake is

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.970 
perfectly fine because a good cupcake is
a<00:03:03.879> little<00:03:04.599> lumpy<00:03:05.019> keeps<00:03:05.349> everything<00:03:05.590> really

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
a little lumpy keeps everything really

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.839 
a little lumpy keeps everything really
nice<00:03:06.129> and<00:03:06.370> moist

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
nice and moist

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.940 
nice and moist
just<00:03:07.120> means<00:03:07.299> that<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.540> haven't<00:03:07.780> over<00:03:08.260> mixed

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
just means that you haven't over mixed

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.589 
just means that you haven't over mixed
it<00:03:09.129> and<00:03:09.160> then<00:03:09.489> it'll<00:03:09.790> be<00:03:09.879> really<00:03:10.090> tough<00:03:10.329> and

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
it and then it'll be really tough and

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.150 
it and then it'll be really tough and
dry<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.220> definitely<00:03:12.220> don't<00:03:12.430> want<00:03:12.579> that<00:03:12.640> so

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
dry and definitely don't want that so

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.680 
dry and definitely don't want that so
now<00:03:15.160> that<00:03:15.190> we<00:03:15.400> have<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:15.640> all<00:03:15.849> combined<00:03:16.329> I'm

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
scooper I'm going to divide the batter

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.460 
scooper I'm going to divide the batter
evenly<00:03:21.030> until<00:03:22.030> we<00:03:22.750> have<00:03:22.870> everything<00:03:23.140> all

filled up last one now I'm going to put

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.449 
filled up last one now I'm going to put
this<00:03:27.790> into<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.150> preheated<00:03:28.629> oven<00:03:28.720> 350<00:03:29.440> for<00:03:30.040> 18

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
this into the preheated oven 350 for 18

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.129 
this into the preheated oven 350 for 18
to<00:03:30.489> 20<00:03:30.910> minutes<00:03:31.180> or<00:03:31.329> until<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.900> toothpick
