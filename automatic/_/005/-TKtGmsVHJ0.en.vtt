00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
until it stops blinking which gives you

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.920 
until it stops blinking which gives you
the<00:01:55.680> full<00:01:55.860> charge<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.790> there<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.659> how<00:01:57.780> it

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the full charge so there is how it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.850 
the full charge so there is how it
sounds<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.259> battery<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.479> finally<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.659> tip<00:02:01.380> for

down<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.340> ladder

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
down the ladder

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.030 
down the ladder
that<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.030> what<00:02:24.240> I<00:02:24.450> do<00:02:24.990> with<00:02:25.290> all<00:02:25.470> my<00:02:25.500> electronic

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
that is what I do with all my electronic

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.430 
that is what I do with all my electronic
items<00:02:26.370> whatever<00:02:27.090> they<00:02:27.270> say<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:27.780> yeah<00:02:28.230> I

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
items whatever they say but yeah I

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.200 
items whatever they say but yeah I
believe<00:02:28.860> that's<00:02:29.520> how<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> batteries<00:02:30.150> walk<00:02:30.600> so

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
believe that's how the batteries walk so

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.430 
believe that's how the batteries walk so
while<00:02:33.210> you're<00:02:33.360> charging<00:02:33.510> charge<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.350> the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
while you're charging charge it to the
