00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.230 
design I design comfort and the
technology<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:23.010> make<00:00:23.189> my<00:00:23.369> designs<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.060> then

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
technology to make my designs and then

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.929 
technology to make my designs and then
make<00:00:24.510> them<00:00:24.630> fashion<00:00:25.130> the<00:00:26.130> first<00:00:26.430> thing<00:00:26.699> that's

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
make them fashion the first thing that's

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.970 
make them fashion the first thing that's
different<00:00:27.180> between<00:00:27.359> myself<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.320> other

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
different between myself and other

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.880 
different between myself and other
designers<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.269> still<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> retailer<00:00:31.740> at

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
designers is that I still a retailer at

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.049 
designers is that I still a retailer at
heart<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.340> look<00:00:32.520> at<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.730> from<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.910> different

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
heart so I look at it from a different

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.819 
heart so I look at it from a different
point<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.480> view<00:00:33.660> where<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> opened<00:00:34.380> up<00:00:34.410> my<00:00:34.559> first

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
years ago and I used to go to the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.790 
years ago and I used to go to the
factories<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.870> would<00:00:39.989> say<00:00:40.170> change<00:00:40.530> this

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
factories and I would say change this

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.350

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
change this I didn't even realize I was

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.270 
change this I didn't even realize I was
designing<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.410> probably<00:00:43.620> been<00:00:43.890> designing
