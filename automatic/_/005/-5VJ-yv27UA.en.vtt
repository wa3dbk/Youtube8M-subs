Hey guys, Andru Edwards here, editor-in-chief
of GearLive.com.

00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:08.320
And in today's edition of Unboxing Live, we're
gonna be taking a look at the Dell XPS 13,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.010
the world's smallest 13-inch notebook.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.890
My question though is, if it's so small, why
is it in such a big box?

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:29.700
Look at this, I mean, yeah it cannot even
fit into the frame.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.010
This is the box that the smallest 13-inch
notebook comes in.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.450
We're gonna have to open it up and see why
that is.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.350
I'm actually very curious.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.649
What takes up so much space?

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.630
Pull that open, try not to hit anything.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.210
The thing is so.., aww, all right.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.210
Well, I thought, uh uh, it was gonna be a
bunch of padding which there certainly is,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.989
a bunch of padding to keep this protected,
but the very first thing that I see is, boom,

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:03.989
this came from Dell.

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.369
First of all, thank you Dell, for including
that in there.

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.420
This is actually the Dell Premier Backpack
if I am not mistaken, yes it is, the Dell

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.420
Premier Backpack.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.880
They have just put that to tag right there.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.549
Now this backpack allows you to actually keep
your accessories, tablet, notebook and all

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:19.549
that organized.

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.869
Now this is also TSA friendly, so you can
actually just put in right through the scanner,

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.119
you don't even have to take your laptop out.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.399
And it also works with the Dell Power Companion
which is a, basically, an external battery

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.319
pack which you'll see for things like your
smartphones, tablets but it's actually compatible

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:37.490
with the Dell notebook.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.420
So you can actually charge your notebook on
the go and the backpack has a special section

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.420
for that.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.959
You can plug in your notebook while you backpack
to get it charged.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:50.979
So that's pretty cool, if they threw that
in there and this actually fits up to notebooks

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.549
that are 15 and 1/2 inches.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.619
So yes, definitely unexpected, more in there
than I realized.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.309
I thought we were just getting a notebook
and a gigantic box which might maybe, that

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:02.420
was a little foolish of me.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.380
Now, it actually looks like there is some
stuff in this backpack, so why don't we just

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.389
go through that.

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:10.450
I mean, obviously, Dell sent that over, so
itÃ­s probably something cool.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.250
Okay, there is a little folder with the word
"Hello" on the front.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.910
All right, information about the Dell XPS
13 carved with my name on it.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.219
Okay, all right, this is fancier than I thought.

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:29.040
Andru, hope you love your new Dell XPS 13,
look forward to hearing your feedback.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.310
All right, well, you will be hearing my feedback
Dell, don't you worry.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.069
Uh, let's see we've got a copy of Microsoft
Office Professional 2013, which obviously

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.370
goes very nicely if you have a Windows computer.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.370
Power cable.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.599
They have basically taken this backpack and
outfitted it with different things.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.629
There's a power cable right here for example,
right up front, as you can see, in one of

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:57.629
the convenient pockets.

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.390
And then one of the other pockets in here,
that's gonna be the power brick and then this

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.590
will connect to the power brick to allow you
to plug it in to a wall charger.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.590
Like...

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.590
So...

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.629
Like a little game, there is this all sorts
of compartments on here and seems that a lot

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.340
of the compartments have things in them.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.360
So, check in there, anything in there?

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.360
No, right No..

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.909
Here, a little keychain in there.

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:35.560
So, inside, this is the Dell HDMI, or rather
USB 3.0, HDMI, VGA, Ethernet that you can

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.610
put on with.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.189
Basically, like a mini dock, it's a 4-in-1
travel adapter.

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:47.930
You plug one side on the USB 3.0 port on the
XPS 13 and then you get the HDMI port, you

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.829
get the Ethernet port, USB 2 and VGA port.

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.279
So, hey, appreciate you throwing that in.

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:57.170
Let's go to the second compartment and see
what's going on.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:04.269
This right here is the Dell Power Companion
battery and it goes right into the main compartment,

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.629
slips right in there and this will charge
your laptop.

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.019
It will also charge your, your smartphone,
your tablet, things like that over the USB.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.739
It has 2 USB ports there.

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.690
It's a 1200 mAh hour battery.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.910
It will charge your Dell XPS 13 while you're
on the go at the same time as it charges your

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.190
tablet and your smartphone if you wanted to
do that.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.569
All-in-one, that's awesome.

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:32.919
I like that, I mean you usually don't find
thing that'll let you to charge your laptop

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.940
when you are on the go, smartphone, tablet
sure, but I like it.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.030
This, next compartment here is for the laptop
itself.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.069
This is the airplane compliant section.

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:48.819
Oh and I think, okay, that is the laptop.

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:55.990
So, as you can see, it's plugged in and what
it's plugged into is Dell Power companion.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.400
So let me remove that.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.889
What you see here is a Dell Premier Sleeve.

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.949
This is a custom designed sleeve by Dell.

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:08.040
A cord pass through as you saw, right there,
had a little notch for the cord to go through,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.820
so you can charge it while it is in the protective
sleeve and

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.820
Boom!

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:22.650
There that is, this is the Dell XPS 13 2015
edition of that notebook.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.610
You can see the front there, nice and light,
thanks to the Carbon fiber.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.590
On the back there, XPS logo.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:39.240
Check that out, check out the covered carbon
fiber palm rest.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.240
That is beautiful.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.449
Now, we'll get this thing turned on in just
a moment and will tell you more about it.

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.810
We, obviously, got sidetracked by all the
other goodies that Dell decided to throw in.
