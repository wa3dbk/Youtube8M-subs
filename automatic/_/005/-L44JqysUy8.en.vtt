00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.539 

and<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.869> check<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.560> your<00:01:31.710> PC<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.369> it's

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
installed correctly and it sees the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.840 
installed correctly and it sees the
device<00:01:34.289> is<00:01:34.469> not<00:01:34.649> showing<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.039> an<00:01:35.189> unknown

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
device is not showing as an unknown

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.810 
device is not showing as an unknown
device<00:01:36.500> I'm<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.710> unplug<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.399> again<00:01:38.460> for

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
device I'm going to unplug it again for

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.760 
device I'm going to unplug it again for
this<00:01:38.969> part<00:01:39.479> because<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.020> tend<00:01:40.319> to<00:01:40.380> find<00:01:40.590> when

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
this part because you tend to find when

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.520 
this part because you tend to find when
it's<00:01:41.009> got<00:01:41.130> power<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:42.170> when<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.259> power<00:01:43.500> it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
it's got power in it when you power it

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.990 
it's got power in it when you power it
off

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
off

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.910 
off
he<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.420> reboots<00:01:45.720> itself<00:01:45.810> again<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.380> starts

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
he just reboots itself again it starts

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.969 
he just reboots itself again it starts
back<00:01:47.069> up<00:01:47.100> side<00:01:48.079> unplug<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.289> power<00:01:51.289> then<00:01:52.289> we're

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
back up side unplug the power then we're

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.499 
back up side unplug the power then we're
going<00:01:53.159> into<00:01:53.340> bootloader<00:01:53.729> mode<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:54.360> need

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
going into bootloader mode so we need

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.580 
going into bootloader mode so we need
volume<00:01:54.899> down<00:01:55.939> while<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.179> turn<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.569> on<00:01:57.720> volume

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
volume down while we turn it on volume

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.580 
volume down while we turn it on volume
down<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.009> within<00:01:59.340> both<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> same<00:01:59.819> time<00:02:00.590> and

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
down on within both the same time and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.580 
down on within both the same time and
then<00:02:02.280> hopefully<00:02:02.610> when<00:02:02.819> I<00:02:02.880> let<00:02:03.000> go<00:02:03.349> we<00:02:04.349> see

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
then hopefully when I let go we see

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.130 
then hopefully when I let go we see
bootloader<00:02:05.159> mode<00:02:05.390> so<00:02:06.390> now<00:02:06.630> I'm<00:02:06.810> going<00:02:06.929> to<00:02:07.020> plug

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
bootloader mode so now I'm going to plug

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:16.100 
bootloader mode so now I'm going to plug
it<00:02:07.259> back<00:02:07.289> in<00:02:14.030> turns<00:02:15.030> out<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.450> didn't<00:02:15.870> stalk

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
it back in turns out a didn't stalk

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.110 
it back in turns out a didn't stalk
really<00:02:16.470> try<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.769> install<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> Falcon<00:02:17.849> s

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
really try to install a Falcon s

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.309 
really try to install a Falcon s
whatever<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:20.989> did<00:02:21.989> show<00:02:22.290> you

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
whatever that is so I did show you

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.350 
whatever that is so I did show you
briefly<00:02:23.269> Motorola<00:02:24.269> device<00:02:24.660> manager<00:02:26.360> shall

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
briefly Motorola device manager shall

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:37.020 
briefly Motorola device manager shall
fire<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.930> up<00:02:28.430> unplug<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.930> phone<00:02:31.230> you

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:47.710 

let's<00:02:37.480> get<00:02:37.600> on<00:02:37.750> with<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:38.200> get<00:02:38.950> on<00:02:39.130> with<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.310> okay

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.690 

that's<00:02:48.200> why<00:02:48.320> we<00:02:48.440> need<00:02:48.590> installing<00:02:49.070> devices

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
that's why we need installing devices

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.190 
that's why we need installing devices
USB<00:02:50.180> drivers<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:55.480> they're<00:02:56.480> not<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:56.990> much

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200

adb<00:03:34.450> interface<00:03:35.200> so<00:03:35.469> i<00:03:35.560> think<00:03:36.269> that's<00:03:37.269> where<00:03:37.840> we

adb interface so i think that's where we

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:45.300 
adb interface so i think that's where we
need<00:03:38.079> to<00:03:38.290> be<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:42.400> in<00:03:42.790> theory<00:03:43.980> tap<00:03:44.980> through

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310
