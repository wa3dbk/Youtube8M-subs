00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
marbling on short nails is that since

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.100 
marbling on short nails is that since
you<00:01:17.600> get<00:01:17.780> less<00:01:18.350> of<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:19.580> design<00:01:19.939> you<00:01:20.540> kind<00:01:21.080> of

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
you get less of the design you kind of

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.050 
you get less of the design you kind of
need<00:01:21.320> to<00:01:21.350> make<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.770> design<00:01:22.040> more<00:01:22.100> intricate

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
need to make the design more intricate

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.109 
need to make the design more intricate
