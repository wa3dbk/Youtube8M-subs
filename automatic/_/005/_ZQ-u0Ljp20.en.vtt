maker tool
well<00:00:18.840> they<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.439> actually<00:00:19.830> four

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
well they it's actually four

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.160 
well they it's actually four
compartments<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.930> made<00:00:22.080> of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
compartments and this is made of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.590 
compartments and this is made of
galvanized<00:00:22.680> metal<00:00:23.060> you<00:00:24.060> filled<00:00:24.390> each

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
galvanized metal you filled each

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.109 
galvanized metal you filled each
compartment<00:00:24.960> up<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.710> soil<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.250> use<00:00:26.910> it

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
compartment up with the soil and use it

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.609 
compartment up with the soil and use it
just<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.480> cookie<00:00:27.810> cutter<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.199> make<00:00:28.230> four

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
just like a cookie cutter to make four

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.050 
just like a cookie cutter to make four
little<00:00:28.859> blocks<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.310> soil<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.789> plant<00:00:30.000> your

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
little blocks of soil to plant your

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.540 
little blocks of soil to plant your
seeds<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.449> that's<00:00:31.109> really<00:00:31.320> cool<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.890> it's<00:00:32.369> got

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
seeds in that's really cool and it's got

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.400 
seeds in that's really cool and it's got
these<00:00:32.669> little<00:00:32.850> divots<00:00:33.420> mm-hmm<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.170> can<00:00:34.320> just

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
these little divots mm-hmm we can just

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.110 
these little divots mm-hmm we can just
plant<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.739> seed<00:00:34.860> directly<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.489> there<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
plant a seed directly in there in the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.209 
plant a seed directly in there in the
hole<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.809> cover<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.829> water<00:00:38.040> it

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
hole you cover them up you just water it

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.610 
hole you cover them up you just water it
gently<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.730> then<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.050> transplant<00:00:40.410> this

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
gently and then you can transplant this

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.229 
gently and then you can transplant this
directly<00:00:40.950> outside<00:00:41.160> there's<00:00:41.640> no<00:00:41.730> transplant

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
directly outside there's no transplant

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.990 
directly outside there's no transplant
shock<00:00:42.480> there<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.079> no<00:00:43.530> container<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.610> throw

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
shock there is no container to throw

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.639 
shock there is no container to throw
away<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.239> store<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.079> goes<00:00:46.200> directly<00:00:46.530> into

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
away to store it just goes directly into

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.680 
away to store it just goes directly into
the<00:00:46.739> ground<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.700> seeds<00:00:47.969> come<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the ground and as the seeds come up and

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.990 
the ground and as the seeds come up and
start<00:00:49.050> growing<00:00:49.410> through<00:00:49.649> here<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.820> they

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
start growing through here will they

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.080 
start growing through here will they
outgrow<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> little<00:00:51.899> block<00:00:52.079> um<00:00:53.129> actually

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
outgrow the little block um actually

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.189 
outgrow the little block um actually
what's<00:00:54.300> different<00:00:54.600> about<00:00:54.629> these<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.079> they

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
what's different about these is they

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.350 
what's different about these is they
don't<00:00:55.320> become<00:00:55.620> root<00:00:55.829> bound<00:00:56.039> when<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.879> root

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
don't become root bound when the root

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.540 
don't become root bound when the root
reaches<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> edge<00:00:58.010> there's<00:00:59.010> an<00:00:59.129> air<00:00:59.280> barrier

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
reaches the edge there's an air barrier

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.010 
reaches the edge there's an air barrier
there<00:00:59.820> it'll<00:00:59.940> actually<00:01:00.120> stop<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.629> wait<00:01:00.780> for

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
there it'll actually stop and wait for

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.779 
there it'll actually stop and wait for
to<00:01:01.199> become<00:01:01.440> transplanted<00:01:02.160> if<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.579> want<00:01:02.730> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
to become transplanted if you want to

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.130 
to become transplanted if you want to
contain<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.210> would<00:01:03.329> wrap<00:01:03.539> around<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.899> become

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
contain it would wrap around and become

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.050 
contain it would wrap around and become
root<00:01:04.379> bound<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.460> dirt<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.880> took

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
root bound so is it's just dirt I took

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.880 
root bound so is it's just dirt I took
out<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> house<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> potting<00:01:07.680> soil

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
out of the house this is a potting soil

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.380 
out of the house this is a potting soil
mixed<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:08.490> Johnny<00:01:08.700> cells<00:01:09.000> several

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
mixed with Johnny cells several

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.330 
mixed with Johnny cells several
different<00:01:09.659> types<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.500> mixed<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:10.950> water<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
different types it's mixed with water to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.859 
different types it's mixed with water to
the<00:01:11.460> consistency<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.060> about<00:01:12.360> peanut<00:01:12.720> butter

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the consistency of about peanut butter

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.420 
the consistency of about peanut butter
you<00:01:12.930> want<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.320> careful<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:13.860> more<00:01:14.310> on

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you want to be careful that it's more on

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.770 
you want to be careful that it's more on
the<00:01:14.520> wet<00:01:14.700> side<00:01:14.880> than<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.150> dry<00:01:15.299> side<00:01:15.540> when<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the wet side than the dry side when you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.539 
the wet side than the dry side when you
mix<00:01:15.900> this

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.620 

so<00:01:25.549> Anthony<00:01:25.700> I've<00:01:25.939> got<00:01:26.060> this<00:01:26.180> little<00:01:26.390> teeny

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
so Anthony I've got this little teeny

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.660 
so Anthony I've got this little teeny
block<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.200> my<00:01:27.320> hand<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:27.770> I<00:01:27.799> imagine<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.369> plant

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
block in my hand and I imagine the plant

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.359 
block in my hand and I imagine the plant
outgrowing<00:01:29.360> this<00:01:29.720> block<00:01:29.960> pretty<00:01:30.259> quickly<00:01:30.560> so

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
outgrowing this block pretty quickly so

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.840 
outgrowing this block pretty quickly so
what<00:01:31.759> do<00:01:31.820> I<00:01:31.909> do<00:01:32.140> well<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.530> next<00:01:33.740> step<00:01:33.860> is<00:01:34.189> to

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
what do I do well the next step is to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.270 
what do I do well the next step is to
put<00:01:35.659> it<00:01:35.780> in<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:36.049> two-inch<00:01:36.470> block<00:01:36.740> it's<00:01:37.100> called

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
put it in the two-inch block it's called

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.450 
put it in the two-inch block it's called
potting<00:01:37.670> on<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.119> if<00:01:39.080> it<00:01:39.740> ever<00:01:39.890> does<00:01:40.100> outgrow

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
potting on and if it ever does outgrow

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.940 
potting on and if it ever does outgrow
the<00:01:40.610> two-inch<00:01:40.939> block<00:01:41.210> we<00:01:41.990> have<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:42.170> 4-inch<00:01:42.679> soil
