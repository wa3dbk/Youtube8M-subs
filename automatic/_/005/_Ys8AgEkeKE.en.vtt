00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.540 

I<00:00:36.140> mix<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.320> up<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.620> lot<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.130> that<00:00:38.250> she<00:00:38.370> never

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
I mix it up a lot so that she never

00:00:38.550 --> 00:01:01.180 
I mix it up a lot so that she never
knows<00:00:38.760> what's<00:00:39.060> going<00:00:39.240> to<00:00:39.330> happen

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.820 

that<00:01:02.150> fair<00:01:03.489> nice<00:01:04.489> job<00:01:05.350> it's<00:01:06.350> having<00:01:06.680> trouble

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
that fair nice job it's having trouble

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.040 
that fair nice job it's having trouble
with<00:01:07.250> once<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.790> toy<00:01:08.030> comes<00:01:08.360> out<00:01:08.600> it<00:01:08.840> becomes

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
with once the toy comes out it becomes

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.650 
with once the toy comes out it becomes
far<00:01:09.440> too<00:01:09.680> motivating<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.460> be<00:01:10.640> out<00:01:10.820> in<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.360> end

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
far too motivating to be out in the end

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:29.960 
far too motivating to be out in the end
so

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970
