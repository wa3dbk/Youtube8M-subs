00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.079

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.600
 As the 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.620

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.520
 progress that can be made 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.160
 institution 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.920
 of Chilean and community football and only 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.610
 did not find really spectacular the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.589
 first level 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.890
 he was just telling me it was 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.890
 amazing 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.030
 and this is something that has to be taken 

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:12.730
 as always when that is always what 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.740
 that he has trumpeted 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.570
 and this is the way to follow 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.570
 I was very impressed 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.719
 yes of course good he 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.490
 it's part of the story here sick 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.900
 there here in rancagua now really 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.660
 that way be with her 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.200
 and they had to go knowing then it was 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.200
 very pleasant 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.380
 meeting more familiar than anything else 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.060
 very nice to have him here and that the day of 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.070
 tomorrow you can have the manchester me 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.110
 says that our age is now the 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.850
 use of not being able to learn 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.280
 the truth is that he has not gone to any 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.380
 TV show there has not been 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.590
 no interview he has a contract 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.810

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.520
 exclusive 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.060
 so I think it was pretty 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.119
 different 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.819
 being here and being able to visit 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.510

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.780
