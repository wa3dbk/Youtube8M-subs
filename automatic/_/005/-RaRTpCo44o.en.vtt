00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
supposed to be truly or this is curly

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.479 
supposed to be truly or this is curly
hair<00:03:35.600> but<00:03:35.930> this<00:03:36.440> hair<00:03:36.680> is<00:03:36.799> not<00:03:36.950> fully<00:03:37.250> at

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
hair but this hair is not fully at

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.340

whatsoever is more sort of a wavy

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.150 
whatsoever is more sort of a wavy
texture<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.870> if<00:03:41.959> you're<00:03:42.079> looking<00:03:42.170> for<00:03:42.350> a<00:03:42.709> curly

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
texture so if you're looking for a curly

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.800 
texture so if you're looking for a curly
hair<00:03:43.489> I<00:03:43.730> wouldn't<00:03:44.120> recommend<00:03:44.360> it<00:03:44.570> here

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
hair I wouldn't recommend it here

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.470 
hair I wouldn't recommend it here
because<00:03:44.959> as<00:03:45.290> hair<00:03:45.470> is<00:03:45.560> not<00:03:45.709> curly<00:03:46.579> its<00:03:46.790> wasy

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
because as hair is not curly its wasy

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.940 
because as hair is not curly its wasy
which<00:03:47.660> is<00:03:47.780> something<00:03:47.959> I<00:03:48.170> think<00:03:48.380> my<00:03:48.470> dear<00:03:48.680> car

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
which is something I think my dear car

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.860 
which is something I think my dear car
should<00:03:49.160> clear<00:03:49.400> up<00:03:49.579> because<00:03:50.120> even<00:03:50.600> in<00:03:50.720> other

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
should clear up because even in other

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.840 
should clear up because even in other
videos<00:03:51.170> even<00:03:51.680> even<00:03:52.130> in<00:03:52.250> other<00:03:52.459> people's

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
videos even even in other people's

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.760 
videos even even in other people's
videos<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.810> hair<00:03:53.989> didn't<00:03:54.260> look

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770

update<00:04:18.470> everything<00:04:19.010> like<00:04:19.220> I<00:04:19.310> said<00:04:19.459> is<00:04:19.550> pretty

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
update everything like I said is pretty

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.180 
update everything like I said is pretty
much<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.060> same<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.510> only<00:04:20.840> things<00:04:21.320> that's<00:04:21.830> an

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
much the same the only things that's an

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.310 
much the same the only things that's an
issue<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:22.760> me<00:04:22.790> is<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.330> size<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.900> bundles

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
issue to me is the size of the bundles

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.100 
issue to me is the size of the bundles
because<00:04:24.500> you'll<00:04:24.800> need<00:04:24.980> a<00:04:25.010> lot<00:04:25.250> more<00:04:25.460> hair<00:04:26.110> if

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
because you'll need a lot more hair if

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.700 
because you'll need a lot more hair if
you're<00:04:27.350> doing<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.620> full<00:04:27.890> install<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:29.710> that's

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
you're doing the full install and that's

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.410 
you're doing the full install and that's
pretty<00:04:30.980> much<00:04:31.160> if<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.550> shedding<00:04:31.790> I<00:04:32.030> can<00:04:32.210> deal

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
pretty much if the shedding I can deal

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.210 
pretty much if the shedding I can deal
with<00:04:32.450> because<00:04:33.200> it's<00:04:33.350> only<00:04:33.530> excessive<00:04:34.100> when

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
with because it's only excessive when

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.890 
with because it's only excessive when
I'm<00:04:34.340> styling<00:04:34.730> it<00:04:34.880> and<00:04:35.030> I<00:04:35.090> didn't<00:04:35.390> send<00:04:35.600> my<00:04:35.690> webs

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900
