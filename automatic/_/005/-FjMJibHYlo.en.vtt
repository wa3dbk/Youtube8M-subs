the present Gohan at both super saiyan

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.019 
the present Gohan at both super saiyan
levels<00:00:24.990> honestly<00:00:25.590> uh<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> tough<00:00:27.000> one

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
levels honestly uh this is a tough one

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.400 
levels honestly uh this is a tough one
because<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.480> mean<00:00:27.750> obviously<00:00:27.869> they're<00:00:28.289> both

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
because I mean obviously they're both

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.019 
because I mean obviously they're both
Gohan's<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.130> they'll<00:00:29.220> never<00:00:29.250> actually<00:00:29.670> do

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
Gohan's and they'll never actually do

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.279 
Gohan's and they'll never actually do
this<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:30.480> then<00:00:30.599> again<00:00:30.630> they<00:00:30.900> probably<00:00:31.050> would

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
this but then again they probably would

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.830 
this but then again they probably would
but<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.560> never<00:00:31.740> know<00:00:31.890> um<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.910> would<00:00:33.570> personally

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
but you never know um I would personally

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.380 
but you never know um I would personally
feel<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.469> future<00:00:35.340> Gohan<00:00:35.790> would<00:00:36.000> win<00:00:36.180> just

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
feel like future Gohan would win just

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.900 
feel like future Gohan would win just
because<00:00:36.570> he's<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> lot<00:00:37.770> more<00:00:38.010> ruthless<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.820> my

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
because he's a lot more ruthless in my

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.760 
because he's a lot more ruthless in my
opinion<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.660> because<00:00:39.960> he<00:00:40.170> had<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.379> endure

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
opinion just because he had to endure

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.910 
opinion just because he had to endure
the<00:00:41.520> entire<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:42.300> 20<00:00:42.840> years<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.260> androids

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the entire like 20 years of androids

the entire like 20 years of androids
blowing<00:00:44.460> stuff<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.300> his<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.780> his<00:00:45.840> time

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
period so uh and plus not only that but

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.410 
period so uh and plus not only that but
after<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.680> present<00:00:50.370> Gohan<00:00:50.730> after<00:00:51.059> he<00:00:51.180> killed

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
after the present Gohan after he killed

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.660 
after the present Gohan after he killed
cell<00:00:51.750> he<00:00:52.170> kind<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.500> gone<00:00:52.680> soft<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.219> everybody

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
cell he kind of gone soft on everybody

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.160 
cell he kind of gone soft on everybody
you<00:00:53.879> know<00:00:53.910> he<00:00:54.210> was<00:00:54.329> going<00:00:54.570> hit<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> books

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
you know he was going hit in the books

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.049 
you know he was going hit in the books
going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> school<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.219> whatnot<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.820> mean

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
going to school and whatnot so I mean

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.459 
going to school and whatnot so I mean
I'm<00:00:57.210> pretty<00:00:57.239> sure<00:00:57.600> his<00:00:57.750> power<00:00:57.960> level<00:00:58.350> isn't

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
I'm pretty sure his power level isn't

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.950 
I'm pretty sure his power level isn't
what<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.129> know<00:00:59.160> used<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.609> be<00:00:59.730> but<00:00:59.960> future

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
what you know used to be but future

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.660 
what you know used to be but future

always always always fighting he'd

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.330 
always always always fighting he'd
probably<00:01:05.939> compete<00:01:06.630> with<00:01:06.780> his<00:01:06.869> dad<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.560> you

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
probably compete with his dad if you

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.219 
probably compete with his dad if you
know<00:01:08.460> Goku<00:01:08.880> came<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> future<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.930> that

particular<00:01:10.590> time<00:01:11.010> period<00:01:11.220> arm<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:12.360> don't<00:01:13.229> know

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
particular time period arm I don't know

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.399 
let me know what you guys think if you
guys<00:01:14.490> think<00:01:14.520> future<00:01:15.030> Gohan<00:01:15.360> would<00:01:15.509> win<00:01:15.689> or<00:01:16.229> do

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
guys think future Gohan would win or do

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.350 
guys think future Gohan would win or do
you<00:01:16.500> guys<00:01:16.590> think<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.250> present<00:01:18.060> Gohan

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
you guys think that the present Gohan

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.330 
you guys think that the present Gohan
would<00:01:18.600> actually<00:01:18.990> put<00:01:19.170> up<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.350> epic<00:01:20.070> fighting

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
would actually put up a epic fighting

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.399 
would actually put up a epic fighting
just<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.909> know<00:01:21.000> demolish<00:01:21.540> him<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.869> mean<00:01:22.259> after

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
just you know demolish him I mean after

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.870 
just you know demolish him I mean after
all<00:01:22.560> they're<00:01:22.799> both<00:01:22.950> Gohan<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.520> they<00:01:23.640> both<00:01:23.759> have

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
all they're both Gohan so they both have

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120 
all they're both Gohan so they both have
the<00:01:24.060> exact<00:01:24.360> same<00:01:24.390> move<00:01:24.810> sets<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> mean<00:01:25.619> then

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the exact same move sets so I mean then

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.770 
the exact same move sets so I mean then
again<00:01:26.250> future<00:01:26.850> Gohan<00:01:27.180> knows<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.630> bit

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
again future Gohan knows a little bit

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.569 
again future Gohan knows a little bit
more<00:01:27.990> stuff<00:01:28.320> than<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.680> present<00:01:29.070> Gohan<00:01:29.369> does

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
more stuff than the present Gohan does

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.789 
more stuff than the present Gohan does
so<00:01:29.880> he<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.570> use<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.840> for<00:01:30.900> his<00:01:31.170> advantage<00:01:31.590> but

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
so he can use that for his advantage but

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.859 
so he can use that for his advantage but
um<00:01:32.130> let<00:01:33.060> me<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.240> what<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.390> guys<00:01:33.509> think<00:01:33.720> what

um let me know what you guys think what
do<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.020> think<00:01:34.079> would<00:01:34.229> be<00:01:34.320> stronger<00:01:34.860> that's<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
do you think would be stronger that's a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.499 
do you think would be stronger that's a
very<00:01:35.310> interesting<00:01:35.549> question<00:01:35.790> who<00:01:36.210> think<00:01:36.420> will

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
very interesting question who think will

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.359 
very interesting question who think will
be<00:01:36.570> stronger<00:01:36.930> out<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> two<00:01:37.530> who<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
