a normal weight paper that you would use

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.970 
a normal weight paper that you would use
from<00:00:06.600> your<00:00:06.660> printer<00:00:07.109> when<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.259> first<00:00:07.710> start

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
from your printer when you first start

rubber stamping and a bleed proof paper

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.230 
rubber stamping and a bleed proof paper
and<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.460> first<00:00:11.670> things<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.059> might

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
and the first things that you might

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.709 
and the first things that you might
notice<00:00:12.450> on<00:00:12.900> camera<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.980> color<00:00:14.160> difference

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
notice on camera is the color difference

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.939 
notice on camera is the color difference
the<00:00:15.719> eighth<00:00:15.929> gram<00:00:16.199> white<00:00:16.379> paper<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.890> a

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the eighth gram white paper is a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.599 
the eighth gram white paper is a
slightly<00:00:17.400> grayer<00:00:17.970> shade<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.840> white<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.609> I

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
slightly grayer shade of white and I

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.250 
slightly grayer shade of white and I
know<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.910> can't<00:00:21.180> appreciate<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.960> video

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
know you can't appreciate this on video

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.099 
know you can't appreciate this on video
but<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.970> coarseness<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.180> paper<00:00:24.779> will

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
but the coarseness of the paper will

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.339 
but the coarseness of the paper will
affect<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:26.189> way<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.400> color<00:00:26.730> lays<00:00:27.000> down

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
affect the way you color lays down

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.689 
affect the way you color lays down
whereas<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> bleed<00:00:28.680> proof<00:00:28.980> paper<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.460> nice

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
whereas the bleed proof paper is nice

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.600 
whereas the bleed proof paper is nice
and<00:00:29.939> smooth<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.859> when<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.980> color<00:00:32.160> lays<00:00:32.369> down

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
and smooth and when the color lays down

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.680 
and smooth and when the color lays down
is<00:00:32.880> an<00:00:33.329> awful<00:00:34.020> lot<00:00:34.260> nicer<00:00:34.800> than<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:36.300> 80<00:00:36.450> gram

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
is an awful lot nicer than the 80 gram

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.479 
is an awful lot nicer than the 80 gram
wet<00:00:36.870> paper<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.860> I'll<00:00:38.070> show<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
wet paper and I'll show you the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.880 
wet paper and I'll show you the
difference<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.989> demonstration<00:00:40.350> I'm

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
difference in this demonstration I'm

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.130 
difference in this demonstration I'm
just<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.430> color<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.360> top<00:00:42.600> half<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
just going to color in the top half of a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.180 
just going to color in the top half of a
body<00:00:43.350> I'm<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.100> color<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.520> her<00:00:44.730> arms

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
body I'm just going to color in her arms

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.680 
body I'm just going to color in her arms
and<00:00:47.190> I'm<00:00:47.340> going<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.520> color<00:00:47.760> them<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.149> exactly

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
and I'm going to color them in exactly

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.900 
and I'm going to color them in exactly
the<00:00:48.870> same<00:00:49.219> with<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> same<00:00:50.550> amount<00:00:50.820> of

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the same with the same amount of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.110 
the same with the same amount of
pressure<00:00:51.949> so<00:00:52.949> I'm<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.250> gonna<00:00:53.370> do<00:00:53.640> her<00:00:53.820> shade

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
pressure so I'm just gonna do her shade

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.540 
pressure so I'm just gonna do her shade
in<00:00:55.820> using<00:00:56.820> my<00:00:56.969> favorite<00:00:57.360> techniques<00:00:58.370> just<00:00:59.370> go

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
in using my favorite techniques just go

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.820 
in using my favorite techniques just go
underneath<00:00:59.789> her<00:01:00.059> hairline<00:01:03.619> using<00:01:04.619> my

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
underneath her hairline using my

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.280 
underneath her hairline using my
favorite<00:01:05.309> three<00:01:05.519> favorite<00:01:05.909> colors<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:07.170> I'm

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
favorite three favorite colors so I'm

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.719 
favorite three favorite colors so I'm
going<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.470> blend<00:01:07.799> them<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.369> would<00:01:08.520> do

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
going to blend them like I would do

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:18.140 
going to blend them like I would do
normally<00:01:09.140> dragging<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> colors<00:01:10.650> through<00:01:17.150> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
normally dragging the colors through and

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.780 
normally dragging the colors through and
what<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.540> will<00:01:18.689> notice<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.740> I'm<00:01:20.280> not<00:01:20.460> sure<00:01:20.670> if

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
what you will notice and I'm not sure if

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.890 
what you will notice and I'm not sure if
you'll<00:01:20.909> see<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.270> video<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:21.840> I'll

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
you'll see it on video but I'll

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.830 
you'll see it on video but I'll
certainly<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> photographic<00:01:23.310> comparison

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
certainly do a photographic comparison

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.160 
certainly do a photographic comparison
to<00:01:24.840> go<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> blog<00:01:25.470> once<00:01:25.680> I've<00:01:25.830> finished<00:01:25.979> is

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
to go on the blog once I've finished is

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.410 
to go on the blog once I've finished is
that<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.380> color<00:01:28.650> will<00:01:29.220> creep<00:01:29.700> over<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.210> lines

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
that the color will creep over the lines

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.240 
that the color will creep over the lines
so<00:01:30.869> when<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.380> start<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:31.950> your<00:01:32.070> pro

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
so when you do start with your pro

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.580 
so when you do start with your pro
markers<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.939> we<00:01:33.000> know<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> lot<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.659> beginners

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
markers and we know a lot of beginners

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.999 
markers and we know a lot of beginners
have<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:35.009> problem<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:36.479> they're<00:01:37.409> finding

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
have this problem is they're finding

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.499 
have this problem is they're finding
that<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.280> color<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.640> creeping<00:01:39.150> over<00:01:39.240> their

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
that the color is creeping over their

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.160 
that the color is creeping over their
line<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:41.570> obviously<00:01:42.570> they're<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:42.899> getting

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
line and obviously they're not getting

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.630 
line and obviously they're not getting
along<00:01:43.350> with<00:01:43.409> our<00:01:43.680> Pro<00:01:43.920> markers<00:01:44.310> straight<00:01:44.610> away

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
along with our Pro markers straight away

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.010 
along with our Pro markers straight away
so<00:01:47.640> that's<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.970> reason<00:01:48.180> why<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.540> colors

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
so that's the reason why you colors

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.380 
so that's the reason why you colors
creep<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:49.740> due<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.579> density<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.149> your

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
creep in it's due to the density of your

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.590 
creep in it's due to the density of your
paper<00:01:51.770> if<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.829> can<00:01:53.070> go<00:01:53.189> for<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.430> smoother<00:01:54.090> paper

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
paper if you can go for a smoother paper

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.069 
paper if you can go for a smoother paper
that's<00:01:55.380> fine<00:01:55.880> but<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.060> letter<00:01:57.240> set<00:01:57.570> blueproof

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
that's fine but the letter set blueproof

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.609 
that's fine but the letter set blueproof
paper<00:01:59.450> will<00:02:00.450> give<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.689> guaranteed<00:02:01.200> results

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
paper will give you guaranteed results

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.490 
paper will give you guaranteed results
every<00:02:01.860> time<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.840> I'm<00:02:04.020> going<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.200> leave<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
every time so I'm going to leave the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.959 
every time so I'm going to leave the
alcohol<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.979> evaporate<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.670> one<00:02:05.820> and

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
alcohol to evaporate on that one and

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.570 
alcohol to evaporate on that one and
start<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.930> smoother<00:02:07.380> paper<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.220> what<00:02:08.459> you

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
start on the smoother paper and what you

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.070 
start on the smoother paper and what you
will<00:02:08.729> notice<00:02:09.149> when<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.450> start<00:02:09.750> working<00:02:09.929> with

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
will notice when you start working with

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.790 
will notice when you start working with
is<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.920> color<00:02:11.220> goes<00:02:11.489> down<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.810> nicely

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
is it the color goes down so nicely

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.860 
is it the color goes down so nicely
you<00:02:14.460> don't<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.970> kind<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.270> scratch<00:02:15.660> it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
you don't have to kind of scratch it

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.450 
you don't have to kind of scratch it
into<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.260> paper<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:18.750> nice<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.350> smooth<00:02:19.740> and

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
into the paper it's nice and smooth and

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.310 
into the paper it's nice and smooth and
it<00:02:20.610> doesn't<00:02:20.640> creep<00:02:21.450> when<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.810> put<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.110> color

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
it doesn't creep when you put the color

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:30.350 
it doesn't creep when you put the color
down<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.770> I've<00:02:29.070> given<00:02:29.280> her<00:02:29.670> some<00:02:29.790> shade<00:02:30.330> in

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
down so I've given her some shade in

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.070 
down so I've given her some shade in
there

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
there

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.920 
there
I'll<00:02:31.860> do<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.220> midtown<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:35.610> color<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:36.150> just

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
I'll do the midtown and color in just

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.980 
I'll do the midtown and color in just
like<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.230> did<00:02:37.410> before<00:02:41.210> because<00:02:42.210> it's<00:02:42.600> nice<00:02:42.720> and

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
like I did before because it's nice and

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.660 
like I did before because it's nice and
smooth<00:02:43.260> you'll<00:02:43.500> notice<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.190> paper<00:02:44.400> that

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
smooth you'll notice that the paper that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.010 
smooth you'll notice that the paper that
the<00:02:44.790> pen<00:02:45.000> squeaking<00:02:45.570> on<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.320> paper<00:02:48.020> which

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
the pen squeaking on the paper which

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.480 
the pen squeaking on the paper which
gives<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.350> good<00:02:49.470> indication<00:02:49.650> there<00:02:50.340> it's

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
gives you a good indication there it's

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.650 
gives you a good indication there it's
there<00:02:50.640> going<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.880> be<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.000> good<00:02:51.240> color<00:02:51.480> lay<00:02:51.720> down

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
there going to be a good color lay down

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.760 
there going to be a good color lay down
and<00:02:55.010> then<00:02:56.010> use<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.580> last<00:02:56.850> of<00:02:57.150> my<00:02:57.450> colors<00:02:57.900> to

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
and then use the last of my colors to

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.350 
and then use the last of my colors to
finish<00:02:59.160> her<00:02:59.370> off<00:03:01.130> what<00:03:02.130> also<00:03:02.370> happens<00:03:03.120> with

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
finish her off what also happens with

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.750 
finish her off what also happens with
the<00:03:03.450> bleed<00:03:03.630> proof<00:03:03.870> paper<00:03:04.110> as<00:03:04.350> well<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:05.550> that

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the bleed proof paper as well is that

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:17.530 
the bleed proof paper as well is that
the<00:03:05.880> alcohol<00:03:06.390> evaporates<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:07.230> lot<00:03:07.440> quicker

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.449 

well<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:18.590> also<00:03:18.950> want<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.459> show<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:21.280> before<00:03:22.280> we

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
well I also want to show you before we

will go through your 80 gram weight

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.410 
will go through your 80 gram weight

will take a photograph with a macro zoom
on<00:03:46.220> there<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:46.579> you<00:03:46.640> can<00:03:46.849> see<00:03:47.709> we're<00:03:48.709> on<00:03:48.829> the

it's<00:04:04.040> worth<00:04:04.280> buying<00:04:04.519> a<00:04:04.700> pad<00:04:04.909> to<00:04:05.389> practice<00:04:05.810> on

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
it's worth buying a pad to practice on

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.129 
it's worth buying a pad to practice on
until<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.069> get<00:04:07.220> used<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.639> it<00:04:07.790> and<00:04:07.940> then<00:04:08.329> once

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
until you get used to it and then once

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.839 
until you get used to it and then once
you've<00:04:09.290> got<00:04:09.440> used<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.769> how<00:04:09.950> color<00:04:10.280> flows<00:04:10.549> down

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
you've got used to how color flows down

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:11.890 
you've got used to how color flows down
then<00:04:11.120> you'll<00:04:11.269> be<00:04:11.359> able<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.629> switch<00:04:11.870> between

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
then you'll be able to switch between

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.839 
then you'll be able to switch between
papers<00:04:12.650> but<00:04:12.829> certainly<00:04:13.159> when<00:04:13.340> you<00:04:13.430> starting
