00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.370 
all right folks what I got here is my

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.170 
all right folks what I got here is my
Clark<00:00:06.700> and<00:00:07.200> x200<00:00:08.549> I'm<00:00:09.549> testing<00:00:10.030> out<00:00:10.120> some

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.180 
Clark and x200 I'm testing out some

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.080 
Clark and x200 I'm testing out some
suspension<00:00:10.840> systems<00:00:11.730> trying<00:00:12.730> to<00:00:12.820> get<00:00:12.970> this

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
suspension systems trying to get this

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.460 
suspension systems trying to get this
thing<00:00:13.300> separated<00:00:13.840> from<00:00:14.050> the<00:00:14.910> from<00:00:15.910> the<00:00:16.000> tarp

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
thing separated from the from the tarp

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.080 
thing separated from the from the tarp
so<00:00:17.470> you<00:00:17.680> can<00:00:17.860> use<00:00:18.099> a<00:00:18.130> different<00:00:18.369> type<00:00:18.550> or<00:00:18.910> hang

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
so you can use a different type or hang

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.080 
so you can use a different type or hang
without<00:00:19.450> the<00:00:19.630> tarp<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.980> tarp<00:00:21.220> holds<00:00:21.579> the<00:00:21.790> the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
without the tarp the tarp holds the the

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.900 
without the tarp the tarp holds the the
tarp<00:00:22.989> holds<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.349> bug<00:00:23.500> netting<00:00:23.710> up<00:00:23.919> with<00:00:24.759> some

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
tarp holds the bug netting up with some

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.790 
tarp holds the bug netting up with some
loops<00:00:25.119> in<00:00:25.270> the<00:00:25.329> tarp<00:00:25.599> so<00:00:25.840> trying<00:00:26.560> to<00:00:26.590> come<00:00:26.710> up

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
loops in the tarp so trying to come up

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.569 
loops in the tarp so trying to come up
with<00:00:26.919> a<00:00:26.980> way<00:00:27.099> to<00:00:27.130> do<00:00:27.369> that<00:00:27.869> what<00:00:28.869> I<00:00:28.899> did<00:00:29.340> was<00:00:30.340> I

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
with a way to do that what I did was I

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.920 
with a way to do that what I did was I
put<00:00:30.730> a<00:00:31.180> prusik<00:00:31.570> loop<00:00:31.899> on<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:33.600> fixed<00:00:34.600> end<00:00:34.750> of

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
put a prusik loop on the fixed end of

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.020 
put a prusik loop on the fixed end of
the<00:00:34.989> adjustable<00:00:35.590> loop<00:00:35.739> you<00:00:36.550> can<00:00:36.699> also<00:00:36.850> hook

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
the adjustable loop you can also hook

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.369 
the adjustable loop you can also hook
this<00:00:37.210> right<00:00:37.420> to<00:00:37.539> your<00:00:37.660> carabiner<00:00:38.140> or<00:00:38.170> your

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
this right to your carabiner or your

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.579 
this right to your carabiner or your
straps<00:00:38.679> whatever<00:00:39.190> I<00:00:40.030> got<00:00:40.899> some<00:00:41.050> a<00:00:41.140> spinners<00:00:41.469> in

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
straps whatever I got some a spinners in

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:44.459 
straps whatever I got some a spinners in
here<00:00:41.739> right<00:00:41.859> now<00:00:42.039> just<00:00:43.109> testing<00:00:44.109> things<00:00:44.320> out

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
here right now just testing things out

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.709 
here right now just testing things out
I'd<00:00:45.250> be<00:00:45.370> nice<00:00:45.550> to<00:00:45.789> eliminate<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:46.329> s<00:00:46.449> beaner

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
I'd be nice to eliminate the s beaner

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.410 
I'd be nice to eliminate the s beaner
and<00:00:47.339> that's<00:00:48.339> what<00:00:48.429> I'm<00:00:48.489> gonna<00:00:48.579> try<00:00:48.789> to<00:00:48.820> do<00:00:49.089> then

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
and that's what I'm gonna try to do then

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.729 
and that's what I'm gonna try to do then
what<00:00:49.570> I<00:00:49.600> did<00:00:49.719> is<00:00:49.839> I<00:00:50.019> just<00:00:50.050> took<00:00:50.230> a<00:00:50.410> standard

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
what I did is I just took a standard

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.459 
what I did is I just took a standard
guideline<00:00:51.190> and<00:00:52.059> brought<00:00:52.749> that<00:00:52.899> down<00:00:53.109> to<00:00:53.410> the

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
guideline and brought that down to the

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.220 
guideline and brought that down to the
attachment<00:00:53.980> point<00:00:54.219> on<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.719> weather<00:00:55.989> shield

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
attachment point on the weather shield

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.779 
attachment point on the weather shield
but<00:00:56.409> they<00:00:56.499> call<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.710> weather<00:00:56.829> shield<00:00:57.129> which

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
but they call the weather shield which

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.779 
but they call the weather shield which
is<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.059> bug<00:00:58.210> net<00:00:59.280> this<00:01:00.280> gives<00:01:00.579> you<00:01:00.670> the

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
is the bug net this gives you the

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.630 
is the bug net this gives you the
flexibility<00:01:01.420> that<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:02.589> shot<00:01:03.129> cord<00:01:03.399> it<00:01:03.460> came

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
flexibility that the shot cord it came

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.230 
flexibility that the shot cord it came
with<00:01:03.960> gives<00:01:04.960> you<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.350> gives<00:01:06.040> you<00:01:06.240> adjust

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
with gives you and gives you adjust

with gives you and gives you adjust
ability<00:01:07.530> right<00:01:08.530> here<00:01:08.770> at<00:01:08.829> the<00:01:08.920> prusik<00:01:09.100> loop

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
ability right here at the prusik loop

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.300 
ability right here at the prusik loop
and<00:01:11.350> then<00:01:11.890> I've<00:01:12.040> got<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.600> slings<00:01:14.070> I've<00:01:15.070> got<00:01:15.280> a

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
and then I've got the slings I've got a

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.850 
and then I've got the slings I've got a
seven-inch<00:01:15.970> continuous<00:01:16.960> loop<00:01:17.200> made<00:01:17.470> up<00:01:17.619> with

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
seven-inch continuous loop made up with

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.490 
seven-inch continuous loop made up with
a<00:01:17.890> ring<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.399> then<00:01:19.119> just<00:01:19.329> a<00:01:19.420> six-foot<00:01:19.840> Whoopie

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
a ring and then just a six-foot Whoopie

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.550 
a ring and then just a six-foot Whoopie
sling<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:22.420> gets<00:01:22.659> your<00:01:22.780> rings<00:01:23.049> under<00:01:23.439> the

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
sling this gets your rings under the

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.170 
sling this gets your rings under the
tarp<00:01:23.799> so<00:01:24.280> that<00:01:24.430> you<00:01:24.549> don't<00:01:24.700> have<00:01:24.880> to<00:01:25.000> worry

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
tarp so that you don't have to worry

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.569 
tarp so that you don't have to worry
about<00:01:25.469> water<00:01:26.469> hitting<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.860> ring<00:01:27.040> outside<00:01:27.460> of

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
about water hitting the ring outside of

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.080 
about water hitting the ring outside of
the<00:01:27.640> tarp<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.439> that's<00:01:29.590> it<00:01:29.829> still<00:01:30.700> working<00:01:30.969> on

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
the tarp and that's it still working on

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.410 
the tarp and that's it still working on
it

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420

you can see I've got a pretty decent
pretty<00:01:35.049> good<00:01:35.170> distance<00:01:35.439> between<00:01:35.590> these<00:01:35.799> two

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
pretty good distance between these two

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.020 
pretty good distance between these two
trees<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:39.490> feels<00:01:39.700> good

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
trees it feels good

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.030 
trees it feels good
looks<00:01:41.720> good<00:01:41.870> still<00:01:42.470> working<00:01:42.740> on<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:42.860> though

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
looks good still working on it though

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.730 
looks good still working on it though
just<00:01:43.430> want<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.670> give<00:01:43.760> everybody<00:01:43.910> an<00:01:44.120> update

just want to give everybody an update
all<00:01:45.740> right<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:46.070> I<00:01:46.100> got<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.400> thinking<00:01:46.730> as<00:01:47.600> I<00:01:47.840> said

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
all right so I got to thinking as I said

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.420 
all right so I got to thinking as I said
my<00:01:48.080> tarp<00:01:48.320> up<00:01:48.470> I<00:01:48.590> noticed<00:01:48.860> that<00:01:49.010> those<00:01:49.130> guy

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
my tarp up I noticed that those guy

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.500 
my tarp up I noticed that those guy
lines<00:01:49.640> are<00:01:49.760> probably<00:01:50.000> just<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.210> little<00:01:50.420> too

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
lines are probably just a little too

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.720 
lines are probably just a little too
close<00:01:50.660> to<00:01:50.870> the<00:01:50.960> top<00:01:51.250> so<00:01:52.250> I<00:01:52.310> thought<00:01:52.520> why<00:01:52.670> not

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
close to the top so I thought why not

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.720 
close to the top so I thought why not
just<00:01:52.880> hook<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:53.240> right<00:01:54.250> above<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.400> ring<00:01:55.580> right

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
just hook it right above the ring right

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.430 
just hook it right above the ring right
here<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:58.340> can<00:01:58.430> see<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:58.910> don't<00:01:59.390> pull<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.320> guy

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
here you can see I don't pull the guy

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.470 
here you can see I don't pull the guy
line<00:02:00.650> tight<00:02:00.860> I<00:02:00.890> just<00:02:01.190> snug<00:02:01.850> it<00:02:01.940> up<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.180> holds

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
line tight I just snug it up so holds
