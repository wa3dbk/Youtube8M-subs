that i can't get into this thing quite a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:24.649 
that i can't get into this thing quite a
bit<00:01:17.900> all<00:01:18.900> right<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.820> then<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> little<00:01:23.659> all

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
bit all right and then the little all

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.960

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
calculates all your points all right so

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.090 
calculates all your points all right so
that<00:03:05.670> further<00:03:06.000> ado<00:03:06.480> let's<00:03:07.440> go<00:03:07.590> ahead<00:03:07.620> and

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
that further ado let's go ahead and

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.729 
that further ado let's go ahead and
knock<00:03:09.800> see<00:03:10.800> start<00:03:11.670> boom<00:03:12.200> all<00:03:13.200> right<00:03:13.320> so<00:03:13.530> what's

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
knock see start boom all right so what's

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.040 
knock see start boom all right so what's
cool<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:13.950> actually<00:03:14.519> this<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.930> kind<00:03:15.930> of

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
cool is actually this is kind of

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.100 
cool is actually this is kind of
perfectly<00:03:16.680> laid<00:03:17.010> across<00:03:19.730> infox<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.239> actually

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
perfectly laid across infox so actually

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.250 
perfectly laid across infox so actually
reading<00:03:22.470> insert<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.340> right<00:03:23.640> into<00:03:23.790> here<00:03:24.260> this

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
reading insert it right into here this

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.130 
reading insert it right into here this

bit of a weight to it alright a little
bit<00:03:46.080> of<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.760> cushioning<00:03:47.760> at<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.000> end<00:03:48.180> here

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.000 

and<00:03:52.720> getting<00:03:53.720> this<00:03:53.810> last<00:03:54.140> piece<00:03:54.790> off<00:03:57.010> all

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
and getting this last piece off all

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.540 
and getting this last piece off all
right

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
right

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.030

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
so we got the end of the rod it is all

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.860 
so we got the end of the rod it is all
metal<00:04:01.600> what<00:04:02.600> looks<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.870> be<00:04:02.990> one<00:04:03.470> solid<00:04:04.370> piece

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
is actually Elvis tape on it oh all

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:16.180 
is actually Elvis tape on it oh all
right

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
right

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.560 
right
came<00:04:16.400> off<00:04:16.640> rate<00:04:16.880> pretty<00:04:17.390> easily<00:04:19.540> all<00:04:20.540> right

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
came off rate pretty easily all right

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.670 
came off rate pretty easily all right
so<00:04:23.920> as<00:04:24.920> for<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.310> crystal<00:04:25.760> ball<00:04:25.970> middle<00:04:26.680> seems

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
so as for the crystal ball middle seems

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.410 
so as for the crystal ball middle seems
like<00:04:27.920> yeah<00:04:28.220> seems<00:04:28.520> like<00:04:28.610> this<00:04:28.850> is<00:04:28.970> all<00:04:29.120> one<00:04:29.390> big

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
piece so basically the ball in the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.830 
piece so basically the ball in the
middle<00:04:33.550> not<00:04:34.550> sure<00:04:34.790> if<00:04:34.910> it<00:04:35.000> actually<00:04:35.150> lights<00:04:35.540> up

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
middle not sure if it actually lights up

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.090 
middle not sure if it actually lights up
or<00:04:36.050> anything<00:04:36.910> but<00:04:37.910> uh<00:04:38.650> there<00:04:39.650> you<00:04:39.710> go

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
or anything but uh there you go

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
you gotta see it it's just this white

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.000 
you gotta see it it's just this white
what<00:04:43.430> looks<00:04:43.610> like<00:04:43.700> a<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:44.260> don't<00:04:45.260> know<00:04:45.380> it's<00:04:45.800> not

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
what looks like a I don't know it's not

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.760 
what looks like a I don't know it's not
glass<00:04:46.430> maybe<00:04:46.940> like<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.300> hard<00:04:47.780> plastic<00:04:48.200> maybe

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
glass maybe like a hard plastic maybe

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.950 
glass maybe like a hard plastic maybe
and<00:04:49.070> then<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:49.910> rest<00:04:50.150> of<00:04:50.300> this<00:04:50.420> actually

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
and then the rest of this actually

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.300 
and then the rest of this actually
starting<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:51.830> wonder<00:04:51.950> if<00:04:52.100> it's<00:04:52.220> actually

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
starting to wonder if it's actually

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.180 
starting to wonder if it's actually
metal<00:04:52.670> some<00:04:53.000> of<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.150> bends<00:04:53.600> so<00:04:53.900> yeah<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.920> pole

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
metal some of the bends so yeah the pole

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.850 
metal some of the bends so yeah the pole
is<00:04:55.430> metal<00:04:55.970> but<00:04:56.690> then<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:56.930> rest<00:04:57.230> of<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.560> top

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
is metal but then the rest of the top

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.790 
is metal but then the rest of the top
part<00:04:58.370> so<00:04:58.490> this<00:04:58.790> right<00:04:59.030> here<00:04:59.090> is<00:04:59.630> made<00:05:00.380> of<00:05:00.530> very

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
part so this right here is made of very

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.910 
part so this right here is made of very
hard<00:05:01.160> plastic<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:02.900> then<00:05:03.080> all<00:05:03.230> of<00:05:03.260> this<00:05:03.590> is

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
hard plastic and then all of this is

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.860 
hard plastic and then all of this is
made<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.460> metal<00:05:04.760> so<00:05:05.680> if<00:05:06.680> I<00:05:06.800> were<00:05:07.040> to<00:05:07.630> raise<00:05:08.630> this

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
made of metal so if I were to raise this

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.940 
made of metal so if I were to raise this
up<00:05:09.140> so<00:05:09.770> you<00:05:09.860> guys<00:05:10.010> get<00:05:10.280> kind<00:05:10.610> of<00:05:10.670> a<00:05:11.530> better<00:05:12.530> just

we're<00:05:28.040> hazing<00:05:28.430> it<00:05:28.550> up<00:05:28.640> so<00:05:29.090> you<00:05:29.180> can<00:05:29.300> see<00:05:29.480> the

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
we're hazing it up so you can see the

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.530 
we're hazing it up so you can see the
height<00:05:29.840> difference<00:05:30.080> here<00:05:31.210> this<00:05:32.210> thing<00:05:32.360> is

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
height difference here this thing is

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.020 
height difference here this thing is
actually<00:05:32.720> six<00:05:33.110> feet<00:05:33.320> tall<00:05:33.700> it's<00:05:34.700> actually

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
actually six feet tall it's actually
