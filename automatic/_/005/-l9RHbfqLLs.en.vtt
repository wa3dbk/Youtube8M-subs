then it will someone a lot of my card

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.390 
then it will someone a lot of my card
command<00:02:30.840> blocks<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.739> basically<00:02:32.130> what<00:02:32.370> it

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
command blocks that basically what it

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.270 
command blocks that basically what it
does<00:02:32.489> is<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.820> either<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.510> clones<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.800> block

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
does is it either it clones the block

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.270 
does is it either it clones the block
next<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:36.090> right<00:02:36.330> in<00:02:37.230> front<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.739> on<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
positive x-axis um and it will clone it

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.860 
positive x-axis um and it will clone it
to<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.370> certain<00:02:44.670> place<00:02:44.790> right<00:02:45.120> around<00:02:45.239> here<00:02:45.690> and

to a certain place right around here and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.560 
to a certain place right around here and
then<00:02:46.290> we'll<00:02:46.440> just<00:02:46.650> delete<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.760> mic<00:02:48.060> the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
then we'll just delete the mic the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.539 
then we'll just delete the mic the
activator<00:02:49.110> rail<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:50.670> UM<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:52.549> redstone

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
activator rail and the UM the redstone

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.180 
activator rail and the UM the redstone
block<00:02:53.820> under<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.390> activator<00:02:54.810> rail<00:02:55.049> then<00:02:55.830> it

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
block under the activator rail then it

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.120 
block under the activator rail then it
Tippy's<00:02:57.120> all<00:02:57.299> those<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.230> Tippy's

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
Tippy's all those to you and Tippy's

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.880 
Tippy's all those to you and Tippy's
them<00:02:59.310> up<00:02:59.459> ten<00:02:59.700> blocks<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:01.850> it<00:03:02.850> sees<00:03:03.269> you<00:03:03.510> back

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
them up ten blocks and it sees you back

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.430 
them up ten blocks and it sees you back
1.5<00:03:04.890> blocks<00:03:05.100> yeah<00:03:05.610> negative<00:03:06.390> 1.5<00:03:06.840> lakhs<00:03:07.200> on

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
1.5 blocks yeah negative 1.5 lakhs on

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.729 
1.5 blocks yeah negative 1.5 lakhs on
the<00:03:07.530> x-axis<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.959> gives<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.260> effect<00:03:10.590> of

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
the x-axis and gives you the effect of

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.740 
the x-axis and gives you the effect of
slowness<00:03:11.100> 41<00:03:11.640> seconds<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:12.570> don't

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
slowness 41 seconds that you don't

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.539 
slowness 41 seconds that you don't
interfere<00:03:13.500> with<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.860> minecart<00:03:14.250> command

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
interfere with the minecart command

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.910 
interfere with the minecart command
blocks<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.420> few<00:03:15.600> seconds<00:03:15.959> later<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.500> kills

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
blocks and a few seconds later it kills

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.170 
blocks and a few seconds later it kills
all<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:18.230> command<00:03:19.230> blocks<00:03:19.440> neck<00:03:19.680> pickup

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
all of the command blocks neck pickup

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.160 
all of the command blocks neck pickup
now<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.540> will<00:03:23.320> get<00:03:23.500> on<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.990> putting<00:03:25.990> down

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
now I will get on to the putting down

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.140 
now I will get on to the putting down
part<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.740> ribs<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.400> starts<00:03:27.700> much<00:03:27.910> the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
part of the ribs so it starts much the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.760 
part of the ribs so it starts much the
same<00:03:28.300> way<00:03:28.360> it<00:03:29.110> tries<00:03:29.770> to<00:03:30.000> test<00:03:31.000> for<00:03:31.270> a<00:03:31.770> book

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
same way it tries to test for a book

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.120 
same way it tries to test for a book
with<00:03:33.040> place<00:03:33.430> down<00:03:33.730> in<00:03:33.760> it<00:03:34.120> then<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.380> gives<00:03:35.920> you

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
with place down in it then it gives you

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.420 
with place down in it then it gives you
a<00:03:36.160> writable<00:03:36.640> book<00:03:36.790> back<00:03:37.060> clears<00:03:37.540> it<00:03:37.780> as<00:03:38.110> well

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
a writable book back clears it as well

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.670 
a writable book back clears it as well
so<00:03:39.430> you<00:03:39.490> have<00:03:39.580> fresh<00:03:39.880> new<00:03:40.090> book<00:03:40.350> falling<00:03:41.350> sand

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
so you have fresh new book falling sand

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.100 
so you have fresh new book falling sand
that's<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.100> redstone<00:03:42.370> block<00:03:42.790> teleports<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.960> to

career blocks they delete the activator

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.110 
career blocks they delete the activator
rail<00:03:56.380> they<00:03:56.890> delete<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.220> rental<00:03:57.670> mock<00:03:57.880> and

rail they delete the rental mock and
then<00:03:58.600> clone<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.020> block<00:03:59.230> that's<00:03:59.440> over<00:03:59.740> here

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
then clone the block that's over here

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.070 
then clone the block that's over here
that<00:04:00.130> was<00:04:00.220> previously<00:04:00.580> cloned<00:04:01.120> by<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.720> pickup

that was previously cloned by the pickup

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.350 
that was previously cloned by the pickup
command<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.710> put<00:04:03.220> it<00:04:03.340> one<00:04:03.700> block<00:04:03.910> out<00:04:04.120> of<00:04:04.240> you

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
command and put it one block out of you

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.050 
command and put it one block out of you
on<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.600> x-axis<00:04:05.940> um<00:04:08.160> then<00:04:09.160> it's<00:04:09.640> someone's

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
on the x-axis um then it's someone's

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.820 
on the x-axis um then it's someone's
those<00:04:10.180> 100<00:04:10.540> blocks<00:04:10.720> in<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.900> air<00:04:11.080> they<00:04:11.620> get

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
those 100 blocks in the air they get

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.980 
those 100 blocks in the air they get
teleported<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.520> you<00:04:12.760> you<00:04:13.270> can<00:04:13.420> teleport<00:04:13.750> eight

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
teleported to you you can teleport eight

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.170 
teleported to you you can teleport eight
blocks<00:04:14.170> into<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.560> air<00:04:14.710> then<00:04:15.520> unit<00:04:15.850> ill<00:04:16.000> afford

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
blocks into the air then unit ill afford

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.210 
blocks into the air then unit ill afford
one<00:04:16.420> point<00:04:16.660> five<00:04:16.810> bucks<00:04:17.200> back<00:04:17.680> on<00:04:17.950> that

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
one point five bucks back on that

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.150 
one point five bucks back on that
negative<00:04:18.610> z<00:04:18.760> axis<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.870> get<00:04:20.020> salon<00:04:20.350> is<00:04:20.440> 40<00:04:20.860> for

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
negative z axis you get salon is 40 for

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.970 
negative z axis you get salon is 40 for
one<00:04:21.310> second<00:04:21.790> and<00:04:22.380> then<00:04:24.540> kills<00:04:25.540> all<00:04:26.170> things

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
one second and then kills all things

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.100 
one second and then kills all things
they<00:04:27.220> pick<00:04:27.460> up<00:04:27.640> and<00:04:27.850> sets<00:04:28.480> the<00:04:28.630> block<00:04:28.810> over

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
they pick up and sets the block over

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.870 
they pick up and sets the block over
there<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:29.470> air<00:04:29.650> so<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.430> you<00:04:30.610> cannot

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
there to air so that you cannot

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.290 
there to air so that you cannot
unlimited<00:04:31.480> place<00:04:31.750> things<00:04:32.050> down<00:04:32.380> and<00:04:33.300> that's

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
unlimited place things down and that's

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.020 
unlimited place things down and that's
it<00:04:34.660> so<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.020> think<00:04:35.290> this<00:04:35.380> is<00:04:35.440> really<00:04:35.770> cool<00:04:36.070> for

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
it so I think this is really cool for

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.820 
it so I think this is really cool for
some<00:04:37.180> reason<00:04:37.450> it<00:04:37.480> doesn't<00:04:37.660> like<00:04:37.930> walls<00:04:38.320> I

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
some reason it doesn't like walls I

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.880 
some reason it doesn't like walls I
don't<00:04:39.520> know<00:04:39.580> why<00:04:40.140> so<00:04:41.140> let's<00:04:41.410> test<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:41.830> right

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
don't know why so let's test it right

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.810 
don't know why so let's test it right
now<00:04:42.210> let's<00:04:43.210> get<00:04:43.360> any<00:04:43.510> old<00:04:43.840> block<00:04:44.080> come<00:04:44.260> on

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
now let's get any old block come on

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.210 
now let's get any old block come on
spruce<00:04:45.820> leaves<00:04:47.970> let<00:04:48.970> is<00:04:49.240> this<00:04:49.360> a<00:04:49.420> positive

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
spruce leaves let is this a positive

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.670 
spruce leaves let is this a positive
x-axis<00:04:52.830> this<00:04:53.830> is<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.340> positive<00:04:54.790> x-axis<00:04:55.410> so<00:04:56.410> we

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
x-axis this is the positive x-axis so we

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.550 
x-axis this is the positive x-axis so we
go<00:04:57.070> down<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:57.490> do<00:04:57.610> it<00:04:57.640> we<00:04:57.970> press<00:04:58.210> we<00:04:58.600> type<00:04:59.260> pick

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
go down and do it we press we type pick

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.620 
go down and do it we press we type pick
up

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
up
