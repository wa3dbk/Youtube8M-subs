00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:08.960
 Just coded anything anyway 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.960
 Remove it like this and again inoue 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.880
 Yes. What yijeongdo now write three lines look to convert their text 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:27.350
 4 It is the first jet here. It was a child. 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:32.179
 I see it all and everything else seems to be straight. 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:38.200
 So itguyo shows a very high turnover rate is now the Education Hanyang text 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:38.200
 I have to change it to Korean, but this also recognizes him. 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:50.219
 I do not recognize it when I write it like this. 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.219
 That this is now changing the text geolro Let me turn to the flat where Hangul 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.680
 Let's just write this handwriting and press Convert to Wrinkle Text. 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.590
 Ah, which Alpha is not the original look 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.470
 Well, I do not get it. 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.470
 I'll write it down once a month. 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.880
 I have this kind of error because it 's what I need now in real time 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.880
 I think you can see it together. 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:37.420
 So this is what I am now. 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:41.680
 It seems a little like this. 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.080
 I think it's a variation of No. 1, 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.170
 Peace can show the country. 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.170
 I'll show you the ability to turn ink into formula again. 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.489
 Then you do so now need to write this article than in reality I write 5 history 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.970
 As a child, I can see it because it's time to recognize it. 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:10.739
 If you click on a lot of guys 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:14.819
 If you change this to something, 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:18.510
 You can see what you're typing and entering 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:23.880
 Something like this can be useful. 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:28.920
 I'll show you something like that next time. 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.780
 HS good doing so itguyo 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.590
 These election packs 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:40.190
 Then you can adjust the color and thickness here 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:43.100
 So qu a lost sense of operating feel can see what you itguyo 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.880
 Then what is written will get back to you with a map to show the details somewhat 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.690
 I'll do it 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.690
 Oh , well, I can not draw pictures anymore 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.690

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:19.500
 I canceled my child so much . 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.500
 You have to show this minimal ability to those who see it. 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.819
 This way it's just like that . Now it's just a bit of detail. 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:39.810
 You can see what you are aware of. 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:42.300
 So I looked, and this no-wakku Now that the Galaxy Note and this for two 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:48.240
 So now I 've used it. 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:51.870
 Wakku as ps discipline is very delicate, but does not nearly do've eaten 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:56.759
 If you think that you can use it comfortably , 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.509
 I do not think it's going to be a problem enough to raise it. 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.509
 4 2 4
