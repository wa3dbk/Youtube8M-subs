00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.440
 we have the bmx now 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.260
 that is executed for example in 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.690
 red that can make you happy 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.270
 that is now available in 2016 with plug 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.700
 axis and there is also a new display 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.920
 not alone in the display that is now 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.440
 the old one and you can see it here 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:37.840
 times the remote controller here 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.940
 it is such a pre-production model of the 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.290
 new then the one then fades in one of the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.370
 really great 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.560
 and that is almost without a display 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.910
 Functional otherwise is a 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.430
 clip set here now fixes 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.380
 at 32- chamber that's the yuan's bio 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.010
 nothing that you can stop yourself 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.750
 and the hand is quiet and powerful 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.210
 and driving makes it fun and here 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.550
 you can see it has nothing bio bikes has 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.710
 now equipped with practically yourself 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.780
 to ascot 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.549
 it could be so handy if 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.970
 It buys itself on his bike 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.500
 m attach then is a great thing 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.720
 You could always change the bike 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.720
 and that remains in the drive skip 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.030
 so again from the place
