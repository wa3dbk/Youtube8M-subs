00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 sense of happiness comes 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.390
 up to mexico mini picks by dwarfs removed 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.680
 of this pet is amazing and is 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.450
 available in our country because I do not 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.310
 accompany you to know the details here in 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.410
 come the joy or the opd pointed 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.530
 and is that having one of these animals 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.300
 it does not replace dogs or cats 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.430
 but it is a good option if what 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.710
 you are a very original pet 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.010
 Arturo Islas saw the great interest of the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.419
 Mexicans and now he 's an expert on the subject 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.730
 the idea is that people can have 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.800
 a pet how are you at home and have 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.780
 the benefits of having a pig in 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.280
 house are extraordinary pets the 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.750
 truth is that it sounds incredible and 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.300
 all the people could be thinking about 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.310
 home like I'm going to have a little room 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.710
 pet but what qualities do the 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.810
 mini tics that obviously make them 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.570
 possible to have then and I live in a 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.190
 apartment or in a house with garden 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.990
 first ipad there are different people who 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.970
 they have different ways of life and there 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.290
 animals that are going to adjust to these 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.880
 different ways of life and why 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.370
 they are animals that fit that perfect 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.360
 they do not pull hair they call them and they can see 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.250
 that in the United States they call the 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.720
 hypoallergenic animals because 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.540
 it really is not an animal that can 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.790
 throw a lot of dandruff do not sweat everything have 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.070
 a very strong smell 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.110
 and with those characteristics still not you 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.090
 enough then there is more to know about the 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.860
 mini picks are animals that do not generate 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.590
 allergies and it is proven that they are 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.750
 Extremely clean 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.670
 look at the wave sizes is for 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.409
 example a pig from a bark that is a 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.259
 pork production can reach 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.179
 weigh up to 500 kilos a large stallion 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.060
 and they are too heavy to weigh 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.679
 between 25 and 30 kilos 30 kilos against 500 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.689
 there is already a big difference 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.299
 speaking that if the size of a puppy 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.509
 or of a normal pet not that they could 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.459
 well, more or less like a cocker spaniel 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.500
 the price goes from 20 to 28 thousand 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.450
 weights are reproduced in different parts 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.179
 of the country depending on the weather and are 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.729
 brought to the capital since they are 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.020
 extraordinary pets for the city 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.220
 that part of legality very important 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.780
 that they know it as such are not animals 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.819
 the people who want to buy it do not 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.409
 they are forbidden animals because it is 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.659
 how I feel to sanction 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.000
 carnitas are if you have to have certain 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.009
 rules and rules are that animals 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.870
 are healthy to comply with a calendar of 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.840
 vaccination as it happens with dogs for 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.540
 do not dispel diseases by talking about 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.129
 little bit about the colors I see that they are 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.379
 different colors or all have the 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.940
 same color as functions not if they are from 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.470
 different colors for example and to the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.790
 that we saw in the entrance were about 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.819
 black services 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.530
 little pigs that are pink with 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.359
 classic piglet rosita and ya are and 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.819
 we know in the cartoons but she 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:37.459
 she is a female and she is already one month old 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.739
 ten days old I want to tell you 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.420
 with this one pig a month ten days of 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.310
 born from a normal farm of 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.689
 reproduction and you talked 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.549
 it must be reaching at least 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:49.670
 the first ten kilos I'm talking 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.409
 that they then compare the size of 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.239
 the mini picks can also live together 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.069
 with other animals that already exist in 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.530
 home are loving they feed on 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.889
 protein and best of all is that it is not 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.900
 an animal that requests extreme care 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:05.329
 they take care of themselves like a dog like a cat or 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.919
 they have a more careful look are animals 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.060
 that can be taken care of perfectly as 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.069
 you take care of a dog, a cat, you do not have to 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.659
 compare because it's not the same 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.489
 responsibility from the owners 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.919
 but it is an animal that for example has 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.919
 a great advantage that if we 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:20.930
 we dedicate 100% in their childhood to educate 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:23.030
 and teach what we're going to have a lot 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.100
 success in the long run 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.050
 Well, now it's clearer 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.000
 that having a dwarf piglet is much more 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.430
 simple of what this looks like this 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.439
 is this is not true 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.269
 and what do you think the truth is 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.640
 extraordinary the mini picks the 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:42.020
 small pigs and available already in 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:50.740
 our country come joy 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:50.740
