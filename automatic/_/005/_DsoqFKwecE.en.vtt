going to notice in this set of videos
that<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.930> start<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.350> utilize<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.100> rivet<00:01:02.730> gun<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
that I start to utilize the rivet gun a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.160 
that I start to utilize the rivet gun a
little<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:05.750> can<00:01:06.750> snipe

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
little more as you can see you can snipe

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.380

these<00:01:07.549> splicers<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.880> hit<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> head

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
these splicers with one hit to the head

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.390 
these splicers with one hit to the head
it's<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.080> very<00:01:10.260> effective<00:01:10.530> strategy<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.189> got<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it's a very effective strategy we got a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.810 
it's a very effective strategy we got a
distance<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:13.229> utilize<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.830> again<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> lot<00:01:14.490> in

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
distance and I utilize it again a lot in

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.580 
distance and I utilize it again a lot in
these<00:01:15.060> these<00:01:15.479> videos<00:01:17.780> some<00:01:18.780> background<00:01:19.320> on

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
these these videos some background on

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.130 
these these videos some background on
this<00:01:19.830> first<00:01:20.159> Big<00:01:20.909> Daddy<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:22.220> part<00:01:23.840> was<00:01:24.840> just

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
this first Big Daddy this part was just

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.510 
this first Big Daddy this part was just
rot<00:01:25.830> with<00:01:26.240> problems<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.570> issues<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.860> taking

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
rot with problems and issues and taking

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.899 
rot with problems and issues and taking
down<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.820> big<00:01:30.090> daddy<00:01:31.250> probably<00:01:32.250> took<00:01:32.520> not

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
down this big daddy probably took not

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.179 
down this big daddy probably took not
really<00:01:33.390> about<00:01:34.430> twenty<00:01:35.430> takes<00:01:36.829> until<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.890> was

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
really about twenty takes until I was

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.190 
really about twenty takes until I was
comfortable<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.509> even<00:01:39.630> then<00:01:39.930> it's

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
comfortable with it and even then it's

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.469 
comfortable with it and even then it's
still<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:41.070> how<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:42.060> would<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.540> liked<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.899> but

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
still not how I would have liked it but

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.330 
still not how I would have liked it but
the<00:01:45.479> general<00:01:45.810> strategy<00:01:45.990> i<00:01:46.229> was<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:46.799> is

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the general strategy i was going for is

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.569 
the general strategy i was going for is
kind<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.149> collecting<00:01:48.630> explosive<00:01:49.320> barrels<00:01:49.740> on

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
kind of collecting explosive barrels on

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.389 
kind of collecting explosive barrels on
the<00:01:50.850> top<00:01:51.060> here<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:52.460> then<00:01:54.950> taking<00:01:55.950> over<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
the top here and then taking over the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.840 
the top here and then taking over the
camera<00:01:56.880> um<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.020> bottom<00:01:58.409> right

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
camera um to the bottom right

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.390 
camera um to the bottom right
and<00:02:00.590> pulling<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.680> big<00:02:01.830> daddy<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.189> there

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
and pulling the big daddy in there

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.070 
and pulling the big daddy in there
getting<00:02:02.790> him<00:02:02.970> on<00:02:03.090> camera<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.659> having<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
getting him on camera and having the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.450 
getting him on camera and having the
charts<00:02:04.350> attack<00:02:04.619> him<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.130> while<00:02:05.280> he's

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
charts attack him and while he's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.150 
charts attack him and while he's
distracted<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:06.240> unload<00:02:06.600> heavy<00:02:07.560> rivets<00:02:07.979> on

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
distracted you unload heavy rivets on

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.830 
distracted you unload heavy rivets on
him<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.670> throw<00:02:09.209> barrels<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:12.540> fight

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
him and throw barrels this fight

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.430 
him and throw barrels this fight
probably<00:02:13.560> works<00:02:14.989> twenty<00:02:15.989> percent<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.350> the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
probably works twenty percent of the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.820 
probably works twenty percent of the
time<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.950> it's<00:02:17.760> not<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.209> best<00:02:18.360> strategy<00:02:18.830> but

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
time and it's not the best strategy but

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.110 
time and it's not the best strategy but
if<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.580> can<00:02:20.790> get<00:02:20.970> him<00:02:21.180> distracted<00:02:21.810> by

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
if you can get him distracted by

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.120 
if you can get him distracted by
centuries<00:02:24.140> from<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.290> camera<00:02:25.709> then<00:02:25.950> you're

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
centuries from the camera then you're

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.030 
centuries from the camera then you're
probably<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.580> good<00:02:26.730> shape<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:28.410> just<00:02:28.770> unload

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
probably in good shape you just unload

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.620 
probably in good shape you just unload
as<00:02:29.069> many<00:02:29.340> barrels<00:02:29.700> as<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:30.330> them<00:02:30.480> and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
as many barrels as you can on them and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.550 
as many barrels as you can on them and
then<00:02:31.170> use<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.160> lecher<00:02:32.430> shock<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:33.630> stun<00:02:34.319> him

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
then use the lecher shock to stun him

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.009 
then use the lecher shock to stun him
and<00:02:34.860> stop<00:02:35.310> him<00:02:35.340> from<00:02:35.610> shooting<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:36.330> centuries

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
and stop him from shooting the centuries

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.960 
and stop him from shooting the centuries
giving<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.680> more<00:02:37.860> time<00:02:38.010> future<00:02:38.340> rivets<00:02:38.760> and

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
giving you more time future rivets and

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.910 
giving you more time future rivets and
then<00:02:39.600> finally<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:40.019> machine<00:02:40.319> gun<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.709> enter

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
then finally a machine gun to enter

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.259 
then finally a machine gun to enter
grades<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:43.019> was<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.440> strategy<00:02:43.680> um<00:02:44.269> but

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
grades so that was the strategy um but

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.449 
grades so that was the strategy um but
sometimes<00:02:46.140> he<00:02:46.290> gets<00:02:46.380> distracted<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.190> he<00:02:47.280> gets

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
sometimes he gets distracted and he gets

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.430 
sometimes he gets distracted and he gets
kind<00:02:47.819> of<00:02:49.069> held<00:02:50.069> back<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:51.180> back<00:02:51.390> area<00:02:51.660> so

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
kind of held back in this back area so

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.070 
kind of held back in this back area so
he<00:02:52.860> doesn't<00:02:53.069> quite<00:02:53.540> do<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.569> in<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.870> best

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
he doesn't quite do it in the best

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.630 
he doesn't quite do it in the best
amount<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.500> time<00:02:55.680> he<00:02:55.950> doesn't<00:02:56.100> get<00:02:56.310> over<00:02:56.489> to

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
amount of time he doesn't get over to

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.590 
amount of time he doesn't get over to
that<00:02:56.670> side<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:58.290> think<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:58.950> just

that side and I think I have to just

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.570 
that side and I think I have to just
shoot<00:03:00.600> him<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:01.230> get<00:03:01.500> his<00:03:01.620> attention
