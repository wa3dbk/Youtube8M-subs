00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.900 
hey guys Michael anar is here from
simple<00:00:03.149> nursing<00:00:03.680> comm<00:00:04.680> today<00:00:05.609> we're<00:00:05.700> going<00:00:05.790> to

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
simple nursing comm today we're going to

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.030 
simple nursing comm today we're going to
be<00:00:05.970> going<00:00:06.120> over<00:00:06.390> hypotonic<00:00:07.319> fluids

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
be going over hypotonic fluids

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.759 
be going over hypotonic fluids
hypertonic<00:00:08.940> fluids<00:00:09.510> as<00:00:09.750> well<00:00:10.469> as<00:00:10.590> your

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
hypertonic fluids as well as your

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.400 
hypertonic fluids as well as your
isotonic<00:00:11.700> fluids<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.719> let's<00:00:12.900> get<00:00:13.080> into<00:00:13.380> it

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
isotonic fluids so let's get into it

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
isotonic fluids so let's get into it
here<00:00:14.299> alright<00:00:15.299> guys<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:15.949> the<00:00:16.949> way<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.279> I

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
here alright guys so the way that I

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.300 
here alright guys so the way that I
remember<00:00:17.810> hypotonic<00:00:18.810> fluids<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.039> got<00:00:20.189> to

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
remember hypotonic fluids is you got to

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.300 
remember hypotonic fluids is you got to
relate<00:00:20.670> anything<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.720> pathophysiology<00:00:22.320> back

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
relate anything in pathophysiology back

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.670 
relate anything in pathophysiology back
to<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.939> picture<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.570> your<00:00:24.600> mind<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.439> kind<00:00:25.619> of

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
to a picture in your mind to kind of

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.509 
to a picture in your mind to kind of
help<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.949> remember

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
help you remember

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.960 
help you remember
so<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.930> way<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.109> remember<00:00:28.410> hypotonic<00:00:29.220> fluids

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
so the way I remember hypotonic fluids

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.060 
so the way I remember hypotonic fluids
remember<00:00:30.390> when<00:00:30.539> fluid<00:00:31.050> goes<00:00:31.320> into<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> cell

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
remember when fluid goes into the cell

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.110 
remember when fluid goes into the cell
that<00:00:32.279> starts<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.669> swell<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.500> turn<00:00:34.500> hypo<00:00:35.090> into<00:00:36.090> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
that starts to swell I turn hypo into a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.840 
that starts to swell I turn hypo into a
hippo<00:00:36.540> now<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.770> know<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.070> looks<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> pig

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
hippo now I know this looks like a pig

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.200 
hippo now I know this looks like a pig
but<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:40.260> did<00:00:40.680> my<00:00:40.800> best<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.280> try<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.610> draw<00:00:41.820> hippo

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
but I did my best to try to draw hippo

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.340 
but I did my best to try to draw hippo
for<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.530> think<00:00:44.520> about<00:00:44.610> fluid<00:00:45.360> going<00:00:45.750> into

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
for you so think about fluid going into

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.340 
for you so think about fluid going into
your<00:00:46.500> cell<00:00:47.570> making<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.690> big<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.820> swollen<00:00:51.350> runs

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
your cell making it big and swollen runs

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.250 
your cell making it big and swollen runs
like<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.530> hippo<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.280> got<00:00:53.520> hippo<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.260> hypotonic

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
like a hippo I got hippo so hypotonic

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.799 
like a hippo I got hippo so hypotonic
fluids<00:00:55.770> hippo<00:00:56.250> tonic<00:00:56.610> glutes<00:00:56.820> that's<00:00:57.539> what<00:00:57.719> I

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
fluids hippo tonic glutes that's what I

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.340 
fluids hippo tonic glutes that's what I
remember<00:00:58.430> next<00:00:59.430> guys<00:00:59.730> is<00:01:00.090> our<00:01:00.480> hypertonic

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
remember next guys is our hypertonic

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.799 
remember next guys is our hypertonic
fluids<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.730> what's<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> first<00:01:03.449> thing<00:01:03.780> that

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
fluids so what's the first thing that

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.899 
fluids so what's the first thing that
you<00:01:04.049> think<00:01:04.290> about<00:01:04.409> when<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.369> hear<00:01:05.519> someone's

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
you think about when you hear someone's

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.770 
you think about when you hear someone's
hyper<00:01:06.530> yeah<00:01:07.530> they<00:01:07.830> got<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> lot<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.250> energy

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
hyper yeah they got a lot of energy

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.750 
hyper yeah they got a lot of energy
usually<00:01:09.780> people<00:01:10.380> with<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> lot<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.830> energy<00:01:11.040> like

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
usually people with a lot of energy like

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.730 
usually people with a lot of energy like
to<00:01:11.909> run<00:01:12.090> around<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.479> lot<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:13.470> makes<00:01:13.619> them

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
to run around a lot that makes them

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.109 
to run around a lot that makes them
skinny<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:15.560> hypertonic<00:01:16.560> fluids<00:01:17.159> make<00:01:17.880> those

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
skinny so hypertonic fluids make those

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.600 
skinny so hypertonic fluids make those
cells<00:01:18.500> skinny<00:01:19.500> because<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.189> all<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
cells skinny because you have all the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.060 
cells skinny because you have all the
fluid<00:01:21.000> escaping<00:01:21.930> from<00:01:22.320> your<00:01:22.530> cells<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.390> that

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
fluid escaping from your cells so that

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.740 
fluid escaping from your cells so that
is<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> way<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.369> remember<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> hypertonic

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
is the way I remember a hypertonic

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.859 
is the way I remember a hypertonic
fluids<00:01:28.320> because<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.280> fluid<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.210> escaping

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
fluids because that fluid is escaping

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.980 
fluids because that fluid is escaping
from<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> cell<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.909> last<00:01:33.210> one<00:01:33.479> guys

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
from the cell the last one guys

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.560 
from the cell the last one guys
is<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:34.430> isotonic<00:01:35.430> fluids<00:01:38.090> now<00:01:39.090> how<00:01:39.329> do<00:01:39.390> you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
is your isotonic fluids now how do you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.929 
is your isotonic fluids now how do you
remember<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.740> isotonic<00:01:41.640> fluids<00:01:42.350> remain

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
remember that isotonic fluids remain

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.910 
remember that isotonic fluids remain
intravascular<00:01:44.939> Li<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.899> they<00:01:46.380> don't<00:01:46.649> cause

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
intravascular Li and they don't cause

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.289 
intravascular Li and they don't cause
any<00:01:47.159> shift<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:48.110> osmosis<00:01:49.110> from<00:01:50.100> cell<00:01:50.490> to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
any shift in osmosis from cell to

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.080 
any shift in osmosis from cell to
vascular<00:01:51.960> spaces<00:01:52.430> how<00:01:53.430> do<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.610> remember<00:01:53.729> that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
vascular spaces how do you remember that

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.940 
vascular spaces how do you remember that
the<00:01:54.899> way<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.079> remember<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.600> so<00:01:57.600> perfect<00:01:58.320> so

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the way I remember it is I so perfect so

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.580 
the way I remember it is I so perfect so
it's<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.880> perfect<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:01.200> know<00:02:01.350> you're

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it's I so perfect you know you're

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.580 
it's I so perfect you know you're
perfect<00:02:02.060> you're<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.899> don't<00:02:04.079> need<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> change

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
perfect you're you don't need a change

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.170 
perfect you're you don't need a change
you<00:02:04.860> don't<00:02:05.009> need<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> game<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.939> you

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
you don't need a game and you

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.740 
you don't need a game and you
to<00:02:06.360> lose<00:02:06.570> its<00:02:06.900> so<00:02:07.680> perfect<00:02:08.460> so<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.179> perfect

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
to lose its so perfect so I so perfect

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.470 
to lose its so perfect so I so perfect
is<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.590> way<00:02:10.710> that<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.890> remember<00:02:11.460> that<00:02:11.670> it

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
is the way that I remember that it

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.650 
is the way that I remember that it
doesn't<00:02:12.780> cause<00:02:12.960> any<00:02:13.170> osmosis<00:02:13.710> ships<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.510> as

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
doesn't cause any osmosis ships so as

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.960 
doesn't cause any osmosis ships so as
long<00:02:15.780> as<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.020> guys<00:02:16.140> remember<00:02:16.610> hypo<00:02:17.610> meaning

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
long as you guys remember hypo meaning

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.150 
long as you guys remember hypo meaning
hippo<00:02:18.770> swollen<00:02:20.750> swollen<00:02:21.750> cells<00:02:22.160> hyper

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
hippo swollen swollen cells hyper

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.810 
hippo swollen swollen cells hyper
meaning<00:02:23.850> hyper<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:25.470> skinny<00:02:25.890> skinny<00:02:26.520> cells

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
meaning hyper like skinny skinny cells

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.300
