but most people do this so I prefer to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.320 
but most people do this so I prefer to
actually<00:01:23.070> stay<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.340> behind<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.970> area

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
actually stay in behind this area

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.420 
actually stay in behind this area
because<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.710> can't<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> people

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
because you can you can't see the people

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.940 
because you can you can't see the people
that<00:01:26.820> come<00:01:27.420> around<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.810> building<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.710> you

that come around the building but you

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.370 
that come around the building but you
have<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> better<00:01:29.369> chance<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.840> somebody<00:01:31.079> not

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
