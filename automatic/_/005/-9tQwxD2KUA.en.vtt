00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.720
 when we arrive at that to construct a new station remove as 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.339
 first your old lawn 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.059
 or start working on the substrate 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.539
 your old lawn will be removed by us with a turf cutting machine and 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.659
 removed 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:23.899
 it is important to loosen the substrate before laying the turf 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.099
 by leveling comes a flat surface is created at the ing 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.279
 as soon as the bed has been made for this burned off, a heavy gas explosion 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.560
 in this way the substrate is 100 percent the same and the turf can 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.110
 be laid 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.710
 before we laid the turf we made sure the substrate was good 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.830
 fertilize 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.400
 it is important to get a faster and better growth of the turf 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.050
 when the manure is scattered, we can lay the turf 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.270
 we start with the rollout of a leader 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.910
 It is important that we roll the first turf as close as possible to the 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.470
 lay the longest right-hand side of the lawn 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.560
 therefore it is a quick loss on the other sides at least we close the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.560
 perfectly matched turf 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.540
 cutting the gas starts with a knife roughly 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.120
 to give the lawn the right shape, but the teeth are cut to the right 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.250
 distance 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.700
 With a special cutting technique we can create beautiful curves in the lawn 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.330
 as soon as the turf has been laid, our coin of sun will be carefully checked 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.420
 so about closer to the last softer the spots and all disappears 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.000
 air traffic may still be under the mat 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.830
 it ensures that the turf can quickly take root your lawn now 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.400
 ready to care 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.180
 it is important to water the grass immediately 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.380
 the first fourteen days to come, the lawn must be sprayed every day 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.560
 you have not yet entered the gas 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.619
 after two weeks the lawn must be made for the first time 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.030
 you can now enjoy the new lawn
