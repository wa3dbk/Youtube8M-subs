regionals<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.550> year<00:00:42.140> he<00:00:43.140> was<00:00:43.770> still<00:00:43.950> running

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
regionals this year he was still running

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.850 
regionals this year he was still running
fairly<00:00:44.700> well<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.390> he<00:00:45.840> didn't<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.710> much

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
fairly well but he didn't have this much

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.690 
fairly well but he didn't have this much
energy<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.969> put<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.450> down<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:49.020> him<00:00:49.200> being

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
energy and I put that down to him being

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.549 
energy and I put that down to him being
older<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.449> his<00:00:51.780> aging<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.410> he's

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
older and just to his aging so he's

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.770 
older and just to his aging so he's
slowing<00:00:52.920> down<00:00:52.949> not<00:00:53.550> quite<00:00:53.850> looking<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.360> happy

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
slowing down not quite looking as happy

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.459 
slowing down not quite looking as happy
his<00:00:55.050> eyes<00:00:55.289> were<00:00:55.559> kind<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.829> dull<00:00:56.660> so<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:58.170> figured

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
his eyes were kind of dull so we figured

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.720 
his eyes were kind of dull so we figured
that<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.949> was<00:00:59.100> gonna<00:00:59.219> be<00:00:59.399> his<00:00:59.550> last

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
that that this was gonna be his last

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.810 
that that this was gonna be his last
year<00:01:00.230> jumping<00:01:01.230> at<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> higher<00:01:01.770> height<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.399> then

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
year jumping at a higher height and then

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.929 
year jumping at a higher height and then
he<00:01:03.000> would<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.180> moving<00:01:03.449> into<00:01:03.570> veterans<00:01:04.519> he<00:01:05.519> had

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
he would be moving into veterans he had

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.050 
he would be moving into veterans he had
a<00:01:05.970> lot<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.299> weight<00:01:06.450> loss<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> what<00:01:08.939> we

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
a lot of weight loss here but so what we
