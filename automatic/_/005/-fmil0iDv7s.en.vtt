 opportune moment I saw that you are 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.910
 young people only 21 but three years old 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.230
 series championships behind the which 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.649
 means that a little bit of a mess-tin has it already 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.120
 made yes three series championships of 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.559
 serious experiences I've already done but me 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.350
 I was hoping for a jump arrived for 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.270
 Luckily this year are 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.699
 very happy and delighted mind 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.850
 we hope that everything goes as well as of 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.229
 via mezzocorona s to the urn company in the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.850
 which one you grew up for 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.920
 opportunity that this is created for you 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.170
 summer but it's definitely all if they 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.720
 I grew up as a child I made up 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.369
 in excellence all there at the salon or later the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.259
 half chrome gave the chance with 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.290
 the beretti series of series b un 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.090
 very difficult championship and I learned 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.390
 many many things even playing with 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.100
 players of enough players 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.409
 important as improvements that has me 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.390
 taught many things like de agostini 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.400
 actors that I learned so much 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.840
 so surely it was one thing 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.030
 positive 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.049
 you also needed the Marano experience 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.670
 in the second part of last year 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.500
 season always in series d but is one 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.259
 series to win even if then won 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.570
 the pordenone is quite another thing to 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.250
 series to be saved to win none 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.130
 race this year and helped me 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.320
 certainly so much because at the level 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.020
 of rhythm I don't suffer so much having already 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.390
 that is, having never trained with the morano 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.760
 because already there that already higher pace than 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.680
 at half-court in a three- handed midfield 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.110
 like the one the coach plays with 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.530
 rastelli which positions can cover 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.180
 fabian tait but I must always be sincere 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.830
 played a midfield of three with everyone 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.230
 coaches I've had I've always done 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.880
 inside the midfield and anyway 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.840
 I play where the minister puts me 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.940
 happy and I adapt we say to the already has 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.340
 noticed the differences that exist 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.620
 between the fact of playing in series d and 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.510
 play and train for the moment in 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.239
 a first division league pro team 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.090
 that is if you have but certainly level 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.400
 it's very high pace you don't have 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.130
 time to stop the ball and watch that is 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.130
 you have to get everything done faster 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.320
 at the same time and much higher pace 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.600
 as said before it is more difficult more 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.760
 hard you have a dedication for this 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.440
 opportunity he says created in the field 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.190
 your professional in football 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.170
 great passion 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.440
 yes I dedicate it to my mother who looks at me 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.440
 from up there
