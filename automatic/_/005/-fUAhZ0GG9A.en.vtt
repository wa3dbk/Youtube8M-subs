we've<00:01:36.119> got<00:01:36.150> here<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> insulation<00:01:37.229> guide<00:01:37.560> and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
we've got here the insulation guide and

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.359 
we've got here the insulation guide and
ill<00:01:38.790> see<00:01:38.939> just<00:01:39.150> standard<00:01:39.900> wipe<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.740> down<00:01:40.890> stick

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
ill see just standard wipe it down stick

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.560 
ill see just standard wipe it down stick
it<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.579> basic<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.090> that's<00:01:42.210> pretty<00:01:42.329> much<00:01:42.450> it

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
it on basic and that's pretty much it

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.710 
it on basic and that's pretty much it
it's<00:01:43.259> still<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.619> same<00:01:43.649> installation<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.180> as

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
it's still the same installation and as

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.530 
it's still the same installation and as
a<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.680> standard<00:01:47.189> screen<00:01:47.399> protector<00:01:47.820> but

obviously<00:01:48.810> you'll<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:49.020> able<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:49.350> here

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
obviously you'll be able to see here

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.399 
obviously you'll be able to see here
there<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.909> very<00:01:51.180> different<00:01:51.630> source<00:01:51.990> includes

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
there is very different source includes

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.020 
there is very different source includes
the<00:01:52.530> whole<00:01:52.740> sector<00:01:53.430> zipper<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.880> look

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
the whole sector zipper just to look

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.880 
the whole sector zipper just to look
into<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.390> now<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:57.200> probably<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.710> very

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
into this now I probably have to be very

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.069 
into this now I probably have to be very
careful<00:01:59.189> as<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.729> bend<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.420> screen<00:02:00.659> protector

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
careful as you bend the screen protector

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.600 
careful as you bend the screen protector
