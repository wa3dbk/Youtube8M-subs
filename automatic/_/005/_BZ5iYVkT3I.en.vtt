queued up for you guys but this is going
to<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> short<00:00:37.800> update<00:00:38.430> here<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.940> part<00:00:39.390> three

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
to be a short update here on part three

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.930 
to be a short update here on part three
didn't<00:00:39.870> get<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> whole<00:00:40.290> lot<00:00:40.500> done<00:00:40.730> and<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
didn't get a whole lot done and the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.819 
didn't get a whole lot done and the
reason<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.989> buyer<00:00:43.170> decided<00:00:43.590> he

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
reason for that is the buyer decided he

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.880 
reason for that is the buyer decided he
wants<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.160> go<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.520> new<00:00:44.670> PE<00:00:44.969> TG<00:00:45.890> tubing

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
wants to go with the new PE TG tubing

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.200 
wants to go with the new PE TG tubing
which<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.280> acrylic<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.879> supposed<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.149> be

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
which is not acrylic it's supposed to be

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.880 
which is not acrylic it's supposed to be
a<00:00:48.239> better<00:00:48.420> material<00:00:48.660> harder<00:00:49.410> material

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
a better material harder material

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.010 
a better material harder material
supposed<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.219> bend<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.550> little<00:00:50.760> bit<00:00:50.879> better<00:00:51.030> so

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
supposed to bend a little bit better so

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.750 
supposed to bend a little bit better so
anything<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.739> see<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:53.190> tubing<00:00:53.610> wise

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
anything that you see here tubing wise

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.520 
anything that you see here tubing wise
is<00:00:53.969> pretty<00:00:54.239> much<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.750> mock-up<00:00:55.020> where<00:00:55.410> I'm

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
is pretty much just a mock-up where I'm

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.740 
is pretty much just a mock-up where I'm
getting<00:00:55.800> all<00:00:55.890> my<00:00:56.039> planning<00:00:56.550> ready<00:00:56.760> which<00:00:57.629> I

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
getting all my planning ready which I

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.900 
getting all my planning ready which I
mentioned<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.199> part<00:00:58.379> 2<00:00:58.649> planning<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.609> key

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
mentioned in part 2 planning is key

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.330 
mentioned in part 2 planning is key
especially<00:01:00.359> when<00:01:00.960> once<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.620> bend<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.070> stuff

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
especially when once you bend this stuff

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.160 
especially when once you bend this stuff
it<00:01:02.609> never<00:01:02.940> goes<00:01:03.120> back<00:01:03.359> straight<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:03.989> you're

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
it never goes back straight so you're

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.140 
it never goes back straight so you're
kind<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.470> stuck<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:05.970> get

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
kind of stuck with it so what do we get

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:54.819 
kind of stuck with it so what do we get
done<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.479> time<00:01:06.720> around

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.050 

all<00:01:55.829> right<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.069> this<00:01:56.189> time<00:01:56.399> around<00:01:56.670> as<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.030> can

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
all right so this time around as you can

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.639 
all right so this time around as you can
see<00:01:57.390> here<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.780> do<00:01:57.899> have<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> piece<00:01:58.319> of<00:01:58.469> acrylic

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
see here we do have a piece of acrylic

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.499 
see here we do have a piece of acrylic
tubing<00:01:59.159> that's<00:01:59.280> got<00:01:59.520> kind<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.969> funky<00:02:00.299> Bend

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
tubing that's got kind of a funky Bend

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.149 
tubing that's got kind of a funky Bend
in<00:02:00.719> there<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> way<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.100> looks

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
in there I like the way that that looks

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.740 
in there I like the way that that looks
because<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.789> want<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.060> try<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.360> keep<00:02:03.479> as<00:02:03.630> many

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
because I want to try and keep as many

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.440 
because I want to try and keep as many
right<00:02:04.110> angles<00:02:04.319> as<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:05.069> in<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.240> as<00:02:06.329> I

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
right angles as I can in this and as I

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.330 
right angles as I can in this and as I
mentioned<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.439> mock-up<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.220> is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
mentioned this is just a mock-up this is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.940 
mentioned this is just a mock-up this is
not<00:02:08.549> perfect<00:02:09.060> by<00:02:09.149> any<00:02:09.179> means<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.989> fact<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
not perfect by any means in fact the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.619 
not perfect by any means in fact the
bend<00:02:11.129> right<00:02:11.459> here<00:02:11.760> I'm<00:02:11.879> not<00:02:11.910> too<00:02:12.209> happy<00:02:12.420> with

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
bend right here I'm not too happy with

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.170 
bend right here I'm not too happy with
the<00:02:12.989> problem<00:02:13.709> with<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.190> I've<00:02:14.400> got<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.730> 90

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
the problem with that is I've got a 90

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.690 
the problem with that is I've got a 90
followed<00:02:15.540> by<00:02:15.660> another<00:02:15.870> 90<00:02:16.410> going<00:02:16.799> to<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.640> know

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
followed by another 90 going to you know

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.280 
followed by another 90 going to you know
completely<00:02:18.180> perpendicular<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.930> each<00:02:19.170> other

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
completely perpendicular to each other

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.050 
completely perpendicular to each other
which<00:02:19.590> makes<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.980> very<00:02:20.010> difficult<00:02:20.489> Bend

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
which makes a very difficult Bend

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.120 
which makes a very difficult Bend
especially<00:02:22.019> since<00:02:22.260> when<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.470> heat<00:02:22.769> up<00:02:22.799> this

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
especially since when you heat up this

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.860 
especially since when you heat up this
part<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.519> acrylic<00:02:23.790> right<00:02:24.150> here<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.720> get

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
part of the acrylic right here to get

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.870 
part of the acrylic right here to get
this<00:02:25.019> Bend<00:02:25.290> inevitably<00:02:26.190> it's<00:02:26.459> going<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.670> heat

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
this Bend inevitably it's going to heat

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.610 
this Bend inevitably it's going to heat
up<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.209> part<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.599> little<00:02:27.720> bit<00:02:27.870> which<00:02:28.170> causes

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
up this part a little bit which causes

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.520 
up this part a little bit which causes
it<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.769> lose<00:02:29.099> some<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.400> its<00:02:29.579> nice<00:02:29.849> squared<00:02:30.630> you

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
it to lose some of its nice squared you

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.220 
it to lose some of its nice squared you
know<00:02:31.650> perfect<00:02:32.160> tea<00:02:32.489> angle<00:02:32.910> overall<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.900> guess

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
know perfect tea angle overall I guess

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.979 
know perfect tea angle overall I guess
in<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.739> radius<00:02:35.069> if<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.310> makes<00:02:35.519> any<00:02:35.640> sense

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
in the radius if that makes any sense

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.600 
in the radius if that makes any sense
but<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.620> perfect<00:02:38.010> by<00:02:38.099> any<00:02:38.129> means<00:02:38.310> but

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
but this is not perfect by any means but

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.339 
but this is not perfect by any means but
this<00:02:38.849> is<00:02:39.030> going<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.299> serve<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:40.049> perfect

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
this is going to serve as a perfect

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.080 
this is going to serve as a perfect
mock-up<00:02:40.950> or<00:02:41.129> template<00:02:41.549> for<00:02:41.730> me<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.879> follow

mock-up or template for me to follow

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.539 
mock-up or template for me to follow
when<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.390> get<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.660> new<00:02:42.780> tubing<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.349> stock<00:02:43.620> or<00:02:44.370> in

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
when I get the new tubing in stock or in

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.949 
when I get the new tubing in stock or in
here<00:02:44.819> which<00:02:44.970> is<00:02:45.120> what<00:02:45.269> we're<00:02:45.390> going<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.569> use<00:02:45.750> so

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
here which is what we're going to use so

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.619 
here which is what we're going to use so
this<00:02:46.170> inevitably<00:02:46.739> is<00:02:46.920> coming<00:02:47.250> out<00:02:47.430> I'm<00:02:48.420> going

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
this inevitably is coming out I'm going

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.030 
this inevitably is coming out I'm going
to<00:02:48.690> end<00:02:48.810> up<00:02:48.870> leaving<00:02:49.140> these<00:02:49.290> two<00:02:49.319> pieces<00:02:49.709> in

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
to end up leaving these two pieces in

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.710 
to end up leaving these two pieces in
here<00:02:50.280> on<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.519> bridge<00:02:50.849> I<00:02:51.060> made<00:02:51.239> for<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.569> two

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
here on the bridge I made for the two

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.420 
here on the bridge I made for the two
graphics<00:02:52.170> cards<00:02:52.470> because<00:02:52.799> these<00:02:53.069> are<00:02:53.250> such

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
graphics cards because these are such

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.220 
graphics cards because these are such
short<00:02:53.760> little<00:02:53.910> pieces<00:02:54.180> right<00:02:54.359> there<00:02:54.690> whether

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
short little pieces right there whether

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.170 
short little pieces right there whether
they're<00:02:55.470> acrylic<00:02:55.859> or<00:02:56.010> PE<00:02:56.160> TG<00:02:56.549> won't<00:02:56.880> matter

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
they're acrylic or PE TG won't matter

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.150 
they're acrylic or PE TG won't matter
whatsoever<00:02:57.630> same<00:02:58.440> with<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:58.739> piece<00:02:58.950> right

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
whatsoever same with this piece right

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.520 
whatsoever same with this piece right
here<00:02:59.220> between<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.940> CPU<00:03:00.299> block<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.019> the

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
here between the CPU block and the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.080 
here between the CPU block and the
motherboard<00:03:01.859> block<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.489> that's<00:03:02.730> going<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:02.970> be

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
motherboard block so that's going to be

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.270 
motherboard block so that's going to be
remaining<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:04.109> there<00:03:04.319> this<00:03:04.829> is<00:03:05.069> going<00:03:05.220> to

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
remaining in there this is going to

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.170 
remaining in there this is going to
change<00:03:05.579> right<00:03:05.760> here

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
change right here

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.830 
change right here
now<00:03:06.510> some<00:03:06.720> people<00:03:06.959> asked<00:03:07.139> me<00:03:07.260> after<00:03:07.680> part<00:03:08.310> two

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
now some people asked me after part two

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.000 
now some people asked me after part two
with<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.959> Southbridge<00:03:10.319> block<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.739> right<00:03:10.920> in

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
with the Southbridge block is right in

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.140 
with the Southbridge block is right in
between<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.310> graphics<00:03:11.670> card<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:11.940> how<00:03:12.090> you

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
between the graphics card so how you

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.370 
between the graphics card so how you
going<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.329> make<00:03:12.389> that<00:03:12.510> work<00:03:12.870> well<00:03:13.200> obviously

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
going to make that work well obviously

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.710 
going to make that work well obviously
that<00:03:13.829> has<00:03:14.160> what<00:03:14.340> we've<00:03:14.459> got<00:03:14.670> right<00:03:15.000> here<00:03:15.030> now

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
that has what we've got right here now

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.650 
that has what we've got right here now
I've<00:03:15.840> got<00:03:16.019> about<00:03:16.940> maybe<00:03:17.940> about<00:03:18.060> two<00:03:18.269> inches<00:03:18.510> of

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
I've got about maybe about two inches of

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.150 
I've got about maybe about two inches of
clearance<00:03:18.900> between<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.380> top<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.950> card

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
clearance between the top of the card

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.440 
clearance between the top of the card
right<00:03:20.370> here<00:03:20.669> or<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:20.970> guess<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.269> would<00:03:21.359> be<00:03:21.389> the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
right here or I guess that would be the

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.839 
right here or I guess that would be the
edge<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.930> card<00:03:22.169> and<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.859> tube<00:03:23.099> which<00:03:23.819> is

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
edge of the card and the tube which is

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.449 
edge of the card and the tube which is
going<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.299> allow<00:03:24.569> me<00:03:24.599> to<00:03:24.950> be<00:03:25.950> able<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.130> remove

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
going to allow me to be able to remove

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.490 
going to allow me to be able to remove
this<00:03:26.669> card<00:03:26.910> if<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.150> need<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.959> if<00:03:28.169> I<00:03:28.260> need<00:03:28.410> to

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
this card if I need to and if I need to

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.960 
this card if I need to and if I need to
remove<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.889> card<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.310> can<00:03:29.459> just<00:03:29.609> loosen<00:03:29.880> up

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
remove that card I can just loosen up

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.229 
remove that card I can just loosen up
these<00:03:30.180> two<00:03:30.980> threading<00:03:31.980> threads<00:03:32.400> there<00:03:32.669> loosen

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
these two threading threads there loosen

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.699 
these two threading threads there loosen
up<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.419> bottom<00:03:33.690> card<00:03:33.930> they'll<00:03:34.200> come<00:03:34.380> apart

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
up the bottom card they'll come apart

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.259 
up the bottom card they'll come apart
pull<00:03:35.190> those<00:03:35.370> tubes<00:03:35.609> out<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:35.970> it'll<00:03:36.120> come

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
pull those tubes out and it'll come

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.599 
pull those tubes out and it'll come
right<00:03:36.329> out<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:37.440> is<00:03:37.980> going<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.250> be<00:03:38.370> able<00:03:38.489> to

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
right out so it is going to be able to

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.550 
right out so it is going to be able to
be<00:03:38.790> removable<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.540> only<00:03:39.750> downside<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.470> how

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
be removable the only downside to how

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.330 
be removable the only downside to how
tight<00:03:40.889> it<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.130> in<00:03:41.340> here<00:03:41.639> is<00:03:42.599> to<00:03:42.810> get<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
tight it is in here is to get the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.860 
tight it is in here is to get the
Southbridge<00:03:44.400> tube<00:03:44.730> out<00:03:44.910> right<00:03:45.120> here<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.750> do

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
Southbridge tube out right here you do

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.780 
Southbridge tube out right here you do
have<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.109> remove<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.470> top<00:03:46.650> card<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.609> that's

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
have to remove the top card so that's

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.240 
have to remove the top card so that's
why<00:03:47.940> leak<00:03:48.780> testing<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.530> allof<00:03:49.889> head's<00:03:50.069> going

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
why leak testing and allof head's going

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.890 
why leak testing and allof head's going
to<00:03:50.310> be<00:03:50.370> very<00:03:50.639> very<00:03:50.849> important<00:03:51.389> because

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
to be very very important because

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.960 
to be very very important because
getting<00:03:52.349> out<00:03:52.500> this<00:03:53.069> tube<00:03:53.370> right<00:03:53.400> here<00:03:53.639> and

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
getting out this tube right here and

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.309 
getting out this tube right here and
getting<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.269> new<00:03:54.359> one<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:54.750> actually<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.109> lot

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
getting the new one in is actually a lot

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.470 
getting the new one in is actually a lot
harder<00:03:55.530> than<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.799> looks<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.489> anyway<00:03:57.239> there's

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
harder than it looks so anyway there's

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.569 
harder than it looks so anyway there's
that<00:03:57.750> now<00:03:58.379> here's<00:03:58.860> how<00:03:59.010> I've<00:03:59.099> decided<00:03:59.400> I'm

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
that now here's how I've decided I'm

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:00.200 
that now here's how I've decided I'm
going<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.760> go<00:03:59.909> ahead

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
going to go ahead

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.150 
going to go ahead
and<00:04:00.450> route<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.780> I'm<00:04:01.140> going<00:04:01.740> to<00:04:01.800> have<00:04:01.980> the

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
and route it I'm going to have the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.070 
and route it I'm going to have the
reservoirs<00:04:02.640> over<00:04:02.880> here<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.300> as<00:04:03.570> I<00:04:03.690> mentioned

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
reservoirs over here and as I mentioned

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.500 
reservoirs over here and as I mentioned
earlier<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:04.440> have<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.650> very<00:04:04.890> special<00:04:05.490> plan<00:04:06.210> or

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
earlier I have a very special plan or

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.700 
earlier I have a very special plan or
maybe<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:06.690> didn't<00:04:06.930> mention<00:04:07.140> it<00:04:07.230> yet<00:04:07.410> either<00:04:07.560> way

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
maybe I didn't mention it yet either way

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.440 
maybe I didn't mention it yet either way
I<00:04:07.890> have<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.190> special<00:04:08.550> very<00:04:08.760> special<00:04:09.000> plan<00:04:09.420> for

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
I have a special very special plan for

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.630 
I have a special very special plan for
the<00:04:10.230> reservoirs<00:04:10.710> and<00:04:10.890> how<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.070> want<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.370> handle

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
the reservoirs and how I want to handle

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.190 
the reservoirs and how I want to handle
that<00:04:11.790> if<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.060> recall<00:04:12.360> in<00:04:12.450> part<00:04:12.660> 2<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:12.870> wasn't

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
that if you recall in part 2 I wasn't

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.830 
that if you recall in part 2 I wasn't
sure<00:04:13.440> what<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.680> wanted<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.160> do<00:04:14.340> so<00:04:14.970> I've<00:04:15.390> come<00:04:15.810> up

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
sure what I wanted to do so I've come up

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.330 
sure what I wanted to do so I've come up
with<00:04:15.960> a<00:04:16.080> really<00:04:16.320> neat<00:04:16.470> plan<00:04:16.710> and<00:04:16.980> that's<00:04:17.160> one

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
with a really neat plan and that's one

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.550 
with a really neat plan and that's one
of<00:04:17.460> the<00:04:17.520> hold<00:04:17.730> ups<00:04:17.970> was<00:04:18.780> we<00:04:18.900> had<00:04:19.080> to<00:04:19.170> order<00:04:19.320> some

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
of the hold ups was we had to order some

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.770 
of the hold ups was we had to order some
parts<00:04:19.710> for<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.040> now<00:04:20.970> when<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.330> comes<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.600> the

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
parts for that now when it comes to the

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.140 
parts for that now when it comes to the
floor<00:04:22.170> right<00:04:22.410> here<00:04:22.800> instead<00:04:23.670> of<00:04:23.760> ordering<00:04:24.000> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
floor right here instead of ordering the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.960 
floor right here instead of ordering the
solid<00:04:24.660> panel<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.170> wanted<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:25.980> give<00:04:26.670> the<00:04:26.790> buyer

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
solid panel I wanted to give the buyer

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.880 
solid panel I wanted to give the buyer
an<00:04:27.210> option<00:04:27.570> or<00:04:27.690> flexibility<00:04:28.290> in<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.560> future

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
an option or flexibility in the future

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.260 
an option or flexibility in the future
if<00:04:29.040> he<00:04:29.070> wants<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.460> do<00:04:29.670> something<00:04:29.940> with<00:04:30.090> the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
if he wants to do something with the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.000 
if he wants to do something with the
middle<00:04:30.540> here<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:30.900> naturally<00:04:31.590> we<00:04:31.710> have<00:04:31.890> these

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
middle here so naturally we have these

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.430 
middle here so naturally we have these
three<00:04:32.460> fan<00:04:33.120> cutouts<00:04:33.540> here<00:04:33.810> in<00:04:33.930> this<00:04:34.050> big<00:04:34.260> cut

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
three fan cutouts here in this big cut

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.800 
three fan cutouts here in this big cut
out<00:04:34.590> there<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.460> are<00:04:35.820> a<00:04:35.850> little<00:04:36.210> bit<00:04:36.390> ugly<00:04:36.780> but

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
out there that are a little bit ugly but

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.570 
out there that are a little bit ugly but
what<00:04:37.050> I'm<00:04:37.170> planning<00:04:37.500> on<00:04:37.560> doing<00:04:37.620> with<00:04:38.010> this<00:04:38.250> is

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
what I'm planning on doing with this is

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.880 
what I'm planning on doing with this is
doing<00:04:39.000> an<00:04:39.090> acrylic<00:04:39.360> floor<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.560> way<00:04:40.710> it's

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
doing an acrylic floor that way it's

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.800 
doing an acrylic floor that way it's
going<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.070> be<00:04:41.130> nice<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:41.610> smooth<00:04:41.940> that<00:04:42.510> I<00:04:42.570> can

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
going to be nice and smooth that I can

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.710 
going to be nice and smooth that I can
drill<00:04:43.020> my<00:04:43.170> holes<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:43.680> things<00:04:43.800> into<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.400> and

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
drill my holes and things into that and

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.690 
drill my holes and things into that and
just<00:04:45.720> remove<00:04:46.110> these<00:04:46.320> plates<00:04:46.710> when<00:04:47.370> it<00:04:47.490> comes

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
just remove these plates when it comes

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.430 
just remove these plates when it comes
time<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.450> know<00:04:48.480> put<00:04:48.870> them<00:04:49.020> through<00:04:49.050> the

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
time to you know put them through the

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.870 
time to you know put them through the
floor<00:04:49.680> that<00:04:49.950> way<00:04:50.100> I'm<00:04:50.190> not<00:04:50.280> actually<00:04:50.460> drilling

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
floor that way I'm not actually drilling

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.790 
floor that way I'm not actually drilling
into<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.240> floor<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.810> these<00:04:52.410> I'm<00:04:52.650> drilling

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
into the floor of these I'm drilling

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.680 
into the floor of these I'm drilling
into<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.160> acrylic<00:04:53.430> if<00:04:53.790> that<00:04:54.000> makes<00:04:54.240> sense<00:04:54.510> so

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
into the acrylic if that makes sense so

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.390 
into the acrylic if that makes sense so
it<00:04:54.810> allows<00:04:55.020> him<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.320> have<00:04:55.470> more<00:04:55.770> flexibility

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
it allows him to have more flexibility

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.980 
it allows him to have more flexibility
without<00:04:57.000> having<00:04:57.270> to<00:04:57.330> drill<00:04:57.570> holes<00:04:57.720> in<00:04:57.960> the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
without having to drill holes in the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.750 
without having to drill holes in the
floor<00:04:58.350> if<00:04:58.530> all<00:04:59.100> goes<00:04:59.130> according<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.700> plan

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
floor if all goes according to plan

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.910 
floor if all goes according to plan
anyway<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:00.960> what<00:05:01.140> I'm<00:05:01.230> going<00:05:01.380> to<00:05:01.440> do<00:05:01.620> with<00:05:01.800> the

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
anyway so what I'm going to do with the

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.350 
anyway so what I'm going to do with the
routing<00:05:02.130> of<00:05:02.400> this<00:05:02.550> I'm<00:05:02.880> going<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.090> have<00:05:03.180> the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
routing of this I'm going to have the

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.090 
routing of this I'm going to have the
reservoirs<00:05:03.840> over<00:05:04.080> here<00:05:04.290> up<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.680> down<00:05:04.770> they're

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
reservoirs over here up and down they're

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.920 
reservoirs over here up and down they're
not<00:05:05.130> going<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.430> be<00:05:05.520> horizontal<00:05:06.120> sorry<00:05:06.690> guys

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
not going to be horizontal sorry guys

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.330 
not going to be horizontal sorry guys
who<00:05:07.140> thought<00:05:07.290> that<00:05:07.350> would<00:05:07.560> be<00:05:07.590> cool<00:05:07.800> the

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
who thought that would be cool the

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.920 
who thought that would be cool the
problem<00:05:08.670> is<00:05:08.790> as<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.180> tubes<00:05:09.390> would<00:05:09.540> be<00:05:09.630> coming

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
problem is as the tubes would be coming

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.570 
problem is as the tubes would be coming
off<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.080> side<00:05:10.500> over<00:05:10.770> here<00:05:10.800> it's<00:05:11.100> too<00:05:11.310> much<00:05:11.460> of

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
off the side over here it's too much of

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.090 
off the side over here it's too much of
a<00:05:11.640> crazy<00:05:11.940> Bend<00:05:12.330> to<00:05:12.540> get<00:05:12.660> back<00:05:12.870> so<00:05:13.290> I<00:05:13.500> went<00:05:13.980> ahead

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
a crazy Bend to get back so I went ahead

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.640 
a crazy Bend to get back so I went ahead
and<00:05:14.280> scrap<00:05:14.550> that<00:05:14.580> idea<00:05:15.020> but<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.110> bottom<00:05:16.470> loop

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
and scrap that idea but the bottom loop

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.920 
and scrap that idea but the bottom loop
here<00:05:16.890> for<00:05:17.190> the<00:05:17.910> graphics<00:05:18.300> cards<00:05:18.630> is<00:05:18.720> going<00:05:18.870> to

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
here for the graphics cards is going to

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.240 
here for the graphics cards is going to
be<00:05:19.080> reservoir<00:05:20.420> down<00:05:21.420> into<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:21.990> floor<00:05:22.250> down

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
be reservoir down into the floor down

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.330 
be reservoir down into the floor down
into<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.550> pump<00:05:23.820> and<00:05:24.210> then<00:05:24.450> up<00:05:24.630> into<00:05:25.440> here<00:05:25.770> it's

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
into the pump and then up into here it's

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.980 
into the pump and then up into here it's
going<00:05:26.520> to<00:05:26.580> split<00:05:26.940> both<00:05:27.180> cards<00:05:27.690> and<00:05:27.810> it's<00:05:27.900> going

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
going to split both cards and it's going

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.930 
going to split both cards and it's going
to<00:05:28.050> come<00:05:28.230> back<00:05:28.350> out<00:05:28.590> here<00:05:28.620> and<00:05:29.130> go<00:05:29.730> back<00:05:29.910> down

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
to come back out here and go back down

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.580 
to come back out here and go back down
to<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.330> bottom<00:05:30.510> so<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.140> only<00:05:31.290> thing<00:05:31.500> you're

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
to the bottom so the only thing you're

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.070 
to the bottom so the only thing you're
going<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:31.800> really<00:05:31.980> see<00:05:32.340> on<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.630> graphics<00:05:34.020> card

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
going to really see on the graphics card

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.750 
going to really see on the graphics card
loops<00:05:34.500> is<00:05:34.740> going<00:05:34.920> to<00:05:34.980> be<00:05:35.100> these<00:05:35.280> two<00:05:35.340> tubes

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
loops is going to be these two tubes

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.490 
loops is going to be these two tubes
right<00:05:35.940> here<00:05:36.210> where<00:05:36.690> it<00:05:36.780> goes<00:05:36.870> into<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.260> floor

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
right here where it goes into the floor

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.230 
right here where it goes into the floor
there<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:37.980> then<00:05:38.490> where<00:05:38.640> it<00:05:38.700> goes<00:05:38.820> back<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.150> the

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
here and it's going to come back and

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.530 
here and it's going to come back and
into<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.530> reservoir<00:05:44.010> I<00:05:44.160> want<00:05:45.030> more<00:05:45.240> tubes

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
into the reservoir I want more tubes

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.150 
into the reservoir I want more tubes
visible<00:05:46.020> up<00:05:46.170> top<00:05:46.380> just<00:05:46.650> because<00:05:46.740> if<00:05:47.040> you're

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
visible up top just because if you're

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.980 
visible up top just because if you're
going<00:05:47.310> through<00:05:47.550> all<00:05:47.730> of<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:48.030> planning<00:05:48.870> and

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.760 
all of the trouble of acrylic bending
you<00:05:50.910> might<00:05:51.120> as<00:05:51.240> well<00:05:51.360> have<00:05:51.600> them<00:05:51.750> visible<00:05:52.260> so

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
you might as well have them visible so

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.960 
you might as well have them visible so
some<00:05:53.040> of<00:05:53.070> the<00:05:53.220> tubes<00:05:53.460> will<00:05:53.610> go<00:05:53.700> through<00:05:53.880> the

actually going to feed it it's going to

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.270 
actually going to feed it it's going to
go<00:06:06.630> from<00:06:06.750> the<00:06:06.900> reservoir<00:06:07.260> into<00:06:07.770> this<00:06:07.890> fitting

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
go from the reservoir into this fitting

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.720 
go from the reservoir into this fitting
here<00:06:08.550> out<00:06:09.240> into<00:06:09.870> the<00:06:09.990> CPU<00:06:10.350> block<00:06:10.620> out<00:06:11.400> of<00:06:11.640> the

those parts in I can start planning for
that<00:06:30.659> and<00:06:31.020> then<00:06:31.529> we'll<00:06:31.979> go<00:06:32.129> from<00:06:32.249> there

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
that and then we'll go from there

that and then we'll go from there
the<00:06:32.849> only<00:06:32.999> other<00:06:33.150> thing<00:06:33.389> I<00:06:33.479> really<00:06:33.599> got<00:06:33.840> done

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
the only other thing I really got done

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.010 
the only other thing I really got done
was<00:06:34.199> I've<00:06:34.349> got<00:06:34.529> the<00:06:34.680> Flex<00:06:34.919> base<00:06:35.779> removed<00:06:36.779> and<00:06:36.990> I

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
was I've got the Flex base removed and I

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.899 
was I've got the Flex base removed and I
got<00:06:37.139> the<00:06:37.229> ventilated<00:06:37.740> Bay's<00:06:37.919> in<00:06:38.159> there<00:06:38.340> but<00:06:38.879> I

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:38.909 
got the ventilated Bay's in there but I

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:40.939 
got the ventilated Bay's in there but I
can't<00:06:39.180> put<00:06:39.360> the<00:06:39.479> fans<00:06:39.749> or<00:06:40.020> the<00:06:40.080> radiators<00:06:40.770> in

can't put the fans or the radiators in

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:43.249 
can't put the fans or the radiators in
