00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
then I got into the beta and played it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.740 
then I got into the beta and played it
and<00:01:22.590> said<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.580> solid<00:01:24.000> foundation<00:01:24.150> like

to<00:05:21.310> ask<00:05:21.490> for<00:05:21.820> so<00:05:22.030> little<00:05:22.140> means<00:05:23.140> that<00:05:23.290> we

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
to ask for so little means that we

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.590 
to ask for so little means that we
should<00:05:23.680> keep<00:05:23.950> our<00:05:24.360> expectations<00:05:25.360> in<00:05:25.570> check

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
should keep our expectations in check

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.659 
should keep our expectations in check
but<00:05:26.169> from<00:05:26.350> what<00:05:26.560> I've<00:05:26.710> seen<00:05:26.740> the<00:05:27.310> gameplay

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
but from what I've seen the gameplay

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.190 
but from what I've seen the gameplay
footage<00:05:27.880> ever<00:05:28.120> released<00:05:28.360> so<00:05:28.510> far<00:05:28.540> it<00:05:28.990> looks

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
footage ever released so far it looks

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.440 
footage ever released so far it looks
like<00:05:29.500> it<00:05:29.710> could<00:05:29.860> be<00:05:29.890> great<00:05:30.280> but<00:05:30.490> again<00:05:30.760> it<00:05:31.000> is

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
like it could be great but again it is

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.520 
like it could be great but again it is
an<00:05:31.630> indie<00:05:31.840> title<00:05:32.200> now<00:05:32.320> if<00:05:32.380> you're<00:05:32.500> wondering

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
an indie title now if you're wondering

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.070 
an indie title now if you're wondering
why<00:05:32.979> they<00:05:33.190> asking<00:05:33.550> for<00:05:33.580> more<00:05:33.910> money<00:05:33.970> well<00:05:34.960> they

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
why they asking for more money well they

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.510 
why they asking for more money well they
only<00:05:35.260> got<00:05:35.530> fifty<00:05:35.950> thousand<00:05:36.340> dollars

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
only got fifty thousand dollars

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.100 
only got fifty thousand dollars
initially<00:05:37.000> and<00:05:37.120> as<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.360> just<00:05:37.390> mentioned<00:05:37.600> you

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
initially and as I just mentioned you

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.680 
initially and as I just mentioned you
need<00:05:38.290> millions<00:05:38.919> to<00:05:39.220> make<00:05:39.370> a<00:05:39.400> quality<00:05:39.880> MMO<00:05:40.419> so

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
need millions to make a quality MMO so

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.000 
need millions to make a quality MMO so
the<00:05:40.780> fact<00:05:40.990> that<00:05:41.080> they're<00:05:41.260> still<00:05:41.440> asking<00:05:41.590> for

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
the fact that they're still asking for

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.800 
the fact that they're still asking for
so<00:05:42.130> little<00:05:42.310> this<00:05:43.030> is<00:05:43.180> being<00:05:43.390> developed<00:05:43.630> by

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
so little this is being developed by

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.230 
so little this is being developed by
company<00:05:44.290> who<00:05:44.440> at<00:05:44.620> its<00:05:44.830> onset<00:05:45.310> was<00:05:45.790> just<00:05:45.970> doing

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
company who at its onset was just doing

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.150 
company who at its onset was just doing
this<00:05:46.360> in<00:05:46.570> their<00:05:46.720> spare<00:05:47.020> time<00:05:47.080> on<00:05:47.530> the<00:05:47.650> weekends

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
this in their spare time on the weekends

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.130 
this in their spare time on the weekends
in<00:05:48.250> addition<00:05:48.700> to<00:05:48.790> their<00:05:48.910> full-time<00:05:49.150> jobs<00:05:49.630> now

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
in addition to their full-time jobs now

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.420 
in addition to their full-time jobs now
I'm<00:05:50.229> not<00:05:50.380> sure<00:05:50.410> how<00:05:50.710> many<00:05:50.770> people<00:05:51.160> have<00:05:51.280> moved

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
I'm not sure how many people have moved

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.580 
I'm not sure how many people have moved
into<00:05:51.700> full-time<00:05:51.940> development<00:05:52.720> I'm<00:05:52.900> assuming

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
into full-time development I'm assuming

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.290 
into full-time development I'm assuming
at<00:05:53.919> least<00:05:54.160> some<00:05:54.370> portion<00:05:54.580> of<00:05:54.850> it<00:05:54.970> but<00:05:55.090> again<00:05:55.270> I

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
at least some portion of it but again I

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.820 
at least some portion of it but again I
don't<00:05:55.750> know<00:05:55.900> that<00:05:56.110> so<00:05:56.290> don't<00:05:56.380> quote<00:05:56.620> me<00:05:56.800> on

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
don't know that so don't quote me on

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.830 
don't know that so don't quote me on
that<00:05:56.950> aspect<00:05:57.460> of<00:05:57.700> it<00:05:57.850> but<00:05:58.330> none<00:05:58.479> of<00:05:58.570> that<00:05:58.630> even

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
that aspect of it but none of that even

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.300 
that aspect of it but none of that even
really<00:05:59.140> matters<00:05:59.470> because<00:05:59.800> what<00:05:59.979> I've<00:06:00.100> seen

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
really matters because what I've seen

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.219 
really matters because what I've seen
looks<00:06:00.550> good<00:06:00.760> what<00:06:00.940> I've<00:06:01.060> heard<00:06:01.240> looks<00:06:01.510> good<00:06:01.750> so

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
looks good what I've heard looks good so

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.840 
looks good what I've heard looks good so
