for some reason you find your system is

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.140 
for some reason you find your system is
not<00:00:10.750> putting<00:00:11.260> water<00:00:11.470> back<00:00:11.620> into<00:00:12.340> the<00:00:12.639> salt

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
not putting water back into the salt

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.360 
not putting water back into the salt
tank<00:00:13.510> and<00:00:13.809> you've<00:00:14.590> already<00:00:14.799> checked<00:00:15.250> the

brine cam gear in the back and you can

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.300 
brine cam gear in the back and you can
see<00:00:18.039> you<00:00:18.310> the<00:00:18.700> white<00:00:18.940> Crescent<00:00:20.100> gesture<00:00:21.100> is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
see you the white Crescent gesture is

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.610 
see you the white Crescent gesture is
set<00:00:21.610> on<00:00:21.850> you<00:00:22.390> know<00:00:22.540> reasonable<00:00:22.960> amount<00:00:23.380> like

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620 
set on you know reasonable amount like

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.420 
set on you know reasonable amount like
912<00:00:24.610> pounds<00:00:25.180> but<00:00:25.930> little<00:00:26.470> to<00:00:26.590> no<00:00:26.740> water<00:00:26.980> is

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
912 pounds but little to no water is

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.430 
912 pounds but little to no water is

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
going into the salt tank then the

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.840 
going into the salt tank then the
problem<00:00:29.830> will<00:00:29.980> be<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.310> brine<00:00:30.550> line<00:00:30.580> flow

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
problem will be the brine line flow

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.680 
problem will be the brine line flow

you'll see it unscrews from the plastic
ejector<00:00:53.469> drain<00:00:53.679> module<00:00:54.219> as<00:00:54.399> an<00:00:55.179> o-ring<00:00:55.329> on<00:00:55.749> it

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
ejector drain module as an o-ring on it

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.149 
ejector drain module as an o-ring on it
has<00:00:56.679> a<00:00:56.710> little<00:00:57.339> retainer<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.679> the<00:00:59.679> button<00:01:00.010> is

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
has a little retainer and the button is

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.419 
has a little retainer and the button is
behind<00:01:00.519> there<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:02.649> can<00:01:02.829> also<00:01:02.979> look<00:01:03.370> through

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
behind there you can also look through

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:08.219 
behind there you can also look through
this<00:01:03.969> way<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.510> see<00:01:05.490> if<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:07.600> clear<00:01:08.020> or<00:01:08.140> not

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
this way and see if it's clear or not

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.190 
this way and see if it's clear or not
this<00:01:08.770> one<00:01:08.979> is<00:01:09.280> clear<00:01:09.729> but<00:01:09.939> I<00:01:10.210> couldn't<00:01:10.899> see<00:01:11.049> the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
this one is clear but I couldn't see the

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.289 
this one is clear but I couldn't see the
light<00:01:11.409> through<00:01:11.740> that<00:01:11.979> then<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:12.909> would<00:01:13.090> know

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
light through that then I would know

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:21.020 
light through that then I would know
that<00:01:13.600> I<00:01:14.380> wanted<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:16.530> pull<00:01:17.530> out<00:01:19.079> pair<00:01:20.079> of<00:01:20.229> pliers

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that I wanted to pull out pair of pliers

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.090 
that I wanted to pull out pair of pliers
little<00:01:22.979> twist<00:01:23.979> and<00:01:27.600> yeah<00:01:28.600> very<00:01:29.439> solid<00:01:29.890> yank

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
little twist and yeah very solid yank

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.330 
little twist and yeah very solid yank
now<00:01:30.759> here's<00:01:31.210> my<00:01:31.420> button<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:32.680> numbers<00:01:33.100> are

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
now here's my button the numbers are

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.380 
now here's my button the numbers are
facing<00:01:33.939> me<00:01:34.090> as<00:01:34.270> they<00:01:34.630> should<00:01:35.820> now<00:01:36.820> I've<00:01:37.030> pulled

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
facing me as they should now I've pulled

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.160 
facing me as they should now I've pulled
it<00:01:37.630> out<00:01:38.700> there<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:40.180> is<00:01:40.359> it's<00:01:40.840> got<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.020> little

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
it out there it is it's got a little

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.310 
it out there it is it's got a little
hole<00:01:41.590> in<00:01:41.829> the<00:01:41.920> middle<00:01:41.979> this<00:01:42.969> one's<00:01:43.299> a<00:01:43.600> point<00:01:44.020> 5o

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
hole in the middle this one's a point 5o

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.730 
hole in the middle this one's a point 5o
so<00:01:44.920> it's<00:01:45.490> 1/2<00:01:46.299> a<00:01:46.600> gallon<00:01:46.750> per<00:01:46.899> minute<00:01:47.049> some<00:01:47.619> are

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
so it's 1/2 a gallon per minute some are

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.109 
so it's 1/2 a gallon per minute some are
smaller<00:01:49.200> 0.25<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.590> they<00:01:51.070> make<00:01:51.250> larger<00:01:51.670> also

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
smaller 0.25 and they make larger also

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.599 
smaller 0.25 and they make larger also
but<00:01:52.359> I<00:01:53.109> can<00:01:53.439> easily<00:01:53.590> get<00:01:53.890> clogged<00:01:54.159> by<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.429> big

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609 
but I can easily get clogged by a big

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:57.179 
but I can easily get clogged by a big
chunk<00:01:54.969> of<00:01:55.090> sand<00:01:55.329> or<00:01:55.600> something<00:01:55.840> so<00:01:56.829> if<00:01:57.039> you

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
chunk of sand or something so if you

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.800 
chunk of sand or something so if you
clear<00:01:57.729> it<00:01:57.850> out<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:59.140> can<00:01:59.259> put<00:01:59.409> it<00:01:59.500> back<00:01:59.679> in<00:02:00.009> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
clear it out you can put it back in and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.349 
clear it out you can put it back in and
with<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.929> numbers<00:02:02.999> facing<00:02:03.999> up<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:07.119> put

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
with the numbers facing up and just put

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:12.890 
with the numbers facing up and just put
your<00:02:07.539> retainer<00:02:08.250> back<00:02:09.250> in<00:02:09.640> place

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.839 

ok<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:15.340> we've<00:02:15.610> cleared<00:02:15.819> it<00:02:16.150> put<00:02:16.569> it<00:02:16.690> back<00:02:16.720> in

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
ok so we've cleared it put it back in

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.559 
ok so we've cleared it put it back in
rarely<00:02:18.849> but<00:02:19.060> occasionally

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
rarely but occasionally

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.239 
rarely but occasionally
you<00:02:19.629> might<00:02:19.810> want<00:02:20.049> to<00:02:20.109> replace<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:22.019> but<00:02:23.159> if<00:02:24.159> that

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:24.249 
you might want to replace it but if that

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.729 
you might want to replace it but if that
was<00:02:24.609> clogged<00:02:24.939> you<00:02:25.480> should<00:02:25.840> notice<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.379> easily

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
was clogged you should notice it easily

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.720 
was clogged you should notice it easily
clear<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.189> and<00:02:27.599> that<00:02:28.599> takes<00:02:29.260> care<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.650> one<00:02:30.040> of

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
clear it and that takes care of one of

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.750 
clear it and that takes care of one of
the<00:02:30.939> reasons<00:02:31.499> why<00:02:32.499> your<00:02:32.859> system<00:02:33.280> may<00:02:33.489> not<00:02:33.700> be

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
the reasons why your system may not be

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.479 
the reasons why your system may not be
putting<00:02:34.299> any<00:02:34.450> water<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.109> salt<00:02:35.379> tank<00:02:35.650> when
