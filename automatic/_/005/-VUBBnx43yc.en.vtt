diorama that I just finished actually

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.019 
diorama that I just finished actually
it's<00:00:27.810> not<00:00:27.930> finished<00:00:28.349> yet<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.099> still<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.670> work

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
it's not finished yet it is still a work

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.340 
it's not finished yet it is still a work
in<00:00:30.179> progress<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:32.329> this<00:00:33.329> new<00:00:33.540> diorama<00:00:34.050> was

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
in progress but this new diorama was

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.459 
in progress but this new diorama was
inspired<00:00:34.890> by<00:00:35.780> when<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.809> was<00:00:36.989> searching<00:00:37.350> on

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
inspired by when I was searching on

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.979 
inspired by when I was searching on
google<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:37.800> pipes<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:39.059> found<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.629> found

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
google for pipes and I found I found

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.110 
google for pipes and I found I found
this<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.829> stumbled<00:00:41.219> upon<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.430> picture<00:00:41.850> where

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
this I stumbled upon a picture where

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.420 
this I stumbled upon a picture where
there<00:00:42.300> are<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> lot<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.840> pipes<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.710> it's

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
there are a lot of pipes so it's

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.850 
there are a lot of pipes so it's
basically<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.300> chemical<00:00:45.780> plant<00:00:47.539> diorama<00:00:48.539> and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
basically a chemical plant diorama and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.130 
basically a chemical plant diorama and
as<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.250> see<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.750> corridor<00:00:52.649> type

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
as you can see it is a corridor type

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.770 
as you can see it is a corridor type
scene<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:56.910> said<00:00:57.180> since<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
scene but as I have said since this is

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.959 
scene but as I have said since this is
still<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.199> work<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.469> progress<00:00:58.620> I'm<00:00:59.250> still<00:00:59.520> doing

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
still a work in progress I'm still doing

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.729 
still a work in progress I'm still doing
a<00:01:00.260> another<00:01:01.260> wall<00:01:01.559> which<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.399> third<00:01:02.670> wall

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
a another wall which is the third wall

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.010 
a another wall which is the third wall
because<00:01:05.060> probably<00:01:06.060> you've<00:01:06.390> probably<00:01:06.720> noticed

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
because probably you've probably noticed

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.469 
because probably you've probably noticed
that<00:01:07.439> when<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.040> do<00:01:08.189> my<00:01:08.280> dioramas<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.119> make<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that when I do my dioramas I make the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.840 
that when I do my dioramas I make the
modular<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> could<00:01:10.860> move<00:01:11.010> them<00:01:11.220> around<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
modular so I could move them around and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.350 
modular so I could move them around and
rearrange<00:01:12.330> them<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.250> third<00:01:14.729> panel<00:01:14.970> or

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
rearrange them so the the third panel or

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.390 
rearrange them so the the third panel or
the<00:01:15.509> third<00:01:15.720> wall<00:01:15.990> will<00:01:16.470> make<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.979> bigger

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the third wall will make a bigger

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.830 
the third wall will make a bigger
chemical<00:01:18.360> plant<00:01:19.070> for<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> bigger<00:01:20.610> scene<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.780> I

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
chemical plant for a bigger scene that I

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.260 
chemical plant for a bigger scene that I
could<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> CBA<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.939> Toei

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
could do for a CBA and for Toei

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.840 
could do for a CBA and for Toei
photography<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:27.560> for<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> first<00:01:28.829> look<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.490> used

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
photography so for the first look I used

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.760 
photography so for the first look I used
the<00:01:30.090> Avengers<00:01:30.840> Marvel<00:01:31.140> Select<00:01:31.560> figure<00:01:33.770> for
