00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.410
 hi we all want to do one today 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.270
 technical video a technique that was there 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.520
 but much requested by many customers 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.550
 especially for beginners and 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.099
 coffee tray technique 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.290
 tanoressici and the simple drawer that 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.649
 it can be used to create gods 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:34.329
 necklaces bracelets to make gods 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:36.280
 beautiful need then for the 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.460
 realization of the drawer we have 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.390
 first and foremost need fig here or 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.960
 copper wire coated in two sizes with 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.769
 0 81 which is the standard measure we say 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.870
 the one they used the most 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.690
 it should be said, however, that if the 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.350
 pearl or ola stone you want 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.789
 insert into the drawer 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.800
 maybe too small 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.950
 the problem that arises is what 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.720
 just the thread not while in the hole e 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.829
 for this you can switch to use 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:17.259
 of a thread 0 51 confine a little more 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:20.009
 small then to show you the 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.360
 kid's technique the simple one 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.070
 I use this thread a little more 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:30.759
 often because it has a stronger hold 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.729
 we need some nippers or I need it 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.469
 above all a conical forceps without the 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.170
 which the cable could not come 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.530
 straight and then I need a pincer a 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.180
 curved tip for 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.430
 define it then we do little dog 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.159
 simple simple cable we can 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:57.030
 take in itself but at the end of the thread e 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.340
 we simply turn the conical tip there 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.210
 will make a pike perfectly 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.869
 round then we can fix it and 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:11.400
 fix this kind of kid can 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:15.120
 be used when you will have to 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.620
 connect or another wire always of ram 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:26.459
 or we can show a chain 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:28.200
 we insert the pearl you see in this 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.410
 case the pearl hole is too much 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.760
 small so let's enter a 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.350
 with a round of quartz that there is a hole 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.360
 being a hard stone ie a hole a 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.760
 little bit more 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.700
 then we inserted our pearl 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.510
 our stone this hard stone of 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.239
 quartz and now we go to aprica to do the 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.180
 drawer inside the black 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.950
 chain the chain in this case to a 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.410
 avellino closed so we must 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.870
 go to work directly 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:05.700
 inside then we take the pliers 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:11.269
 let's make this move we move 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:21.290
 a little bit then we insert a lamb 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:21.290
 of the chain and then we turn 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:33.560
 at this point we are going to cut and with 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.090
 this other caliper that I had 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.480
 talked about before 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.170
 let's go and define our carlet 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.170
 simple 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.350
 here we are, now I want to do you 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.960
 see how to do instead how to make 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.840
 the capacious one of hours fitch and therefore cut 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.380
 a little bit of thread a little bit more 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.110
 thin because I use a pearl with a 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:05.690
 smaller hole and then I do this 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:09.320
 work then i take the thread with the con 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:12.590
 the laconic pliers and hardly turn it 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:17.950
 just around the wrist towards me then with 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:22.190
 the tyrol hand filho sky ride around 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:29.060
 I always stop it with the same pliers e 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:34.400
 I'm going to close after you with the 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:39.170
 cutting nippers and as usual with 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:43.490
 the other thinks I'm going to accompany the 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:50.660
 tip crena that I do not feel anymore 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:53.150
 which then stings the pearl and I do 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:58.280
 the same thing on the other side then 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:06.290
 I take the pliers with the conical tip around 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:13.450
 the wrist turns with the hand the thread lo 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:18.410
 I stop and do so after cutting 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:20.080
 being careful not to ruin the pearl e 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.830
 with this clamp 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.490
 I set it up here tried to put under 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.650
 and do not cut happy now with this 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.610
 type of processing 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:39.639
 I can go and insert another 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:40.509
 pearl attaching it to this then of 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:47.500
 new 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:49.479
 I take the thread around the wrist I do so 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.979
 and at this point I insert myself 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.310
 inside of 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:58.240
 this because we are always talking about 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:06:00.940
 little loops made around or another 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:05.289
 cappelletto or with chains with 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:08.440
 the ring is closed and then we do this 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:19.180
 work as we did before again 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:27.389
 cut we fix we insert another 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:27.389
 pearl and let's do the same job 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:38.789
 now here I am going to stick to these 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:43.930
 two fireplace made this way I keep it 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:45.610
 around you will see the thread is much softer 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.500
 because thinner 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.319
 in this case it holds better because the 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.000
 drawer is more secure than the 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:55.289
 simple pitch we saw 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 I showed you how to do it first 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:07:03.120
 these two types of loops in this 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.889
 If you've attached to the chain had 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.069
 mashed 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:10.050
 this tiny spiral but is 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:14.580
 You can also do this by using a 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:18.270
 violin and here instead I put more more 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:20.430
 pearls and these here we say that is the 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.969
 basic technique to do this kind of 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:27.210
 processing here we are this video is 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:29.729
 finished I wanted to show how 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.879
 use these loops to create 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:36.090
 components so you can use 

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:38.969
 of the parties of the bie cono stones e 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.889
 then apply them by joining them in a 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:46.650
 accommodation in a different way than 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:50.389
 to simply stuff them with this is all 

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.389
 an affectionate greeting bye 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.100
 no
