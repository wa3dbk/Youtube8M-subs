00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:06.830
 today I want to talk to you about the salt cows 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.910
 we all want to have in our homes 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.519
 a basil 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.650
 the basil leaves allow us to make 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.959
 a very tasty salad we can catch 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.330
 the leaves wash them well chopped with the 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.280
 lettuce we can eat them with tomato 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.990
 cheese in olive oil has many 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.090
 advantages and get a basil bush 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.130
 in our homes and I think most 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.140
 of you do not have if not so 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.210
 Well, I invite you to get it and today I 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.220
 I'm going to give some kits and tips for 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.560
 keep this plant in very good 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.690
 conditions first here we are seeing 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.030
 that this cow plant is already 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.430
 out here we see those are the flowers 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.140
 of basil that are opening and coming 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.690
 opening little by little each of them 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.000
 like in bell form then they 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.390
 they will produce the seed there if we leave 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.130
 that this plant gives us seed 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.340
 eventually the mother plant will die 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.260
 then what should we do and have with 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.010
 common pruning shears 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.809
 flowering we cut perfectly here 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.540
 without any problem 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.380
 we cut this one that comes here see it here 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.740
 the flowering is coming 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.619
 we cut it even we can use 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.210
 these new ones for salads for the 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.340
 cheese as we were discussing 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.579
 we are seeing that this plant is going 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.740
 growing up we have an area that 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.799
 is not proportional to the size of the 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.220
 plant to the pot 20 well you what 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.319
 So big is this plant versus the 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.990
 pot then the plant also 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.880
 is saying also repo always fear 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.649
 come either on the ground or just in a 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.750
 large pot that what we're going to do 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.970
 now we are going to move it to a more pot 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.619
 large to enjoy the plant 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.899
 for much longer and that grows us 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.700
 more and give us more foliage that we have 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.810
 we have the pot 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.580
 here we have this is going to be also 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.830
 proportionally the size of the pot 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.750
 to see if the ideal plant because because 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.179
 the roots are going to develop and the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.849
 plant will grow a lot more than 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.700
 we have to take into account very well 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:04.099
 let's say the depth of the pot and 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.619
 we are seeing that this pot does not 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:09.019
 has drainage already what the bottom is 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.690
 totally closed that we have to do 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.000
 then make holes in the pot 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.780
 that the water drains and does not accumulate 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.730
 with a simple running blade 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.770
 we make small holes that 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.060
 they are already marked within the 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:30.830
 Potted we can make are 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.680
 doing perfectly is to force a 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.080
 little bit and you know because they have means 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.360
 trained we could already have the 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.850
 small holes and we make holes to all 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.400
 sides well and three four or six holes 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.500
 in this case we have in holes and the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.290
 we are leaving for the water to come out 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.940
 if we do not make these holes 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.950
 the water with respect to the irrigation that 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.360
 we are giving, it is accumulating at 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.000
 accumulate in the roots that we are going to 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.790
 have problems with bacteria problems 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.530
 fungus problems of data 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.550
 can facilitate more than all fungi and 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.319
 bacteria 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.170
 we take 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.720
 prepared land that is prepared land 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.820
 very well 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.800
 it is not ordinary land of 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.700
 pastures if not a land that is 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.190
 being treated with boiler that comes with 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.400
 farm here we can see it we got to 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.130
 this land and let go of it look 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.620
 loose with fat comes with fertilizers 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.660
 organic veras sombrei compost that other 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.460
 day we will see what is man compost 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.370
 and that you yourselves can do your 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.190
 fertilizers in the house we put the earth 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.950
 we are perfectly filling the pot 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.900
 little by little very well we arrange the 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.940
 land is not necessary to put 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.650
 fertilizers because this land already 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.530
 comes prepared with a fertilizer 10 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.050
 2010 we take the plant that we are going to 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.110
 transplant we had said that is this 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.630
 we tightened well nothing else we were 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.520
 squeezing to release the side we squeeze 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.940
 in the form already done in 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.090
 the flower pot 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.580
 we squeeze it well and we release the 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.500
 plant we put our hands in this position 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.500
 to turn 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:15.280
 to the pot ok see what I said 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.320
 you see the roots look how they are 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.360
 saturated the roots clear all these 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.000
 Root hairs are great because 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.280
 these are the ones that absorb all the 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.830
 nutrients that are in the earth let go 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.620
 a little bit the now very well let go 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.450
 so that the roots can 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.650
 find life as they are that she is 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.530
 saying that he is rich 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.840
 they are giving me a chance to grow more 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.720
 we let go well, we put them together and 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.760
 ok we already present it we can not bury 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.950
 or sow deeper where is 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.470
 then already having the presented and 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.180
 It is in the center of the pot 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.970
 we proceed to put more land all 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.010
 around more land 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.420
 we do accommodate everywhere 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.180
 tasty little dish 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.150
 and we can have a plant that does not 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.190
 we can enjoy with enough time in 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.660
 our homes remember that the 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.220
 basil if you have it in a pot 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.780
 they have to put in a place where they 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.390
 alive again in the morning or in the 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.430
 ideal evening if we have it inside the 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.560
 cook then near a window in 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.080
 some area where it has aeration and 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.020
 have enough sun, the sun is important 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.530
 so that the growth of the 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.940
 numm plant pretty healthy growth 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.070
 fertilizers if you want to put it 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.070
 organic fertilizers once a month 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.830
 they can do it or chemical fertilizers 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:37.480
 It's that easy to transplant and take care of 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.480
 dawn plant that enjoy it
