00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.620 
and mobile advisory from Farpoint group
and<00:00:10.309> today<00:00:10.549> we're<00:00:11.120> going<00:00:11.210> to<00:00:11.299> be<00:00:11.389> talking

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
and today we're going to be talking

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.660 
and today we're going to be talking
about<00:00:11.840> cellular<00:00:12.440> generations<00:00:13.100> that<00:00:13.370> with<00:00:13.580> the

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
about cellular generations that with the

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.670 
about cellular generations that with the
announcement<00:00:14.119> of<00:00:14.150> the<00:00:14.209> iPhone<00:00:14.320> there's<00:00:15.320> a<00:00:15.410> lot

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
announcement of the iPhone there's a lot

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.400 
announcement of the iPhone there's a lot
of<00:00:15.799> confusion<00:00:16.129> about<00:00:16.280> what's<00:00:16.789> 3G<00:00:17.330> what's<00:00:17.600> 4G<00:00:18.199> a

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
of confusion about what's 3G what's 4G a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.380 
of confusion about what's 3G what's 4G a
lot<00:00:18.980> of<00:00:19.070> these<00:00:19.160> terms<00:00:19.460> are<00:00:19.610> imprecise<00:00:20.119> but<00:00:20.360> I

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
lot of these terms are imprecise but I

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.279 
lot of these terms are imprecise but I
want<00:00:20.570> to<00:00:20.660> give<00:00:20.779> you<00:00:20.810> at<00:00:20.990> least<00:00:21.020> a<00:00:21.260> little

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
want to give you at least a little

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.290 
want to give you at least a little
perspective<00:00:21.769> on<00:00:22.160> where<00:00:22.429> they<00:00:22.609> came<00:00:22.820> from<00:00:23.000> and

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
perspective on where they came from and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.970 
perspective on where they came from and
where<00:00:23.720> we're<00:00:23.869> going<00:00:23.900> with<00:00:24.230> this<00:00:24.349> technology

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
where we're going with this technology

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.650 
where we're going with this technology
and<00:00:25.160> the<00:00:25.339> set<00:00:25.609> of<00:00:25.699> technologies<00:00:26.269> over<00:00:26.300> the

and the set of technologies over the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.870 
and the set of technologies over the
next<00:00:26.839> few<00:00:27.019> years

1g<00:00:28.880> as<00:00:29.119> you<00:00:29.300> might<00:00:29.480> guess<00:00:29.689> was<00:00:29.929> the<00:00:30.050> original

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
1g as you might guess was the original

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.430 
1g as you might guess was the original
analog<00:00:30.919> cellular<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:31.699> by<00:00:32.689> analog<00:00:33.140> we<00:00:33.290> mean

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
analog cellular and by analog we mean

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.930 
analog cellular and by analog we mean
the<00:00:33.620> carrier<00:00:33.980> was<00:00:34.190> analog<00:00:34.579> we<00:00:34.700> weren't

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
the carrier was analog we weren't

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.250 
the carrier was analog we weren't
sending<00:00:35.240> bits<00:00:35.420> over-the-air<00:00:35.810> we<00:00:36.020> were<00:00:36.140> in

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
sending bits over-the-air we were in

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.369 
sending bits over-the-air we were in
fact<00:00:36.500> just<00:00:36.829> sending<00:00:37.250> waveforms<00:00:38.000> and

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
fact just sending waveforms and

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.840 
fact just sending waveforms and
primarily<00:00:39.379> for<00:00:39.739> voice<00:00:39.890> it<00:00:40.250> turns<00:00:40.489> out<00:00:40.699> we

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
primarily for voice it turns out we

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.549 
primarily for voice it turns out we
could<00:00:41.030> also<00:00:41.180> do<00:00:41.420> a<00:00:41.449> limited<00:00:41.930> amount<00:00:42.050> of<00:00:42.350> data

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
could also do a limited amount of data

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.560 
could also do a limited amount of data
didn't<00:00:43.039> work<00:00:43.219> very<00:00:43.550> well<00:00:43.640> but<00:00:44.059> it<00:00:44.210> did<00:00:44.390> work

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
didn't work very well but it did work

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.770 
didn't work very well but it did work
and<00:00:44.870> this<00:00:45.710> whole<00:00:46.510> technology<00:00:47.510> actually

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
and this whole technology actually

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.170 
and this whole technology actually
sounded<00:00:48.620> very<00:00:48.859> good<00:00:49.160> as<00:00:49.340> well<00:00:49.520> one<00:00:50.030> of<00:00:50.059> the

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
sounded very good as well one of the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.430 
sounded very good as well one of the
problems<00:00:50.600> though<00:00:50.750> is<00:00:50.899> their<00:00:51.079> worth<00:00:51.230> there

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
problems though is their worth there

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.139 
problems though is their worth there
were<00:00:51.559> an<00:00:51.680> awful<00:00:51.859> lot<00:00:52.370> of<00:00:52.399> these<00:00:52.670> in<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.030> world

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
were an awful lot of these in the world

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.819 
were an awful lot of these in the world
we<00:00:53.719> use<00:00:53.840> something<00:00:54.050> called<00:00:54.170> ants<00:00:54.530> in<00:00:54.739> this

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
we use something called ants in this

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.590 
we use something called ants in this
country<00:00:55.280> in<00:00:55.489> Europe<00:00:55.910> they<00:00:56.030> had<00:00:56.210> more<00:00:56.420> than

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
country in Europe they had more than

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.540 
country in Europe they had more than
eight<00:00:56.809> different<00:00:57.710> cellular<00:00:57.920> systems

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
eight different cellular systems

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.029 
eight different cellular systems
including<00:00:59.300> nmt<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.199> tax<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:00.769> bunch<00:01:00.920> of

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
including nmt and tax and a bunch of

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.860 
including nmt and tax and a bunch of
others<00:01:01.309> it<00:01:01.579> was<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.030> mess<00:01:02.329> but<00:01:02.600> there<00:01:02.719> was<00:01:02.840> a

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
others it was a mess but there was a

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.660 
others it was a mess but there was a
bigger<00:01:03.109> problem<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:03.679> that's<00:01:04.280> what<00:01:04.489> led<00:01:04.640> to

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
bigger problem and that's what led to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.970 
bigger problem and that's what led to
the<00:01:04.850> development<00:01:05.030> of<00:01:05.420> digital<00:01:05.600> cellular<00:01:06.050> now

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
the development of digital cellular now

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.350 
the development of digital cellular now
in<00:01:07.130> digital<00:01:07.340> we're<00:01:07.700> talking<00:01:08.000> about<00:01:08.090> sending

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
in digital we're talking about sending

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.840 
in digital we're talking about sending
ones<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:09.080> zeros<00:01:09.470> over-the-air<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.400> believe

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
ones and zeros over-the-air and believe

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.880 
ones and zeros over-the-air and believe
it<00:01:11.000> or<00:01:11.060> not<00:01:11.210> we<00:01:11.480> did<00:01:11.630> not<00:01:11.690> do<00:01:12.140> this<00:01:12.380> in<00:01:12.620> order<00:01:12.770> to

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
it or not we did not do this in order to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.860 
it or not we did not do this in order to
make<00:01:12.980> voice<00:01:13.430> sound<00:01:13.820> better<00:01:14.030> we<00:01:14.240> did<00:01:14.480> it<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.720> get

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
make voice sound better we did it to get

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.290 
make voice sound better we did it to get
more<00:01:15.170> bits<00:01:15.530> on<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:15.980> air<00:01:16.130> Digital<00:01:16.970> is<00:01:17.090> more

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
more bits on the air Digital is more

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.450 
more bits on the air Digital is more
spectrally<00:01:18.080> efficient<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:18.770> we<00:01:18.920> get<00:01:19.160> more

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
spectrally efficient so we get more

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.670 
spectrally efficient so we get more
customers<00:01:20.300> on<00:01:20.540> there<00:01:20.750> more<00:01:20.990> conversation

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
customers on there more conversation

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.310 
customers on there more conversation

handoff between these different
technologies<00:07:04.690> could<00:07:05.200> become<00:07:05.530> a<00:07:05.560> key<00:07:05.770> elements

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
technologies could become a key elements

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.040 
technologies could become a key elements
in<00:07:06.280> the<00:07:06.370> success<00:07:06.520> of<00:07:06.880> 4G<00:07:07.120> going<00:07:07.570> forward<00:07:07.930> as

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
in the success of 4G going forward as

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.100 
in the success of 4G going forward as
well<00:07:08.200> is<00:07:08.620> there<00:07:09.400> a<00:07:09.430> 5g<00:07:09.940> no<00:07:10.480> we're<00:07:10.720> not<00:07:10.810> talking

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110 
well is there a 5g no we're not talking

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.870 
well is there a 5g no we're not talking
about<00:07:11.200> anything<00:07:11.560> like<00:07:11.740> 5g<00:07:12.190> at<00:07:12.310> this<00:07:12.460> point<00:07:12.700> but

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
about anything like 5g at this point but

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.180 
about anything like 5g at this point but
gigabit<00:07:13.420> wireless<00:07:13.930> will<00:07:14.320> be<00:07:14.440> the<00:07:14.590> next<00:07:14.950> big

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.190 
gigabit wireless will be the next big

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.070 
gigabit wireless will be the next big
topic<00:07:15.460> that<00:07:15.790> will<00:07:15.910> be<00:07:15.940> tackled<00:07:16.390> by<00:07:16.420> a<00:07:16.540> lot<00:07:16.900> of

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 
topic that will be tackled by a lot of

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.500 
topic that will be tackled by a lot of
Engineers<00:07:17.920> and<00:07:18.160> carriers<00:07:18.760> out<00:07:18.940> there<00:07:19.180> as<00:07:19.330> well

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:19.510 
Engineers and carriers out there as well
