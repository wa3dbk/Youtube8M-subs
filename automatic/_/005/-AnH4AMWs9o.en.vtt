00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello perverse humans thirsty for 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.319
 worldly pleasures 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.780
 I am Maca who is their leader 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.360
 proudly surviving spiritual 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.240
 of flu wild political news 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.449
 it appears that the famous clown 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.789
 of the telepathy lagrimita was postulated 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.490
 to be mayor of Guadalajara and one of 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.550
 its mottos is vivanco bicycles for 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.679
 all if you are 15 or 16 years old 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.720
 you did not understand a fucking mother what I said 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.270
 it's funny to create in my opinion the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.940
 Mexican political machinery already 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.969
 became a gigantic tragicomedy 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.070
 starring the dirtiest rats 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.600
 that has never seen the planet I am 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.640
 completely disappointed in the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.890
 Mexican politics I feel disgusted 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.690
 level 'taxi driver' makes me want to 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.699
 do terrorist acts but 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.699
 Fortunately wing is my heart 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.739
 something that I loved about this race 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.260
 policy that you have just undertaken 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.489
 lagrimita was the poster that he put on his 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.010
 facebook page 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.740
 check what is deliciously malicious 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.020
 the correct clown is a good satire 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.690
 if he wins the tear I would love to see his 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.640
 cabinet secretary of economy 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.580
 Bubjita in tourism would put piojito 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.290
 in education would approve place the and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.149
 in the transportation secretary would put a 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.530
 Smile now what is my opinion 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:28.289
 about this vomit it's all vomit I 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.600
 I say that this is a dirty tactic a 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.700
 classic social tactic to take away the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.170
 value to our vote someone is behind 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.360
 of all this I think it is the first 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.030
 because people with a little bit of fame are 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.610
 postulates very simple is a very 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.860
 fast and effective weight loss 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.960
 voters say whether the click 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.080
 Lagrimita gets in the elections 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.899
 10,000 votes are 10,000 votes that are not 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.670
 for the pri nor for the bread and for the 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.300
 citizen movement this to the pri le 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.490
 it suits 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.190
 The more votes you take from your 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.220
 competitors more possibility you have of 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.740
 keep your 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.540
 has the advantage the pri with people 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.910
 divided can not achieve a good 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.710
 politics that's why lagrimita did not join 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.550
 no party is a candidate 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.320
 Independent 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.750
 his mission is to take votes from the 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.190
 left left matches 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.620
 politicians manipulate the vote the 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.990
 jaliciense with bullshit like pla grimi 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.340
 is running, I think if I'm 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.140
 an advice to all those who are going to vote 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.750
 vote for the people who most 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.820
 represent a drastic change in case not 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.920
 they knew the state of jalisco came back to 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.200
 be a PRI member after many years and 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.630
 this the federal government wants it 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.240
 take advantage but as Enrique peña grandson- 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.610
 last year he gave a lot of money to 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.440
 state of Jalisco a record number of 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.290
 federal government had never given 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.480
 so much money to jalisco but why then 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.870
 because jalisco is already priista enrique 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.610
 peña grandson suits you that jalisco 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.290
 remain priísta and all that money that 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.060
 the federal government has jalisco for 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.160
 to be used as part here 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.280
 jalisco is being built the famous 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.140
 line 3 of the light rail this line 3 of 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.660
 light rail in guadalajara 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.410
 starting in two the entire city of 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.590
 end to end in 33 minutes 70% 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.240
 of this line is going to be aerial they remember 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.150
 the simpson episode of the monorail 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.860
 to then account for line 3 of the 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.690
 light rail here in guadalajara all 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.430
 let's be able to see us going to go through the 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.410
 head is going to be very modern is going to be the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.110
 wave because Aristotle sandoval the 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.989
 Governor of Jalisco agreed to do this 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.060
 work so great stop telling them something 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.010
 it was not his idea they asked him what 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.350
 did the federal government want 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.020
 shield the tapatía citizenship and so 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.850
 everyone thinks the pri that good government 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.269
 because enrique peña grandson did not send everything 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.800
 that money to oaxaca warrior I'm going to 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.380
 say why because they are not states 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.019
 important jalisco is important and is 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.480
 PRI member you have to give them all the money and 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.580
