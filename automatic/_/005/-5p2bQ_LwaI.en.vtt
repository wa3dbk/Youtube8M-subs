excellent compressibility but also a

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.619 
layering piece not as a cold-weather
jacket<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.320> fairly<00:00:55.890> thinly<00:00:56.640> insulated

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
jacket so it's fairly thinly insulated

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.049 
jacket so it's fairly thinly insulated
it's<00:00:57.780> got<00:00:57.960> 60<00:00:58.469> grams<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.640> insulation

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
it's got 60 grams of that insulation

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.240 
it's got 60 grams of that insulation
again<00:01:00.660> makes<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> great<00:01:01.500> layering<00:01:01.829> piece

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
again makes this a great layering piece

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.780 
again makes this a great layering piece
and<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:03.000> cool<00:01:03.329> temperatures<00:01:04.080> early<00:01:05.010> fall<00:01:05.339> late

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and in cool temperatures early fall late

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.450 
and in cool temperatures early fall late
spring<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.350> an<00:01:07.470> excellent<00:01:07.830> standalone

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
