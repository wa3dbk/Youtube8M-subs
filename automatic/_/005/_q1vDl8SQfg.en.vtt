 daimler benz memorial stands there 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.779

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.130

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.599
 Ten horse carriage replicas of 1885 the 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.600

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.540

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.340

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.540
 driving is not that easy 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.579
 glow red now how to do it first 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.890

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.629
 Reservation is by match 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.910
 infected and then becomes natural 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.750
 cranked I always jump on the 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.489
 first hit 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.259
 you have to work very hard 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.190
 make it even ignite 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:13.080

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.080
 this is really big cinema 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.860
 The cinema will of course be much bigger 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.530
 when he not only runs, but when he does 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.600
 sometimes drives itself takes the time 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.550

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.220

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.780
 speed and the wheels
