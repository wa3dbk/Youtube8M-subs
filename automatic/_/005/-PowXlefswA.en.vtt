00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 in this video we will explain to you step 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.109
 step how to weave a pompom in the case of 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.260
 not have a few kits for pom poms just 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.620
 we need a piece of rigid cardboard and 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.680
 we make you marks how are you the more 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.869
 big is the biggest circle is going 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.199
 to leave the pompom and now we only have 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.199
 that cut the molds 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.880
 once we have the outside part of the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.310
 cut out mold 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.390
 will 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.600
 the cut to the inside part to 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.140
 that remains open 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.140
 and we will cut the inner circle 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.790
 once we have the two molds cut 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.580
 we put them on top of each other and that 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.090
 we match the opening in it 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.510
 space and we are going to do the following 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.510
 we take the wool 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.940
 with the same finger we hold it 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.490
 and let's go past 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.060
 inside the opening 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.110
 the wool around the entire contour 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.110
 of the cardboard 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.670
 and we have to go 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:01.509
 filling the center space up 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.509
 that we are rather closed 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.500
 if we put it less wool the pompom does not 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.540
 it will be 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.700
 so voluminous 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.940
 so we have to go 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:38.000
 spinning it with wool 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:40.540
 to the cardboard until we have the wool that 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.540
 we want 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.879
 once we have filled in the circles with 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.390
 the wool enough what we have to 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.390
 do is 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.530
 and pass the scissors through the middle of the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.900
 two cartons 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.900
 and go cutting the wool 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.480
 once we have cut all the wool 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:41.070
 we take a piece of wool and we had it 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.070
 between the two cartons 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.370
 and we make a knot 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.819
 and to reassure it we make 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.900
 another way 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.470
 and now we can only withdraw 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.470
 the paperboard 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:44.249
 we cut the two threads and now we just 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:44.249
 the pompom is equalized with the scissors 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.350
 once we have matched with the scissors 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.350
 We have finished the pompom
