00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.220
 It is a powerhouse equations of parabolic Let denunciation to take a look and say whether or not there this what problem 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:12.970
 Please give me 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:19.779
 It looks like this. Imagine taking a straight line of light blue as a fictional focus and passing 104, 0 on the battlefield. 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:20.470
 Songs equations Attan of straight line When you have made a song equations and You're in previous videos seek a parabola 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.440
 is not it 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.539
 How to bend a straight line 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:32.750
 It's a low equation, and this time it's a parabolic equation of parabola . 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:34.370
 Straight line on the Toka sought want a point on the curve pr or sought after all I birds that did well in the last video 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.829
 It is like a corner sheeter 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:45.230
 I'm was only fitting to take if and parabolic of the definition of the sun in the way of taking of polar coordinates 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.560
 Considering the condition of full open this time almost bites the definition of this parabola even if it is the condition with magic 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.260
 That fitting 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:54.530
 Will be 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:56.960
 Points are equal distance from the jazz parabolic of doing what was or I say when the small tent Junsen I definition 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.059
 I'm gathering is it went parabola of 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:06.200
 If you are not sure about parabola please review this video , for example x2 = 4 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.280
 p Yes I draw this kind of thing , but this is like this x 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.680
 Since there are coordinates ix and y 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:18.720
 And if there is a point p focus here and the opposite is the profit line, this focus and jun 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:25.860
 It's was that I would look when the distance from the line is going to take a point equal 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.870
 That Madokka this distance and this distance when you took what point in this man object 1 sheet it 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.820
 Did you go parabola 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:37.360
 Even along ch y like chorion px It is together x axis y axis is 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:42.160
 There are some I bet and the opposite cruiser warfare here to focus matches 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:48.860
 If this gathering of points with equal distances of the genuine annual tents is this parabola 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:52.730
 I'm this child distance it this distance and 9 are equal to each other if there is it if a point in this area it 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.810
 Here, of course it's was that Tteyuu has been introduced anywhere in the bouncing how matter say vertical 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.050
 It is right 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.700
 The distance between the point and the straight line, so naturally it is vertical ok 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.409
 How do in after it sparingly and let's use it anyway it is another practice this problem 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:10.860
 Let's see 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:16.260
 After all I first imagine it I'm a child of a fictional store I'll take a song cherry It's a song cherry 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.430
 This Nissen ox in of the Tteyuu I and Shi washing line is it is how to express the polar 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:24.400
 There is 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:31.150
 That Jono store 404,0 has a length of from large this that 4 Rette angle is 0-seater is 0 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.810
 What is that on this sunline It's a straight line to it, a pure sense, this is a roundabout 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.799
 It is 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:40.930
 This is the focus and I'm saying this is pure 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:44.440
 No , this and this distance draw a parabola like this is a gathering of Saisen. 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:50.000
 This is the point of how you are used to parabolics 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:55.190
 So as such people product policy though it's a thing Tteyuu so request a song equation of 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.110
 You mean, take the store pr corner sheeter in the curve shape you want to find 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.760
 Think if and still take the r now Mercy other sun Art Deco by the curve is obtained 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:08.989
 What to do 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.439
 It is parabolic of the definition means that I'm such thing as this distance Tteyuu've got this distance is equal to 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.060
 Ne 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:17.390
 If you want to think of this as a condition somehow, then to make it easier to express 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.750
 Let's put the ne ne Toka 10 h better, which had been put name here 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:26.910
 We think that if we let h be the foot of this perpendicular that was dropped from p to this genuine 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:32.430
 It means that it will become po = ph 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.990
 Then what is the length of the length p of this p and how to express this polar coordinates 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.209
 As you can see if you think 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.080
 9 Ten' distance from the station of Daikarashi is to say in here with bow and arrow I r is I can see I r 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.740
 Is it 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.340
 The length of the op is this 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:49.490
 I understand immediately 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:52.140
 So how is this th represented? Ph is 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:56.310
 It is good to do this 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:00.120
 Let's take a look here to think about the length of ph 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:03.450
 I want to know the cat this length and want to know the length of the here and now 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.980
 So what should I think ? 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:12.300
 If you say here the distance from here 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:18.070
 I'm Why is 4 it that Woo This is the distance from the large to here Te 4 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:22.330
 And I think it might be better to subtract the length here from here 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:26.530
 I wonder if cats should subtract this length, so what is the length of here? 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.810
 I man drew accustomed to can be done with it r times child 3 c other so soon you are familiar with the 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.070
 So Once if the number is also 4 a Toka put 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:37.660
 A child 's seater is good for r minutes It means that a will be said 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.060
 When a child is r times less than this, this is r times cos c 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.300
 Understand 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.720
 Right 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:48.600
 So also here Tara child 3 c 10 in the case where there is here here call 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:53.280
 And here also this by I mean I'm a child 3-seater in the case of 4-is 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:56.190
 If the distance of ph is 4-, the child 3 c will be understood as saying 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.360
 It's the point that it's like this 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:05.340
 Anyway, with this op = pa value hint 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.760
 best mark In this way, in order that we showdown Okura making r and-seater relationship 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.710
 Go 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:13.260
 That 's right Zao p Girl at ph 4- because there was a child in case there was r = 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.210
 Yo 6- will know if there is a child 3 c 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:23.020
 Migration Then only is it the coach going to organize this was 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:25.000
 Kneaded by the Fu like this it is so divided by Kukuru and and 1 Datsuko's test hitting in the r 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.229
 The answer comes out 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.710
 How is it ? It is a sewing line of parabola but how could it be understood? 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:34.250
 Ne 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:37.670
 I do not please do not hesitate to ask a question if such another star questions 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.660
 Firmly towards the router so that it can be a Nohinto in seed yourself can I I could also 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.660
 Let's practice
