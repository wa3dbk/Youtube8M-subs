00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
i believe the 360 had four I never had a

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.439 
i believe the 360 had four I never had a
360<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.980> don't<00:01:02.190> know<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.489> sure<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:03.059> never

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
360 so I don't know for sure I never

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.600 
360 so I don't know for sure I never
really<00:01:03.660> paid<00:01:03.809> attention<00:01:04.070> but<00:01:05.070> if<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.460> am

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
really paid attention but if I am

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.760 
really paid attention but if I am
correct<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.420> xbox<00:01:06.840> one<00:01:07.080> will<00:01:07.110> actually<00:01:07.619> have

correct the xbox one will actually have

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.390 
correct the xbox one will actually have
three<00:01:08.960> processors<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.380> will<00:01:11.040> correct

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
three processors in it I will correct

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.300 
three processors in it I will correct
myself<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:12.180> later<00:01:12.570> terms<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.799> find<00:01:14.189> out

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
myself in later terms if I find out

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.330 
myself in later terms if I find out
different<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:15.330> uh<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.140> moment<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.590> if<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.070> I

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
different but uh at this moment I if I I

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.460 
different but uh at this moment I if I I
believe<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.210> three<00:01:18.509> processors<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.380> I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
believe there is three processors and I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.530 
believe there is three processors and I
will<00:01:19.619> talk<00:01:19.740> about<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.950> later<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:21.060> let's<00:01:21.360> get

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
into it so the xbox one will not be

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.719 
into it so the xbox one will not be

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.420 
but I don't understand how that will
work<00:04:59.840> because<00:05:00.199> even<00:05:00.590> if<00:05:00.710> you<00:05:00.800> did<00:05:01.009> get<00:05:01.099> the<00:05:01.250> red

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
work because even if you did get the red

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.820 
work because even if you did get the red
ring<00:05:01.639> of<00:05:01.729> death<00:05:01.789> it<00:05:02.300> never<00:05:02.569> turned<00:05:02.960> on<00:05:03.229> or

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
maybe it did I don't know it never

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.490 
maybe it did I don't know it never
turned<00:05:05.629> on<00:05:05.779> when<00:05:05.900> I<00:05:05.990> had<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.110> red<00:05:06.289> ring<00:05:06.469> of

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
turned on when I had the red ring of

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.019 
turned on when I had the red ring of
death<00:05:06.590> so<00:05:06.919> you<00:05:06.949> couldn't<00:05:07.490> get<00:05:07.639> a<00:05:07.669> display

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:08.029 
death so you couldn't get a display

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:11.559 
death so you couldn't get a display
message<00:05:08.479> so<00:05:09.259> neck<00:05:09.650> that<00:05:09.979> kind<00:05:10.250> of<00:05:10.419> confuses<00:05:11.419> me

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569 
message so neck that kind of confuses me

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.529 
message so neck that kind of confuses me
but<00:05:12.069> here<00:05:13.069> we<00:05:13.159> go<00:05:13.279> with<00:05:13.430> the<00:05:13.520> three<00:05:13.759> processors

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
but here we go with the three processors

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.409 
but here we go with the three processors
so<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:15.490> Microsoft<00:05:16.490> is<00:05:16.639> switching<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.120> a<00:05:17.150> more

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
so the Microsoft is switching to a more

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.920 
so the Microsoft is switching to a more
accessible<00:05:17.689> eight<00:05:18.050> core<00:05:18.490> x86<00:05:19.490> so<00:05:19.699> 86<00:05:20.479> bit<00:05:20.750> i'm

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
accessible eight core x86 so 86 bit i'm

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.760 
accessible eight core x86 so 86 bit i'm
gonna<00:05:21.289> suppose<00:05:22.330> pc-style<00:05:23.330> processor<00:05:24.319> mm<00:05:24.620> it's

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
gonna suppose pc-style processor mm it's

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.610 
gonna suppose pc-style processor mm it's
a<00:05:24.860> big<00:05:25.009> change<00:05:25.189> for<00:05:25.370> Microsoft<00:05:25.879> but<00:05:26.349> they<00:05:27.349> use

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
a big change for Microsoft but they use

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.469 
a big change for Microsoft but they use
more<00:05:27.979> customized<00:05:28.550> chips<00:05:28.909> for<00:05:29.180> its<00:05:29.300> game

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
more customized chips for its game

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.939 
more customized chips for its game
consoles<00:05:29.900> before<00:05:30.259> but<00:05:31.039> here<00:05:31.669> it<00:05:31.789> is<00:05:31.849> so<00:05:32.949> the

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
consoles before but here it is so the

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.369 
consoles before but here it is so the
xbox<00:05:34.490> one<00:05:34.699> can<00:05:34.940> run<00:05:35.150> Windows<00:05:35.509> 8<00:05:35.719> apps<00:05:35.990> when

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:36.379 
xbox one can run Windows 8 apps when

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:39.070 
xbox one can run Windows 8 apps when
needed<00:05:36.830> indeed<00:05:37.339> the<00:05:37.580> console<00:05:38.120> will<00:05:38.330> run<00:05:38.539> three

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
needed indeed the console will run three

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.189 
needed indeed the console will run three
operating<00:05:39.680> systems<00:05:40.000> so<00:05:41.000> maybe<00:05:41.839> that's<00:05:42.080> not

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
operating systems so maybe that's not

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:43.930 
operating systems so maybe that's not
three<00:05:42.440> processors<00:05:43.009> but<00:05:43.159> three<00:05:43.370> operating

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
player starts a game so you have an

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.089 
player starts a game so you have an
operating<00:06:05.779> system<00:06:05.810> for<00:06:06.289> internet<00:06:06.770> and<00:06:06.949> all

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
one for gaming which is pretty good so

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.420 
one for gaming which is pretty good so
you<00:06:11.300> have<00:06:11.539> different<00:06:12.319> experience<00:06:13.009> for<00:06:13.219> each

so Xbox OS will be four games and then

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.510 
so Xbox OS will be four games and then
there's<00:06:17.300> a<00:06:17.360> small<00:06:17.810> third<00:06:18.259> OS<00:06:18.650> that<00:06:19.099> is<00:06:19.279> pretty

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
there's a small third OS that is pretty

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.100 
there's a small third OS that is pretty
much<00:06:19.729> just<00:06:19.909> a<00:06:20.029> bridge<00:06:20.240> between<00:06:20.419> the<00:06:20.659> two<00:06:20.779> to

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
much just a bridge between the two to

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.950 
much just a bridge between the two to
keep<00:06:21.289> them<00:06:21.500> running<00:06:21.879> so<00:06:22.879> say<00:06:23.360> you<00:06:23.419> go<00:06:23.659> from<00:06:23.870> a

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
keep them running so say you go from a

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.110 
keep them running so say you go from a
game<00:06:24.229> to<00:06:24.529> like<00:06:24.680> Skype<00:06:24.949> really<00:06:25.250> fast<00:06:25.490> it'll<00:06:25.969> go
