favorite Russian class it's gonna be a
very<00:00:12.840> aggressive<00:00:13.469> build<00:00:14.040> for<00:00:14.400> advanced

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
very aggressive build for advanced

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.880 
very aggressive build for advanced
warfare<00:00:14.820> using<00:00:15.660> mainly<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> submachine<00:00:16.650> gun

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
warfare using mainly a submachine gun

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.519 
warfare using mainly a submachine gun
and<00:00:17.070> rushing<00:00:17.970> around<00:00:18.090> objective<00:00:19.020> play<00:00:19.230> all<00:00:19.500> of

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
and rushing around objective play all of

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.290 
and rushing around objective play all of
that<00:00:19.770> stuff<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.220> obviously<00:00:20.310> no<00:00:20.730> stealth

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
that stuff and obviously no stealth

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.150 
that stuff and obviously no stealth
involved<00:00:21.810> or<00:00:21.960> suppression<00:00:22.529> or<00:00:22.650> kind<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.980> being

stealthy right up in the enemy's face
and<00:00:25.019> winning<00:00:25.470> gunfights<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.279> hopefully<00:00:26.730> this

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and winning gunfights so hopefully this

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.550 
and winning gunfights so hopefully this
build<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.689> there<00:00:27.930> something<00:00:28.230> you'll<00:00:28.349> find

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
build is there something you'll find

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.290 
build is there something you'll find
useful<00:00:28.800> but<00:00:29.400> we're<00:00:29.580> gonna<00:00:29.670> go<00:00:29.820> off<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
useful but we're gonna go off with the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.659 
useful but we're gonna go off with the
asm1<00:00:30.810> I'll<00:00:31.289> show<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.980> build<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.520> go

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
you the full class as it is but we're

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.060 
you the full class as it is but we're
gonna<00:00:39.120> use<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> ASM<00:00:39.750> one<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.260> not<00:00:40.530> very<00:00:40.710> still

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
gonna use the ASM one I'm not very still

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.069 
gonna use the ASM one I'm not very still
sure<00:00:41.340> what<00:00:41.760> my<00:00:41.879> favorite<00:00:42.210> submachine<00:00:42.690> gun<00:00:42.899> but

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
sure what my favorite submachine gun but

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.020 
sure what my favorite submachine gun but
out<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.410> lot<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.800> seems<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.850> best

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
out of the lot this seems to be the best

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.180 
out of the lot this seems to be the best
for<00:00:45.480> air<00:00:45.719> actual<00:00:46.110> damage<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.800> doesn't<00:00:47.100> have

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
for air actual damage it doesn't have

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.740 
for air actual damage it doesn't have
the<00:00:47.340> best<00:00:47.460> range<00:00:47.820> which<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> problem

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the best range which is the problem

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.110 
the best range which is the problem
there<00:00:48.899> weapons<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.980> our<00:00:50.430> better<00:00:50.730> range

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
there weapons that have our better range

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.490 
there weapons that have our better range
the<00:00:51.360> SM<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.260> has<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> best

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the SM one but this one has the best

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.170 
the SM one but this one has the best
damage<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.520> definitely<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.030> better

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
damage this is definitely the better

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.060 
damage this is definitely the better
close-range<00:00:54.899> weapon<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.469> opposed<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.860> other

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
close-range weapon as opposed to other

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.099 
close-range weapon as opposed to other
submachine<00:00:56.520> guns<00:00:56.730> which<00:00:57.149> are<00:00:57.300> good<00:00:57.570> at<00:00:57.780> longer

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
submachine guns which are good at longer

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.139 
submachine guns which are good at longer
ranges<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.039> rushing<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.579> getting<00:01:00.059> up

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
ranges but as for rushing and getting up

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.670 
ranges but as for rushing and getting up
the<00:01:00.300> enemies<00:01:00.539> faces<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> air<00:01:01.170> someone<00:01:01.530> is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the enemies faces the air someone is

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.500 
the enemies faces the air someone is
definitely<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:02.219> preferred<00:01:02.609> choice<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.090> for

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
definitely my preferred choice as for

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.670 
definitely my preferred choice as for
attachments<00:01:04.049> I'm<00:01:04.140> gonna<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.650> with

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
attachments I'm gonna be going with

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.130 
attachments I'm gonna be going with
firstly<00:01:05.369> stock<00:01:05.729> which<00:01:05.970> helps<00:01:06.299> massively<00:01:06.960> at

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
firstly stock which helps massively at

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.510 
firstly stock which helps massively at
close<00:01:07.320> quarters<00:01:07.680> gunfights<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.280> lets<00:01:08.400> you

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
close quarters gunfights that lets you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.800 
close quarters gunfights that lets you
straight<00:01:08.790> back<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.150> forward<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.450> aim<00:01:09.630> down

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
straight back and forward we aim down

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.480 
straight back and forward we aim down
sight<00:01:10.110> which<00:01:10.500> will<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.770> doing<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.100> lot<00:01:11.340> if

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
sight which will be doing a lot if

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.800 
sight which will be doing a lot if
you're<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.850> enemy's<00:01:12.119> face<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.540> rushing

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
you're up in enemy's face and rushing

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.690 
you're up in enemy's face and rushing
around<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.830> helps<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.189> kind<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.400> evade

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
around and this helps you kind of evade

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.070 
around and this helps you kind of evade
their<00:01:14.970> shots<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.330> move<00:01:15.540> quicker<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:15.960> so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
their shots and move quicker and so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.969 
their shots and move quicker and so
you're<00:01:16.200> not<00:01:16.259> kind<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.500> like<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
you're not kind of like more of a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.469 
you're not kind of like more of a
sitting<00:01:17.189> duck<00:01:17.280> when<00:01:17.850> you're<00:01:17.970> shooting<00:01:18.360> at

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
sitting duck when you're shooting at

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.030 
sitting duck when you're shooting at
each<00:01:18.509> other<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> next<00:01:19.320> attach<00:01:19.590> mummeries

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
each other so the next attach mummeries

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.710 
each other so the next attach mummeries
is<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.970> group<00:01:21.180> these<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.509> actually

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
is the for group these are actually

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.690 
is the for group these are actually
massively<00:01:22.020> massively<00:01:22.680> helpful<00:01:23.310> with<00:01:23.610> an

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
massively massively helpful with an

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
massively massively helpful with an
advanced<00:01:23.970> warfare<00:01:24.390> much<00:01:24.630> more<00:01:24.840> useful<00:01:24.960> than

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
advanced warfare much more useful than

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.170 
advanced warfare much more useful than
they<00:01:25.650> were<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.920> past<00:01:26.130> fair<00:01:26.460> called<00:01:26.759> G<00:01:26.880> games

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
they were in past fair called G games

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.460 
they were in past fair called G games
I've<00:01:27.390> made<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> video<00:01:27.840> specifically<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.439> that

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470

which I'll link in the description you
fall<00:01:30.090> into<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.329> difference<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.990> all<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
fall into the difference of all the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.289 
fall into the difference of all the
recoil<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.340> spreads<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.759> patterns<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
recoil but it spreads and patterns and

stuff<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:33.869> see<00:01:34.020> how<00:01:34.200> actually

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
stuff like that you can see how actually

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.170 
stuff like that you can see how actually
makes<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> difference<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.060> real

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
makes the difference and it's a real

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.219 
makes the difference and it's a real
interesting<00:01:36.450> video<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.689> definitely<00:01:37.049> recommend

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
interesting video I definitely recommend

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.899 
interesting video I definitely recommend
each<00:01:37.380> other<00:01:37.530> out<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.490> photos<00:01:38.790> that's

what<00:01:39.060> I'm<00:01:39.119> gonna<00:01:39.240> go<00:01:39.420> with<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.869> gonna<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
what I'm gonna go with is gonna be the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.780 
what I'm gonna go with is gonna be the
quick-draw<00:01:40.680> grip<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.189> allows<00:01:41.369> me<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.579> aim

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.609 
quick-draw grip this allows me to aim
down<00:01:41.970> sight<00:01:42.240> faster<00:01:42.750> which<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.110> massively

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
down sight faster which is massively

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.230 
down sight faster which is massively
helpful<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.369> snap<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.610> target<00:01:45.030> really

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
helpful so I can snap on target really

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.730 
helpful so I can snap on target really
quickly<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.780> start<00:01:46.229> getting<00:01:46.500> shots

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
quickly and start getting shots

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.350 
quickly and start getting shots
downrange<00:01:47.340> really<00:01:47.610> accurately<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.210> also

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
downrange really accurately and also

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.730 
downrange really accurately and also
that's<00:01:48.509> gonna<00:01:48.630> require<00:01:48.899> primary<00:01:49.530> gunfighter

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that's gonna require primary gunfighter

move<00:02:43.110> super<00:02:43.770> fast<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.130> equip<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.330> with

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
move super fast and equip that with

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.790 
move super fast and equip that with
light<00:02:45.870> weight<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.440> course<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
light weight and of course the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.220 
light weight and of course the
submachine<00:02:47.220> gun<00:02:47.400> you're<00:02:47.580> moving<00:02:48.060> super<00:02:48.420> super

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
submachine gun you're moving super super

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.320 
submachine gun you're moving super super
fast<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:49.650> X<00:02:49.890> overclock<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.640> definitely<00:02:51.090> really

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
fast so X overclock is definitely really

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.240 
fast so X overclock is definitely really
cool<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.690> isn't<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.290> also<00:02:52.470> going<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.710> use<00:02:52.830> XO

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
cool and isn't that also going to use XO

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.040 
cool and isn't that also going to use XO
stim<00:02:53.670> which<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.090> gives<00:02:54.210> you<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> slight<00:02:54.840> boost

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
stim which it gives you a slight boost

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.810 
stim which it gives you a slight boost
of<00:02:55.230> health<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.010> again<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.460> will<00:02:56.520> come<00:02:56.700> in

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
of health and again that will come in

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.250 
of health and again that will come in
handy<00:02:56.850> when<00:02:57.150> you're<00:02:57.330> rushing<00:02:57.540> around<00:02:57.750> get

handy when you're rushing around get
into<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.470> lot<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.650> gunfights<00:02:59.070> maybe<00:02:59.340> for

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
into a lot of gunfights maybe for
