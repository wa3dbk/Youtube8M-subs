hello thank you for watching this is
crash<00:00:02.070> course<00:00:02.100> in<00:00:02.580> my<00:00:02.760> hair<00:00:03.149> section<00:00:03.810> 5<00:00:04.049> this

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.370 
crash course in my hair section 5 this

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.230 
crash course in my hair section 5 this
is<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.879> second<00:00:06.270> video<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.839> example

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
is the second video in the example

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.810 
is the second video in the example
continuing<00:00:09.240> from<00:00:09.570> before<00:00:10.429> looks<00:00:11.429> like<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.759> just

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
continuing from before looks like I just

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.350 
continuing from before looks like I just
finished<00:00:12.660> the

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.120 

part<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.139> hair<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.500> will<00:00:16.619> be<00:00:16.740> affected

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
part of the hair that will be affected

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.240 
part of the hair that will be affected
by<00:00:17.250> non<00:00:17.850> normal<00:00:18.240> gravity<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.529> i<00:00:19.560> created<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
by non normal gravity so i created the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.990 
by non normal gravity so i created the
hair

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.590 

I'm<00:00:23.450> setting<00:00:23.900> up<00:00:24.020> the<00:00:24.940> aerodynamics<00:00:25.940> get

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
I'm setting up the aerodynamics get

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:34.700 
I'm setting up the aerodynamics get
ready<00:00:26.810> to<00:00:26.900> style<00:00:27.619> it<00:00:27.800> with<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.220> aerodynamics

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.880 

as<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.430> see<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.780> do<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> heavy<00:00:37.079> extreme<00:00:37.620> on

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
as you can see I do a heavy extreme on

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.549 
as you can see I do a heavy extreme on
the<00:00:38.160> left-hand<00:00:38.910> side<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.540> face<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:40.020> to

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the left-hand side of the face just to

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.630 
the left-hand side of the face just to
get<00:00:40.680> all<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> hair<00:00:41.070> over<00:00:41.250> there<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.489> there's

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
get all the hair over there so there's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:55.990 
get all the hair over there so there's
no<00:00:41.760> wandering<00:00:42.629> stragglers<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.290> middle

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000 

I've<00:00:56.630> set<00:00:56.870> at<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:57.140> current<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:57.650> I<00:00:57.680> can<00:00:57.890> work

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
I've set at the current so I can work

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.380 
I've set at the current so I can work
with<00:00:58.070> those<00:00:58.430> curves<00:00:58.730> instead<00:00:59.120> of<00:00:59.500> the<00:01:00.500> spiky

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
with those curves instead of the spiky

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.030 
with those curves instead of the spiky
curves

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.280 

now<00:01:07.580> i'm<00:01:07.670> going<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.120> specific<00:01:08.540> UVs<00:01:08.930> as<00:01:09.140> you

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
now i'm going to the specific UVs as you

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.400 
now i'm going to the specific UVs as you
can<00:01:09.410> see<00:01:09.620> here<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:09.950> have<00:01:10.070> a<00:01:10.550> ton<00:01:10.940> of<00:01:11.110> CDs<00:01:12.110> I'm<00:01:12.380> a

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
can see here I have a ton of CDs I'm a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.520 
can see here I have a ton of CDs I'm a
long<00:01:12.590> hair<00:01:12.910> but<00:01:13.910> you<00:01:14.390> saw<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:14.780> selected<00:01:15.320> the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
long hair but you saw I selected the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.040 
long hair but you saw I selected the
front<00:01:16.070> UVs<00:01:16.490> or<00:01:16.790> sorry<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.060> other<00:01:17.330> front<00:01:17.600> CVS

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.490 
front UVs or sorry the other front CVS
and<00:01:18.320> put<00:01:18.650> a<00:01:18.680> transformer<00:01:19.490> on<00:01:19.520> it<00:01:19.820> that<00:01:20.630> way<00:01:20.900> or

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
and put a transformer on it that way or

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.870 
and put a transformer on it that way or
transfer<00:01:21.860> constraint<00:01:22.190> that<00:01:22.250> way<00:01:22.550> I<00:01:22.580> can

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
transfer constraint that way I can

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.260 
transfer constraint that way I can
actually<00:01:23.270> control<00:01:23.780> manipulate<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.880> front

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
actually control manipulate the front

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.750 
actually control manipulate the front
part<00:01:26.479> of<00:01:26.510> the<00:01:26.570> curves<00:01:26.840> instead<00:01:27.260> of<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.760> totally

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
part of the curves instead of it totally

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:40.760 
part of the curves instead of it totally
being<00:01:28.910> affected<00:01:29.330> by<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.540> aerodynamic

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.649 

now<00:01:41.310> she's<00:01:41.609> feeling<00:01:41.909> with<00:01:42.000> members<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.509> get

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
now she's feeling with members to get

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:55.280 
now she's feeling with members to get
the<00:01:42.780> hair<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.350> look<00:01:43.530> how<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.770> wanted<00:01:44.039> to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.200 

looks<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.160> I<00:01:56.310> was<00:01:56.430> pleased<00:01:56.700> pleased<00:01:57.090> with

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
looks like I was pleased pleased with

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.340 
looks like I was pleased pleased with
that<00:01:57.240> result<00:01:57.690> so<00:01:57.900> now<00:01:58.080> it's<00:01:58.230> time<00:01:58.380> for<00:01:58.620> me<00:01:58.740> to

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
that result so now it's time for me to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.370 
that result so now it's time for me to
get<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:02.000> bank<00:02:03.000> taking<00:02:03.420> care<00:02:03.720> so<00:02:03.990> I'm<00:02:04.080> getting

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
get the bank taking care so I'm getting

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.800 
get the bank taking care so I'm getting
that<00:02:04.500> done

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.390 

as<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.260> can<00:02:12.349> see<00:02:12.590> i<00:02:12.620> am<00:02:12.770> setting<00:02:13.099> up<00:02:13.280> the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
as you can see i am setting up the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.820 
as you can see i am setting up the
constraints<00:02:13.910> like<00:02:14.420> usual<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:15.349> that<00:02:15.590> goes

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
constraints like usual so that goes

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.350 
constraints like usual so that goes
around<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.220> face<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.970> nose<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.420> all<00:02:17.510> that

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
around the face the nose and all that

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.510 
around the face the nose and all that
and<00:02:19.780> after<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.200> set<00:02:20.410> everything<00:02:20.500> up<00:02:20.890> it's<00:02:21.250> once

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
and after I set everything up it's once

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.460 
and after I set everything up it's once
again<00:02:21.580> back<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:23.730> there<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.930> get<00:02:26.350> the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
again back to the there to get the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.800 
again back to the there to get the
styling<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.040> hair<00:02:27.390> since<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.540> kind<00:02:28.750> of

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
styling of the hair since it kind of

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.160 
styling of the hair since it kind of
sways<00:02:29.440> down<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.790> face<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.750> left<00:02:31.960> of

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
sways down the face and to the left of

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.250 
sways down the face and to the left of
the<00:02:32.290> eye<00:02:32.490> I'm<00:02:33.490> trying<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.210> want<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:34.900> do<00:02:34.960> my<00:02:35.020> best

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
the eye I'm trying to want to do my best

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.230 
the eye I'm trying to want to do my best
to<00:02:35.380> make<00:02:35.410> sure<00:02:35.710> it<00:02:35.830> gets<00:02:36.610> as<00:02:36.820> best<00:02:37.060> as<00:02:37.180> possible

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
to make sure it gets as best as possible

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.270 
to make sure it gets as best as possible
as<00:02:37.720> close<00:02:37.960> as<00:02:38.140> possible<00:02:38.170> before<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:38.890> start

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
as close as possible before I start

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.760 
as close as possible before I start
doing<00:02:39.430> some<00:02:39.580> fine<00:02:39.760> detail<00:02:40.140> which<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.410> won't<00:02:41.650> be

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
doing some fine detail which I won't be

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.710 
doing some fine detail which I won't be
doing<00:02:41.950> considering<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:43.270> is<00:02:43.420> an<00:02:43.480> example

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
doing considering this is an example

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.260 
doing considering this is an example
this<00:02:43.960> is<00:02:44.020> this<00:02:44.290> more<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:44.670> how<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.730> get<00:02:46.060> the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
this is this more like how to get the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.910 
this is this more like how to get the
general<00:02:46.660> basis<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.320> what<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.560> hair<00:02:47.740> should

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
general basis of what the hair should

general basis of what the hair should
look<00:02:48.070> like<00:02:48.100> or<00:02:48.550> how<00:02:49.060> how<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.690> can<00:02:49.870> style<00:02:50.110> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
look like or how how you can style the

look like or how how you can style the
hair

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.260 

right<00:02:54.010> now<00:02:54.160> i'm<00:02:54.280> selecting<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.670> CVS<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.150> like

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
right now i'm selecting the CVS it like

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.660 
right now i'm selecting the CVS it like
before<00:02:55.390> i'm<00:02:56.350> going<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.650> put<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.130> transfer

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
constraints so after i start slapping

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.810

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.410 

as<00:03:17.069> you<00:03:17.159> can<00:03:17.250> see<00:03:17.430> i'm<00:03:17.519> working<00:03:17.849> in<00:03:17.909> sections

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
as you can see i'm working in sections

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.899 
as you can see i'm working in sections
the<00:03:18.860> tip<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.069> baggage<00:03:20.370> which<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.670> base

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
the tip of the baggage which I the base

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.620 
the tip of the baggage which I the base
of<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.090> bangs<00:03:21.329> are

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.410 

I'm<00:03:23.900> pleased<00:03:24.230> with<00:03:24.260> so<00:03:24.770> i<00:03:24.880> set<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:25.970> cars<00:03:26.180> there

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
I'm pleased with so i set the cars there

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.390 
I'm pleased with so i set the cars there
put<00:03:26.750> another<00:03:26.900> transform<00:03:27.560> constraint<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.130> now

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
put another transform constraint and now

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.520 
put another transform constraint and now
i'm<00:03:28.490> going<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:28.790> be<00:03:28.910> working<00:03:29.270> with<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.840> air

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
i'm going to be working with the air

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.400 
i'm going to be working with the air
again<00:03:30.740> to<00:03:31.130> try<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.520> get<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:32.020> swiftness<00:03:33.020> way

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
again to try to get the swiftness way

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.010 
again to try to get the swiftness way
from<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.770> bangs

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.080 

it<00:03:38.560> looks<00:03:38.800> good<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.400> can<00:03:39.520> see<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:39.670> set<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.060> to

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
it looks good so you can see I set it to

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.690 
it looks good so you can see I set it to
the<00:03:40.240> current<00:03:40.510> or<00:03:41.020> to<00:03:41.110> start

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
the current or to start

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:52.700 
the current or to start
and<00:03:43.180> I'm<00:03:43.390> putting<00:03:43.690> everything<00:03:43.840> as<00:03:44.410> static

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.140 

all<00:03:53.190> right<00:03:53.370> looks<00:03:53.520> like<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.670> style<00:03:53.970> is

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
all right looks like the style is

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.550 
all right looks like the style is
generally<00:03:54.480> done<00:03:54.660> now<00:03:54.900> it's<00:03:55.050> time<00:03:55.200> for<00:03:55.380> me<00:03:55.440> to

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
generally done now it's time for me to

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.350 
generally done now it's time for me to
trim<00:03:55.710> the<00:03:55.860> hair

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.110

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
going to start curves go into a sub

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.540 
going to start curves go into a sub
operation<00:04:01.570> going<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:01.900> CVS<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.560> selecting<00:04:03.400> the

lasso tool selecting the CVS I want to

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.640 
lasso tool selecting the CVS I want to
trim<00:04:06.550> out<00:04:06.700> with<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:07.660> hairstyle<00:04:08.080> and<00:04:08.290> just

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
trim out with the hairstyle and just

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:27.879 
trim out with the hairstyle and just
delete<00:04:08.830> him

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.129 

that<00:04:28.460> was<00:04:28.580> time<00:04:28.759> for<00:04:28.939> me<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.090> work<00:04:29.930> with<00:04:29.960> a

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
that was time for me to work with a

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.570 
that was time for me to work with a
little<00:04:30.439> bit<00:04:30.620> of<00:04:31.509> global<00:04:32.509> redoing<00:04:33.550> suppose<00:04:34.550> I

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
little bit of global redoing suppose I

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.179 
little bit of global redoing suppose I
call<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:35.389> so<00:04:36.020> I<00:04:36.050> slept<00:04:36.289> all<00:04:36.499> the<00:04:36.529> CVS<00:04:37.009> and

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:37.189 
call it so I slept all the CVS and

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:39.360 
call it so I slept all the CVS and
putting<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.610> lattice<00:04:37.939> to<00:04:38.090> on<00:04:38.210> it

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
putting a lattice to on it

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.950 
putting a lattice to on it
so<00:04:40.000> I<00:04:40.060> can<00:04:40.360> modify<00:04:40.930> everything

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
so I can modify everything

00:04:42.960 --> 00:05:02.060 
so I can modify everything
just<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.199> little<00:04:43.590> bit

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.430 

let's<00:05:02.550> see<00:05:02.730> i'm<00:05:02.820> just<00:05:03.330> doing<00:05:03.540> a<00:05:03.600> little<00:05:03.960> push

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
let's see i'm just doing a little push

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:17.730 
let's see i'm just doing a little push
it's<00:05:04.710> not<00:05:04.860> too<00:05:05.040> much

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.670 

problem<00:05:18.520> is<00:05:18.669> with<00:05:19.599> running<00:05:19.870> fraps<00:05:20.259> with

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
problem is with running fraps with

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.379 
problem is with running fraps with
running<00:05:20.979> the<00:05:21.009> hair<00:05:21.280> dynamic<00:05:21.789> system<00:05:22.150> with<00:05:22.270> all

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
running the hair dynamic system with all

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.510 
running the hair dynamic system with all
these<00:05:22.539> curves<00:05:22.870> in<00:05:23.050> Maya<00:05:23.259> that<00:05:24.069> computer<00:05:24.490> is

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
these curves in Maya that computer is

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.070 
these curves in Maya that computer is
really<00:05:24.610> starting<00:05:25.090> to<00:05:25.180> chug<00:05:25.419> so<00:05:25.660> you<00:05:25.780> can<00:05:25.930> see

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
really starting to chug so you can see

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.779 
really starting to chug so you can see
it<00:05:26.169> to<00:05:26.319> skipping<00:05:26.710> around<00:05:26.830> it<00:05:27.160> can<00:05:27.280> be<00:05:27.400> a<00:05:27.430> little

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
it to skipping around it can be a little

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:42.719 
it to skipping around it can be a little
bit<00:05:28.210> difficult<00:05:28.389> for<00:05:28.780> me

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.929 

I'm<00:05:43.330> doing<00:05:43.719> some<00:05:44.020> fine<00:05:44.680> detail<00:05:45.129> work<00:05:45.370> on<00:05:45.610> the

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:45.939 
I'm doing some fine detail work on the

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:50.110 
I'm doing some fine detail work on the
tips<00:05:46.839> of<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.259> hair<00:05:48.059> get<00:05:49.059> it<00:05:49.180> to<00:05:49.300> look

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
tips of the hair get it to look

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.450 
tips of the hair get it to look
more<00:05:50.449> like<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.900> the<00:05:51.350> picture<00:05:51.680> the<00:05:52.130> reference

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
more like the the picture the reference

00:05:52.460 --> 00:06:12.650 
more like the the picture the reference
photo

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.700 

right<00:06:13.020> now<00:06:13.170> it's<00:06:13.350> time<00:06:13.530> for<00:06:13.710> me<00:06:13.830> to

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
right now it's time for me to

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.950 
right now it's time for me to
do<00:06:16.070> the<00:06:16.190> final<00:06:16.400> touch<00:06:16.730> make<00:06:17.330> it<00:06:17.480> look<00:06:17.630> more

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
do the final touch make it look more

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.170 
do the final touch make it look more
natural<00:06:18.110> so<00:06:18.800> I<00:06:18.830> put<00:06:19.310> it<00:06:19.400> back<00:06:19.550> in<00:06:19.670> the<00:06:19.730> dynamics

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
natural so I put it back in the dynamics

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.670 
natural so I put it back in the dynamics
make<00:06:20.360> everything<00:06:20.570> dynamic<00:06:21.140> have<00:06:21.290> signed<00:06:21.560> all

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
make everything dynamic have signed all

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.460 
make everything dynamic have signed all
the<00:06:21.710> constraints<00:06:22.100> to<00:06:22.340> it<00:06:22.460> and<00:06:22.750> I'm<00:06:23.750> just

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
the constraints to it and I'm just

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.710

making gravity kind of release it from
the<00:06:26.810> constraints<00:06:27.430> and<00:06:28.430> I<00:06:29.120> am<00:06:29.270> putting<00:06:29.600> the

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.179 

start<00:06:32.789> curve<00:06:32.999> attribute<00:06:33.539> up<00:06:34.439> a<00:06:34.589> little<00:06:34.710> bit<00:06:34.919> so

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:35.189 
start curve attribute up a little bit so

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:39.320 
start curve attribute up a little bit so
the<00:06:35.610> dynamic<00:06:35.999> stay<00:06:36.180> with<00:06:36.389> the<00:06:36.569> curve

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.010 

but<00:06:39.720> really<00:06:40.110> that's<00:06:40.259> it<00:06:41.039> in<00:06:41.370> terms<00:06:41.610> of<00:06:42.020> general

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
but really that's it in terms of general

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.520 
but really that's it in terms of general
Harris<00:06:43.289> excuse<00:06:44.039> me<00:06:44.159> general<00:06:44.430> hair<00:06:44.699> styling
