00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:07.420
 we start there we are when I go 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.760
 learning as we go 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:14.050
 finding step by step 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.119
 step by step with us and today nicolÃ¡s 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.199
 let's do something that people 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.659
 fascinates with very little how to do 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.400
 boxes yes yes we think many times in 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:31.230
 in a box we think of a ring or some 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.130
 fins some motions to some chocolates 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.940
 let's move on 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.940
 clear shoulders 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.460
 to make a box are required 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.620
 just one sheet and it's that way 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.910
 penguin cards and we're going to do it 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.460
 in this way a square we bend to a 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.230
 rectangle 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.840
 in this way we unfold we rotate and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.770
 we repeat the same step 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.710
 previous 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.960
 we unfold we turn around and take 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.240
 the bottom corner with corner 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.420
 up this way 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.350
 overflow we turn and go back to repeat 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.110
 the same previous step 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.280
 we discount and what we have achieved is 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.479
 like a trunk from the bottom up there's 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.229
 we sink we close to have this form 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.380
 Well, look, I'm going to turn so they go 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.600
 seeing the shape we have open sides and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.360
 closed side only let's take a 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.039
 fin of the open side and let's talk 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:48.240
 from the side to the center in this way 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:52.200
 first on one side after the other side 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.619
 we turn around and we repeat the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.860
 same previous step always using 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.070
 the fingertips in this way there are 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.890
 we take a fin open in the middle 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.320
 from bottom to top we crush that 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.039
 matches this line with the line that 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.440
 We have low or outer and inner and 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.930
 this step we repeat on all the fins 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.700
 that is, we have four fins in total 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.450
 we are doing two we turn around 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.700
 we repeat here again 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.420
 always but to coincide these lines with 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.930
 this other line we take the last one that is 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.030
 the fourth in this way there and we're going to 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.790
 have this very interesting way that is 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:44.280
 on both sides I'm going to take fin with 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.950
 fin we close both up and down and 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.319
 we crush and we are going to have a line 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.600
 that a brand so let's guide us 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.200
 for that brand to fold in this way 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:01.150
 one 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:02.140
 2 we turn around we have 3 and 4 and something 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.060
 very interesting 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.690
 here we have side and side that close 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:12.569
 so that to form a triangle 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:15.560
 back and forth in this way 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.560
 next step down here 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.060
 we have fins we go down to where 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.700
 you can and it's okay we turn around 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.610
 you repeat but we have to go down 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.599
 these two as we make a fin with a 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:36.190
 fin we closed the other one we can also 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:39.880
 go down and back 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.340
 now after what comes to little piggy 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.220
 in palmar 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:51.900
 we turn 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:56.269
 we turn around and back 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.269
 we already have a starry box 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.450
 a pleasure told the divine truth many 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.000
 thank you and good to have been here and 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.980
 well I want to say goodbye to you 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.650
 they follow just that which is hands to the
