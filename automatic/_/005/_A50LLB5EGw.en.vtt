00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.490
 I need credits found there that code 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.410
 gugon below in description was 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.810
 all boys and welcome back to this 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.520
 new prediction rating video today 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.430
 are they bringing him the second episode 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.050
 with you squared and little we leave 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.000
 immediately from the earth and the player who 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.250
 how will you receive a plus or a rating a 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.170
 plus 3 in speed a plus 2 the shot 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.500
 pass that will remain unchanged because 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.410
 already a 77 which is a very long passage 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.780
 good with an attacker minus 1 in 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.640
 defense a plus 2 in dribbling and a physique 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.219
 of about 82 points 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.140
 also speaks four if the skills and 4 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.730
 stars see this upgrade as weak for me 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.890
 and the least seen what he did 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.960
 this year at Juventus he did one 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.899
 truly extraordinary season in 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.239
 championship and in the Italian cup then in 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.519
 champions league and in europe league not 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.340
 he played very well but I think that 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.470
 at least a true god will have it 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.330
 surely now let's move on to the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.950
 player who exploded this year 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.110
 square the player who already in the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.909
 over the past few years he had been good 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.110
 championships but this year it really is 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.350
 passed a championship 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.140
 extraordinary performing a dribble 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.390
 mail of the other for this m on 15 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.219
 executed 15 will have five stars writes 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.950
 that is one more star compared to 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.170
 four grades up to 14 is always three 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.079
 celebrated and weak will always receive for me 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.409
 all ratings a plus or speed 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:42.439
 a plus 9 even in extra shooting 4 the 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.329
 pass plus 4 should lose one 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.539
 point in defense and will have 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.729
 roughly 67 of physical will be a card 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.439
 really must for lazzari to a 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.759
 very strong player 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.520
 now guys let's move on to the last one 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.130
 Today's octopus talent paul player 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.039
 with pride the tower that for two years now 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.409
 juventus is running championships 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.750
 at very high levels and true merits 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.289
 this year even a plus 4 in 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.600
 evaluation will therefore go from 81 to 85 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.970
 with really very much evaluation 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.550
 good for this player who has le 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.700
 about twenty years for me they will receive more 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.640
 two speeds was more Trentino completed 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.250
 that passage a more 3 dribbling a 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.090
 p 3 in defense will have a physicist at 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.769
 the 87 points are uncertain and practically 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.300
 unofficial that will have four-star skill 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:38.209
 and 4 stars pede weak a card 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.269
 devastating guys a card with almost 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.000
 all the statistics above the 80 a 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.390
 card really scary a player 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.239
 extraordinary absurd another must for 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.250
 a series with cuadrado well 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.620
