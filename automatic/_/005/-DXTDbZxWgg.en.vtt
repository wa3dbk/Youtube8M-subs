00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
that extra source of comfort I guess

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.670 
that extra source of comfort I guess
because<00:02:48.669> it<00:02:49.359> just<00:02:49.569> feels<00:02:49.870> good<00:02:50.109> hold<00:02:50.409> and<00:02:50.530> it

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
because it just feels good hold and it

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.140 
because it just feels good hold and it
doesn't<00:02:51.129> feel<00:02:51.159> like<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.549> going<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.760> slip<00:02:52.030> out
