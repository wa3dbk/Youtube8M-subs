necessarily<00:01:21.479> want<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.659> take<00:01:21.780> them<00:01:21.930> out<00:01:22.020> on

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
necessarily want to take them out on

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.480 
necessarily want to take them out on
stage<00:01:22.380> or<00:01:22.619> take<00:01:22.740> them<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:22.950> tour<00:01:23.130> with<00:01:23.340> you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
stage or take them on tour with you

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.670 
stage or take them on tour with you
exactly<00:01:24.000> because<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.840> know<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.650> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
exactly because they you know with a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530 
exactly because they you know with a
little<00:01:25.979> money<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.310> they<00:01:26.369> never<00:01:26.490> play<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.000> yeah

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
little money and they never play so yeah

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.929 
little money and they never play so yeah
so<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.220> what<00:01:29.340> we're<00:01:29.490> doing<00:01:29.610> here<00:01:29.729> today

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
so this is what we're doing here today

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.030 
so this is what we're doing here today
is<00:01:30.060> actually<00:01:30.210> trying<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.689> redo<00:01:31.650> some<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
is actually trying to redo some of the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.230 
is actually trying to redo some of the
sounds<00:01:32.280> from<00:01:32.340> these<00:01:32.520> old<00:01:32.759> pedals<00:01:33.000> without

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
sounds from these old pedals without

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.940 
sounds from these old pedals without
actually<00:01:33.659> covering<00:01:33.960> them<00:01:34.110> one<00:01:34.320> by<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.470> right

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
actually covering them one by one right

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.170 
actually covering them one by one right
like<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.250> had<00:01:35.700> said<00:01:35.790> earlier<00:01:36.090> we're

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
like you had said earlier we're

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.789 
like you had said earlier we're
capturing<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.659> spirit<00:01:36.780> yeah<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.500> sound

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
capturing the spirit yeah of the sound

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:38.390 
capturing the spirit yeah of the sound
of<00:01:37.890> those<00:01:37.950> bells

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
of those bells

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.069 
of those bells
what<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.579> we<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.700> here<00:01:38.939> now<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
what do we have here now this is the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.160 
what do we have here now this is the
Hartmann<00:01:40.740> analog<00:01:41.070> flanger<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.909> is

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
Hartmann analog flanger and it is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.109 
Hartmann analog flanger and it is
basically<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.350> boutique<00:01:43.710> version<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.399> an

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
basically a boutique version of an

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.389 
basically a boutique version of an
original<00:01:45.360> electro<00:01:46.079> harmonix<00:01:46.500> yeah<00:01:46.770> flange

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
original electro harmonix yeah flange

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.190 
original electro harmonix yeah flange
and<00:01:47.579> pedal<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.329> recreates<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.020> sound

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and pedal and so it recreates that sound

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200 
and pedal and so it recreates that sound
all<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.500> analog<00:01:49.770> domain<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
all in the analog domain it's a it's a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.310 
all in the analog domain it's a it's a
nice<00:01:51.329> awning<00:01:51.600> pedal<00:01:51.810> because<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.140> kind<00:01:52.290> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
nice awning pedal because it's kind of

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.780 
nice awning pedal because it's kind of
subtle<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.770> not<00:01:52.890> an<00:01:52.979> over-the-top<00:01:53.280> flange

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
subtle it's not an over-the-top flange

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.039 
subtle it's not an over-the-top flange
or<00:01:53.970> no<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.180> lets<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.390> get<00:01:54.509> some<00:01:54.630> nice<00:01:54.750> chorus

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
or no it lets you get some nice chorus

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.870 
or no it lets you get some nice chorus
type<00:01:55.229> sounds<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.040> some<00:01:56.340> good<00:01:56.490> sweeping

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
type sounds and some good sweeping

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.520 
type sounds and some good sweeping
flange<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.329> kind<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.570> sounds<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:57.990> I'm

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
flange and kind of sounds and I'm

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.810 
flange and kind of sounds and I'm
anxious<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:58.979> what<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.280> do<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> vortex

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
anxious to see what we can do the vortex

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.490 
anxious to see what we can do the vortex
so<00:02:00.000> let's<00:02:00.180> try<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.420> out<00:02:00.570> inside<00:02:00.840> city<00:02:01.320> I

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
so let's try it out inside city I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.350 
so let's try it out inside city I
remember<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:02.729> one<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.060> things<00:02:03.240> I

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
remember and it's one of the things I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.539 
remember and it's one of the things I
always<00:02:03.509> tell<00:02:04.409> people<00:02:04.590> when<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.890> do<00:02:04.950> demos<00:02:05.369> for

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
always tell people when I do demos for

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.709 
always tell people when I do demos for
some<00:02:05.640> other<00:02:05.790> pedals<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.149> when<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> get<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
some other pedals and when I get to the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.719 
some other pedals and when I get to the
flanger<00:02:07.049> it's<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.380> that's<00:02:08.069> actually<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> lot

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
flanger it's like that's actually a lot

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.699 
flanger it's like that's actually a lot
of<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.940> old<00:02:09.090> sounds<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.200> you'd<00:02:10.319> think<00:02:10.530> would

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
of the old sounds that you'd think would

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.680 
of the old sounds that you'd think would
be<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> chorus<00:02:11.220> especially<00:02:11.640> for<00:02:11.790> anything<00:02:11.910> like

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
be a chorus especially for anything like

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.210 
be a chorus especially for anything like
and<00:02:12.750> he<00:02:12.840> summons<00:02:13.140> from<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.290> police<00:02:13.620> actually

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
and he summons from the police actually

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.490 
and he summons from the police actually
that<00:02:14.550> kind<00:02:14.820> of<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.540> kind<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:15.840> pedal<00:02:16.110> right

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
that kind of that kind of pedal right

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.810 
that kind of that kind of pedal right
right<00:02:16.860> yeah<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.100> we're<00:02:17.190> using<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.520> course<00:02:17.700> but

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
right yeah that we're using a course but

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.120 
right yeah that we're using a course but
all<00:02:17.940> they're<00:02:18.030> using<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.270> flange<00:02:18.480> yeah<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.560> cool

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
all they're using a flange yeah so cool

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.900 
all they're using a flange yeah so cool
let's<00:02:20.340> check<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.640> out

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
let's check it out

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.880 
let's check it out
yeah<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.390> magically<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:22.460> distortion<00:02:23.460> pedal

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
yeah and magically a distortion pedal

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.490 
yeah and magically a distortion pedal
basically<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> lot<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.850> times<00:02:27.500> overdrive

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
basically a lot of times overdrive

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.950 
basically a lot of times overdrive
distortion<00:02:28.830> kind<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.190> takes<00:02:29.570> makes<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.690> easier

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
distortion kind of takes makes it easier

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.810 
distortion kind of takes makes it easier
to<00:02:30.990> hear<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.380> differences<00:02:31.830> in<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.550> tonal

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
to hear the differences in and the tonal

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.220 
to hear the differences in and the tonal
nuances<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.390> flanger<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.840> kind<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.050> brings

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
nuances of a flanger it kind of brings

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.810 
nuances of a flanger it kind of brings
out<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.620> best<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.070> pedal<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.610> have<00:02:35.730> that

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
out the best of that pedal you have that

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.370 
out the best of that pedal you have that
extra<00:02:35.940> harmonic<00:02:36.390> content<00:02:36.750> for<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.020> flanger

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
extra harmonic content for the flanger

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.020 
extra harmonic content for the flanger
to<00:02:37.440> work<00:02:37.590> upon<00:02:37.860> exactly<00:02:38.430> sweeping<00:02:38.910> through

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
to work upon exactly sweeping through

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.240 
to work upon exactly sweeping through
yeah<00:02:39.210> so<00:02:39.780> we<00:02:40.110> kind<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.320> used<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.620> both<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:41.010> dial

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
yeah so we kind of used it both to dial

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.010 
yeah so we kind of used it both to dial
it<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.490> and<00:02:41.520> also<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:41.940> can<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.300> lot<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.540> cool

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
it in and also you can do a lot of cool

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.750 
it in and also you can do a lot of cool
sounds<00:02:43.350> with<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.530> flanger<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.100> back<00:02:44.520> pedal

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
sounds with a flanger and a back pedal

00:02:44.760 --> 00:03:07.140 
sounds with a flanger and a back pedal
at<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.910> same<00:02:45.060> time<00:02:45.270> yeah<00:02:45.450> absolutely<00:02:45.570> right

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.030 

you

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
you

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:18.240 
you
and<00:03:09.700> then<00:03:09.849> we<00:03:09.939> can<00:03:10.060> do<00:03:10.150> this<00:03:10.299> one<00:03:10.980> here

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.830 

that<00:03:18.670> basically<00:03:18.970> means<00:03:19.210> we<00:03:19.420> have<00:03:19.540> all<00:03:19.690> the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
that basically means we have all the

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.130 
that basically means we have all the
know<00:03:20.620> right<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:21.430> it's<00:03:22.300> more<00:03:22.810> less<00:03:22.960> of<00:03:23.080> a

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
know right so it's more less of a

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.240 
know right so it's more less of a
children<00:03:23.470> mm-hmm

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
children mm-hmm

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.310 
children mm-hmm
so<00:03:24.550> at<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:25.210> 12<00:03:25.510> o'clock<00:03:25.660> position<00:03:25.750> on<00:03:26.230> the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
so at the 12 o'clock position on the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.080 
so at the 12 o'clock position on the
delay<00:03:26.530> time<00:03:26.740> we're<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.310> same<00:03:27.490> as<00:03:27.670> this<00:03:27.820> is

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
delay time we're the same as this is

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.490 
delay time we're the same as this is
yeah<00:03:28.330> exactly<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.930> then<00:03:29.020> you<00:03:29.050> can<00:03:29.230> kind<00:03:29.410> of

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
yeah exactly and then you can kind of

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.290 
yeah exactly and then you can kind of
change<00:03:29.770> that<00:03:29.920> later<00:03:30.190> time<00:03:30.340> which<00:03:30.490> which

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
change that later time which which

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.790 
change that later time which which
changes<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:31.840> were<00:03:31.900> telling<00:03:32.080> me<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.230> width<00:03:32.590> oh

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
changes you were telling me the width oh

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.320 
changes you were telling me the width oh
yeah<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.250> height<00:03:33.460> of<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.700> flanger<00:03:34.060> yeah<00:03:34.180> we

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
yeah the height of the flanger yeah we

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.730 
yeah the height of the flanger yeah we
can<00:03:34.450> kind<00:03:34.600> of<00:03:34.630> here<00:03:34.840> just<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.320> just<00:03:37.740> basically

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
can kind of here just to just basically

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.430 
can kind of here just to just basically
how<00:03:38.920> high<00:03:39.160> up<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.209> flanton<00:03:40.450> goes<00:03:40.750> so<00:03:41.110> if

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
how high up the the flanton goes so if

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.260 
how high up the the flanton goes so if
it's<00:03:41.650> cranked<00:03:42.459> all<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.580> way<00:03:42.670> back<00:03:42.910> it's<00:03:43.060> gonna

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
it's cranked all the way back it's gonna

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.610 
it's cranked all the way back it's gonna
go<00:03:43.480> all<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.720> way<00:03:43.840> up<00:03:44.020> to<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.260> point<00:03:44.410> where

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
go all the way up to the point where

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.280 
go all the way up to the point where
it's<00:03:44.740> almost<00:03:44.830> unnoticed<00:03:45.760> goes<00:03:45.910> really<00:03:46.290> the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
it's almost unnoticed goes really the

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.020 
it's almost unnoticed goes really the
cursor<00:03:47.620> if<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:47.740> back<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:48.070> down<00:03:48.190> it's<00:03:48.610> a<00:03:48.730> deeper

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
cursor if you back it down it's a deeper

00:03:49.030 --> 00:04:04.569 
cursor if you back it down it's a deeper
sound

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.520 

right<00:04:05.579> and<00:04:05.730> then<00:04:05.819> also<00:04:06.120> right<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:06.930> the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
right and then also right and the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.899 
right and then also right and the
Hardman<00:04:07.829> doesn't<00:04:08.069> have<00:04:08.219> that<00:04:08.370> control<00:04:08.640> so

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
Hardman doesn't have that control so

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.459 
Hardman doesn't have that control so
it's<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.150> fixed<00:04:09.480> setting<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:09.930> we<00:04:09.959> basically

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:10.469 
it's a fixed setting so we basically

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.780 
it's a fixed setting so we basically
made<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:10.859> so<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.010> when<00:04:11.280> you<00:04:11.370> put<00:04:11.549> it<00:04:11.670> at<00:04:11.760> 12

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
made it so that when you put it at 12

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.969 
made it so that when you put it at 12
o'clock<00:04:14.659> and<00:04:15.659> the<00:04:16.350> only<00:04:16.560> other<00:04:16.680> ones<00:04:16.889> are

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
o'clock and the only other ones are

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.620 
o'clock and the only other ones are
basically<00:04:17.070> mapped<00:04:17.579> exactly<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.239> same<00:04:18.419> oh

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
basically mapped exactly the same oh

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.749 
basically mapped exactly the same oh
yeah<00:04:18.989> we<00:04:19.109> just<00:04:19.229> map<00:04:19.380> so<00:04:19.769> speed<00:04:20.039> matches<00:04:20.400> up<00:04:20.579> in

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759 
yeah we just map so speed matches up in

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.790 
yeah we just map so speed matches up in
the<00:04:20.850> depth<00:04:21.030> yeah<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.600> colors<00:04:22.049> feedback<00:04:22.530> so

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
the depth yeah and colors feedback so

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.340 
the depth yeah and colors feedback so
there<00:04:23.729> you<00:04:23.789> go<00:04:23.910> but<00:04:24.660> man<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:24.990> really<00:04:25.169> close

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
there you go but man it's really close

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.850 
there you go but man it's really close
yeah

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
yeah

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.890 
yeah
want<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.160> play<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.310> couple<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.669> samples<00:04:27.570> will<00:04:27.750> do

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
want to play a couple of samples will do

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.379 
want to play a couple of samples will do
sure<00:04:28.440> so<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.190> think<00:04:29.370> we<00:04:29.580> started<00:04:29.970> out<00:04:30.060> with<00:04:30.210> the

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
sure so I think we started out with the

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:55.110 
sure so I think we started out with the
that<00:04:31.169> kind<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:31.470> subtle

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.260 

it's<00:04:56.120> really<00:04:56.450> close<00:04:56.650> so<00:04:57.650> that's<00:04:58.640> another<00:04:59.000> term

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
it's really close so that's another term

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.330 
it's really close so that's another term
print<00:04:59.510> yeah<00:04:59.960> another<00:05:00.350> success<00:05:00.740> yeah<00:05:01.010> it's

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
print yeah another success yeah it's

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.640 
print yeah another success yeah it's
really<00:05:01.670> great<00:05:02.170> what<00:05:03.170> should<00:05:03.290> we<00:05:03.350> call<00:05:03.500> this

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
really great what should we call this

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.020 
really great what should we call this
one<00:05:03.830> what<00:05:04.160> do<00:05:04.220> you<00:05:04.310> think<00:05:04.490> let's<00:05:04.820> call<00:05:04.940> this

one what do you think let's call this

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.510 
one what do you think let's call this
one<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:05.210> Electric<00:05:05.570> vortex<00:05:06.020> I<00:05:06.380> like<00:05:06.860> that<00:05:07.070> it's

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
one the Electric vortex I like that it's

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.640 
one the Electric vortex I like that it's
like<00:05:07.670> a<00:05:07.730> Tim<00:05:08.570> it's<00:05:08.870> a<00:05:08.990> cross<00:05:09.230> between<00:05:09.410> the

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
like a Tim it's a cross between the

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:17.440 
like a Tim it's a cross between the
exact<00:05:10.490> or<00:05:10.640> the<00:05:10.850> electric<00:05:11.270> mistress<00:05:11.630> right<00:05:16.450> and

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
exact or the electric mistress right and

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.920 
exact or the electric mistress right and
there<00:05:17.600> we<00:05:17.660> go

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
there we go
