00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.010
 three days after suffering a 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.200
 elimination in leagues of europa league 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.599
 here even facing the Danes and desberg 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.550
 Saint-Etienne wants to revive 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.970
 championship with the reception of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.369
 Bordeaux 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.869
 the public is indeed present and if 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.450
 in the spans of geoffroy guichard 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.180
 to support his team that realized 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.619
 a very good start to the season with two 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.149
 victories and a defeat the week 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.790
 last face to Lille all under the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.050
 eyes of yoann mollo and mevlut erding them 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.420
 next two Etienne recruits 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.160
 go to who starts very well in 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.080
 this game 8th minute of play the ball 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.620
 arrives right side on the Romanian 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.230
 nicolita the banana center cut a 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.150
 by roman hour hamouma 8th minute of 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.880
 donkey game and already 1 0 for the ace 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.130
 saint-etienne roman hamouma marcq here 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.260
 his first goal this season he who is 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.300
 positioned at the tip of the attacked this 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.030
 evening since the Brazilian 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.920
 brandao still suffers from adductors 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.590
 christophe galtier call for vigilance 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.960
 of his men but overall she is 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.880
 Bordeaux are harmless 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.590
 Stephanois works well in the image 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.749
 of this recovery the feet of place 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.600
 he has a three against four to play 

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:20.549
 corgnet the one two with hamouma and the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.399
 striking of the former Lorientais is 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.920
 slightly crossed too beautiful exit 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.079
 to the passage of Cedric Carrasso who has 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.729
 plugged the angle benjamin corgnet into 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.889
 romain hamouma's support 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.799
 omnipresent 1st is just before the 

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:37.289
 half time with that shot on the post 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.409
 Cedric Carrasso is saved by his 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:43.619
 amount 1 to 0 at the break for the greens 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.200
 is a well deserved benefit the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.409
 public Etienne and the two future 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.429
 recruits so have seen 45 beautiful firsts 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.869
 0 minutes 0 to two times it was 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.639
 score during the matches of the season 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.130
 last time there is rhythm 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:00.599
 there are a lot of self-denial in 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.429
 Etienne, especially on the shots of 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.679
 foot stopped and on one of them it's 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.289
 loïc perrin the captain who will double 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.479
 setting 2 to 0 for saint-etienne at the 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.360
 50th minute of play but what apathy 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.700
 general of the Bordeaux defense 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.720
 subtle deviation of benjamin corgnet 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.850
 is completely and this place 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.680
 my poto loïc perrin gives an advantage 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.720
 more consequent to the Stéphaneans who go 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.210
 to have a fright in the minutes that 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.990
 follow the good little balloon stung 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.600
 poko for sheikh diabate the Malian who has 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.190
 even scored three goals throughout his 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.650
 career against the Etienne is in 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.540
 failure for the moment saint-etienne is going 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.140
 enjoy the spaces at the end of the game 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.410
 the beautiful work for renaud cohade who 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.660
 bute on cédric carrasso and francis 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.500
 gillot asks a little bit more 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.480
 concentration 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.070
 we are in the playtime of 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.380
 this part and to save the honor 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.110
 in a superb way it's ludovic 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.260
 obraniak who cleans the skylight of 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.240
 stéphane ruffier 2 goals 1 for alès 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.459
 Saint-Etienne the return to Bordelais 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.830
 will be too late the Girondins 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.650
 bow and saint-etienne with three 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.860
 victories in four matches climbs on 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.860
 the podium
