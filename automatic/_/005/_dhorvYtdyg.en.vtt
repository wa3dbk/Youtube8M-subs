00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 Hello everyone in this video I want you 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.110
 show unusual stool for 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.330
 feeding 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.560
 such models are gaining popularity 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.690
 now because they are multi-functional 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.360
 and now you see 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.040
 stool assembled further when 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.900
 baby grows up you can remove the top 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.060
 part it will turn into a highchair separately 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.550
 and the lower part turn into a desk 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.230
 No, I didn’t like them at all 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.930
 my like high chairs are not 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.400
 used and now I will explain why 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.949
 First of all 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.109
 cover material such oilcloth along with 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.630
 cloth is something combined 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.399
 accordingly if you serve porridge jam 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.610
 something else needs to be forgotten urgently 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.620
 otherwise you don't know what the belt of three will be 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.960
 points to fix a child only in 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.700
 this area in the shoulders of the child 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.590
 no way fix it uncomfortable and sense 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.860
 I don’t see any such belts 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.989
 there is a table tray removable 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.370
 we used it but the child for some reason 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.800
 doesn't really like this highchairs in 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.719
 Basically the design is going to sit 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.800
 using such plastic screws and 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.690
 it is generally not very stable and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.379
 This highchair takes a lot 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.210
 places 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.640
 downstairs to drive videos so that you can 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.890
 move it around the apartment 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.710
 Well, somehow he did not take root 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.299
 chicco chair is much better 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.549
 more convenient but we will now use 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.259
 this high chair is exactly like high chair with 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:25.619
 porto it became knocking i'm just now 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.840
 you see a highchair he is a small child 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.140
 like to sit in it exactly 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.240
 position and the desk itself on can that 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.310
 put if desired for nature itself 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.799
 of this 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.259
 the rollers can only be unscrewed. 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.960
 they are not easily removable with simple 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.549
 way and now we will draw 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.770
 note that the chair is very long 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.479
 collect a lot of hard work a lot 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.670
 small parts especially cogs 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.930
 plastic which need to be screwed on 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.030
 it is waiting for you of course a lot of time 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.560
