tip<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.700> before<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.360> start

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
tip I have for you before you start

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.929 
tip I have for you before you start
building<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.530> would<00:01:43.860> recommend<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.640> be

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
building this I would recommend it to be

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.660 
building this I would recommend it to be
in<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.119> straight<00:01:45.509> line<00:01:45.649> so<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:47.640> is

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
in a straight line so this is

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.090 
in a straight line so this is
recommended<00:01:48.299> version<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.680> not<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
recommended version this is not the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.889 
recommended version this is not the
recommended<00:01:50.640> version<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.299> works<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:51.840> it

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
recommended version but it works but it

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.980 
recommended version but it works but it
will<00:01:52.649> increase<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.250> fail<00:01:53.549> chance<00:01:54.450> quite<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
will increase the fail chance quite a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.709 
will increase the fail chance quite a
lot<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.340> how<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.610> turn<00:01:57.000> please

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
lot but if you know how to turn please

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.319

would recommend a glass block here and

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.710 
would recommend a glass block here and
here<00:04:17.630> and<00:04:17.810> here<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:19.070> another<00:04:19.310> very<00:04:19.940> important

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
here and here is another very important

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.710 
here and here is another very important
thing<00:04:21.250> as<00:04:22.250> you<00:04:22.460> can<00:04:22.580> see<00:04:22.790> here<00:04:23.000> if<00:04:23.150> I<00:04:23.360> place<00:04:23.690> one

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
thing as you can see here if I place one

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.400 
thing as you can see here if I place one
ear<00:04:24.169> nothing<00:04:24.740> happens<00:04:25.100> so<00:04:25.910> actually<00:04:26.389> here<00:04:27.229> is

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
ear nothing happens so actually here is

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.140 
ear nothing happens so actually here is
the<00:04:27.560> place<00:04:27.770> we<00:04:27.950> should<00:04:28.160> have<00:04:28.310> a<00:04:28.340> torchon<00:04:28.880> and

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
the place we should have a torchon and

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.469 
the place we should have a torchon and
an<00:04:30.110> extra<00:04:30.770> block<00:04:31.010> on<00:04:31.340> top<00:04:31.370> of<00:04:31.729> oh<00:04:33.250> no<00:04:34.250> yeah<00:04:35.180> it's

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
an extra block on top of oh no yeah it's

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.260 
an extra block on top of oh no yeah it's
right<00:04:35.780> so<00:04:36.139> it<00:04:36.410> should<00:04:36.620> go<00:04:36.650> that<00:04:37.130> way<00:04:37.460> when

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
right so it should go that way when

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.500 
right so it should go that way when
nothing<00:04:38.690> is<00:04:38.810> on<00:04:39.229> this<00:04:39.470> plate<00:04:40.160> here<00:04:40.430> so<00:04:41.300> that's

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
nothing is on this plate here so that's

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.780 
nothing is on this plate here so that's
how<00:04:41.780> you<00:04:41.840> build<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.350> first<00:04:42.560> section<00:04:43.220> of<00:04:43.550> it

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
how you build the first section of it

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.680 
how you build the first section of it
actually<00:04:44.260> so<00:04:45.260> yeah<00:04:45.650> oh<00:04:45.979> no<00:04:46.479> we<00:04:47.479> have<00:04:47.660> to

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
actually so yeah oh no we have to

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:55.420 
actually so yeah oh no we have to
actually<00:04:48.380> place<00:04:49.039> a<00:04:49.310> lever<00:04:49.910> here<00:04:50.500> leaver<00:04:54.430> like

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
actually place a lever here leaver like

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.029 
actually place a lever here leaver like
that<00:04:55.669> and<00:04:55.880> then<00:04:56.120> you<00:04:56.210> can<00:04:56.390> remove<00:04:56.570> it<00:04:56.870> so<00:04:57.830> it's

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
that and then you can remove it so it's

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.279 
that and then you can remove it so it's
facing<00:04:58.580> upwards<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.479> here<00:04:59.750> should<00:04:59.960> it<00:05:00.080> go

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
facing upwards and here should it go

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.640 
facing upwards and here should it go
down<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.770> up<00:05:01.400> and<00:05:01.760> down<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.360> up<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.690> up<00:05:03.289> here

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
down and up and down and up and up here

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.200 
down and up and down and up and up here
and<00:05:04.510> here<00:05:05.510> you<00:05:06.350> have<00:05:06.380> to<00:05:06.740> add<00:05:06.860> some<00:05:07.280> buttons<00:05:07.700> I

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
and here you have to add some buttons I

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.029 
and here you have to add some buttons I
don't<00:05:08.810> think<00:05:08.870> you<00:05:09.140> have<00:05:09.289> to<00:05:09.320> add<00:05:09.560> a<00:05:09.620> button

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
don't think you have to add a button

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.969 
don't think you have to add a button
here<00:05:10.370> but<00:05:11.120> i<00:05:11.150> would<00:05:11.270> recommend<00:05:11.900> it<00:05:12.169> anyways

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
here but i would recommend it anyways

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.250 
here but i would recommend it anyways
because<00:05:13.220> sometimes<00:05:13.940> you<00:05:14.300> could<00:05:14.630> get<00:05:14.930> stuck

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
because sometimes you could get stuck

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.540 
because sometimes you could get stuck
there<00:05:15.500> and<00:05:15.789> if<00:05:16.789> you<00:05:16.910> protest<00:05:17.180> it<00:05:17.690> now<00:05:18.190> it<00:05:19.190> works

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
there and if you protest it now it works

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.020 
there and if you protest it now it works
so<00:05:20.419> what<00:05:21.110> i'm<00:05:21.200> going<00:05:21.380> to<00:05:21.440> do<00:05:21.620> now<00:05:21.890> is<00:05:22.160> extend

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
so what i'm going to do now is extend

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.870 
so what i'm going to do now is extend
this<00:05:23.180> rail<00:05:23.479> a<00:05:23.510> little<00:05:23.960> bit<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:24.640> we've<00:05:25.640> build

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
this rail a little bit and we've build

00:05:25.880 --> 00:06:39.690 
this rail a little bit and we've build
the<00:05:26.090> next<00:05:26.620> machine<00:05:27.620> thing

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.510 

and<00:06:39.790> you<00:06:40.000> have<00:06:40.300> feel

alrighty<00:06:45.520> let's<00:06:45.999> do<00:06:46.300> the<00:06:46.449> first<00:06:46.599> test<00:06:46.900> run<00:06:47.050> so

00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:47.559 
alrighty let's do the first test run so
