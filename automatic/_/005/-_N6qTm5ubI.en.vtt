00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.519
 so pay extra new murder 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.089
 ideas and today it is about the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.560
 rap partly murder than reptiles mod are 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.480
 Crocodiles in there is a right one 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.779
 komodo dragon in here is a medal 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.090
 inside of looks like that's just 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.880
 only huge looks the best at it 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.160
 can eat me in a hard way 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.840
 mega blatant what this mod does which 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.610
 We will add animals immediately 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.590
 take a look and then it works 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.969
 go ahead 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.890
 So now we go all animals first 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.469
 mostly to what by what 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.670
 description on the mow not quite 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.160
 so completely missing there are a few 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.910
 In any case, this is the mega narnia 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.469
 has 20 lives so ten hearts 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:54.899
 that's what cows eat cows sheep cows 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.210
 chickens and also players and them 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.440
 Dry leather when you die and also 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.940
 she thinks of course and she does not 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.640
 so really 10 was you can still some 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.220
 of the animals count the way it looks 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.760
 that is certainly great and fat 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.140
 scene 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.049
 otherwise you could still here 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.900
 small komodowaran or kommune crowd 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.580
 and he is also sheep 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.939
 pig and send at least none 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.970
 cows more that we small of its 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.080
 believe something bigger than the others 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.400
 Alligators I 'm sure I am 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.200
 have the right weight so 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.290
 Come the commodore dragon should it 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.670
 his 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.520
 yes that would actually be the comodo 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.250
 The groups are also called leather and lace 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:44.700
 if they are killed and one man 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:47.399
 can she with raw meat themes and 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.799
 cook for meat can drive it 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.570
 so to speak first on your own 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.890
 Alligators can ride around 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.940
 quite naturally live a lot 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:01.150
 but it's already here 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:03.670
 olli is little crass you can 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.720
 nor do I think swimming go on 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.850
 have to get out of the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.740
 inventory that can spawn now and times 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.900
 Although there are different types of version 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.510
 from others the beasts eat 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.800
 Berlin as it shows again 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.690
 a savannah that is then 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.820
 accordingly a small lizard the in 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.770
 You do not live that much in the desert 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.440
 live but these lizards in this size 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.030
 all eat no more sheep but still 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.150
 then swine chickens ours immediately 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.050
 You can also be tough with meat 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.790
 cooked mates a crisis it something 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.630
 smaller excel then only eat 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.640
 send it I believe and are right 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.620
 I quickly find it out of the desert 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.390
 you can see the colors boulevards 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.960
 come here a party 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.740
 accordingly, an extra the 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.960
 seeds we have already seen then 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.340
 race that looks similar to the first 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.040
 a little bit bigger, do not remember 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.170
 that's just how it looks a bit wider 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.120
 somehow this is with the optics is the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.590
 optics that are right out okay but a 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.640
 other patterns come back from others 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.650
 currency to him 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.900
 Of course, we also have a crocodile 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.570
 nor as must not forget this 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.060
 time again all for sheep 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.739
 pigs player is day or night 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.540
 it does not matter much to me 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.100
 be kill even if live here 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.560
 you should of course have a weapon 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.850
 use 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.160
 fortunately, is a little slower so you 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.410
 can just run away from the cattle and 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.170
 of course, the spores also something 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.150
 rare marsh bio and they keep 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.459
 also lose leather and meat if 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.140
 They die and their eyes are supposed to be at night 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.670
 as you can see, you are already 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.430
 he also helps a bit 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.409
 very neat 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.700
 The whole thing will come later 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.980
 in the larger model to come then still 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.810
 time by but still one of the 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.700
 authors like so often if you have something else 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.799
 You can make a small one yourself 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.569
 small turtle and there are still 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.480
 so passive pug our freaky pug 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.310
 anyway better turtle species and at 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.349
 which of course it is the one you can 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.849
 also tame with apples and 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.650
 carrots are available for a few 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.540
 pretty sure what that brings him 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.530
 running around and power-hungry can set 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.639
 to try 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.260
 the game but mini turtles 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.819
 pietsch you write there ground 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.810
 Walls on it may not sit that way 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.449
 be so small again 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.820
 Cover turtle of very very small 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.380
 very enduring 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.729
 turtle can not become such 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.070
 so they eaten, believe me 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.960
 I am here very little turtle 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.430
 but we come now you 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.620
 converse as crocodile one 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.669
 giant crocodile magistrate from the front 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.080
 drive know because of shaders 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.970
 probably he can from very short 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.169
 hold and then you would have to see that 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.570
 years much better significantly better 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:47.080
 that's exactly what they look like and are 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.210
 relatively true big right 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.120
 right out into the example by means of 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:56.650
 turtles just have fun with that 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.050
 complete smart touch contigo anna that 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.030
 the case a jungle a little boy 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.560
 she was with these, for example 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.880
 partially would have to fall down 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.699
 too bad the players of the 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.750
 Trees down is not as smart as 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.860
 we would also have breaks there first 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.229
 can the next rheins yet 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.150
 look at 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.909
 that would annoy the normal tor 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.659
 Tyson Gay came medion and crocodile 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:19.599
 monitor 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:22.120
 that was the normal torres is one 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:26.349
 giant tortoise same cantz also with 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.099
 apples and carrots you can 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.639
 the couple 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:34.780
 the alligator next to who is big and 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:36.789
 black and he growls too, if that's what you mean 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.949
 lead can I do not know and then as 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:42.729
 only the chameleon is so small 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.110
 here are tiny little whizzes why I am 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.150
 sure whether the change me the color 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.789
 I do not think which sand set 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:52.150
 then we'll have it all the same 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:53.639
 well recognized for mini medica media am 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.990
 excited light must 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.780
 I do not think I do not understand 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.189
 the description separated and the description 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.469
 crocodile monitor is still missing 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:05.009
 that's what I know what monitors it is 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:06.419
 an English word missing 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:07.770
 crocodile or so I'm sure 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.050
 I do not know exactly what that means 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.659
 also is a little smaller 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.990
 the thicker head the ex banker like that 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:21.029
 politics even looks set 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:23.939
 Dividends front only did it before 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:27.240
 I do not get eaten it already hard 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:28.770
 what up opponents any crocodiles of love 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.479
 Of course, the game has a life to watch 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.949
 conceived can attack you naturally 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.689
 also some fighting friedman are 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.789
 passive and circuit test yet 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:38.279
 Finally, if it works out that we 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:42.479
 with the apple, such a turtle 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:43.770
 can pull this works is not here 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.599
 quite so that means it with pin 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.830
 should work I do not want 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.180
 if not go in place because 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.889
 otherwise comes the crocodiles and 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.349
 just eat me cold hit 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:55.409
 I'm not turtle either 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.430
 I'm still over the rush earlier 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:00.210
 Imagine that she was there yet 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:02.839
 what you should tame so 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.379
 so was in there that you can ten 

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:07.379
 apparently it does not work that way yet 

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:08.550
 really bringing this closer is good that 

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:09.300
 we still may have to change 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.129
 still in development 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.689
 Sören link to the description is what 

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:15.089
 Do you think he would? 

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:16.800
 really cool actually with the 

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:18.750
 ocean force murder you have to fit 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.159
 I take care of that at the ocean 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.379
 crocodiles are what I am all about 

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:25.110
 Realistically his municipality is freshwater 

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:27.270
 animals and I suppose so far as I am 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.300
 knows there are saltwater crocodiles happening 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:32.250
 not yes I think he lives here too 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.439
 The marshes, for example, really ingenious 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.939
 chosen by our wife you have me over 

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:42.839
 for as water lilies and trainer son 

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:44.099
 alligators rudi what then yes What You 

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:46.349
 as I said, like proven 

00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:48.300
 comments and west already been 

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:49.669
 I'll find something completely new then we'll see each other 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:53.000
 in the next video button for watching 

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:53.000
 and bye
