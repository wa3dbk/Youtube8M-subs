00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
really quite simple as you think I've

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.800 
really quite simple as you think I've
used<00:01:15.160> this<00:01:15.610> kind<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.940> guitar<00:01:16.030> for<00:01:16.390> many<00:01:16.509> years

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
used this kind of guitar for many years

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.160 
used this kind of guitar for many years
now<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:17.800> I<00:01:17.950> do<00:01:18.130> like<00:01:18.430> particularly<00:01:19.179> the<00:01:19.630> neck

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
now and I do like particularly the neck

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.710 
now and I do like particularly the neck
pickup<00:01:20.500> sound<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.160> then<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.119> other<00:01:22.270> sound<00:01:22.570> I

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
pickup sound and then the other sound I

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.020 
pickup sound and then the other sound I
will<00:01:22.869> generally<00:01:23.500> use<00:01:23.530> is<00:01:24.039> this<00:01:24.460> if<00:01:24.700> it<00:01:24.880> comes

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
will generally use is this if it comes

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.810 
will generally use is this if it comes
together<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:27.009> there<00:01:27.130> are<00:01:27.250> sort<00:01:27.460> of<00:01:27.490> problems

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
together but there are sort of problems

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.340 
together but there are sort of problems
that<00:01:27.940> you're<00:01:28.060> getting<00:01:28.240> generally<00:01:28.869> when

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
that you're getting generally when

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.690 
that you're getting generally when
you're<00:01:29.440> working<00:01:29.800> around<00:01:29.860> computers<00:01:30.520> like

you're working around computers like

you're working around computers like
when<00:01:30.880> I'm<00:01:30.940> doing<00:01:31.149> sessions<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.690> things<00:01:31.840> like

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
when I'm doing sessions and things like

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
that and also the kind of lighting

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.510 
that and also the kind of lighting
systems<00:01:34.630> you're<00:01:34.780> working<00:01:35.140> around<00:01:35.259> so<00:01:36.190> trip

Wilkinson<00:01:36.940> came<00:01:37.149> up<00:01:37.270> with<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.420> idea<00:01:37.750> of

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
Wilkinson came up with the idea of

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.440 
Wilkinson came up with the idea of
putting<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.830> dummy<00:01:39.039> coil<00:01:39.399> under<00:01:39.670> here<00:01:39.880> so

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
putting a dummy coil under here so

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.660 
putting a dummy coil under here so
there's<00:01:40.630> actually<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.020> fourth<00:01:41.440> pick<00:01:41.679> up<00:01:41.860> under

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
there's actually a fourth pick up under

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.609 
there's actually a fourth pick up under
the<00:01:42.759> pig<00:01:42.970> guard<00:01:43.209> which<00:01:43.959> means<00:01:44.229> that<00:01:44.440> when<00:01:44.590> you

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
the pig guard which means that when you

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.249 
the pig guard which means that when you
got<00:01:45.250> your<00:01:45.429> normal<00:01:45.640> neck<00:01:46.479> pickup<00:01:46.810> setting

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
got your normal neck pickup setting

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.529 
got your normal neck pickup setting
you've<00:01:47.979> got<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.340> neck<00:01:48.550> pickup<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.090> this<00:01:49.330> one

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
you've got the neck pickup and this one

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.660 
you've got the neck pickup and this one
under<00:01:49.840> here<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:50.950> way<00:01:51.069> it<00:01:51.160> works<00:01:51.399> is<00:01:51.640> you

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
under here and the way it works is you

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.120 
under here and the way it works is you
still<00:01:52.090> get<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:52.569> classic<00:01:52.899> front<00:01:53.830> pickup

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
still get that classic front pickup

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.639 
still get that classic front pickup
single<00:01:54.550> coil<00:01:54.789> sound<00:01:55.119> but<00:01:56.110> you're<00:01:56.229> not<00:01:56.440> getting

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
single coil sound but you're not getting

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.620 
single coil sound but you're not getting
as<00:01:56.709> much<00:01:56.860> home<00:01:57.190> and<00:01:58.119> you're<00:01:58.239> actually<00:01:58.390> getting

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
as much home and you're actually getting

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.479 
as much home and you're actually getting
a<00:01:58.750> bit<00:01:58.899> more<00:01:59.080> output<00:01:59.470> as<00:01:59.590> well<00:01:59.830> so<00:02:00.369> it's

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:00.489 
a bit more output as well so it's

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:02.609 
a bit more output as well so it's
driving<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:01.119> around<00:02:01.179> but<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:02.229> still<00:02:02.500> get

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
driving you around but you still get

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.309 
driving you around but you still get
enough<00:02:02.830> from<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:03.009> pickup<00:02:03.250> sound<00:02:04.319> similarly

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
enough from a pickup sound similarly

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.479 
enough from a pickup sound similarly
when<00:02:05.440> you<00:02:05.530> use<00:02:05.800> it<00:02:05.920> in<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.099> bridge<00:02:06.280> pickup

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:06.489 
when you use it in the bridge pickup

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:08.219 
when you use it in the bridge pickup
you've<00:02:06.910> actually<00:02:07.090> got<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.390> bridge<00:02:07.630> pickup<00:02:07.989> and

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
you've actually got a bridge pickup and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.949 
you've actually got a bridge pickup and
this<00:02:08.380> one<00:02:08.590> here<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:09.250> say<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.729> same<00:02:09.940> thing<00:02:10.270> you

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
this one here so say the same thing you

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.809 
this one here so say the same thing you
get<00:02:11.110> another<00:02:11.170> sort<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.770> humbucker<00:02:12.190> output

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
get another sort of a humbucker output

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.850 
get another sort of a humbucker output

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
but you still get in that classic sound

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.130 
but you still get in that classic sound
out<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.910> bridge<00:02:16.090> pickup<00:02:16.480> which<00:02:16.900> i<00:02:17.080> think

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
out of the bridge pickup which i think

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.830 
out of the bridge pickup which i think
is<00:02:17.410> great

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
is great

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.500

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
works a tree and it works really well

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.589 
works a tree and it works really well
for<00:02:35.459> me<00:02:37.010> but<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.160> other<00:02:38.519> main<00:02:38.730> sort<00:02:39.540> of

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
for me but the other main sort of

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.000 
for me but the other main sort of
feature<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.050> needed<00:02:40.349> from<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.560> guitar<00:02:40.830> is

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
feature that I needed from the guitar is

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.940 
feature that I needed from the guitar is
I<00:02:41.129> tend<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:42.140> use<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.319> point<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.620> well<00:02:43.830> my

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
I tend to use the point that well my

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.050 
I tend to use the point that well my
guitar<00:02:44.250> all<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.519> time<00:02:44.700> for<00:02:44.879> getting

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
guitar all the time for getting

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.449 
guitar all the time for getting
different<00:02:45.209> sounds<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.410> won't<00:02:46.739> use<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.980> pedal

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
different sounds so I won't use a pedal

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.910 
different sounds so I won't use a pedal
for<00:02:47.760> example<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.269> turn<00:02:48.510> down<00:02:49.349> to<00:02:49.590> get<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.739> rhythm

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920
