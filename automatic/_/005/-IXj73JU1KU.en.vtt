then the patients are likely to have
less<00:02:04.670> pain

less pain

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.359

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.940 
because there are fewer incisions there
may<00:02:08.520> also<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:09.060> less<00:02:09.539> risk<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.170> complications

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
may also be less risk of complications

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.180
