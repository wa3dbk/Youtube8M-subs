00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
area so here you can see them lined up

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.160 
area so here you can see them lined up
you've<00:00:32.610> got<00:00:32.640> aluminum<00:00:32.969> space<00:00:33.570> gray<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.079> then

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
you've got aluminum space gray and then

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.690 
you've got aluminum space gray and then
for<00:00:34.320> good<00:00:34.410> measure<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:34.980> far<00:00:35.399> right-hand

I don't know exactly what this means

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.219

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
maybe they're working on something new

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.660 
maybe they're working on something new
that<00:01:04.439> we<00:01:04.500> haven't<00:01:04.739> seen<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.070> at<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.189> prototype

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
that we haven't seen you at a prototype

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.160 
that we haven't seen you at a prototype
anyways<00:01:06.210> that's<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.720> something<00:01:06.900> worth

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
anyways that's just something worth

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.590 
anyways that's just something worth
mentioning<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.979> space<00:01:08.549> grey<00:01:08.880> back<00:01:09.119> casing

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
mentioning this space grey back casing

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.230 
mentioning this space grey back casing
also<00:01:09.960> happened<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> ship<00:01:10.680> with<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> black<00:01:11.610> front

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
also happened to ship with a black front

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.149 
also happened to ship with a black front
cover<00:01:12.510> around<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.170> bezel<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.890> front

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
cover around the bezel of the front

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.160 
cover around the bezel of the front
panel<00:01:14.400> unlike<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.180> silver<00:01:15.600> version<00:01:15.780> which

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
panel unlike the silver version which

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.590 
panel unlike the silver version which
shipped<00:01:16.470> with<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.220> white<00:01:17.430> front<00:01:17.790> panel<00:01:18.090> this

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
shipped with the white front panel this

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.090 
shipped with the white front panel this
leads<00:01:18.869> me<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.110> believe<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.830> color

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
leads me to believe that the color

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.160 
leads me to believe that the color
combinations<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> next<00:01:21.630> generation<00:01:22.110> of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
combinations for the next generation of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.830 
combinations for the next generation of
iPad<00:01:22.530> will<00:01:23.009> likely<00:01:23.310> follow<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:24.240> line<00:01:24.270> with

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
iPad will likely follow in line with

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.929 
iPad will likely follow in line with
that<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.320> iphone<00:01:25.710> 5s<00:01:26.159> where<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.580> will<00:01:26.729> see

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
that of the iphone 5s where you will see

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.120 
that of the iphone 5s where you will see
a<00:01:27.090> black<00:01:27.390> front<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.080> go<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> space<00:01:28.860> grey

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
a black front to go with a space grey

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.850 
a black front to go with a space grey
back<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.579> white<00:01:30.180> front<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.659> go<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.530> silver

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
back a white front to go with the silver

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.310 
back a white front to go with the silver
back<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:32.880> will<00:01:33.030> also<00:01:33.420> likely<00:01:33.689> see<00:01:34.140> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
back and then we will also likely see a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.530 
back and then we will also likely see a
gold<00:01:34.740> version<00:01:35.070> similar<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.000> what<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.240> saw<00:01:36.390> with

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
gold version similar to what we saw with

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.810 
gold version similar to what we saw with
the<00:01:36.659> iPhone<00:01:36.990> 5s<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:38.070> thing<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.460> been<00:01:38.610> so

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the iPhone 5s the thing that's been so

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.850 
the iPhone 5s the thing that's been so
popular<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.299> they<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.750> keep<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.140> stock<00:01:40.380> we

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
popular that they can keep in stock we

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.469 
popular that they can keep in stock we
have<00:01:41.009> leaked<00:01:41.400> images<00:01:41.820> pointing<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.450> that

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
have leaked images pointing in that

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.420 
have leaked images pointing in that
direction<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.649> would<00:01:43.740> only<00:01:43.860> seem<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.340> make

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
direction and it would only seem to make

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.980 
direction and it would only seem to make
sense<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.119> would<00:01:45.149> carry<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.780> same

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
sense that they would carry the same

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.139 
sense that they would carry the same
thing<00:01:46.320> through<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.250> iPad<00:01:47.610> lineup<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
thing through on the iPad lineup that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.969 
thing through on the iPad lineup that
they've<00:01:48.270> got<00:01:48.450> going<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> iphone<00:01:49.560> 5s

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
they've got going on with the iphone 5s
