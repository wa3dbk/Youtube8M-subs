00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:01.790
 Hello guys 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.190
 this demo today 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.830
 let's show 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.650
 how to use a new feature of windows server 2008 r2 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.309
 called 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.579
 do I rated myself game and infrastructure 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.809
 simply perfect 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.220
 this feature 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.339
 that unicer 2008 r2 has incorporated 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.269
 he is very interesting 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.329
 where you can do automatic sorting 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.279
 based file location 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.320
 file owner file content 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.680
 extension 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.630
 and especially what we are going to show today 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.180
 what is the classification 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.019
 fur 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.980
 the anguish of the wait a word 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.960
 here I go here they will contain 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.410
 our example 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.410
 We're going to have some pasta 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.120
 and there we would have previously 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.930
 where did I tell 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.200
 two files 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.810
 where will they be 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.449
 which contains the word 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.449
 sales 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.650
 contains the word sales here they have a file and here we have a file 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.280
 of the word 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.930
 which also contains 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.109
 the word 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:17.840
 sales 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.659
 the other files do not contain the word sales then the goal 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.640
 here is he and three more 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.760
 in his class room in his old room in the documents folder he tracks and 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.840
 selective 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.960
 he inspired those new files to be new 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.470
 into the folder 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.820
 documents 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.820
 restricted content 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.890
 the other installation step you must have the fax server 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.740
 files 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.220
 hanser verlag that already installed 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.820
 as well as the function 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.820
 File Server Resource Manager 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.840
 with this requirement already installed 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.730
 you go 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.200
 open administrative tool 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.030
 the resource manager 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.340
 of files 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.719
 Do not forget this feature only has crazy beer and 8 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.039
 harry 2 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.179
 we're going to start doing badly property ranking 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.200
 let's create a new property 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.199
 call 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.659
 classify 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.809
 sales 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:27.269
 and as a description we will put 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.660
 classify 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.149
 here you 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:33.229
 containing 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.509
 the word 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.509
 sales 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.129
 then the type of property so does not 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.029
 soon we will create a classification rule 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.539
 the name of the rule let's put 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:56.859
 sales 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.719
 and as a description 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.589
 the same discretion 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:06.129
 here we will define the scope, whatever happens here will apply 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.939
 rules 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.939
 in the drive of our computer 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.430
 in the folder 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.399
 documents 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:16.379
 in India the classification 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.480
 we have some mechanisms of classification we will leave the 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.659
 sorting content 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.419
 here the property is not 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:25.929
 classified as lace 

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:27.839
 property if 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:29.729
 and did not spare the striker 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:33.169
 in the other guide for many the final classification 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:34.920
 We'll put it here. 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.609
 or experienced 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:38.889
 the value 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:39.810
 sales 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.679
 what is the content or the word critique to search 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:46.019
 within each file 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:46.849
 OK 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.309
 what 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:52.919
 the next step is to define a file 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.559
 what it is and what it wants to happen 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.519
 so let's create a rule here 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.299
 the rule name 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.749
 sales 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:03.379
 the description 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.379
 classified pounds that contain the word comes from the sp 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.959
 look 9 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:13.269
 these files 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.619
 will make 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:17.759
 another folder 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.539
 then where will it be applied again in the der in the documents par 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:25.400
 What reaction do you want? 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.280
 or where it will expire 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.159
 Look, it's just going to expire into the unit. 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:33.080
 a lot of them got 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.080
 here we know restricted content documents 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.120
 all files containing the word sales 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.930
 they will be moved 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.930
 you are restricted 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.550
 here if you want to modify your user 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.550
 somehow and a half the eagle 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.819
 report type report 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.360
 and corruption is the important point 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.710
 where are we going to set the property ranks sales 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.830
 operator 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.010
 equal to 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.129
 and finally 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.629
 done that we will define then 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.469
 settle at what time it would be given 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:15.490
 by placing daily 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.490
 twelve hours in your time 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:20.680
 How can we not wait? 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.150
 this schedule happen we are going to do so the test is to break 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.129
 finalize in showing you the final result the machico cup task 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:37.299
 and involves what is going to happen in this classification rule that the 

00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:39.339
 people just put 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:43.939
 The goal then only remembering is the death of those files that contain the 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:45.610
 sales word 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.620
 by a pass that we left pre-defined 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.409
 it will then generate a report on our screen 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:54.610
 showing 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.909
 what he actually found see 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:58.150
 he found 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.219
 two files 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.629
 two files 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:04.369
 containing 

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:07.369
 the word comes from your report 

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:09.289
 and Brazil for profit 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.659
 So let's check what happened in this final result. 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:19.119
 they were stored in the documents folder can see that it no longer 

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:22.679
 there is more he is now in the c in the unit to be 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:28.339
 where these two files have already been 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:31.339
 the file reports that contain the word sales 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.160
 another misconception and now in 11 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.130
 which also 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.130
 contains the word sales 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.100
 With that, people finish. 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.589
 our defeat 

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:49.429
 I hope everyone enjoys
