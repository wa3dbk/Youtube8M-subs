 when we decided to make this video 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.289
 we think about things that we women

 can influence a safe direction 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.700

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.430
 pedal operation 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.239
 also has the problem with 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.399
 slippers 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.980
 besides hurting our feet have to 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.100

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.520

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.859
 but wearing closed shoes helps 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.109
 protect our feet and accident case 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.489
 cool would be done and leave a footwear

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.799
 who ever bags and bags should not 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.570
 be transported over the seat in case 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.100
 of accident they are thrown to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.100
 front causing injury 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:24.409
 so they should be placed in the 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.060
 and the bag is supposed to be 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.060
 transported on the car floor 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.149

 in case of an accident she may get hurt 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.520
 seriously for vehicles that have 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.409
 there is a safe distance between 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.229
 the steering wheel and the driver 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.619

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.630
 passengers of 40 centimeters give that 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.739
 bike back in the park helps us to

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.319
 Another problem is the size of our 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.900
 bike 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.060
 it can not handle the width of the vehicle 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.170
 when this happens the transport in the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.300
 upper cut 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.459
 but remember that there is a maximum height 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.989
