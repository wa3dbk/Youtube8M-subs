gave me a more global vision so and also
an<00:01:15.440> eventually<00:01:16.190> went<00:01:16.549> back<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.850> Japan<00:01:16.970> but

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
an eventually went back to Japan but

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.870 
an eventually went back to Japan but
then<00:01:17.750> I<00:01:17.900> went<00:01:18.170> out<00:01:18.380> to<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:18.710> US<00:01:18.950> again<00:01:19.070> for

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
then I went out to the US again for

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.580 
then I went out to the US again for
Sonic<00:01:20.240> Adventure<00:01:20.420> 2<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.049> then<00:01:21.200> again<00:01:21.440> you

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
Sonic Adventure 2 and then again you

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.760 
Sonic Adventure 2 and then again you
know<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:21.740> had<00:01:21.920> another<00:01:23.409> overseas<00:01:24.409> experience

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
know I had another overseas experience

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.620 
know I had another overseas experience
there<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:25.400> really<00:01:25.940> working<00:01:26.270> on<00:01:26.390> assigning

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
there and really working on assigning

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.260 
there and really working on assigning
titles<00:01:26.840> given<00:01:27.380> me<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.190> much<00:01:28.340> more<00:01:28.400> of<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:29.000> global

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
titles given me so much more of a global

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.690 
titles given me so much more of a global
understanding<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.469> I<00:01:30.859> think<00:01:31.070> this<00:01:31.280> is<00:01:31.340> really

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
understanding so I think this is really

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.719 
understanding so I think this is really
one<00:01:31.939> of<00:01:31.969> the<00:01:32.090> key<00:01:32.390> things<00:01:32.630> for<00:01:33.350> me<00:01:33.619> I'm<00:01:34.310> working

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
one of the key things for me I'm working

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.209 
one of the key things for me I'm working
on<00:01:37.090> so<00:01:38.090> what<00:01:38.420> it's<00:01:38.570> been<00:01:38.930> like<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.469> sort<00:01:39.740> of<00:01:39.799> go

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
on so what it's been like to sort of go

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.130 
on so what it's been like to sort of go
through<00:01:40.250> all<00:01:40.850> of<00:01:40.909> Sonic's<00:01:41.180> history<00:01:41.719> to<00:01:41.869> find

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
through all of Sonic's history to find

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.160 
through all of Sonic's history to find
the<00:01:42.409> best<00:01:42.859> moments<00:01:43.490> in<00:01:43.659> that<00:01:44.659> you<00:01:44.810> wanted<00:01:45.109> to

the best moments in that you wanted to

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.980 
the best moments in that you wanted to
bring<00:01:45.530> back<00:01:45.770> in<00:01:46.039> doing<00:01:46.250> some<00:01:46.460> generations<00:01:47.060> so

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
bring back in doing some generations so

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.099 
bring back in doing some generations so

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
Sonic in some way and they have played

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.890 
Sonic in some way and they have played
one<00:02:43.130> of<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.310> various<00:02:43.700> level<00:02:44.030> games<00:02:44.599> that<00:02:44.780> we

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900

with<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:53.060> levels<00:02:53.569> because<00:02:54.200> they<00:02:54.440> would<00:02:54.620> have

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
with the levels because they would have

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.410

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
to immediately identify this as being

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.150 
to immediately identify this as being
the<00:03:20.480> sonic<00:03:20.810> game<00:03:20.989> they<00:03:21.170> remember<00:03:21.620> but

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
the sonic game they remember but

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160 
the sonic game they remember but
completely<00:03:22.940> brought<00:03:23.269> up<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.630> date<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:23.989> we've

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
completely brought up to date and we've

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.199 
completely brought up to date and we've
been<00:03:24.470> able<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.860> encapsulate<00:03:25.280> all<00:03:25.819> of<00:03:26.060> these

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
been able to encapsulate all of these

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.150 
been able to encapsulate all of these
elements<00:03:26.450> into<00:03:27.110> one<00:03:27.319> title<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:27.830> think<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.100> is

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
elements into one title I think this is

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.559 
elements into one title I think this is
one<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.610> great<00:03:28.790> features<00:03:28.819> of<00:03:29.209> Sonic

next 20 years for Sonic oh no masonic 10
sonic<00:06:02.279> started<00:06:02.940> as<00:06:03.150> an<00:06:03.330> action<00:06:03.690> game<00:06:03.900> look<00:06:04.259> at

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 
sonic started as an action game look at

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.219 
sonic started as an action game look at
20<00:06:04.860> years<00:06:04.949> ago<00:06:05.279> and<00:06:05.909> we<00:06:06.389> will<00:06:06.539> continue<00:06:07.080> to

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
20 years ago and we will continue to

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:08.990 
20 years ago and we will continue to
focus<00:06:07.409> on<00:06:07.830> creating<00:06:08.039> the<00:06:08.430> best<00:06:08.460> possible

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
focus on creating the best possible

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.529 
focus on creating the best possible
action<00:06:09.870> games<00:06:10.080> but<00:06:10.740> we<00:06:10.889> want<00:06:11.099> to<00:06:11.219> reach<00:06:11.539> the

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
action games but we want to reach the

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.559 
action games but we want to reach the
widest<00:06:12.960> possible<00:06:13.169> audience<00:06:13.560> so<00:06:14.339> you<00:06:15.000> know<00:06:15.120> we

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:15.569 
widest possible audience so you know we

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:17.689 
widest possible audience so you know we
will<00:06:15.719> probably<00:06:16.050> see<00:06:16.319> sonic<00:06:16.740> going<00:06:17.219> into<00:06:17.490> other

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
will probably see sonic going into other

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.029 
will probably see sonic going into other
genres<00:06:17.789> of<00:06:18.180> games<00:06:18.569> and<00:06:19.139> also<00:06:19.620> seeing

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
genres of games and also seeing

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.409 
genres of games and also seeing
something<00:06:20.370> in<00:06:20.580> different<00:06:20.940> media<00:06:21.240> immediately

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
something in different media immediately

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.219 
something in different media immediately
