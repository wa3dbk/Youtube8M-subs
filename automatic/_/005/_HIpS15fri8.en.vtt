00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
to look at in this clip is a very unique

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.639 
to look at in this clip is a very unique
style<00:00:05.430> it's<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.850> jazz<00:00:06.210> style<00:00:06.660> we're<00:00:07.470> going<00:00:07.589> to

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649

style it's the jazz style we're going to
look<00:00:07.710> at<00:00:07.859> different<00:00:08.130> patterns<00:00:08.550> but<00:00:09.059> mainly

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
look at different patterns but mainly

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.810 
look at different patterns but mainly
the<00:00:10.410> thing<00:00:10.559> that<00:00:10.710> sets<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.070> apart<00:00:11.130> from<00:00:11.580> most

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
the thing that sets it apart from most

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.940 
the thing that sets it apart from most
of<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.210> other<00:00:12.360> styles<00:00:13.019> we've<00:00:13.320> we've<00:00:13.710> looked

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
of the other styles we've we've looked

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.379 
of the other styles we've we've looked
at<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.160> other<00:00:14.340> Clips<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.820> can<00:00:14.940> go<00:00:15.030> check<00:00:15.059> them

you<00:00:28.650> can<00:00:28.830> speed<00:00:29.160> up<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.760> two<00:00:29.939> three<00:00:30.210> but

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
you can speed up that one two three but

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.410 
you can speed up that one two three but
it's<00:00:30.660> all<00:00:30.929> pretty<00:00:31.650> much<00:00:31.859> based<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.399> three<00:00:32.790> so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
call them triplet beats so speed up the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.980 
call them triplet beats so speed up the
tempo<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.820> you've<00:01:09.060> got<00:01:09.240> different<00:01:09.450> patterns

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990

that<00:01:10.590> pattern<00:01:11.400> there's<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.939> big<00:01:12.150> joke<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.540> just
