you

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.139 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.570 

talking<00:00:12.139> about<00:00:12.260> shoe<00:00:12.620> positioning<00:00:13.280> today

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
talking about shoe positioning today

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.990 
talking about shoe positioning today
we're<00:00:14.570> in<00:00:14.930> the<00:00:15.650> first<00:00:16.039> week<00:00:16.340> of<00:00:16.490> June<00:00:16.730> actually

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
we're in the first week of June actually

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.980 
we're in the first week of June actually
it's<00:00:17.359> June<00:00:17.660> 8th<00:00:17.930> today<00:00:18.350> and<00:00:19.269> see<00:00:20.269> we've<00:00:20.420> got<00:00:20.600> a

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
it's June 8th today and see we've got a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.419 
it's June 8th today and see we've got a
fairly<00:00:21.680> high<00:00:21.949> canopy<00:00:22.810> and<00:00:23.810> what<00:00:24.199> we're<00:00:24.439> doing

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:25.429 
fairly high canopy and what we're doing

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.009 
fairly high canopy and what we're doing
in<00:00:25.550> this<00:00:25.699> vineyard<00:00:26.089> is<00:00:26.329> what's<00:00:26.659> called<00:00:26.869> a

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
in this vineyard is what's called a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.560 
in this vineyard is what's called a
vertical<00:00:27.619> chute<00:00:27.890> position<00:00:28.429> system<00:00:28.970> or<00:00:29.119> to

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
vertical chute position system or to

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.689 
vertical chute position system or to
shorten<00:00:29.929> it<00:00:30.019> up<00:00:30.169> the<00:00:30.589> acronym<00:00:31.099> would<00:00:31.249> be<00:00:31.429> the

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
shorten it up the acronym would be the

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.229 
shorten it up the acronym would be the
VSP<00:00:32.239> system<00:00:33.160> we've<00:00:34.160> got<00:00:34.370> three<00:00:34.760> pairs<00:00:35.090> of

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
VSP system we've got three pairs of

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.920 
VSP system we've got three pairs of
wires<00:00:35.600> that<00:00:36.170> we're<00:00:36.380> using<00:00:36.649> to<00:00:37.540> maintain<00:00:38.540> our

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
wires that we're using to maintain our

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.910 
wires that we're using to maintain our
growth<00:00:39.850> in<00:00:40.850> a<00:00:41.030> vertical<00:00:41.330> fashion<00:00:41.710> thus<00:00:42.710> the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
growth in a vertical fashion thus the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.180 
growth in a vertical fashion thus the
name<00:00:43.100> for<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.880> trellis<00:00:44.270> system<00:00:44.630> and<00:00:45.190> we're

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
name for the trellis system and we're

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.160 
name for the trellis system and we're
using<00:00:46.430> these<00:00:46.790> three<00:00:47.090> pairs<00:00:47.420> of<00:00:47.540> wires<00:00:47.840> and

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
using these three pairs of wires and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.450 
using these three pairs of wires and
essentially<00:00:48.710> what<00:00:48.860> we're<00:00:49.010> doing<00:00:49.040> is

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
essentially what we're doing is

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.130 
essentially what we're doing is
leapfrogging<00:00:50.330> the<00:00:50.630> wires<00:00:50.840> so<00:00:51.230> after<00:00:52.160> we<00:00:52.310> prune

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
leapfrogging the wires so after we prune

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.510 
leapfrogging the wires so after we prune
everything<00:00:54.140> that<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.740> vine<00:00:54.920> has<00:00:55.130> to<00:00:55.280> deal

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
everything that the vine has to deal

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.570 
everything that the vine has to deal
with<00:00:55.550> is<00:00:55.970> on<00:00:56.180> this<00:00:56.360> wire<00:00:56.690> or<00:00:57.020> below<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:58.220> we<00:00:58.250> move

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
with is on this wire or below so we move

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.540 
with is on this wire or below so we move
the<00:00:58.730> first<00:00:58.940> pair<00:00:59.270> of<00:00:59.300> wire<00:00:59.600> down<00:01:00.400> below<00:01:01.400> the

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
the first pair of wire down below the

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.329 
the first pair of wire down below the
irrigation<00:01:02.000> hose<00:01:02.450> and<00:01:02.780> as<00:01:03.380> the<00:01:03.620> plant<00:01:03.890> starts

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
irrigation hose and as the plant starts

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.270 
irrigation hose and as the plant starts
growing<00:01:04.610> we<00:01:05.299> move<00:01:05.570> that<00:01:05.930> wire<00:01:06.229> into<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.040> first

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
growing we move that wire into the first

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.899 
growing we move that wire into the first
notch<00:01:07.549> here<00:01:08.200> then<00:01:09.200> we<00:01:09.860> move<00:01:10.070> that<00:01:10.250> wire<00:01:10.520> into

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
notch here then we move that wire into

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.640 
notch here then we move that wire into
the<00:01:10.940> second<00:01:11.390> notch<00:01:11.570> as<00:01:11.870> the<00:01:12.020> plant<00:01:12.290> continues

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
the second notch as the plant continues

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.860 
the second notch as the plant continues
to<00:01:12.980> grow<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:13.430> we<00:01:13.940> move<00:01:14.120> the<00:01:14.270> second<00:01:14.630> pair<00:01:14.840> of

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
to grow and we move the second pair of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.560 
to grow and we move the second pair of
wires<00:01:15.200> down<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.430> first<00:01:16.670> notch<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.300> plant

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
wires down to the first notch the plant

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.140 
wires down to the first notch the plant
continues<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.320> grow<00:01:18.560> then<00:01:19.370> we<00:01:19.580> move<00:01:19.790> the

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
continues to grow then we move the

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.570 
continues to grow then we move the
second<00:01:20.930> pair<00:01:21.110> of<00:01:21.200> wires<00:01:21.440> into<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:21.979> third

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
second pair of wires into the third

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.000 
second pair of wires into the third
notch<00:01:22.820> then<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.810> fourth<00:01:24.050> notch<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:24.620> then<00:01:24.890> the

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
notch then the fourth notch and then the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.170 
notch then the fourth notch and then the
top<00:01:25.250> wire<00:01:25.520> comes<00:01:25.970> down<00:01:26.240> into<00:01:27.110> this<00:01:27.229> position

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
top wire comes down into this position

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.100 
top wire comes down into this position
ultimately<00:01:29.229> we'll<00:01:30.229> have<00:01:30.400> this<00:01:31.400> wire<00:01:31.760> and<00:01:32.120> this

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
ultimately we'll have this wire and this

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.440 
ultimately we'll have this wire and this
wire<00:01:33.170> at<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.830> same<00:01:34.070> time<00:01:34.400> we'll<00:01:34.850> walk<00:01:35.090> through

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
wire at the same time we'll walk through

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.370 
wire at the same time we'll walk through
the<00:01:36.140> rows<00:01:36.380> with<00:01:36.860> two<00:01:37.130> pairs<00:01:37.430> of<00:01:37.610> wires<00:01:38.380> raising

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
the rows with two pairs of wires raising

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.990 
the rows with two pairs of wires raising
that<00:01:39.530> wire<00:01:39.860> up<00:01:39.890> into<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.729> top<00:01:41.659> position<00:01:42.260> and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
that wire up into the top position and

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.280 
that wire up into the top position and
trapping<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.090> foliage<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:44.630> between<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.110> wire

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
trapping the foliage in between the wire

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:56.130 
trapping the foliage in between the wire
as<00:01:45.560> we<00:01:45.740> go

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.910 

just<00:01:56.800> like<00:01:57.010> that<00:01:57.840> after<00:01:58.840> we've<00:01:59.020> moved<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.620> the

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
just like that after we've moved the the

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.120 
just like that after we've moved the the
wires<00:02:00.160> into<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:01.030> next<00:02:01.600> position<00:02:01.900> we<00:02:02.740> actually

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
wires into the next position we actually

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.790 
wires into the next position we actually
go<00:02:03.310> through<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.850> we<00:02:03.910> separate<00:02:04.660> all<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.680> the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
go through and we separate all of the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.620 
go through and we separate all of the
shoots<00:02:06.100> making<00:02:06.640> sure<00:02:06.820> that<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.180> shoots<00:02:07.450> are

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
shoots making sure that the shoots are

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.550 
shoots making sure that the shoots are
in<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.560> proper<00:02:09.009> position<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:10.410> nothing<00:02:11.410> is

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
in the proper position and nothing is

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.540 
in the proper position and nothing is
criss<00:02:11.830> crossing<00:02:12.160> in<00:02:12.640> in<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.900> canopy<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.740> we

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
criss crossing in in the canopy and we

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.400 
criss crossing in in the canopy and we
think<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:15.910> is<00:02:15.970> extremely<00:02:16.450> important<00:02:17.290> for

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
think this is extremely important for

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.260 
think this is extremely important for
getting<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.800> proper<00:02:18.190> amount<00:02:18.490> of<00:02:18.550> sunlight<00:02:19.030> on

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
getting the proper amount of sunlight on

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.680 
getting the proper amount of sunlight on
each<00:02:19.690> leaf<00:02:20.080> surface<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:21.130> every<00:02:21.490> chute<00:02:21.760> being

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
each leaf surface of every chute being

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.510 
each leaf surface of every chute being
that<00:02:22.930> we're<00:02:23.080> trying<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.470> ripen<00:02:23.709> up<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.340> two

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
that we're trying to ripen up to two

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.230 
that we're trying to ripen up to two
clusters<00:02:25.060> on<00:02:25.270> that<00:02:25.480> chute<00:02:25.780> if<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.650> leaves<00:02:26.920> are

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
clusters on that chute if the leaves are

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.880 
clusters on that chute if the leaves are
matted<00:02:28.240> in<00:02:28.390> between<00:02:28.840> other<00:02:29.080> shoots<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.740> so

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
matted in between other shoots and so

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.860

vine that branches out and the fruit
actually<00:02:50.140> comes<00:02:50.680> off<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:50.920> we<00:02:51.670> need<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:51.970> get<00:02:52.120> the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
actually comes off of we need to get the

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.660 
actually comes off of we need to get the
proper<00:02:52.660> amount<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:53.020> sunlight<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:54.310> each<00:02:54.459> of

proper amount of sunlight on to each of
these<00:02:54.820> buds<00:02:55.150> because<00:02:55.989> that<00:02:56.200> will<00:02:56.380> be<00:02:56.530> where

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
these buds because that will be where

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.550 
these buds because that will be where
our<00:02:56.770> fruit<00:02:57.190> comes<00:02:57.489> from<00:02:57.760> for<00:02:58.030> next<00:02:58.270> year<00:02:58.560> so

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
our fruit comes from for next year so

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.560 
our fruit comes from for next year so
that's<00:03:00.340> what's<00:03:00.670> going<00:03:00.940> on<00:03:01.060> in<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.330> vineyard

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
that's what's going on in the vineyard

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.959 
that's what's going on in the vineyard
right<00:03:01.780> now
