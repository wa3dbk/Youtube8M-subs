to<00:02:48.290> three<00:02:48.469> times<00:02:48.620> generally<00:02:49.189> in<00:02:49.249> a<00:02:49.310> tool<00:02:49.489> and

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
to three times generally in a tool and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.429 
to three times generally in a tool and
we<00:02:49.790> got<00:02:49.939> those<00:02:50.150> three<00:02:50.450> traits<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:50.959> we<00:02:51.139> can

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:51.439 
we got those three traits so we can

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.649 
we got those three traits so we can
mitigate<00:02:51.709> each<00:02:52.219> one<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:52.879> get<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.239> range<00:02:53.480> and

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
mitigate each one and get that range and

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.539 
mitigate each one and get that range and
control<00:02:54.019> everything<00:02:54.319> and<00:02:54.680> get<00:02:55.069> in<00:02:55.189> heels<00:02:55.400> so

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
control everything and get in heels so

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:56.770 
control everything and get in heels so
if<00:02:55.639> they're<00:02:55.790> in<00:02:55.819> close<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.090> they<00:02:56.329> silence<00:02:56.689> you
