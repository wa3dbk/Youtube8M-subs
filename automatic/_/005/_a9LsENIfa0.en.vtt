trying to upload as much as possible but

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.420 
trying to upload as much as possible but
sometimes<00:05:25.570> life<00:05:26.140> just<00:05:26.169> gets<00:05:26.590> in<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:26.860> way<00:05:27.010> but

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
sometimes life just gets in the way but

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.130 
sometimes life just gets in the way but
really<00:05:27.730> though<00:05:27.880> parts<00:05:28.300> of<00:05:28.450> this<00:05:28.570> past<00:05:28.840> month

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
really though parts of this past month

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.620 
really though parts of this past month
were<00:05:29.410> just<00:05:29.680> off<00:05:29.860> for<00:05:30.580> me<00:05:30.700> I<00:05:30.730> was<00:05:31.000> feeling<00:05:31.360> weird
