00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.890
 Y 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:37.050
 and the weekly snapshot review 12w 41 that 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.320
 I hope it's a great 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.030
 snapshot so let's review it what 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.670
 first that observed guys has been that 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.390
 when I give it to f 3 I can see the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.629
 cardinal points west north east and south 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.140
 and another of the things is that when I 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.489
 I give to efe 3 the diagram does not appear 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.769
 from right 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.100
 I have to give the siff efe 3 so that 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.440
 I see the truth is one thing that I 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.240
 they have liked it so much as a 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.700
 box of this order and I with a change 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.030
 quite curious is that when we 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.280
 We press f 3 h and now we put 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.590
 on top of an item appears the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.659
 durability as you see there was or two 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.430
 taps a pig and now I have 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.770
 less durability in this sword now 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.290
 was another and has been reduced by one point 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.490
 to remove it we simply return to efe 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.040
 3 h 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.090
 here is everything normal we have a new 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:38.170
 block guys and it's really fascinating 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.720
 is the anvil and does not appear in the villas 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.149
 as you will see, he wanted to make us understand in 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.890
 the official page the character is the 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.570
 next three metal blocks in the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.820
 top three metal blocks in 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.640
 the bottom and a nice ingot 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.679
 iron in the middle part up 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.869
 fifty-five iron blocks and 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.479
 it has fascinating properties so 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.330
 let's see them we have here our 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.759
 individual and I will teach you the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.030
 characteristics of the good anvil is 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.840
 illuminate the sand as it can fall 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.900
 as you are watching but it does not suffocate but 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.030
 however it does damage by fall then 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.250
 the damage it causes is from a heart and 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.730
 medium for each block then one and 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.940
 half three four and a half these would be 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.769
 six seven and a half nine and if you threw a 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.750
 anvil from here should remove ten 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.160
 hearts and a half that is hard norm and 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.790
 undefended 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.090
 and something very curious is that the armor and 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.490
 the sword defense takes effect when 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.980
 damage therefore now galindo a 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:48.040
 anvil from the same height does not kill me 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.360
 climbing up guys we meet 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.370
 at height 200 and what does this mean 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.620
 well, down there we have a 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.990
 ant that is going to be crushed by a 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.210
 anvil but it has diamond armor and 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.610
 is going to defend himself with a sword so 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.470
 both this can retain the damage by 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.230
 crush so let's see what 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.160
 fell a fall that is worth 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.720
 falling down 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.520
 OK OK OK let's see it going 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.080
 to see it so perfect and it does not kill is is 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.780
 amazing 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.540
 let's continue with the physical properties of 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.760
 the anvils we can not move it with 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.150
 prince tormes this is something they have done 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.880
 on purpose so that they do not generate boost 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.790
 of duplication the anvils go through 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.950
 three phases which is new which is 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.370
 a little broken and the one that is very broken 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.150
 can be chopped with any wood peak 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.880
 gold diamond metal stone with any 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.420
 peak and tell you that if we have an anvil 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.210
 very damaged and we throw it is going to generate 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.670
 as if it were a new one is a bug is 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.740
 broken now it's new it's broken now 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.660
 is new the truth is that it is a block 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.230
 with very very physical properties 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.390
 interesting that have changed a little thing 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.209
 of the pri with block is that when we give 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.010
 a donation and we choose an effect of 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.650
 potion now what would be the 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.350
 particles and spirals that 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.750
 they are starting to come out they are very much 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.269
 more than clouds I do not know if you can 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.740
 appreciate now they hardly notice each other but 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.840
 when we see a potion 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.480
 normal 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.030
 or better than mine 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.510
 new little thing is that when we 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.430
 we went up five levels now sounds the 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.620
 Experience music as we go to 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.250
 check I have level 9 therefore 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.100
 when you reach level 10 sound is very 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.930
 Little girl, the truth is something that I like 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.930
 quite and now all the time 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.250
 they have added a couple of new anecdotes 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.979
 for the block that would affect spanair 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.950
 to our dear explosive friends 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:05.710
 the one clippers would be the radius of 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:09.160
 explosion that would be written explosion 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.460
 radios and the other would be the time of 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.310
 detonation of a crime that would be feels 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.100
 good this for those who use programs 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.500
 external for block editing 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.080
 partners is very well for what 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.270
 really serves an anvil first 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.360
 we need to activate it with a cane 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:32.390
 fish so perfect by omitting this part 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.700
 allows us to mix enchantments 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.860
 regenerate tools with them 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.320
 spells good is something really 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.620
 pimp is still here I have power 4 more power 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:46.790
 4 equal to 5 power with 7 levels alone and 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:49.910
 I can also put the arc of the ritz mc 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.730
 I can do this also with items in 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.310
 name is worth 5 levels and name one 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.560
 tool is worth me 15 levels too 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.140
 I'm going to do it with blocks so here 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.500
 that I pick up my bow and also that you see 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.690
 that I can get efficiency 5 yes 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.270
 sir is something that will be fascinating 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.150
 and well I can also mix by 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.640
 example hit 5 with looks in the USA not 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.460
 it would cost me 21 levels and now I can 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.320
 make a second enchantment me 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.440
 like 30 levels the truth is that 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.150
 this sometimes is not something that can be 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.340
 start doing and doing and doing and 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.790
 regenerate and generate since you do not always 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.080
 it goes well for example I can not put together 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.000
 enchantments that have never been able 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.430
 put together by how can it be if you're with 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.740
 fortune offering to tropo 24 with 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.630
 hit or 5 and you know that the new 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.970
 enchantments that can be obtained 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.410
 they are perdition is another 25 that was already 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.450
 but it was like very complicated to obtain 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.730
 hit 5 that was already but that was very 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.190
 complicated to have and hold 5 that only 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:52.580
 I could get on the golden swords the 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:55.280
 truth is something fascinating and that you know 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.140
 that can not be mixed and we have to 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.310
 have been modified for example these 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:03.980
 shurikens for example like that and although we 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:07.640
 it would cost us 52 levels 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:12.290
 mixing them does not leave us I hope that you 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:14.660
 I really liked this review and I 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.820
 It seems to me that I want to give something to 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:20.840
 see to see what is 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:24.780
 There is a display of colors I hope that you 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:28.740
 I really liked this review 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:33.199
 or this one let's see 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.199
 but this is not cauliflower I
