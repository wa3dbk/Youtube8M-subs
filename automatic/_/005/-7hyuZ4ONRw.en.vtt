controversial for a lot of people is

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.160 
controversial for a lot of people is
BCAAs<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> must<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.370> would<00:00:35.579> say<00:00:35.760> 99%<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.690> time<00:00:36.870> be

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
BCAAs a must I would say 99% of time be

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.590 
BCAAs a must I would say 99% of time be
CAS<00:00:37.500> or<00:00:37.739> not<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> must<00:00:38.460> if<00:00:38.730> you're<00:00:39.210> looking<00:00:39.540> to
