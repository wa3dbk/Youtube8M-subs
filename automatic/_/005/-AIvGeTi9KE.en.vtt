all this we were things and stuff I

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.759

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
information that I've found and the best

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.040 
information that I've found and the best
way<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.849> as<00:00:27.000> well<00:00:27.180> as<00:00:27.240> you'll<00:00:27.539> explain<00:00:27.990> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
way to do it as well as you'll explain a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.960 
way to do it as well as you'll explain a
little<00:00:28.470> bit<00:00:28.710> more<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.550> different<00:00:29.849> parts

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
little bit more on the different parts

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.880 
little bit more on the different parts
because<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.330> did<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.689> do<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:30.929> very<00:00:31.170> well<00:00:31.590> last

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
because I did not do that very well last

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.370 
because I did not do that very well last
time<00:00:32.219> anyways<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.360> strategy<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.140> basically

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
time anyways this strategy is basically

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.319 
time anyways this strategy is basically
the<00:00:34.770> same<00:00:35.040> as<00:00:35.219> last<00:00:35.370> time<00:00:35.550> all<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.210> do

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the same as last time all you have to do

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.720 
the same as last time all you have to do
is<00:00:36.480> put<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.989> game<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.380> casual<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.550> know<00:00:38.610> a

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
is put the game on casual and I know a

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.280 
is put the game on casual and I know a
lot<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.210> guys<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.600> comments<00:00:39.780> say<00:00:40.050> put

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
lot of you guys in the comments say put

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.290 
lot of you guys in the comments say put
it<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.440> hardcore<00:00:40.770> or<00:00:41.160> add<00:00:41.309> some<00:00:41.610> relics<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.180> it

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
it on hardcore or add some relics to it

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.690 
it on hardcore or add some relics to it
and<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.410> true<00:00:43.739> no<00:00:44.250> way<00:00:44.460> does

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
and this is just not true no way does

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.270 
and this is just not true no way does
putting<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.420> hard<00:00:45.719> or<00:00:46.020> adding<00:00:46.469> any<00:00:46.649> difficulty

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
putting on hard or adding any difficulty

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.490 
putting on hard or adding any difficulty
modifiers<00:00:47.789> change<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.629> amount<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.050> teeth<00:00:49.289> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
modifiers change the amount of teeth it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.069 
modifiers change the amount of teeth it
required<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.370> getting<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> kills<00:00:51.210> for<00:00:51.750> teeth

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
required for getting the kills for teeth

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
required for getting the kills for teeth
the<00:00:52.260> strategy<00:00:52.739> works<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> fact<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:53.969> you

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the strategy works on the fact that you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.880 
the strategy works on the fact that you
get<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.780> certain<00:00:55.260> amount<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.500> kills<00:00:55.710> which

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
get a certain amount of kills which

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.709 
get a certain amount of kills which
there's<00:00:56.070> about<00:00:56.280> 600<00:00:56.670> I'm<00:00:57.030> pretty<00:00:57.329> sure<00:00:57.690> of

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
there's about 600 I'm pretty sure of

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.779 
there's about 600 I'm pretty sure of
that<00:00:57.899> by<00:00:58.350> now<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.859> tested<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.340> many<00:00:59.550> times

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
that by now I have tested as many times

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.540 
that by now I have tested as many times
every<00:01:00.059> 600<00:01:01.020> kills<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.590> get<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> teeth<00:01:02.160> tooth

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
every 600 kills you get a teeth tooth

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.390 
every 600 kills you get a teeth tooth
even<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.110> how<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.530> strategy<00:01:05.159> works

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
even and this is how this strategy works

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.560 
even and this is how this strategy works
hardcore<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.150> relics<00:01:06.510> do<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.990> affect<00:01:07.740> this

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
hardcore and relics do not affect this

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.060 
hardcore and relics do not affect this
anyways<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> loadout<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.799> ultimate

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
anyways for the loadout in this ultimate

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.190 
anyways for the loadout in this ultimate
kamek<00:01:11.610> strategy<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> most<00:01:12.420> important<00:01:12.990> part

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
kamek strategy the most important part

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.350 
kamek strategy the most important part
is<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.460> sentry<00:01:14.460> gun<00:01:14.490> because<00:01:15.150> you're<00:01:15.270> gonna

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
is the sentry gun because you're gonna

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.570 
is the sentry gun because you're gonna
be<00:01:15.509> using<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.960> thing<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.560> basically<00:01:16.830> do<00:01:17.310> most

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
be using this thing to basically do most

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.340 
be using this thing to basically do most
of<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> work<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> shoot

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
of the work for you and you get to shoot

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.719 
of the work for you and you get to shoot
every<00:01:19.560> once<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.860> while<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.250> next<00:01:20.369> thing<00:01:20.610> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
every once in a while the next thing I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.060 
every once in a while the next thing I
say<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.119> bring<00:01:21.360> normal<00:01:22.110> ammunition<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:23.040> can

bring specialty ammo but in all honesty

bring specialty ammo but in all honesty
these<00:01:25.650> guys<00:01:25.890> still<00:01:26.280> die<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:27.090> bullets<00:01:27.390> every

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
these guys still die to bullets every

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.390 
these guys still die to bullets every
time<00:01:27.930> no<00:01:28.200> matter<00:01:28.380> what<00:01:28.590> ammo<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.159> on

to<00:01:33.450> bring<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.840> new<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.470> because<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.799> can

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
to bring the new on but because you can

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.219 
to bring the new on but because you can
get<00:01:35.070> 70<00:01:35.610> percent<00:01:36.000> with<00:01:36.240> one<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> upgrades

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
get 70 percent with one of the upgrades

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.410 
get 70 percent with one of the upgrades
on<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.250> last<00:01:38.460> thing<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.820> say<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.210> bring

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
on it and the last thing I say is bring

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.940 
on it and the last thing I say is bring
weapon<00:01:39.780> specialist<00:01:40.200> because<00:01:40.320> everything

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
weapon specialist because everything

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.069 
weapon specialist because everything
else<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.310> really<00:01:41.939> pretty<00:01:42.119> useless<00:01:42.600> at<00:01:42.899> that

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
else is really pretty useless at that

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.319 
else is really pretty useless at that
point<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:44.100> really<00:01:44.430> not<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.700> worth<00:01:45.119> it

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
point and it's really not that worth it

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.330 
point and it's really not that worth it
everything<00:01:46.020> else<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.409> be<00:01:46.560> left<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.310> I

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
everything else can be left up to you I

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.710 
everything else can be left up to you I
you<00:01:47.729> don't<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.119> use<00:01:48.270> any<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> other

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
you don't really use any of the other

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.630 
you don't really use any of the other
ones<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> recommend<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:49.770> ride<00:01:50.100> shields<00:01:50.490> so

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
ones so I recommend just ride shields so

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.010 
ones so I recommend just ride shields so
you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.000> put<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.299> your<00:01:51.450> back<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.869> case

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
you can just put on your back in case

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.539 
you can just put on your back in case
you<00:01:52.259> want<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> sit<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.159> corner<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.490> a

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
you want to sit in the corner for a

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.760 
you want to sit in the corner for a
while<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.960> everything<00:01:54.960> else<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.320> really

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
while and everything else is just really

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.469 
while and everything else is just really
up<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.430> that's<00:01:56.640> all<00:01:56.850> there<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.360> it

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
up to you and that's all there is to it

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.560 
up to you and that's all there is to it
so<00:01:57.899> basically<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.890> strategy<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.880> gonna<00:02:00.479> be

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
so basically this strategy is gonna be

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.209 
so basically this strategy is gonna be
on<00:02:00.689> point<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.140> contact<00:02:01.649> all<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.100> do

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
on point of contact all you have to do

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.700 
on point of contact all you have to do
is<00:02:02.369> destroy<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.210> first<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.869> three<00:02:04.229> hides<00:02:04.500> that

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
is destroy the first of three hides that

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.530 
is destroy the first of three hides that
is<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.369> spawn<00:02:05.759> at<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.090> two

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
is the one that you spawn at and two

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.229 
is the one that you spawn at and two
more<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.770> strategy<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.670> basically

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
more on this strategy this basically

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.119 
more on this strategy this basically
works<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> fact<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.110> if<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.440> destroy

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
works on the fact that if you destroy

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.610 
works on the fact that if you destroy
that<00:02:11.370> last<00:02:11.700> time<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.150> fourth<00:02:12.450> hide<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.319> have

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
that last time that fourth hide you have

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.619 
that last time that fourth hide you have
the<00:02:14.220> helicopter<00:02:14.760> will<00:02:14.909> arrive<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
the helicopter will arrive and the

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.449 
the helicopter will arrive and the
barrier<00:02:15.959> hype<00:02:16.170> will<00:02:16.560> start<00:02:16.860> getting<00:02:17.010> attacked

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
barrier hype will start getting attacked

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.979 
barrier hype will start getting attacked
when<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.849> starts<00:02:18.120> getting<00:02:18.360> attacked<00:02:18.599> the

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
when that starts getting attacked the

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.630 
when that starts getting attacked the
Scorpions<00:02:19.560> will<00:02:19.620> start<00:02:19.920> spawning<00:02:20.129> and<00:02:20.459> of

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
Scorpions will start spawning and of

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.910 
Scorpions will start spawning and of
course<00:02:20.909> one<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.390> goes<00:02:21.659> down<00:02:21.959> they<00:02:22.470> have<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
course one that goes down they have the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.160 
course one that goes down they have the
potential<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.760> spawning<00:02:24.150> rhinos<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:24.930> what<00:02:25.080> you

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
potential of spawning rhinos so what you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.770 
potential of spawning rhinos so what you
want<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.409> do<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.620> just<00:02:25.769> leave<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.190> hive<00:02:26.459> and

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
want to do is just leave that hive and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.729 
want to do is just leave that hive and
basically<00:02:27.780> work<00:02:28.049> on<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> fact<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
basically work on the fact that the

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.740 
basically work on the fact that the
aliens<00:02:29.400> were<00:02:29.459> continued<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.150> spawn<00:02:30.390> really

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
aliens were continued to spawn really

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.750 
aliens were continued to spawn really
really<00:02:30.959> fast<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.349> just<00:02:31.950> keep<00:02:32.159> coming<00:02:32.459> at<00:02:32.579> you

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
really fast and just keep coming at you

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.809 
really fast and just keep coming at you
as<00:02:32.970> much<00:02:33.629> as<00:02:33.870> physically<00:02:34.290> possible<00:02:34.319> and<00:02:34.890> you

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
as much as physically possible and you

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.460 
as much as physically possible and you
basically<00:02:36.000> just<00:02:36.269> sit<00:02:36.599> here<00:02:36.840> for<00:02:37.049> hours<00:02:37.260> and

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
basically just sit here for hours and

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.319 
basically just sit here for hours and
hours<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.950> end<00:02:38.190> getting<00:02:38.400> teeth<00:02:38.700> tooth<00:02:39.120> after

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
hours on end getting teeth tooth after

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.809 
hours on end getting teeth tooth after
tooth<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.440> when<00:02:40.799> you've<00:02:40.980> actually<00:02:41.220> destroyed

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
tooth so when you've actually destroyed

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.729 
tooth so when you've actually destroyed
all<00:02:42.090> three<00:02:42.360> hives<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.690> should<00:02:43.079> have<00:02:43.290> six

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
all three hives you should have six

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.410 
all three hives you should have six
points<00:02:44.099> by<00:02:44.220> then<00:02:44.430> or<00:02:44.670> if<00:02:44.849> you're<00:02:45.000> starting

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
points by then or if you're starting

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.509 
points by then or if you're starting
with<00:02:45.450> an<00:02:45.660> extra<00:02:45.989> skill<00:02:46.200> point<00:02:46.410> seven<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.310> my

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
with an extra skill point seven in my

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.550 
with an extra skill point seven in my
case<00:02:47.760> what<00:02:48.299> you<00:02:48.420> want<00:02:48.569> to<00:02:48.660> do<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:48.930> upgrade<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
case what you want to do is upgrade the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.619 
case what you want to do is upgrade the
turret<00:02:49.980> three<00:02:50.310> times<00:02:50.579> that's<00:02:50.879> one<00:02:51.150> point<00:02:51.359> one

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
turret three times that's one point one

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.449 
turret three times that's one point one
point<00:02:51.870> then<00:02:52.140> two<00:02:52.379> points<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.829> get<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.010> plus

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
point then two points to get the plus

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.330 
point then two points to get the plus
30%<00:02:53.879> ammo<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.319> armor-piercing<00:02:55.709> rounds

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
30% ammo and the armor-piercing rounds

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.610 
30% ammo and the armor-piercing rounds
and<00:02:56.459> then<00:02:56.910> put<00:02:57.180> your<00:02:57.390> last<00:02:57.690> two<00:02:57.930> points<00:02:58.079> in<00:02:58.349> one

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
and then put your last two points in one

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.500 
and then put your last two points in one
in<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.890> ammunition<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.609> one<00:02:59.849> in<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.209> weapon

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
in the ammunition and one in the weapon

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.970 
in the ammunition and one in the weapon
specials<00:03:00.930> class<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.409> if<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.680> have<00:03:01.829> that

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
specials class and if you have that

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.770 
specials class and if you have that
seventh<00:03:02.459> point<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:02.909> recommend<00:03:03.390> putting<00:03:03.569> eight

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
seventh point I recommend putting eight

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.160 
seventh point I recommend putting eight
again<00:03:04.079> in<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.819> ammunition<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:06.690> can<00:03:06.750> also

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
again in the ammunition you can also

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.930 
again in the ammunition you can also
alternatively<00:03:07.769> put<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.129> into<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.519> pistol<00:03:08.879> if

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
alternatively put it into the pistol if

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.220 
alternatively put it into the pistol if
you<00:03:09.030> think<00:03:09.239> you'd<00:03:09.359> be<00:03:09.480> using<00:03:09.659> that<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.109> lot

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
you think you'd be using that a lot

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.720 
you think you'd be using that a lot
especially<00:03:10.680> if<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.099> just<00:03:11.129> want<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.549> put<00:03:11.700> on

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
especially if you just want to put on

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.899 
especially if you just want to put on
relics<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.810> get<00:03:12.959> more<00:03:13.170> experience<00:03:13.819> and<00:03:14.819> the

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
relics to get more experience and the

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.309 
relics to get more experience and the
last<00:03:15.120> thing<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.450> want<00:03:15.629> to<00:03:15.659> say<00:03:15.870> today<00:03:16.049> is<00:03:16.170> that

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
last thing I want to say today is that

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.990 
last thing I want to say today is that
you<00:03:16.590> actually<00:03:16.769> where<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.370> need<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.609> stand<00:03:17.849> is

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
you actually where you need to stand is

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.909 
you actually where you need to stand is
back<00:03:18.239> here<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.930> spawn<00:03:19.319> area<00:03:19.709> it's<00:03:19.829> gonna

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
back here in the spawn area it's gonna

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.050 
back here in the spawn area it's gonna
be<00:03:20.069> all<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.280> way<00:03:20.340> back<00:03:20.519> here<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.790> just<00:03:20.880> put

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
be all the way back here you just put

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.280 
be all the way back here you just put
your<00:03:21.150> turret<00:03:21.480> up<00:03:21.599> it<00:03:21.750> doesn't<00:03:21.900> really<00:03:22.049> matter

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
your turret up it doesn't really matter

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.650 
your turret up it doesn't really matter
where<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.340> turret<00:03:23.579> is<00:03:23.669> I<00:03:23.819> find<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.450> turn

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
where you turret is I find that the turn

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.780 
where you turret is I find that the turn
actually<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.590> best<00:03:25.799> spot<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.220> way<00:03:26.549> in<00:03:26.760> the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
actually the best spot is way in the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.360 
actually the best spot is way in the
back<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.269> right<00:03:27.569> on<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.560> road<00:03:28.799> facing<00:03:29.250> up

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
back to the right on the road facing up

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.550 
back to the right on the road facing up
just<00:03:29.579> because<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:29.910> feel<00:03:30.209> like<00:03:30.269> when<00:03:31.109> the<00:03:31.200> aliens

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
just because I feel like when the aliens

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.990 
just because I feel like when the aliens
are<00:03:31.680> farther<00:03:32.010> away<00:03:32.129> it<00:03:32.400> doesn't<00:03:32.549> have<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.790> turn

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
are farther away it doesn't have to turn

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.490 
are farther away it doesn't have to turn
as<00:03:33.120> much<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.540> actually<00:03:33.870> uses<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.200> lot<00:03:34.470> less

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
as much and it actually uses a lot less

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.280 
as much and it actually uses a lot less
ammo<00:03:35.129> and<00:03:35.280> thus<00:03:35.879> stays<00:03:36.209> up<00:03:36.329> for<00:03:36.660> longer<00:03:37.109> it's

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
ammo and thus stays up for longer it's

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.509 
ammo and thus stays up for longer it's
kind<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.500> like<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.650> science<00:03:37.950> thing<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.280> kind<00:03:38.489> of

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
kind of like a science thing I kind of

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.309 
kind of like a science thing I kind of
timed<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:38.970> back<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.299> forth<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.019> believe

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
timed it back and forth and I believe

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.869 
timed it back and forth and I believe
that<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.859> best<00:03:41.040> spot<00:03:41.250> for<00:03:41.310> these

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
that that is the best spot for these

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.539 
that that is the best spot for these
spawning<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.629> the<00:03:43.019> fact<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.739> ammo<00:03:43.980> does

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
spawning and the fact that the ammo does

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.229 
spawning and the fact that the ammo does
run<00:03:44.849> out<00:03:45.030> on<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.510> turret<00:03:46.069> so<00:03:47.069> to<00:03:47.430> recap<00:03:47.879> all<00:03:48.090> you

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
run out on a turret so to recap all you

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.180 
run out on a turret so to recap all you
have<00:03:48.419> to<00:03:48.540> do<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:48.840> put<00:03:49.079> it<00:03:49.169> on<00:03:49.230> casual<00:03:49.709> put<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.099> on
