applet in this video I will show you how
to<00:00:13.559> display<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.549> digital<00:00:15.299> clock<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:16.230> an<00:00:16.650> applet

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
to display a digital clock in an applet

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.019 
to display a digital clock in an applet
window<00:00:17.990> so<00:00:18.990> don't<00:00:19.680> get<00:00:19.920> too<00:00:20.100> fussy<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:20.760> that

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
window so don't get too fussy here that

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.210 
window so don't get too fussy here that
is<00:00:21.180> not<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.260> complex<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.100> very<00:00:23.400> simple<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
is not so complex this very simple and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.019 
is not so complex this very simple and
very<00:00:26.220> easy<00:00:26.369> program<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.539> see<00:00:28.130> similarly<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
very easy program so see similarly the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.860 
very easy program so see similarly the
thread<00:00:31.019> class<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.859> same<00:00:31.890> all<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.840> I

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
thread class is the same all of that I

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.770 
thread class is the same all of that I
have<00:00:34.170> changed<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.890> definition<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.120> run

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
have changed the definition of this run

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.180 
have changed the definition of this run
method<00:00:38.210> in<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.420> method<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.770> thing<00:00:41.040> I

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
method in this method on the thing I

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.700 
method in this method on the thing I
have<00:00:41.489> imported<00:00:41.910> another<00:00:42.780> class<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.440> date

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
have imported another class that is date

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.819 
have imported another class that is date
inch<00:00:44.010> inside<00:00:44.430> java.util<00:00:45.239> package<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:46.230> our

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
inch inside java.util package and our

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.279 
inch inside java.util package and our
difference<00:00:47.450> inside<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:49.079> my<00:00:49.710> applet<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:51.289> there

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
difference inside the my applet so there

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.650 
difference inside the my applet so there
is<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:54.000> code<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:55.699> calculating<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.030> for

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
is the code for calculating the for

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.840 
is the code for calculating the for
calculating<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.440> detail<00:00:58.920> clock<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.430> inside

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
calculating the detail clock and inside

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.709 
calculating the detail clock and inside
the<00:01:00.270> paint<00:01:00.629> I'm<00:01:00.930> showing<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.800> date<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:03.510> see

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the paint I'm showing the date so see

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.120 
the paint I'm showing the date so see
what<00:01:03.899> happens<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:06.409> we<00:01:07.409> are<00:01:07.439> setting

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
what happens here that we are setting

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.820 
what happens here that we are setting
the<00:01:08.430> date<00:01:09.030> reference<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.170> current<00:01:10.650> date

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the date reference as the current date

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.820 
the date reference as the current date
the<00:01:11.220> by<00:01:11.400> calling<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.000> by<00:01:12.900> instantiating<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the by calling the by instantiating the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.520 
the by calling the by instantiating the
date<00:01:14.340> class<00:01:14.670> using<00:01:15.299> date<00:01:15.630> constructor<00:01:16.350> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
date class using date constructor and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.660 
date class using date constructor and
then<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:17.640> are<00:01:17.700> calling<00:01:17.880> repent<00:01:18.479> repent<00:01:19.670> call

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
then we are calling repent repent call

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.969 
then we are calling repent repent call
the<00:01:20.970> update<00:01:21.240> method<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.960> update<00:01:22.380> by<00:01:22.770> its

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the update method and update by its

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.749 
the update method and update by its
default<00:01:23.430> implementation<00:01:24.299> calls<00:01:25.290> paint<00:01:26.130> so

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
default implementation calls paint so

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.230 
default implementation calls paint so
what<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.720> done<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.740> line<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.700> in

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
what I have done in this line that is in

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.350 
what I have done in this line that is in
here<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:31.619> are<00:01:31.740> directly<00:01:32.220> calling<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.060> paint

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
here we are directly calling the paint

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.230 
here we are directly calling the paint
method<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:33.990> paint<00:01:34.560> method<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.640> cannot

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
method here paint method so you cannot

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.390 
method here paint method so you cannot
paint<00:01:36.630> method<00:01:36.900> explicitly<00:01:37.890> cannot<00:01:38.189> call

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
paint method explicitly cannot call

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.370 
paint method explicitly cannot call
paint<00:01:38.759> measure<00:01:39.000> explicitly<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.200> can

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
paint measure explicitly what you can

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.300 
paint measure explicitly what you can
call<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.799> repent<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.869> paint<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.950> display

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
call this repent to paint to display

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.389 
call this repent to paint to display
something<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.450> repent<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.320> then<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.189> have

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
something so repent and then I have

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.510 
something so repent and then I have
paused<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.030> thread<00:01:48.479> for<00:01:48.960> 1000<00:01:49.890> millisecond

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

milliseconds is the is equal to one

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.569 
milliseconds is the is equal to one
second<00:01:56.880> then<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.899> exception<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.009> cached<00:01:59.310> here

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
second then the exception is cached here

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.060 
second then the exception is cached here
and<00:01:59.729> then<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.689> while<00:02:00.869> loop<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.320> iterated<00:02:01.950> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
and then the while loop is iterated and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.950 
and then the while loop is iterated and
while<00:02:02.610> loop<00:02:02.820> inside<00:02:03.210> while<00:02:03.450> loop<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> troop

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
while loop inside while loop the troop

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.429 
while loop inside while loop the troop
is<00:02:04.259> always<00:02:05.070> satisfied<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.000> again<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.780> after

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
is always satisfied so again the after

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.460 
is always satisfied so again the after
one<00:02:07.649> second<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.340> get<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.910> date<00:02:09.690> right<00:02:10.020> after

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
one second we get the date right after

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.199 
one second we get the date right after
the<00:02:10.649> one<00:02:10.860> second

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
the one second

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.630 
the one second
so<00:02:12.840> let<00:02:13.349> us<00:02:13.379> see<00:02:13.590> what<00:02:13.799> is<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> output<00:02:14.189> of<00:02:14.370> this

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
so let us see what is the output of this

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:37.910 
so let us see what is the output of this
program

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.250 

here<00:02:38.990> say

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.740 

this<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.370> our<00:02:46.519> digital<00:02:46.760> clock<00:02:47.209> here<00:02:47.480> the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
this is our digital clock here the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:58.569 
this is our digital clock here the
second<00:02:48.379> is<00:02:48.650> being<00:02:49.579> incremented<00:02:50.329> here<00:02:56.980> so<00:02:57.980> as

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
second is being incremented here so as

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.509 
second is being incremented here so as
you<00:02:59.329> can<00:02:59.480> see<00:02:59.780> that<00:03:00.079> is<00:03:00.230> not<00:03:00.860> very<00:03:01.129> complex

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
you can see that is not very complex

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.600 
you can see that is not very complex
very<00:03:01.760> simple<00:03:02.150> program<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:03.019> you<00:03:03.680> try<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.310> by

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
very simple program so you try it by

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.050 
very simple program so you try it by
