00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.130 
robot or mini but whatever I think
there's<00:02:40.549> many<00:02:40.640> bottom<00:02:41.060> earners<00:02:41.450> what<00:02:42.049> they

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
there's many bottom earners what they

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.120 
there's many bottom earners what they
require<00:02:42.440> fine<00:02:42.680> under<00:02:44.290> very<00:02:45.290> very<00:02:45.590> easy<00:02:45.859> to

require fine under very very easy to

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.970 
require fine under very very easy to
transform<00:02:46.670> all<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.239> had<00:02:47.359> to<00:02:47.390> do<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:47.980> pull

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
transform all you had to do is just pull

I<00:02:59.709> took<00:03:00.580> quick<00:03:00.940> listen<00:03:01.270> like<00:03:01.450> what<00:03:01.660> five

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
I took quick listen like what five

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.360 
I took quick listen like what five
seconds<00:03:04.050> also<00:03:05.050> he<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.410> strangely<00:03:05.980> one<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.310> the
