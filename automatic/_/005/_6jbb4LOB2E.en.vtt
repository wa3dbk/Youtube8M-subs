00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
throwing together that I had laying

throwing together that I had laying
around<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.849> scrap<00:00:15.179> pile<00:00:17.300> I<00:00:19.460> use<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.609> two<00:00:20.820> ways

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
around on a scrap pile I use it two ways

I<00:00:22.340> have<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> mount<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.000> wall<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:24.600> these<00:00:24.720> two

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
I have a mount to wall with these two

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.630 
I have a mount to wall with these two
little<00:00:25.260> brackets<00:00:25.800> which<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.130> believe<00:00:26.430> are

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
little brackets which I believe are

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.679 
little brackets which I believe are
meant<00:00:26.970> for<00:00:28.369> that<00:00:29.369> for<00:00:29.640> two<00:00:29.789> by<00:00:29.939> fours<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.359> a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
meant for that for two by fours and a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.030 
meant for that for two by fours and a
dime<00:00:30.869> at<00:00:30.990> my<00:00:31.109> local<00:00:31.289> hardware<00:00:31.439> store<00:00:31.949> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
dime at my local hardware store and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.010 
dime at my local hardware store and
they're<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.550> think<00:00:33.000> they're<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.390> decking

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
they're just I think they're for decking

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.440 
they're just I think they're for decking
your<00:00:34.790> field<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.969> don't<00:00:36.000> know<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.329> they're

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
your field I don't know what they're

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.560 
your field I don't know what they're
called<00:00:36.770> they're<00:00:37.770> way<00:00:37.950> that's<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.430> right<00:00:38.550> there

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.350 

some<00:00:43.260> 2x4<00:00:44.000> then<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:46.710> Koyuk<00:00:47.309> bolts<00:00:47.850> here<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
some 2x4 then to Koyuk bolts here and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.569 
some 2x4 then to Koyuk bolts here and
here<00:00:49.430> and<00:00:50.430> then<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:52.350> brackets<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.460> had

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
here and then to brackets here and I had

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.819 
here and then to brackets here and I had
to<00:00:53.670> make<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> bracket<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.360> fit<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.840> between<00:00:55.110> here

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
to make a bracket to fit in between here

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.130 
to make a bracket to fit in between here
since<00:00:56.160> all<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> ones<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.820> had<00:00:57.030> or<00:00:57.210> two<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
since all the ones I had or two just a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.160 
since all the ones I had or two just a
little<00:00:58.770> too<00:00:58.920> big<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.030> didn't<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> bolt

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
little too big and I didn't have a bolt

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.670 
little too big and I didn't have a bolt
big<00:01:04.530> enough<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.309> go<00:01:05.430> through<00:01:05.460> there<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:07.560> I'm

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
big enough to go through there so I'm

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.109 
big enough to go through there so I'm
using<00:01:07.950> u-bolt<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.500> it<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.710> barely<00:01:11.490> makes<00:01:11.970> it

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
using u-bolt and it just barely makes it

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.170 
using u-bolt and it just barely makes it
to<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> other<00:01:12.479> side<00:01:13.400> but<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.430> does<00:01:14.790> work

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
to the other side but it does work

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.399 
to the other side but it does work
because<00:01:15.479> now<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> got<00:01:15.900> something<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> put<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
because now I got something to put the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.420 
because now I got something to put the
bungee<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:17.450> which<00:01:18.450> holds<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.930> thing<00:01:19.200> up<00:01:22.430> and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
bungee on which holds this thing up and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.390 
bungee on which holds this thing up and
it<00:01:23.549> works<00:01:23.729> pretty<00:01:23.909> well<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.450> only<00:01:25.140> being<00:01:25.409> but

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
it works pretty well for only being but

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.170 
it works pretty well for only being but
I<00:01:26.430> took<00:01:26.490> me<00:01:28.250> 45<00:01:29.250> minutes<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.700> put<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.000> thing

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
I took me 45 minutes to put this thing

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.600 
I took me 45 minutes to put this thing
together<00:01:30.680> just<00:01:31.680> use<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> little<00:01:32.159> scrap<00:01:32.400> when<00:01:32.579> I

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
together just use a little scrap when I

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.109 
together just use a little scrap when I
had<00:01:32.880> very<00:01:33.420> free<00:01:33.720> cutting<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.700> you

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
had very free cutting on that and you

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:46.570 
had very free cutting on that and you
can

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:58.000 

not<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.730> ram<00:01:54.170> another<00:01:55.170> one<00:01:55.290> real<00:01:55.470> quick

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.980 

probably<00:01:59.010> builds<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.430> simple<00:02:00.240> hand<00:02:00.720> crusher

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
probably builds a simple hand crusher

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.390 
probably builds a simple hand crusher
like<00:02:01.230> mine<00:02:01.500> there's<00:02:01.770> other<00:02:01.890> ones<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.310> on

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
like mine there's other ones and on
