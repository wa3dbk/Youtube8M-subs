00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.100 
and it shows you all the things you can
do<00:02:12.390> with<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:12.900> how<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.170> use<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:14.540> many<00:02:15.540> little

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
do with it and how to use it many little

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.100 
do with it and how to use it many little
drawings<00:02:16.560> because<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:18.270> has<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.570> lot<00:02:19.080> of

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
drawings because it has a lot of

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.660 
drawings because it has a lot of
different<00:02:19.500> functions<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:22.070> let's<00:02:23.070> get<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.520> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
different functions so let's get to the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.370 
different functions so let's get to the
Beast<00:02:24.060> himself<00:02:24.650> Wildcats

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
Beast himself Wildcats

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.300 
Beast himself Wildcats
there<00:02:28.380> we<00:02:28.530> go<00:02:28.710> let's<00:02:29.430> remove<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.000> cardboard

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
there we go let's remove the cardboard

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.910 
there we go let's remove the cardboard
and<00:02:32.310> here<00:02:32.940> we<00:02:33.060> have<00:02:33.270> Wildcat<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.410> tow<00:02:34.620> truck

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
and here we have Wildcat the tow truck

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.200 
and here we have Wildcat the tow truck
with<00:02:35.880> this<00:02:36.210> little<00:02:36.930> anchor<00:02:37.470> thing<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:39.000> these

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
with this little anchor thing so these

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.090 
with this little anchor thing so these
six<00:02:39.540> discs<00:02:40.170> are<00:02:41.480> projectile<00:02:42.480> disks<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.920> I'll

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
six discs are projectile disks and I'll

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.060 
six discs are projectile disks and I'll
show<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.340> how<00:02:44.490> they<00:02:44.670> work<00:02:45.710> I'll<00:02:46.710> just<00:02:46.770> show

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
show you how they work I'll just show

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.340 
show you how they work I'll just show
one<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.880> can<00:02:48.030> instant<00:02:48.360> insert<00:02:48.840> them<00:02:49.050> here<00:02:49.230> in

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
one you can instant insert them here in

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.190 
one you can instant insert them here in
the<00:02:49.440> front<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:51.360> can<00:02:51.420> later<00:02:51.690> shoot<00:02:51.960> them

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
the front and you can later shoot them

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.460 
the front and you can later shoot them
and<00:02:52.580> of<00:02:53.580> course<00:02:53.790> I'll<00:02:53.940> show<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.210> how<00:02:54.470> but

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
and of course I'll show you how but

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.290 
and of course I'll show you how but
first<00:02:55.770> let's<00:02:56.190> take<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.460> closer<00:02:56.820> look<00:02:56.970> at

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
first let's take a closer look at

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.130 
first let's take a closer look at
Wildcat<00:02:58.580> twist<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.790> light<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> bit<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:00.930> we<00:03:01.050> have

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
Wildcat twist the light a bit so we have

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.490 
Wildcat twist the light a bit so we have
a<00:03:01.200> better<00:03:01.440> view<00:03:02.540> without<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.840> light<00:03:04.050> dropping

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
a better view without the light dropping

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.040 
a better view without the light dropping
down<00:03:04.680> there<00:03:05.220> we<00:03:05.310> go

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
down there we go

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.360 
down there we go
it's<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.230> tow<00:03:07.410> truck<00:03:07.470> alright<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:10.890> see<00:03:11.100> some

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
it's a tow truck alright you see some

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.230 
it's a tow truck alright you see some
lights<00:03:12.000> there<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.540> are<00:03:12.660> obviously<00:03:13.260> guns<00:03:17.240> and

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
lights there that are obviously guns and

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.200 
lights there that are obviously guns and
they're<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.810> projectile<00:03:19.320> fell<00:03:19.530> out<00:03:19.880> well<00:03:20.880> cat

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
they're the projectile fell out well cat

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.740 
they're the projectile fell out well cat
so<00:03:22.220> here's<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.400> tow<00:03:23.580> mechanism<00:03:24.270> or<00:03:24.450> whatever

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
so here's the tow mechanism or whatever

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.300 
so here's the tow mechanism or whatever
you<00:03:24.840> call<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.750> here's<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.260> button<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.800> you

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
you call it so here's a button that you

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.870 
you call it so here's a button that you
can<00:03:29.460> use<00:03:29.610> for<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.880> transformation<00:03:31.670> let's<00:03:32.670> do

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
can use for the transformation let's do

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.800 
can use for the transformation let's do
that<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:34.560> hear<00:03:34.770> it<00:03:34.890> click<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:36.000> then<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.450> pops

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
that you hear it click and then it pops

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.550 
that you hear it click and then it pops
up<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:37.430> there<00:03:38.430> you<00:03:38.460> have<00:03:38.730> your<00:03:38.960> 360<00:03:39.960> degree

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
up and there you have your 360 degree

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.780 
up and there you have your 360 degree
pivoting<00:03:41.010> top<00:03:41.600> like<00:03:42.600> I<00:03:44.570> show<00:03:45.570> you<00:03:45.630> like<00:03:45.930> this

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
pivoting top like I show you like this

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.550 
pivoting top like I show you like this
goes<00:03:47.790> all<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.120> way<00:03:48.270> around<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:51.140> below<00:03:52.140> here

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
goes all the way around and below here

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.940 
goes all the way around and below here
we<00:03:52.770> have<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.310> disc<00:03:53.760> shooting<00:03:54.270> mechanism<00:03:54.950> that's

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
we have a disc shooting mechanism that's

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.100 
we have a disc shooting mechanism that's
why<00:03:56.100> I<00:03:56.130> loaded<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.610> disc<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.600> you<00:03:57.780> can<00:03:57.930> put

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
why I loaded the disc and you can put

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.680 
why I loaded the disc and you can put
all<00:03:58.230> six<00:03:58.500> in<00:03:58.680> there<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.540> the<00:04:00.540> fire<00:04:00.900> button<00:04:01.290> is

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
all six in there and the fire button is

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.810 
all six in there and the fire button is
I'm<00:04:03.690> sorry<00:04:03.990> it<00:04:04.110> was<00:04:04.200> out<00:04:04.350> of<00:04:04.470> camera<00:04:04.740> there<00:04:04.920> the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
I'm sorry it was out of camera there the

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.490 
I'm sorry it was out of camera there the
fire<00:04:06.060> button<00:04:06.330> is<00:04:06.600> actually<00:04:06.840> somewhere<00:04:07.440> I

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
fire button is actually somewhere I

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.280 
fire button is actually somewhere I
don't<00:04:08.040> remember<00:04:08.810> maybe<00:04:09.810> we'll<00:04:09.960> find<00:04:10.170> out

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
don't remember maybe we'll find out

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.230 
don't remember maybe we'll find out
later<00:04:10.910> these<00:04:11.910> can<00:04:12.150> also<00:04:12.300> move<00:04:14.000> one<00:04:15.000> on<00:04:15.120> the

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
later these can also move one on the

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.090 
later these can also move one on the
other<00:04:15.330> side<00:04:15.420> tail

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100

this<00:04:18.760> towing<00:04:19.360> mechanism<00:04:19.930> turns<00:04:20.200> into<00:04:20.970> kind<00:04:21.970> of

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
this towing mechanism turns into kind of

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.820 
this towing mechanism turns into kind of
gun<00:04:22.390> or<00:04:22.630> something<00:04:22.870> I'm<00:04:23.080> not<00:04:23.230> sure<00:04:23.470> what<00:04:23.680> they

projectile she look that up but it

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.110 
projectile she look that up but it
takes<00:04:48.160> too<00:04:48.340> long<00:04:48.370> it's<00:04:48.640> nothing<00:04:48.880> real<00:04:49.000> special

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
takes too long it's nothing real special

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.360 
takes too long it's nothing real special
just<00:04:49.540> shoots<00:04:49.720> out<00:04:49.870> on<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.140> front<00:04:50.350> so<00:04:51.130> that's

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
just shoots out on the front so that's

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.610 
just shoots out on the front so that's
