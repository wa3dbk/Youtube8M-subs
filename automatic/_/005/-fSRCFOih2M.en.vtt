00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
performance expression system and this

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.030 
performance expression system and this
is<00:00:38.340> our<00:00:38.550> target<00:00:38.870> so<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.260> old<00:00:40.440> days<00:00:40.680> when

needed two three four long words to
achieve<00:00:47.460> your<00:00:48.300> daily<00:00:49.100> production<00:00:50.600> target<00:00:51.600> we

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
achieve your daily production target we

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.049 
achieve your daily production target we
want<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.739> go<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.949> one<00:00:53.190> normal<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.610> needs<00:00:53.820> we

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
want to go to one normal that needs we

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.520 
want to go to one normal that needs we
want<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> lower<00:00:54.660> reaches<00:00:55.140> which<00:00:55.350> we

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
want to have a lower reaches which we

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.470 
want to have a lower reaches which we
can<00:00:55.710> admit<00:00:56.100> our<00:00:56.280> knowledge<00:00:56.610> at<00:00:56.760> 10<00:00:56.940> meter<00:00:57.120> 11

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
can admit our knowledge at 10 meter 11

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.959 
can admit our knowledge at 10 meter 11
meter<00:00:57.719> per<00:00:57.840> day<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.340> to<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.460> able<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.850> achieve

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
meter per day and to be able to achieve

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.470 
meter per day and to be able to achieve
this<00:01:00.359> goal<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:02.070> entries<00:01:02.910> which

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
this goal we have to have entries which

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.230 
this goal we have to have entries which
are<00:01:03.719> much<00:01:03.960> better<00:01:04.229> fit<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:04.650> purpose<00:01:05.030> but<00:01:06.030> then

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
are much better fit for purpose but then

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.389 
are much better fit for purpose but then
with<00:01:06.659> standing<00:01:07.350> support<00:01:07.770> only<00:01:07.950> hip<00:01:08.280> energy

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
same a hundred need 120 meters so what

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.209 
same a hundred need 120 meters so what
is<00:01:16.729> holding<00:01:17.060> a<00:01:17.119> Spectre<00:01:17.600> we<00:01:18.320> are<00:01:18.469> hold<00:01:18.710> back<00:01:18.920> of

even more so I think the advantages are
coming<00:03:46.819> when<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.120> Lord<00:03:47.150> uses<00:03:47.659> entry<00:03:48.169> no<00:03:49.010> entry

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
coming when the Lord uses entry no entry

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.379 
coming when the Lord uses entry no entry

the beast from the very fundamental

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.950 
the beast from the very fundamental
aspects<00:04:51.690> of<00:04:51.900> machinery<00:04:52.800> was<00:04:53.190> well<00:04:53.430> accepted

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
aspects of machinery was well accepted

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.050 
aspects of machinery was well accepted
because<00:04:54.960> -<00:04:55.560> see<00:04:55.770> that<00:04:56.100> going<00:04:56.310> away<00:04:56.520> from<00:04:56.910> a

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
because - see that going away from a

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.940 
because - see that going away from a
compress<00:04:57.450> towards<00:04:57.810> is<00:04:58.080> a<00:04:58.140> good<00:04:58.440> thing<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.830> the

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
compress towards is a good thing to the

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.350 
compress towards is a good thing to the
insert<00:04:59.310> it's<00:04:59.580> just<00:05:00.240> obvious<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.970> then<00:05:02.970> again

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
insert it's just obvious and then again

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.420 
insert it's just obvious and then again
as<00:05:03.540> I<00:05:03.570> said<00:05:03.840> when<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.230> when<00:05:04.590> you<00:05:04.710> look<00:05:05.130> at<00:05:05.310> the

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
as I said when you when you look at the

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.110 
as I said when you when you look at the
development<00:05:06.000> phase<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:06.650> you<00:05:07.650> come<00:05:07.950> into<00:05:08.190> in

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
development phase and you come into in

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.680 
development phase and you come into in
stable<00:05:09.600> conditions<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:11.190> drill<00:05:11.460> record<00:05:11.690> on

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
stable conditions the drill record on

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.510 
stable conditions the drill record on
the<00:05:12.870> machine<00:05:13.140> gives<00:05:13.500> you<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.710> flexibility<00:05:14.400> to

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
the machine gives you the flexibility to

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.400 
the machine gives you the flexibility to
do<00:05:14.940> a<00:05:14.970> visit<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.390> increase<00:05:15.810> safety<00:05:16.050> to<00:05:16.380> a

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
do a visit to increase safety to a

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.960 
do a visit to increase safety to a
three-prong<00:05:17.040> control<00:05:17.370> conditions<00:05:17.820> by

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
three-prong control conditions by

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.560 
three-prong control conditions by
putting<00:05:18.300> words<00:05:18.480> into<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:19.020> move<00:05:19.350> which<00:05:20.070> is

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
putting words into the move which is

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.540 
putting words into the move which is
what's<00:05:21.570> very<00:05:21.720> quickly<00:05:22.350> accepted<00:05:22.920> and<00:05:23.160> I<00:05:23.280> think

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
what's very quickly accepted and I think

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.030 
what's very quickly accepted and I think
our<00:05:24.000> crews<00:05:24.720> are<00:05:25.020> very<00:05:25.200> supportive<00:05:25.440> of<00:05:25.860> this

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
our crews are very supportive of this

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.950 
our crews are very supportive of this
technology<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:26.820> are<00:05:27.180> standing<00:05:27.630> fully<00:05:27.810> behind

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
money in poverty everywhere and Poland

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.720 
money in poverty everywhere and Poland
is<00:05:34.890> not<00:05:34.920> an<00:05:35.220> island

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
is not an island

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.300 
is not an island
Poland<00:05:36.300> is<00:05:36.360> part<00:05:36.780> of<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:37.650> world<00:05:37.920> of<00:05:38.220> the
