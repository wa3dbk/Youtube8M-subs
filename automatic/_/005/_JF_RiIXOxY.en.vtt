00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.139
 hey people welcome back and me 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.650
 I want to talk to you today 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.289
 to say so it's about that 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.210
 park in training 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:26.340
 and how do you get the punk what is it 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.250
 pump and important or unimportant as a pak 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.130
 then designates after training 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.690
 just that the enlargement of the muscle 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.149
 volume of a particular muscle that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.590
 means I pump during the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.680
 training was or during 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.600
 a particular training method entirely 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.430
 a lot of blood in the muscle of this world 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.660
 of course, up and up and up 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.980
 Accordingly, I have just this 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.480
 bottled the punk itself is not 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.850
 market or no indication that 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.010
 have trained effectively that is 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.420
 So you need when training 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.699
 should train and you have no 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.820
 puck is not one that they do not 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.189
 have effectively trained the other way 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.900
 of course if he gets a point 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.490
 did not train that effectively so 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.390
 do not rely on the point of 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.619
 pump is in the end just one 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.369
 I just call it a good one now 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.090
 feeling 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.369
 That was not the point anymore 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.680
 you can do it yourself in the training 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.270
 usually quite simply by a right 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.390
 high repetition number so i say 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.490
 times so mostly 12 to 15 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.790
 repetitions with fairly short breaks 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.890
 in between that it is the 7th 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.579
 training system if someone says something 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.960
 this one method has seven sentences 12 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.770
 up to 15 repetitions in 30 seconds 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.869
 pause 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.939
 that would be a fantastic example 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.159
 you can really do it pretty fast 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.479
 in a short time quite a lot of blood with 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.740
 a isolation exercise in the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.110
 score corresponding muscles 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.579
 and you have accordingly 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.780
 Also monster pump that matter has so 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.460
 but its 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.810
 how to exercise naturally on pump 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.640
 also what to do with nutrition that is 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.380
 So you do not have the right ones 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.299
 Nutrients for it will also no point 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.520
 to get 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.110
 the most important nutrient for a good one 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.680
 point are carbohydrates 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.730
 So if you want to watch it, okay me 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.380
 I would like to do some training today 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.590
 who should not pump many before 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.630
 carbohydrates eat the margin before 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.239
 the training so 23 already before the training 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.410
 when the carbohydrate is rich 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.150
 not necessarily make sure in the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.860
 good pump if you are really sure 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.610
 Just want to go the day before 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.840
 evening before carbohydrates eat that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.630
 will be a good one the next day 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.790
 pump give a very simple example 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.230
 Maybe you have ever lived 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.730
 in the evening away a big pizza 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.630
 Eat or whatever under one 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.840
 day in training 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.610
 Do you have this plump feeling that is coming 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.269
 among other things by the carbohydrates 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.380
 you have eaten many before 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.680
 Carbohydrates are actually enough 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.840
 made entirely of salt is also a good one 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.120
 medium so I'm not telling myself now 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.320
 eat a lot of salt but if 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.180
 you eat good salt then you get 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.769
 This also quite good 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.799
 enhance or can help 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.450
 Simply maximize the point again 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.310
 on the other side we have 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.959
 Of course a few more supplements 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.090
 to help you a little bit further 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.620
 can 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.280
 the best known are actually that 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.140
 amino acids l arginine and l citrulline 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.690
 being on a regular basis always lemon 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.079
 going ahead means lemons is 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.609
 actually more effective because of me 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.769
 believe in him first to citrullin 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.840
 must be converted and as there in the 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.310
 end effect so the amount is longer 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.989
 Correspondingly, half means that 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.019
 who actually needs half of the 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.290
 Fund magnin attracts ruolin 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.269
 to achieve the same effectiveness 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.070
 So if I take ten grams ag 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.440
 then, theoretically, would be 5 grams of co2 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.420
 in perfectly adequate and that would 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.489
 even short term ones are enough 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.280
 to take on the training as the 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.660
 that is, if I am just before the 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.340
 training would then fill by the 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.000
 About half an hour five minutes 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.250
 do 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.770
 Citroen even reaches 15 minutes before 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.370
 out 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.960
 regardless, they are not 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.550
 active ingredients that work for everyone 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.489
 Also what the dose is going on there 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.730
 that where the need is 56 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.140
 Others need 10 gears 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.730
 and others from others 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.960
 horse, there is nothing about it even 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.000
 which i just call her this one 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.940
 London that means you can too 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.950
 About 10 gait will be taken from the stomach 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.330
 this does not really strengthen 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.050
 pump minister in the end itself 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.480
 try out 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.400
 they are not supplements either 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.440
 really have a big benefit so 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.200
 at least not a benefit what 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.450
 muscle building so it's not 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.010
 mask supplements i would only do it 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.810
 just recommend if if the 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.780
 purse is too big when he says ok 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.980
 easy for my self-esteem me 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.500
 think that's nice i just want to 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.510
 it is okay to use but here rather 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.100
 they will not bring that too 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.600
 if he has to invest money now 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.070
 or not that about that ever 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.990
 that's it , that's it 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.430
 So diet is like that said 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.660
 most important if the diet is right 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.250
 then you have such a doll in the 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.070
 carbohydrate fall workout and salt 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.600
 people a bit be careful that 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.340
 you are sufficient of it then remains too 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.320
 get a nice point otherwise 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.780
 Of course you can with supplements 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.240
 help as I said the amino acid l 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.200
 citrulline are quite effective in that 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.820
 you have to turn over there 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.540
 Just let yourself experiment 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.800
 slowly it is still short but stands 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.590
 always on the pack on it l 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.840
 Arginine side is to be dosed too high 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.700
 Can you lead herpes at least if 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.650
 you have the virus in it so fits 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.690
 That's what it can do, too 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.760
 go backwards quickly so I say 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.670
 times so 10 grams are already the absolute 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.040
 limit and everything else is one 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.720
 not so good at 10 grams 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.190
 works then let it out then 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.090
 either just take citrullin that should 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.860
 to work better 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.260
 and if not at 67 grams 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.220
 works then saves you the coal 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.130
 then you do not have to do that either 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.720
 spend money because then bring you in 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.370
 end effect nothing so rather invested 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.640
 the money in decent approach then 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.479
 that fits okay that was now 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:14.800
 few words on this topic otherwise 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.800
 thanks for listening and see you soon
