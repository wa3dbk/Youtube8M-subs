right so you get your zip tie and thread

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.120 
right so you get your zip tie and thread
it<00:00:50.829> through<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:51.280> hole<00:00:51.520> in<00:00:51.880> the<00:00:51.940> zip<00:00:52.720> tie<00:00:53.130> in

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
it through the hole in the zip tie in

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.810 
it through the hole in the zip tie in
there<00:00:54.370> in<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.820> pin<00:00:55.030> sorry<00:00:55.390> and<00:00:55.860> then<00:00:56.860> zip<00:00:57.670> that

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
there in the pin sorry and then zip that

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.590 
there in the pin sorry and then zip that
on<00:01:00.480> get<00:01:01.480> it<00:01:01.570> as<00:01:01.660> tight<00:01:01.690> as<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.140> can<00:01:02.290> get<00:01:03.600> right

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
now slide your fuel tubing over it just

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.330 
now slide your fuel tubing over it just
like<00:01:09.729> that<00:01:09.909> so<00:01:10.240> it's<00:01:10.390> on<00:01:10.540> that<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:12.219> get

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
like that so it's on that and you get

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.670 
like that so it's on that and you get
your<00:01:12.430> other<00:01:12.610> zip<00:01:12.969> tie<00:01:14.280> slide<00:01:15.280> it<00:01:15.520> down<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
your other zip tie slide it down the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:26.550 
your other zip tie slide it down the
elders<00:01:17.979> it's<00:01:18.159> on<00:01:18.310> there<00:01:21.659> tighten<00:01:22.659> up<00:01:25.380> cut<00:01:26.380> both

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
elders it's on there tighten up cut both

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.080 
elders it's on there tighten up cut both
ends<00:01:26.799> off<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.960> then<00:01:32.380> you're<00:01:32.530> done<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:33.790> body

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
ends off and then you're done one body

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.090 
ends off and then you're done one body
pin<00:01:34.390> that<00:01:34.540> looks<00:01:34.720> like<00:01:34.930> that<00:01:37.080> right<00:01:38.080> now<00:01:38.710> we

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
pin that looks like that right now we

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.670 
pin that looks like that right now we
are<00:01:39.130> doing<00:01:39.460> it<00:01:39.729> on<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.479> fuel<00:01:40.840> tank<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.409> make<00:01:41.560> it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
are doing it on the fuel tank to make it

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.640 
are doing it on the fuel tank to make it
easier<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.070> open<00:01:42.369> when<00:01:42.909> the<00:01:43.060> shells<00:01:43.330> on<00:01:43.650> okay

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
easier to open when the shells on okay

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.710 
easier to open when the shells on okay
so<00:01:45.130> it's<00:01:45.280> basically<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.790> same<00:01:45.970> principle<00:01:46.270> as

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
so it's basically the same principle as

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.320 
so it's basically the same principle as
the<00:01:47.640> body<00:01:48.640> pin<00:01:48.970> so<00:01:49.689> you<00:01:50.290> get<00:01:50.470> your<00:01:50.500> zip<00:01:50.740> tie

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
the body pin so you get your zip tie

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.749 
the body pin so you get your zip tie
thread<00:01:52.330> it<00:01:52.450> through<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.780> little<00:01:52.930> hole<00:01:53.759> which

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
thread it through the little hole which

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:01.890 
thread it through the little hole which
is<00:01:54.939> quite<00:01:55.360> tricky<00:01:56.100> hang<00:01:57.100> on<00:01:59.970> all<00:02:00.970> right<00:02:01.090> now

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
is quite tricky hang on all right now

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.980 
is quite tricky hang on all right now
zip<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.229> up

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.330 

right<00:02:08.990> now<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:09.259> get<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.470> longer<00:02:09.770> bit<00:02:10.039> of<00:02:10.160> fuel

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
right now you get a longer bit of fuel

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.710 
right now you get a longer bit of fuel
tubing<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.570> slide<00:02:11.990> it<00:02:12.020> over<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:14.360> can<00:02:14.480> have<00:02:14.570> it

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
tubing and slide it over you can have it

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.720 
tubing and slide it over you can have it
as<00:02:14.870> long<00:02:15.140> as<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.410> like<00:02:15.590> as<00:02:15.920> long<00:02:16.220> as<00:02:16.550> your<00:02:16.700> zip

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
as long as you like as long as your zip

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.970 
as long as you like as long as your zip
tie<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.450> long<00:02:17.720> enough<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:18.550> zip<00:02:19.550> up<00:02:20.620> okay<00:02:21.620> so

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
tie it is long enough to zip up okay so

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.890 
tie it is long enough to zip up okay so
you<00:02:22.040> slide<00:02:22.310> your<00:02:22.520> other<00:02:22.610> zip<00:02:22.850> tie<00:02:23.060> over<00:02:23.330> it

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:35.960 

right<00:02:26.900> now<00:02:27.830> cut<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.730> ends<00:02:28.820> of

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.550 

right<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.180> in<00:02:37.450> case<00:02:37.720> you're<00:02:37.960> wondering<00:02:38.020> why

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
I've got this piece of fuel tubing

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.880 
I've got this piece of fuel tubing
across<00:02:40.480> there<00:02:40.750> because<00:02:41.320> I've<00:02:41.410> got<00:02:41.560> fuel
