double<00:05:13.919> sided<00:05:14.130> so<00:05:14.370> there's<00:05:14.520> black<00:05:14.760> on<00:05:14.910> the

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
double sided so there's black on the

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.610 
double sided so there's black on the
back<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.270> knew<00:05:15.390> it<00:05:15.480> was<00:05:15.600> gonna<00:05:15.750> be<00:05:15.810> like<00:05:15.930> four

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
back I knew it was gonna be like four

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.560 
back I knew it was gonna be like four
and<00:05:16.860> one<00:05:17.010> but<00:05:17.160> I<00:05:17.220> didn't<00:05:17.520> know<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.180> other<00:05:18.330> ones

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
and one but I didn't know the other ones

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.310 
and one but I didn't know the other ones
were<00:05:18.830> slipping<00:05:20.660> they<00:05:21.660> actually<00:05:21.840> on<00:05:22.230> the

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
were slipping they actually on the

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.590 
were slipping they actually on the
inside<00:05:22.860> so<00:05:23.130> there's<00:05:23.310> a<00:05:23.400> white<00:05:23.820> warning<00:05:24.210> smear

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
inside so there's a white warning smear

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.120 
inside so there's a white warning smear
on<00:05:25.200> the<00:05:25.470> back<00:05:25.650> of<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:25.860> black<00:05:26.010> when<00:05:26.250> it's<00:05:26.400> cool

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
on the back of the black when it's cool

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.860 
on the back of the black when it's cool
you<00:05:29.130> can't<00:05:29.340> really<00:05:29.460> see<00:05:29.640> it<00:05:29.669> and<00:05:30.180> I've<00:05:30.419> tested

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
you can't really see it and I've tested

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.150 
you can't really see it and I've tested
some<00:05:31.050> of<00:05:31.110> them<00:05:31.230> out<00:05:31.350> but<00:05:31.380> it<00:05:31.710> looks<00:05:31.770> like<00:05:31.950> the

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
some of them out but it looks like the

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.159 
some of them out but it looks like the
silver<00:05:32.610> is<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:32.790> best<00:05:33.000> reflection<00:05:33.750> I<00:05:33.810> can<00:05:33.990> get

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
silver is the best reflection I can get

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.530 
silver is the best reflection I can get
so<00:05:34.350> far<00:05:34.590> to<00:05:35.520> see<00:05:35.700> if<00:05:35.760> I<00:05:35.820> can<00:05:35.970> reflect<00:05:36.180> it<00:05:36.419> like

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
so far to see if I can reflect it like

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.470 
so far to see if I can reflect it like
this<00:05:36.660> look<00:05:36.870> at<00:05:36.960> that<00:05:36.990> look<00:05:37.380> at<00:05:37.590> now<00:05:37.830> yep<00:05:38.480> so

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
this look at that look at now yep so

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.880 
this look at that look at now yep so
cool

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
cool

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.220 
cool
so<00:05:41.400> cool<00:05:42.090> I'm<00:05:42.480> gonna<00:05:42.570> go<00:05:42.720> test<00:05:42.930> something

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 
so cool I'm gonna go test something

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.830 
so cool I'm gonna go test something
blends<00:05:43.500> now<00:05:43.740> so<00:05:44.160> this<00:05:44.370> is<00:05:44.760> it<00:05:45.150> without<00:05:45.450> the

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
blends now so this is it without the

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.900 
blends now so this is it without the
light<00:05:46.050> and<00:05:46.500> now<00:05:46.890> I<00:05:46.920> turned<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:48.270> light<00:05:48.570> on<00:05:49.910> this

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
light and now I turned the light on this

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.120 
light and now I turned the light on this
is<00:05:51.120> definitely<00:05:51.960> a<00:05:52.110> lot<00:05:52.230> better<00:05:52.470> for<00:05:52.680> darker

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
is definitely a lot better for darker

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.410 
is definitely a lot better for darker
