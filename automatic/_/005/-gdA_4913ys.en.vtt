00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.210
 feed feeding tips 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.490
 fury 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.560
 we will start by saying that it is easier and 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.670
 economically eat well that 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.470
 Feeding bad when we say 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.050
 feed well we mean that 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.360
 feeding that aside from the taste and 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.990
 the taste of truth nourishes and benefits the 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.790
 organism when we say feed 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.680
 well we mean that 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.290
 food that does not produce anything 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.620
 useful and rather it harms us and destroys little 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.480
 to little as you can appreciate we are 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.150
 positing that the good taste of a 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.910
 food does not necessarily imply a 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.550
 good nutrition the most foods 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.980
 exquisite can be the most harmful and 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.810
 the least exquisite can be the most 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.060
 nutritious 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.130
 we will start by saying that it is easier and 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.870
 economically eat well that 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.870
 feed poorly 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.450
 when we say we eat well 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.549
 we refer to that diet that 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.819
 margin of taste and taste of truth 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:17.000
 nourishes and benefits the body when 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.799
 we say we eat well we mean 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.959
 that food that does not produce us 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.200
 nothing useful and rather it harms and destroys us 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.870
 little by little as you can see 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.450
 we are proposing that the good taste of 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.480
 a food does not necessarily imply 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.120
 good nutrition the most foods 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.579
 exquisite can be the most harmful and 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.940
 the least exquisite can be the most 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.400
 nutritious we should also note 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.129
 that the sensations of sweet salty 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.049
 tasty the customs and norms with which 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.569
 we feed ourselves daily and those that 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.940
 we are clinging are totally 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.950
 subjective if we can change them little to 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.310
 little at will and with a little 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.989
 patience this is something interesting more 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.680
 that everything if these changes the 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.440
 we aim at something useful using all 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.080
 these tips and observations we can 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.360
 get to a balance point I got 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.700
 foods that benefit health and 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.000
 same time they are nice to the 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.489
 palate talking about health and trying to 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.410
 to the point we will say that in general 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.260
 it's about a fight between nutrients 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.680
 that are constructive and positive 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.860
 and toxins that poison harm and 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.500
 destroy in every organism in all 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.780
 machine as is the human machine and 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.240
 in the entire universe there are no more 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.360
 those two trends and it's a fight between 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.910
 they therefore all food habit 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.130
 or any action related to our 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.320
 body must be on the way to 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.010
 creation of nutrients and elvia after 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.230
 formation of toxins in relation to this 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.630
 we must mention one of the most 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.240
 important of our organism as it is 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.240
 the liver its importance lies in one 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.210
 of its multiple functions is precisely 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.760
 the detoxify by eliminating substances 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.830
 harmful produced by bad habits 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.960
 feeding and daily us 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.510
 poison harm our organs 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.770
 producing imbalances and finally 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.160
 they cause us 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.590
