00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.759
 I dedicate this hammarby tutorial that will surely be the first to see it 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.529
 then you 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.689
 in this tutorial i will explain how to eliminate the dominant color is 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.689
 images like these that green 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.080
 magic question of the Abruzzo national park 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.870
 leader of the end has contaminated all colors of the image I am 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.130
 arrived at this result ie 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.550
 oppo reported 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.900
 in the part below the path of the most natural colors 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.320
 how I made the palette of the two levels immobilizer 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.260
 the first instrument that we will use, however, will be the dropper 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.140
 the dropper will be selected and will have modified with an average of three by three 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.299
 up here because I tell you this because 3 means to you what it means 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.109
 go and get a spokesman boom takes the color we select 3perte 

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:17.090
 means that it will take on the fabrics color 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.510
 trip pixel around the point where we are going to press 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.330
 if instead we had put. sample the color would have been a synthesis of the 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.490
 closer colors 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.020
 go in this case we need a very detailed selection then 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.120
 choose art world for you 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.120
 eeeh we will also use the info panel 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.409
 that I in this version os otherwise this was cs4 otherwise 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.670
 root go to activate from the info window 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.610
 oo for us probably also with f8 own thorn maybe vary reaction 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.170
 avercene volareweb modified because this bread wine this child mentions 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.140
 movie 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.759
 of values ​​that we will then change 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.329
 then this in this section 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.270
 it is important to understand 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.410
 that we're going to work on bing the white points and minutes points. points 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.080
 Dimeglio 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.029
 and then the woodpecker 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:17.029
 whites will be white and lights will obviously be 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:22.739
 there will be our first point selling the legendary shadows and it will be the 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:23.940
 our second. 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.080
 the third and last member who will be the point the midpoint 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.490
 then with if we move in the screen with land dropper 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.720
 we note that here in this area here where rdb is, numbers flow 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:44.549
 those will tell us practically the% amount of color present this one. 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.810
 in red 161 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.909
 beat the group 209 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.989
 how do I choose the i3 points sandro then maja to use for 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.769
 change them to see here this is point 1 that I have already selected 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.480
 previously point 2 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.079
 point 3 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.029
 to review below 1 

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:06.019
 et3 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.819
 and precisely the light point 1 in fact equates the white part 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.499
 ill. safe 2 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:14.629
 that's here 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.140
 he said, but on the one hand, the point on the air would be to say that they are the themes of law 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.490
 which I am here alone sectioned 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.040
 because I select these obviously now 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.320
 you know well in photoshop the values ​​vary from zero 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.340
 for libya manco 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.079
 % 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.480
 255 not as the highest point 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.730
 therefore this case and I will not go to select the maximum prodi values ​​but i 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.250
 next values ​​the white point there is in the light selected this these 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.019
 values ​​vary around this range and not just all 2 55 because 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.090
 because I had to take the baby i'm extreme sims if I couldn't 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.050
 change the lights and shadows according to the general context 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.779
 now not being a 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:03.359
 since there is a lot of light in this image, I will certainly have to go to 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.359
 eliminate above all in this lower part 

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:12.949
 I selected the second one. with values ​​not close to zero but how to see 35 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:18.420
 27 17 if you see well in these fools ie it quits 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.420
 on the white sp there is a greater dominant 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.979
 il2 55054 tat red and yellow in this 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.450
 in this, others are dominant fortitudo sacrati and then 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.180
 overall it is green 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.180
 perella the major dominant 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.050
 Lastly 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.180
 let's say between 242 155 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:55.439
 the igm values 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:02.139
 and i gu 4 23 roma renault I would say trumpets 50 never exceeded 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:08.160
 the 50 while the average ones generally worth nocendum central value of 120 hours I 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:13.830
 select bar values ​​from 140 251 and 102 which maybe a little if 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.509
 I am in Loreto 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.620
 too far apart but in this case however the final yield is excellent because 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.870
 I went various just touch the blue channel
