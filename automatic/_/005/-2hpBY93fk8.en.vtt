00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
larger tonalities and he'd abused the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.039 
larger tonalities and he'd abused the

and<00:01:19.710> there<00:01:20.340> are<00:01:20.549> riots<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.240> aisles

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and there are riots in the aisles

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.359 
and there are riots in the aisles
because<00:01:21.900> people<00:01:22.200> don't<00:01:22.350> find<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.860> music

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
because people don't find that music

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.330 
because people don't find that music
appropriate<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.180> ballet<00:01:24.450> music<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.650> these

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
appropriate for ballet music so these

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.740 
appropriate for ballet music so these
are<00:01:26.400> people<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.850> are<00:01:27.000> experimenting<00:01:27.659> at

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
are people that are experimenting at

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.999 
are people that are experimenting at
different<00:01:28.080> types<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.650> forms<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.430> art

different types and forms of art
probably<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.329> literature<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.630> most

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
probably in literature the most

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.080 
probably in literature the most
interesting<00:01:34.409> experiment<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.640> country

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
interesting experiment in this country

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.300 
interesting experiment in this country
anyhow<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.780> something<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.380> sound<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.950> theory

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
anyhow is something like sound in theory

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.429 
anyhow is something like sound in theory
where<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.119> important<00:01:39.600> or<00:01:39.720> tries<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.110> tell<00:01:40.290> the
