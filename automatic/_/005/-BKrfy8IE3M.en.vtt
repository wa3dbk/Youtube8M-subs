made<00:03:48.470> a<00:03:48.500> video<00:03:48.709> about<00:03:49.099> solar<00:03:49.849> thurs<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.389> we

made a video about solar thurs that we

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.469 
made a video about solar thurs that we
were<00:03:50.750> going<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.799> experience<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:52.760> they<00:03:53.419> were

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:53.479 
were going to experience and they were

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.199 
were going to experience and they were
the<00:03:54.409> most<00:03:54.680> intense<00:03:55.250> solar<00:03:55.519> flares<00:03:55.879> that<00:03:55.970> we

had<00:03:56.329> experienced<00:03:56.959> so<00:03:57.109> far<00:03:57.139> so<00:03:58.129> I<00:03:58.159> don't<00:03:58.459> think

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
had experienced so far so I don't think

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.409

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
don't know so that's why i said i would

start being prepared by buying seriously
a<00:04:24.349> solar<00:04:26.080> generator<00:04:27.080> that<00:04:27.710> would<00:04:27.889> be<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.400> best

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
a solar generator that would be the best

a solar generator that would be the best
bet<00:04:28.880> that's<00:04:29.180> right<00:04:29.720> think<00:04:30.229> but<00:04:31.159> anyway<00:04:31.870> major

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
bet that's right think but anyway major
