00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello how are yours already started with 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.040
 the mini tutorials as I had told them 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.050
 let's go forward like that with what 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.300
 they ask us today we are going to talk about 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.349
 bosom bot which is the one of the most votes 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.539
 famous apart from baseball for warm 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:21.359
 this the breast boat is what was left 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.249
 after four great vows that 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.149
 they were the warm bots 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:29.460
 ehlers bots and then the neo bots together 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:32.560
 with what was the review of the breast that 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.230
 embrace the breast vote this one 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.180
 they asked me and I had done this 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.490
 video much earlier but they told me or are 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.630
 but it's that the video says it's for 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.580
 version 10.57 and it's not for any 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.150
 price and his voice is a crack for the bot 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.530
 for any version yes but no no and 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.200
 clarifying clarifying better we do the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.880
 video again and we explain ok and we 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.400
 let's go to it the first thing that I have to 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.470
 to do is unload us in the sin ball 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.090
 from the official website of the cee no 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.440
 vote dot net here as you can see here 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.479
 above 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.869
 after downloading we installed it 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.409
 normally we install it normally and 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:14.470
 we open it when we open it it goes 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.690
 to say that it's going to update the most 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.070
 updated but are he going to tell them 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.500
 that will be updated to sit by 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.479
 please writing please wait says 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.240
 peace walker is updating what 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:30.549
 we let it totally update now 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:33.190
 when it is updated that it is 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.399
 updating already when updated 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.979
 we totally tell you to close and what 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.140
 we close perfect 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.000
 and we continue to next step ok let's 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.250
 go to a folder that is left I use 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.590
 windows 8 but it's pretty much the same 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.770
 and we windows are going to windows 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.690
 xp windows 7 windows 8 windows 8.1 a 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.750
 fifth view windows I think nobody 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.360
 he uses it but we're not going to do we 're going to 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.110
 the windows folder then we go to the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.320
 folder that is called 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.020
 there are 32 we go to the folder that is 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.020
 call drivers and finally we go to the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.550
 folder etc in this folder we are going to 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.480
 have a file called host 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.160
 point and 7 if you do not have the point and it says 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.310
 that forgiveness 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.410
 ok it will be like host nothing else if not 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.240
 you have it then perfect and if you have it 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.930
 we erase it then as I have it 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.250
 let's delete it ready deleted ok 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.930
 now in the description I'm going to leave you 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.079
 a link 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.850
 that brings us to this page that is called 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:40.800
 ocean point with downloads at 100 points 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.410
 we enter the advance of the index in the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.480
 description that you are going to download 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.610
 here 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.140
 when they download it they can scan what 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.819
 you can pass all the antivirus of the 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.799
 world they want can 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.999
 then search for the return to 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.230
 back and they'll see that it's totally 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:58.989
 clean zero 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.299
 but the virus so they can be 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.640
 quiet are free of cinema is 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.430
 look how average antivirus that has 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.269
 virus I will not solve it or like but not 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.400
 have a virus here we are going to open it and 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.790
 let's say do not extract in the 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.299
 desk or where you want 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.299
 okay 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:24.170
 when we have it here 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.230
 highlights that we open it we have three 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.520
 files because we go without any order 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.140
 the program is the first one called host 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.270
 which was the one that we deleted or the one that 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.690
 We are looking to erase but we 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.690
 we copy 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.709
 and we do not go to the folder again the 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.599
 folder here where then where 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.730
 we look for that it was windows I repeat 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.730
 again 7 32 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:54.090
 32 drivers 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.860
 and etc and here we paste it that's the first 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.480
 easy and simple step correct ok 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.430
 Next step will be planting shown 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.050
 we have this one called server this 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.630
 server point that is an application that 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.380
 create in conjunction with other applications 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.210
 of apache 2 and pipe hp to create a mini 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.150
 server 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.630
 on your pc momentarily for pages 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.730
 web then we just have to open it in 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.560
 my windows 8 comes out that is protecting 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.380
 the memory but we did more information 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.030
 we did run in windows xp or a 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.370
 windows 7 is not going to be anything just all 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.520
 open 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.520
 and we say that if they do not enter this black 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.970
 and now let's open our vote when 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.400
 we open our vote is not going to say that 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.220
 can not can not that authenticates 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.870
 automatic of the failed that please that 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.410
 you restore it we are well 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.760
 calm we go well instruments well 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.770
 Well, if we go to see the black window 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.110
 we see that the pse was not about 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.960
 communicate against our little ones 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.930
 Serbs and he sent us I tell him that he does not 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.940
 I'm going to update ok but if I 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.340
 we count here says event says error 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.330
 but says magic event not just 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.490
 we are cheating the new being 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.980
 telling him, even if we are wrong, say that 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.720
 it is correct ok 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.240
 and last step but the most important 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.550
 let's go crack open 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.630
 when we open it the same way we say 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:26.320
 that please execute 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.030
 ok and it's not going so I've done but I mean 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.550
 endiosan blog of 2006 that was not 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.160
 we started working with us server 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.380
 and those things being fabric or intimidate 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.090
 kings 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.800
 and here I leave my page to be 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.560
 a mystique out there they will see for van a 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.210
 see three things there are good guides 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.509
 we chase we give him crack 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.509
 ok when these four lines do not come out 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:51.910
 is that it is perfect that everything is ready 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:55.990
 now we are going to go here to the bosom bots 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:59.229
 let's say that user is like I do not know 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.849
 what lolas I like so that I like 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:04.300
 a lot and all my friends will do because 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:06.490
 they will laugh and record the gala and 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.860
 password just blah blah tell you that 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.039
 they hear it 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:16.289
 and says thank you do not remember them from playing 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:19.229
 the best server is a dot com ok 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:22.710
 apparently he is already jaqueado like 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:26.130
 we realize let's go open the tibia 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:29.070
 we can open the latest version in this 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.670
 case on this date is 10.76 which is the 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.500
 newer 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:35.910
 we are on April 9, 2015 but now 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.670
 we have tested it with all the versions 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.830
 before and so I serve and say 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.240
 what do we say we inject to the dan 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.730
 direct we see that the window is here 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.430
 we say inject and and here they are 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:50.790
 our in works now we can go alone 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.410
 to the black window minimize this and 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:56.460
 ready we can enter perfectly to 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:58.290
 play then for now that's all that's 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.880
