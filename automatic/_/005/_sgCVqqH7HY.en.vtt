00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.160 
actually be called the xbox 720 itself
but<00:01:15.579> yet<00:01:15.880> all<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.210> people<00:01:16.509> are<00:01:16.600> considering

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
but yet all the people are considering

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.200 
but yet all the people are considering
it<00:01:17.259> might<00:01:17.409> be<00:01:17.560> called<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:17.890> xbox<00:01:18.429> 8<00:01:18.729> hence

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
it might be called the xbox 8 hence

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.550

windows<00:01:20.140> 8<00:01:20.409> and<00:01:20.560> windows<00:01:21.179> phone<00:01:22.179> 8<00:01:22.450> etc<00:01:23.289> so

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
windows 8 and windows phone 8 etc so

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.429 
windows 8 and windows phone 8 etc so
that<00:01:23.799> makes<00:01:24.159> sense<00:01:24.280> as<00:01:24.640> well<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:25.509> mean<00:01:26.259> who

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
that makes sense as well so I mean who

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:27.810 
that makes sense as well so I mean who
really<00:01:26.560> knows<00:01:26.890> what<00:01:27.250> it's<00:01:27.369> really<00:01:27.520> going<00:01:27.729> to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
really knows what it's really going to

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.550 
really knows what it's really going to
be<00:01:27.880> called<00:01:28.119> but<00:01:28.359> right<00:01:28.570> now<00:01:28.750> I'm<00:01:29.020> going<00:01:29.380> by<00:01:29.500> the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
be called but right now I'm going by the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.889 
be called but right now I'm going by the
leaked<00:01:29.829> documents<00:01:29.859> and<00:01:30.789> I<00:01:31.539> would<00:01:31.689> definitely

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
leaked documents and I would definitely

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.209 
leaked documents and I would definitely
say<00:01:32.380> that<00:01:32.679> the<00:01:33.460> xbox<00:01:33.909> 720<00:01:34.420> is<00:01:34.780> most<00:01:35.679> likely<00:01:36.009> to

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
say that the xbox 720 is most likely to

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.819 
say that the xbox 720 is most likely to
be<00:01:36.520> named<00:01:36.789> for<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.270> next<00:01:37.509> Xbox<00:01:37.899> console<00:01:38.499> and

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
be named for the next Xbox console and

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.789 
be named for the next Xbox console and
what<00:01:39.640> I<00:01:39.670> really<00:01:39.939> like<00:01:40.090> about<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.600> xbox<00:01:41.020> 720

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
what I really like about the xbox 720

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.609 
what I really like about the xbox 720
name<00:01:42.189> is<00:01:42.460> that<00:01:42.939> it's<00:01:43.600> double<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.229> amount<00:01:44.380> of

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
name is that it's double the amount of

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.279 
name is that it's double the amount of
360<00:01:45.130> I<00:01:45.219> mean<00:01:45.399> you<00:01:45.490> add<00:01:45.670> 360<00:01:46.299> plus<00:01:46.569> 36<00:01:46.990> you<00:01:47.140> have

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
360 I mean you add 360 plus 36 you have

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.050 
360 I mean you add 360 plus 36 you have
720<00:01:47.950> I<00:01:47.979> think<00:01:48.249> that's<00:01:48.369> a<00:01:48.460> perfect<00:01:48.670> way<00:01:48.909> to

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
720 I think that's a perfect way to

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.649 
720 I think that's a perfect way to
imagine<00:01:49.450> it<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:50.499> know<00:01:50.649> like<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:52.270> just<00:01:52.479> like

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
imagine it you know like it's just like

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.510 
imagine it you know like it's just like
a<00:01:52.689> next-generation<00:01:53.200> console<00:01:53.979> I<00:01:54.100> just<00:01:54.249> like

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
a next-generation console I just like

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
Microsoft's purpose to do that because

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.740 
Microsoft's purpose to do that because
of<00:02:20.800> Windows<00:02:21.160> 8<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.610> wouldn't<00:02:22.450> really<00:02:22.510> make

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
of Windows 8 it wouldn't really make

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.650 
of Windows 8 it wouldn't really make
much<00:02:23.050> sense<00:02:23.080> if<00:02:23.680> windows<00:02:24.550> 9<00:02:24.910> would<00:02:25.300> come<00:02:25.510> out

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
much sense if windows 9 would come out

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.660 
much sense if windows 9 would come out
two<00:02:25.959> years<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.590> maybe<00:02:26.709> even<00:02:26.890> just<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.340> year

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
two years and maybe even just a year

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.370 
two years and maybe even just a year
after<00:02:27.880> windows<00:02:28.870> 8<00:02:29.140> launches<00:02:29.709> this<00:02:29.860> year<00:02:30.160> so

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
after windows 8 launches this year so

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.840 
after windows 8 launches this year so
that's<00:02:32.380> why<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.709> have<00:02:32.950> some<00:02:33.160> doubts<00:02:33.489> that<00:02:33.730> it

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
that's why I have some doubts that it

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.330 
that's why I have some doubts that it
would<00:02:34.120> even<00:02:34.390> be<00:02:34.420> called<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.959> xbox<00:02:35.380> eight<00:02:35.590> but

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
would even be called the xbox eight but

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.190 
would even be called the xbox eight but
all<00:02:37.030> right<00:02:37.239> there<00:02:37.480> is<00:02:37.630> still<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.959> big

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
all right there is still a big

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.320 
all right there is still a big
possibility<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:39.040> could<00:02:39.250> be<00:02:39.430> called<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:39.790> now

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
possibility it could be called that now

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.660 
possibility it could be called that now
onto<00:02:41.200> which<00:02:41.920> name<00:02:42.220> sounds<00:02:42.760> better<00:02:43.090> all<00:02:43.480> right

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
onto which name sounds better all right
