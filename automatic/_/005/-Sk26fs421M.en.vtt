 would be a little water worth in the nursery 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.250
 kindergarten 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.559

 the nfl guide is looking for and trying to find 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.260
 pick up another opponent's locomotive 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.409
 for a champion match and why are I 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.750
 have 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.840
 official law that deserves to 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.500
 hard match against direct defeating him 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.369
 On Roslyak he already which show tries 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.860
 hide run away from me hiding behind 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.409
 constantly general manager how much 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.520
 can i not recognize the automotive which 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.229
 set fire to the face that broke me 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.020
 my head was stitched so 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.510
 threw me on the table burning but I'm still 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.150
 equally got up and fought what would I 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.939
 the rival was not and never looked 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.220
 the truth never never looked for me 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.140
 leadership helped and assigned 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.409
 some other rival and lung 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:03.920
 or let me rest though there is a reason 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:08.119
 why is this happening because he 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.369
 afraid of me you're afraid of attention and I 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.260
 I know that you are afraid so you run 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:18.800
 still find you i 'll get you and 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.590
 take what belongs to me so here 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.690
 you have another chance 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.450
 no probably not the next because 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.390
 and how much can you give so let's say the whole 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:35.360
 last chance last chance to prove 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:42.440
 all that you are worth something loved by fans 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:48.620

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:56.780
 on one against me for the fourth title 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.940
 but I doubt of course because everything 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.670
 time you ran probably run away now 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:10.090
