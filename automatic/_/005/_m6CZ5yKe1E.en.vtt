used but uh yeah he's feeling the ass

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.550 
used but uh yeah he's feeling the ass
he's<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.060> pain<00:02:14.240> in<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.360> ass<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.570> even<00:02:14.990> get<00:02:15.440> too

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
he's a pain in the ass to even get too

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.200 
he's a pain in the ass to even get too
small<00:02:15.860> there<00:02:16.070> he<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.250> eclipsed<00:02:16.670> up<00:02:16.760> in<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:16.970> sky

um<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:18.680> think<00:02:18.860> it's<00:02:19.370> already<00:02:19.820> predetermined<00:02:20.180> if

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
um I think it's already predetermined if

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.260 
um I think it's already predetermined if
the<00:02:21.050> larvae<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.890> come<00:02:22.400> across<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:23.000> going

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
the larvae that you come across is going

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.330 
the larvae that you come across is going
to<00:02:23.420> turn<00:02:23.660> into<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:24.110> guy<00:02:24.350> or<00:02:24.500> not<00:02:24.620> like<00:02:25.220> they

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
to turn into this guy or not like they

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.420 
to turn into this guy or not like they
have<00:02:25.460> a<00:02:25.490> max<00:02:25.880> out<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.870> what<00:02:27.200> they

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
have a max out of what they

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.410 
have a max out of what they
metamorphosize<00:02:28.430> in<00:02:28.640> like<00:02:28.820> most<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.300> them<00:02:29.390> just

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
metamorphosize in like most of them just

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.199 
metamorphosize in like most of them just
go<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.750> badass<00:02:30.050> or<00:02:31.040> super<00:02:31.430> badass<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:32.090> that's

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
go to badass or super badass and that's

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.930 
go to badass or super badass and that's
about<00:02:32.330> it<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.950> mean<00:02:33.950> if<00:02:34.070> you<00:02:34.160> once<00:02:34.489> you<00:02:34.670> see<00:02:34.820> the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
about it I mean if you once you see the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.180 
about it I mean if you once you see the
ultimate<00:02:35.390> one<00:02:35.510> spawn<00:02:36.040> usually<00:02:37.040> that's

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
ultimate one spawn usually that's

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.500 
ultimate one spawn usually that's
probably<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:37.550> good<00:02:37.610> sign<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.970> he's<00:02:38.150> going<00:02:38.450> to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
probably a good sign that he's going to

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.100 
probably a good sign that he's going to
pop<00:02:38.690> up<00:02:40.000> but<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.209> don't<00:02:41.390> know<00:02:41.450> everything<00:02:41.840> isn't
