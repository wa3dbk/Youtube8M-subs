00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.500
 but we see all that is said the cost of these young people for more than a meter by 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.870
 year will pass again 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.209
 today explain to you how to create your own style 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.209
 to change the appearance of your character in x-men 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.059
 then you need the software is unpublished 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.150
 aliens will be available in the work 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.269
 your to avoid China 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.529
 tony's wife this folder 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.739
 you should be and start 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.270
 m6 is unpublished 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.960
 var points 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.230
 You, you are 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.600
 and by employee as toulouse that unpublished 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.010
 a news is this message 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.850
 so when it's the first time you launch 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 they asked to create a bookstore so question contain 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.490
 here 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.490
 listen so had for that to avoid launching 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.030
 % 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.700
 it's like that 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.300
 to change so for that times sauce and change the appearance of your 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.230
 character 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.700
 so here you have color palette 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.930
 you can choose any color 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.860
 here it would not say colors to choose we are hungry for colors 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.630
 finally three tons and he is there on the hud 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.270
 south korea you wrote the world 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.900
 when the big picture 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.990
 with whom details 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.890
 but of course same sentence I remember a cube game 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.170
 so the madiran cuban wax character and square tent 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.600
 powder 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.509
 so every square in paris morning a part of the body just slide 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:35.880
 among those 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.200
 the bridge the face of the character 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.030
 for me what I thought to do it is for example 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.030
 author 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 we see here m 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.850
 this is how 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.840
 to the point a color that makes the color of the skin 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.870
 and you through the small tooling south wall hanging sauce 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.910
 tickets 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.530
 eyi of the elders to turn him 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.619
 all the painting 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.349
 emc 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.579
 the whole picture 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.369
 we have the same color so that is to say the color of the body for example of your 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.019
 character in this case 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.099
 then you have a man whose face on the arms the bottom is a little 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.149
 there the head 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.179
 we expect a little more pink than I do anything it's just to show 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:31.149
 hardly enough of a little imagination 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:34.109
 to find out what you want to do 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.109
 a settler and all that 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.189
 you see people a character 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.409
 his face is number 11 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.259
 so you can created 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:48.359
 % a character from scratch sicily for the head 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:52.799
 according to the head 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.849
 ap i'm going to do it's to show that's it and so you have each part 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.499
 of the table what a part of the body is the same I want the 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:03.060
 put in touch to do this I go in the game with what is written 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:05.759
 so far 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:07.550
 that's why we all 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.209
 1 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.839
 Las 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:12.859
 why not 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.719
 françois dovecote 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:16.969
 Yes 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:18.009
 point bar 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.569
 and you see him killing his pants 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.569
 e 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:27.849
 the world-city makes very quickly I remember once again 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:31.919
 but to convince him not so sure shape 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.460
 it's for the body Thursday 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.889
 three years ago 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.429
 Schäuble 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:41.429
 here 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.129
 like what favored 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.359
 these are ample side since it is the right part 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.829
 and difficult to choose all 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.249
 along his body for what 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:55.119
 so if you want me to make a T-shirt 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:58.119
 just do not work the thief arm 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.799
 if his 100 th 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.799
 I'm surprised they're dead 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.499
 and here is armst here 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:09.749
 so the figures not corrected pardon if you want to put that the losc 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:13.199
 is that a certain size of sleeve 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.840
 colas and all that leaving 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.799
 a skin color for the rest 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.329
 now you see that 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.329
 then there are still seven central sleeves 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:27.369
 if you want to make them eyes for example just put some white 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.080
 because 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:36.969
 I am a little too much maybe 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:40.340
 whereas on Saturday 17 for 100 th 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.340
 to equip the color that you have already used 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.249
 here 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.069
 to see m ti-white 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:49.960
 with the title 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.960
 further 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.959
 how do you say back from time to time it can happen britney not sing 

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:06.229
 repeat to color 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.229
 I find 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.270
 1 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.069
 1 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:15.650
 and you take 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.309
 at least 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:20.029
 yes on the side like these for example 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:23.029
 and hairs us with our character that is starting to take shape 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.259
 sometimes you're done that you're happy with our result in 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.919
 it's enough to go bankrupt 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.219
 seiler 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.879

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:38.779

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.430
 here 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.860
 and then 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.409
 so you have it 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.669
 in the file 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.669
