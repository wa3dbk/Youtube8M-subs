00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.680
 today we are trying to make you soft 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.940
 that's why I'm going to stand it 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.340
 pond still nice to agree 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.180
 maybe find what coins we are going 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.200
 see for yourself 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.200
 I finished a nice job 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.490
 the 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.190
 unfortunately no meter 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.540
 ring with all these 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.410
 just like a forest you will find one 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.410
 for them, nails are nails 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:02.140
 so not so special unfortunately 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:07.300
 I just keep writing nails off 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.300
 so perfect leader fullness but this 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.289
 you are going to tackle it tomorrow 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.120
 part of a can the lid 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.120
 Peter 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.250
 okay 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.599
 again and that 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.860
 unfortunately 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.660
 well we went to the beach today 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.510
 and been a lot of junk but found 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.760
 although long currants but less fun 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.120
 then we thought 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.680
 first we had found one 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.410
 take me i cleaned on the test 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.860
 do is just you that he is back 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.400
 even cleaner, but it works 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.790
 so nice with larger in 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.459
 and later we thought we were 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.770
 encountered a coin 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.100
 but that turns even just you 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:38.670
 so that is very special anyway 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.020
 so on the street today if it isn't 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.060
 good luck 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.130
 however we went back later to 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.310
 fair in haarlem 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.989
 and then you still find a requirement such a button 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.940
 to the ground 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.209
 chair funny that you do not now 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.070
 metal detector is just the 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.470
 simple cloud button but when you just got around 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.540
 ground then it is so special 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.299
 So I think it is now a funny 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.100
 still be found at the end of the day 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:09.030
 super modern nothing nothing special to me 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.830
