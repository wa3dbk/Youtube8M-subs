was<00:05:44.580> kind<00:05:44.880> of<00:05:45.210> forced<00:05:45.480> into<00:05:45.840> trying<00:05:46.140> it<00:05:46.290> again

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
was kind of forced into trying it again

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.240 
was kind of forced into trying it again
today<00:05:47.510> even<00:05:48.510> though<00:05:48.720> I<00:05:48.990> made<00:05:49.560> a<00:05:49.590> big<00:05:49.860> pot<00:05:50.220> of

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
today even though I made a big pot of

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.960 
today even though I made a big pot of
pasta<00:05:51.120> Feghouli<00:05:51.930> soup<00:05:52.230> and<00:05:52.740> this<00:05:53.310> is<00:05:53.430> it<00:05:53.610> here

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
pasta Feghouli soup and this is it here

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.540 
pasta Feghouli soup and this is it here
now<00:05:54.270> it<00:05:54.390> just<00:05:54.419> so<00:05:54.750> happened<00:05:55.200> that<00:05:55.440> the<00:05:56.250> girls

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
now it just so happened that the girls

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.820 
now it just so happened that the girls
are<00:05:56.820> not<00:05:57.000> a<00:05:57.180> big<00:05:57.450> fan<00:05:57.720> of<00:05:57.780> this<00:05:58.110> because<00:05:58.500> of<00:05:58.530> the

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
are not a big fan of this because of the

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.670 
are not a big fan of this because of the
sausage<00:05:59.340> in<00:05:59.580> it<00:05:59.700> and<00:05:59.910> so<00:06:00.690> they<00:06:00.900> decided<00:06:01.290> they

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
sausage in it and so they decided they

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.500 
sausage in it and so they decided they
wanted<00:06:02.100> something<00:06:02.490> different<00:06:02.640> and<00:06:03.120> what<00:06:03.419> did

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
wanted something different and what did

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.940 
wanted something different and what did
they<00:06:03.540> go<00:06:03.840> to<00:06:03.919> it<00:06:04.919> went<00:06:05.160> to<00:06:05.310> this<00:06:05.900> so<00:06:06.950> we

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
they go to it went to this so we

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.320 
they go to it went to this so we
realized<00:06:08.340> that<00:06:08.430> we<00:06:08.520> hadn't<00:06:08.850> actually<00:06:08.970> done<00:06:09.180> a

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
realized that we hadn't actually done a

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.650 
realized that we hadn't actually done a
video<00:06:09.510> taste<00:06:10.350> testing<00:06:10.830> of<00:06:10.980> this<00:06:11.210> and<00:06:12.210> decided

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
video taste testing of this and decided

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.080 
video taste testing of this and decided
to<00:06:12.870> do<00:06:13.050> that<00:06:13.260> so<00:06:13.560> I<00:06:13.770> will<00:06:14.430> go<00:06:14.460> ahead<00:06:14.610> and<00:06:14.880> try

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
to do that so I will go ahead and try

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:22.560 
to do that so I will go ahead and try
this<00:06:15.120> again

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.469 

and<00:06:23.570> this<00:06:23.810> this<00:06:24.370> is<00:06:25.370> very<00:06:25.610> good<00:06:25.880> and<00:06:26.030> like<00:06:26.150> John
