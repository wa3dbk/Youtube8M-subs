rabbit's<00:01:48.240> foot<00:01:48.450> here<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.170> don't<00:01:49.649> know<00:01:49.740> if<00:01:49.829> we

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
rabbit's foot here I don't know if we

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.289 
rabbit's foot here I don't know if we
should<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.220> able<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.579> one<00:01:50.700> seems<00:01:51.240> like

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
should be able to get one seems like

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.350 
should be able to get one seems like
maybe<00:01:51.540> that's<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.079> rarity<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.149> can

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
maybe that's a rarity here so you can

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.480 
maybe that's a rarity here so you can
get<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.720> get<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.049> rabbit<00:01:55.350> hide<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.340> get

lucky rabbit's foot you know it's good

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.020 
lucky rabbit's foot you know it's good
luck<00:02:03.360> time<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.530> get<00:02:04.680> rabbit's<00:02:05.430> foot<00:02:05.579> so

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
luck time you can get rabbit's foot so

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.600 
luck time you can get rabbit's foot so
toast<00:02:06.780> I'm<00:02:07.170> gonna<00:02:07.350> leave<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.740> because<00:02:08.190> you

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
not done with rabbits yet so you're

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.449 
not done with rabbits yet so you're
wondering<00:03:55.530> probably<00:03:56.010> with<00:03:56.100> what<00:03:56.370> the

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
wondering probably with what the

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.740 
wondering probably with what the
rabbit's<00:03:56.730> foot<00:03:56.880> can<00:03:57.090> do<00:03:57.209> well<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.450> rabbit's

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
rabbit's foot can do well the rabbit's

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.240 
rabbit's foot can do well the rabbit's
foot<00:03:57.900> can<00:03:58.230> be<00:03:58.260> used<00:03:58.650> in<00:03:58.920> order<00:03:59.100> to<00:03:59.160> make

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
foot can be used in order to make

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.600 
foot can be used in order to make
potions<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.209> leapin<00:04:01.020> so<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.709> basic<00:04:02.010> potion<00:04:02.459> of

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
potions of leapin so the basic potion of

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.320 
potions of leapin so the basic potion of
leapin<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:04.020> simply<00:04:04.500> awkward<00:04:05.190> potions<00:04:05.640> plus

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
leapin is simply awkward potions plus

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.110 
leapin is simply awkward potions plus
rabbit's<00:04:06.780> foot<00:04:06.930> let<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:07.980> go<00:04:08.130> on<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.730> do<00:04:08.970> its

rabbit's foot let it go on and do its
thing<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.630> brew<00:04:09.990> and<00:04:10.320> then<00:04:10.830> you<00:04:10.980> get<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.160> potion

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
thing and brew and then you get a potion

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.130

modifiers that you put in to to get the
potion<00:04:16.859> of<00:04:17.130> leaping<00:04:17.940> too<00:04:18.209> but<00:04:19.020> then<00:04:19.109> you

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
potion of leaping too but then you

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.900 
potion of leaping too but then you

obviously combined with gunpowder to the
splash<00:04:21.540> potion<00:04:21.960> so<00:04:22.200> anyway<00:04:23.190> here<00:04:23.460> we<00:04:23.490> go

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
splash potion so anyway here we go

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.750 
splash potion so anyway here we go
almost<00:04:24.110> finished

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
almost finished

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.450

there we are potion of leaping three
minutes<00:04:29.790> this<00:04:29.970> could<00:04:30.150> be<00:04:30.240> consumed<00:04:30.660> if<00:04:30.900> we<00:04:31.050> go

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
minutes this could be consumed if we go

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.920 
minutes this could be consumed if we go
into<00:04:31.590> survival<00:04:32.460> so<00:04:32.880> why<00:04:33.090> don't<00:04:33.420> we<00:04:33.630> do<00:04:33.900> that

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
into survival so why don't we do that

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.250 
into survival so why don't we do that
consume<00:04:34.710> our<00:04:34.890> potion<00:04:35.790> leaping<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.450> then<00:04:36.660> you
