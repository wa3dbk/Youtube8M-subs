00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.359 
I suppose you might actually have thin
hair<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.840> not<00:02:01.079> really<00:02:01.439> even<00:02:01.770> realize<00:02:02.159> you

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
hair and not really even realize you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.340 
hair and not really even realize you
actually<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> form<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.600> hair<00:02:03.780> loss<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.200> how

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
actually have a form of hair loss so how

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.709 
actually have a form of hair loss so how
would<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.649> identify<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.790> was<00:02:05.939> hair<00:02:06.479> loss

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
would you identify that it was hair loss

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.490 
would you identify that it was hair loss
well<00:02:08.030> hair<00:02:09.030> grows<00:02:09.360> about<00:02:09.690> half<00:02:09.989> an<00:02:10.170> inch<00:02:10.289> a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
well hair grows about half an inch a

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.170 
well hair grows about half an inch a
month<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.640> goes<00:02:11.790> through<00:02:12.030> different

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
month and it goes through different

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.180 
month and it goes through different
stages

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
stages

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.520 
stages
we<00:02:13.280> phase<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.910> resting<00:02:14.300> phase<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.810> then<00:02:14.930> the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
we phase the resting phase and then the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.050 
we phase the resting phase and then the
hair<00:02:15.710> follicle<00:02:16.220> dies<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.670> hair<00:02:16.820> comes

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
hair follicle dies and the hair comes

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.660 
hair follicle dies and the hair comes
out<00:02:17.300> so<00:02:17.840> you're<00:02:17.990> naturally<00:02:18.200> losing<00:02:19.130> hay<00:02:19.340> all

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670
