picks up a guitar sort of sound and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.560 
picks up a guitar sort of sound and
that's<00:00:41.129> controlled<00:00:41.579> by<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.879> style<00:00:42.329> over

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
that's controlled by this style over

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.470 
that's controlled by this style over
here<00:00:42.809> which<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> volume<00:00:43.590> dial<00:00:44.090> this<00:00:45.090> volume

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
here which is a volume dial this volume

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.680 
here which is a volume dial this volume
controls<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:47.340> piezo<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.480> switch

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
controls the piezo and then this switch

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.110 
controls the piezo and then this switch
here<00:00:48.899> also<00:00:49.140> blends<00:00:49.620> equals<00:00:50.190> magnetics

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
here also blends equals magnetics

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.840 
here also blends equals magnetics
that'll<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.449> your<00:00:51.719> pickups<00:00:52.050> running<00:00:52.850> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
that'll be just your pickups running and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.880 
that'll be just your pickups running and
then<00:00:54.000> when<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.180> go<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.420> middle

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
then when you go in the middle

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.549 
then when you go in the middle
that'll<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:55.980> your<00:00:56.129> pickups<00:00:56.899> plus<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.320> piezo

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
that'll be your pickups plus the piezo

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.060 
that'll be your pickups plus the piezo
bridge<00:00:58.890> running<00:00:59.480> and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:01.469> year<00:01:01.770> is

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
bridge running and then this year is

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.590 
bridge running and then this year is
your<00:01:02.250> humbucker<00:01:02.730> switches<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.420> here

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
your humbucker switches this one here

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840 
your humbucker switches this one here
it's<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.080> humbucker<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.700> other

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
it's for this humbucker and the other

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.450 
it's for this humbucker and the other
one's<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.270> one<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.619> you'll<00:01:08.100> they'll

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
one's for this one so you'll they'll

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.090 
one's for this one so you'll they'll
switch<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.850> from<00:01:08.909> that's<00:01:09.869> coil<00:01:10.500> tap<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.010> then

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
switch it from that's coil tap and then

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.580 
switch it from that's coil tap and then
there's<00:01:11.250> series<00:01:11.580> parallel<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.420> each<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.530> you

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
there's series parallel for each so you

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.380 
there's series parallel for each so you
can<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:13.860> single<00:01:14.580> coil<00:01:14.790> sounds<00:01:15.090> out<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.299> them

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
can get single coil sounds out of them

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.600 
can get single coil sounds out of them
and<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.350> gives<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.650> tone<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.340> we've<00:01:17.460> got<00:01:17.580> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
and this gives you tone so we've got a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.690 
and this gives you tone so we've got a
main<00:01:18.390> volume<00:01:18.570> master<00:01:19.080> volume<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.700> five

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
main volume master volume for this five

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.969 
main volume master volume for this five
ways<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:20.970> controls<00:01:21.570> these<00:01:21.720> magnetic<00:01:22.680> pickups

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
ways to controls these magnetic pickups

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.850 
ways to controls these magnetic pickups
as<00:01:23.100> well<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.729> fender<00:01:24.030> style<00:01:24.360> so

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
as well just like a fender style so

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.550 
as well just like a fender style so
volume<00:01:25.860> 5<00:01:26.460> way<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.000> tone<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
volume 5 way and tone and this is the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.450 
volume 5 way and tone and this is the
blend<00:01:28.829> dial<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> piezo<00:01:31.280> volume<00:01:32.280> well

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
blend dial for the piezo volume well

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.679 
blend dial for the piezo volume well
it's<00:01:32.579> actually<00:01:32.850> nuts<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.210> volume<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
it's actually nuts on volume it's a

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.539 
it's actually nuts on volume it's a
blindness<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.170> volume<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.530> think<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.189> let's

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
blindness and volume I think and let's

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.940 
blindness and volume I think and let's
use<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:36.799> tuner

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
use a tuner

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.920 
use a tuner
so<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:38.970> usual<00:01:39.119> demonstration<00:01:39.720> touch<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.100> it'll

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
so as usual demonstration touch it it'll

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.230 
so as usual demonstration touch it it'll
go<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.259> blink<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.000> touch

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
go on and blink like that you just touch

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.749 
go on and blink like that you just touch
it<00:01:45.360> again<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.630> turn<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.869> off<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.759> starts

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
it again to turn it off it just starts

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.940 
it again to turn it off it just starts
red<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.090> goes<00:01:48.240> green<00:01:48.479> as<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.110> mean<00:01:49.740> Start

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
red and goes green as the I mean Start

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.499 
red and goes green as the I mean Start
screen<00:01:50.040> goes<00:01:50.369> red<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.880> comes<00:01:51.119> into<00:01:51.240> tune

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
screen goes red as it comes into tune

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.020 
screen goes red as it comes into tune
and<00:01:52.140> that's<00:01:52.829> pretty<00:01:53.040> much<00:01:53.159> all<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> horn

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and that's pretty much all the horn

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.030 
and that's pretty much all the horn
that's<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.600> thing<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.020> I'll<00:01:55.680> flip<00:01:55.920> it

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
that's in that thing and I'll flip it

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.850 
that's in that thing and I'll flip it
over<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:57.060> she'll<00:01:57.329> turn<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.869> fiber

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
over here like she'll turn on the fiber

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.999 
over here like she'll turn on the fiber
optics<00:01:59.280> here<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.259> see<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> fiber<00:02:01.619> optics

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
optics here you can see the fiber optics

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.050 
optics here you can see the fiber optics
turned<00:02:02.219> on<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> side<00:02:03.200> all<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> front<00:02:04.560> markers

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
turned on the side all the front markers

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.670 
turned on the side all the front markers
it's<00:02:06.060> got<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> nice<00:02:06.420> teal<00:02:06.780> sort<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.200> color<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.560> it

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
it's got a nice teal sort of color to it

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.420 
it's got a nice teal sort of color to it
and<00:02:09.470> that's<00:02:10.470> how<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.830> works<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.190> I'll<00:02:11.310> just

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
and that's how that works so I'll just

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.250 
and that's how that works so I'll just
flip<00:02:11.580> over<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.970> back<00:02:12.150> here

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
optics control vial over here so it runs

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.350 
optics control vial over here so it runs
down<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.720> goes<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.230> LED<00:03:04.680> over<00:03:04.920> here<00:03:05.360> and

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
down and goes to the LED over here and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.640 
down and goes to the LED over here and
that's<00:03:06.870> pretty<00:03:07.170> much<00:03:07.230> everything<00:03:07.410> and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
that's pretty much everything and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.800 
that's pretty much everything and
everything<00:03:07.890> else<00:03:07.980> knows<00:03:08.250> just<00:03:08.549> ulti<00:03:09.540> mishmash

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
everything else knows just ulti mishmash

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.630 
everything else knows just ulti mishmash
to<00:03:10.200> really<00:03:10.410> show<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.739> but<00:03:10.890> it's<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.459> lot<00:03:11.610> of

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
to really show you but it's a lot of

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.979 
to really show you but it's a lot of
wiring<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:12.090> there<00:03:12.209> so<00:03:12.360> pretty<00:03:12.510> much<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.870> can

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
wiring in there so pretty much you can

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.559 
wiring in there so pretty much you can
get<00:03:13.400> just<00:03:14.400> about<00:03:14.640> any<00:03:14.849> toe<00:03:15.060> another<00:03:15.329> thing<00:03:15.540> a

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
get just about any toe another thing a

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.809 
get just about any toe another thing a
lot<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.200> v<00:03:16.500> 1<00:03:16.650> 3<00:03:16.829> d<00:03:16.890> Apollo<00:03:17.220> all<00:03:17.609> Reed

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
lot like the v 1 3 d Apollo all Reed

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.490 
lot like the v 1 3 d Apollo all Reed
Smith<00:03:18.000> has<00:03:18.209> there<00:03:18.450> but<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.989> don't<00:03:19.350> know<00:03:19.410> how

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
Smith has there but I don't know how

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.470 
Smith has there but I don't know how
there<00:03:19.709> is<00:03:19.799> wired<00:03:20.100> because<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:21.180> can<00:03:21.329> pretty

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
there is wired because you can pretty

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.229 
there is wired because you can pretty
much<00:03:21.569> get<00:03:21.810> any<00:03:21.989> tone<00:03:22.170> because<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.440> got<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
much get any tone because you got the

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.199 
much get any tone because you got the
all<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.540> other<00:03:25.609> options<00:03:26.609> with<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.940> piezo

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
all the other options with the piezo

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.240 
all the other options with the piezo
bridge<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.720> everything<00:03:28.260> like<00:03:28.350> that<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:28.650> noise

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
bridge and everything like that so noise

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.330 
bridge and everything like that so noise
that's<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.989> torque<00:03:30.989> between<00:03:31.200> strap<00:03:31.920> locks<00:03:32.100> on

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
that's the torque between strap locks on

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.620 
that's the torque between strap locks on
there<00:03:32.459> he<00:03:32.549> just<00:03:32.730> has<00:03:32.819> to<00:03:32.910> get<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> strap<00:03:33.269> for<00:03:33.450> it

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
there he just has to get a strap for it

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.840 
there he just has to get a strap for it
and<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.769> had<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.069> Russian<00:03:35.459> get<00:03:35.549> this<00:03:35.700> thing

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
and I had the Russian get this thing

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.509 
and I had the Russian get this thing
finished<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.510> thank<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.500> yeah
