no not the door well I know you can call
it<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.110> doing<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.439> right<00:01:27.110> so<00:01:28.110> anyway<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
it just not doing it right so anyway the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.800 
it just not doing it right so anyway the
next<00:01:29.130> thing<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.030> take<00:01:30.240> force<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
next thing is if you take force and and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.390 
next thing is if you take force and and
yeah<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.869> put<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.340> makes

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
yeah you put it just like this it makes

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.140 
yeah you put it just like this it makes
sense<00:01:36.000> them<00:01:36.500> and<00:01:38.540> there<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:41.150> spiders

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
sense them and there it is and spiders

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.420 
sense them and there it is and spiders
can<00:01:42.479> now<00:01:42.600> climb<00:01:42.960> up<00:01:43.170> walls<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.159> cannot

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
can now climb up walls but they cannot

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.179 
can now climb up walls but they cannot
climb<00:01:44.729> up<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.210> sand<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.380> sands<00:01:46.710> them<00:01:46.979> so

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
climb up on sand and sands them so

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.649 
climb up on sand and sands them so
that's<00:01:47.340> why<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.579> may<00:01:47.880> want<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.149> make<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:51.530> and

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
that's why you may want to make that and

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.969 
that's why you may want to make that and
next<00:01:54.659> we're<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.140> make<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.320> dispenser

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
next we're going to make a dispenser

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.639 
next we're going to make a dispenser
which<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.670> secret<00:01:57.030> item<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:58.229> he<00:01:58.350> added

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
which is the secret item that he added

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.310 
which is the secret item that he added
so<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.280> put<00:01:59.579> seven<00:02:00.030> cobblestone<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.869> bow<00:02:01.170> in

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
so you put seven cobblestone a bow in

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.709 
so you put seven cobblestone a bow in
the<00:02:01.380> middle<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.130> redstone<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.540> makes

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the middle and a redstone and it makes

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.940 
the middle and a redstone and it makes
dispenser<00:02:05.390> so<00:02:06.390> let's<00:02:06.990> go<00:02:07.290> outside<00:02:07.740> real<00:02:07.890> quick

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
dispenser so let's go outside real quick

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.930 
dispenser so let's go outside real quick
and<00:02:08.250> test<00:02:08.489> this

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.780 

so<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.330> place<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.930> down<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.430> then<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.640> could

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
so you place it down and then you could

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.850 
so you place it down and then you could
load<00:02:14.970> up<00:02:15.000> your<00:02:15.120> items<00:02:15.570> i'm<00:02:16.020> going<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.770> use

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
snowballs arrows and eggs and those are

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.760 
snowballs arrows and eggs and those are
the<00:02:20.430> three<00:02:20.700> things<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.030> fly<00:02:21.420> actually<00:02:21.870> the

the three things that fly actually the
other<00:02:22.830> things<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.550> go<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:24.270> about<00:02:24.750> two

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
other things just go like about two

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.650
