00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.070
 Astana 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.640
 but it seems 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.640
 about losing 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.999
 piece by piece 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.090
 dear to him 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.399
 center field 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.399
 visiting museums accountants concluded 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.840
 we all know that 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.240
 program and it is now at 2 4 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.940
 on board diseases hope 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.940
 or take on the situation 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.000
 on Saturday in the capital of this migration and what 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 there 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.760
 I understand what it is 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.030
 maybe just felt 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.030
 we can score 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.820
 Pushkin's game 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820
 just what really notices here 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.330
 speak now 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.210
 so as shelling on communication with speech 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.220
 tell our mutual understanding with 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.950
 new partners 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.909
 found but 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.830
 he but here's the process we emphasize that this 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.310
 as a human rights activist said 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.830
 psychologically hard 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.750
 hence the stones 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.010
 what to think 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.549
 with commanded 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.550
 very decent 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.110
 a reminder of many things 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.110
 psychological training for this 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.870
 moment 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.020
 seek from virtual 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.179
 because before the third consecutive game of officers 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:01.310

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:14.729
 I have no chances that bing 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.269
 speak because of this connection with 300 but player 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.309
