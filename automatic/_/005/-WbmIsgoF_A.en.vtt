through it's really stressful after the
first<00:00:50.250> three<00:00:50.550> weeks<00:00:50.820> basically<00:00:51.719> everyone<00:00:52.140> was

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
first three weeks basically everyone was

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.080 
first three weeks basically everyone was
like<00:00:52.410> counting<00:00:52.829> us<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.190> an<00:00:53.430> already<00:00:53.789> relegated

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
like counting us as an already relegated

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.420 
like counting us as an already relegated
team<00:00:54.510> week<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.440> loss<00:00:55.620> was<00:00:55.860> phonetic<00:00:56.280> was

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
team week one loss was phonetic was

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.279 
team week one loss was phonetic was
definitely<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.270> biggest<00:00:57.570> loss<00:00:57.899> because

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
definitely like the biggest loss because

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.250

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
I think none of our LCS losses was like

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.039 
I think none of our LCS losses was like
that<00:01:01.469> big<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> stump<00:01:02.359> that's<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.570> 84
