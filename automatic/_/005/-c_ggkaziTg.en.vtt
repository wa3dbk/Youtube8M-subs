I guess the knife-throwing act didn't

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:59.350 
I guess the knife-throwing act didn't
work<00:01:41.540> out<00:01:41.750> so<00:01:50.590> yep<00:01:51.590> she's<00:01:51.980> real<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.850> not<00:01:59.090> you

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
work out so yep she's real and not you

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
great this is the right way but do we

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.190 
great this is the right way but do we
really<00:02:04.310> want<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.610> be<00:02:04.760> here

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.729 

I<00:02:07.399> think<00:02:08.399> they<00:02:08.610> combined<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.599> trapeze<00:02:10.319> with

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
I think they combined the trapeze with

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:26.339 
I think they combined the trapeze with
the<00:02:10.950> saw<00:02:11.190> lady<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.700> half
