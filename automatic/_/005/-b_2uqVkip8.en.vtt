00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.540 
actually pretty forgettable but I think
that's<00:00:28.260> what<00:00:28.439> causes<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.859> ones<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.340> stand

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
that's what causes the ones that stand

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.640 
that's what causes the ones that stand
out<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.789> most<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.359> do<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.410> Elite<00:00:31.619> Four
