00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello my name is a porsche i am 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.990
 table tennis racer from bonn and this one 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.950
 video I'll show you three common mistakes 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.950
 at serves 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.480
 could felling table tennis 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.300
 I'll refer to them today 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.740
 setbacks on the mistakes for that 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.730
 I do not show many first 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.590
 suggestions but the mistake could be 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.180
 across all auflege first 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.890
 see are just general 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.890
 Fault the duplex time noticed 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.480
 if we have a sentence here now 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:50.210
 serve with the backhand then 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:55.159
 see who I look like this is me 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:58.629
 I often do what they do 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:03.079
 because upload here 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.850
 the waiters up here and rod the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.990
 stay here and then move on 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.580
 page if I show you now then 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.649
 Do you have them that 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.960
 acceleration phase the short piece and 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.110
 everything she now pulls through it only 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.789
 Hot air plays at the bank 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.440
 means you have to in this short 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.820
 phase your whole speed to 100 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.600
 percent 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.600
 they'll do it like that 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.600
 how could that work in such a way 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.410
 short pieces all the energy too 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.090
 produce 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:47.490
 he needs to cut a lot 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.740
 That's why it's important to keep your pension high 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.720
 throw and then have the way here 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.930
 The must have distance from the ball with it 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.240
 We are also the decisive factor in this time 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:12.020
 could go through or even that 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:14.160
 can pull handling that is a 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.420
 Great difference if I am right here 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.040
 can pull through and this 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.580
 build up speed at all times 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.320
 can 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.450
 then I should be very close here 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.810
 start and then do a little bit 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.090
 he just lost you all this 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.580
 with such orders where you spend a lot 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.410
 the forearm or the whole arm 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.570
 wanted to go through the same cost in too 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.970
 the foresight search will do it 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.920
 so here and then want to go through the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.140
 people perform the little wrist 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:50.090
 they were so close to the ball 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.090
 By contrast, the breweries ring 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:59.140
 rotation generated and clear we could 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.959
 Now that 's all very much 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.440
 transparent what you have and you can see 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.980
 early 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.360
 basta so it's true yes we have if 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.830
 we wanted to do that you the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.769
 you want to surprise opponents then you have to 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:16.209
 also here more from the wrist the 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.830
 make up and me out of the me 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.530
 now for general for the time 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.900
 area and many unterklassige the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.280
 people are playing so exciting more 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.829
 here from the forearm from the whole on 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.140
 that's why not meant too close to the ball 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.880
 States looked a little further away 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.170
 Ferrari does not manage it either 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.579
 of five meters also his 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.530
 to be at top speed 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.569
 needed to know and that with yours 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.060
 Musculature, too, I can do it here 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.769
 but already your top speed 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.280
 but it takes you to get here 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.280
 runs through 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:58.170
 error number two that I often 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.820
 is the right ball high which was 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.950
 Do we need theirs first? 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.630
 at least 16 inches that is 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.170
 ever the rule the table tennis 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.930
 purports 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:11.100
 if you like to throw the ball up 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.810
 or just 30 inches that is the 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.020
 crucial question and then you have to 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.900
 really your right yours 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.400
 find the right height 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.630
 First of all there are many who are here then 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.790
 so what we had the Balkan 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.590
 firstly wrong and secondly credit 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.030
 no speed at all and also 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.560
 do not bring in a cut because they are 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.920
 do not have your own energy from the 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.720
 ball 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.610
 and because it's all too tight and 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.340
 They are thus much too hectic 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.590
 then there are the people right 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.270
 they always want to look cool in the ball 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.380
 high throw but none at all 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.300
 have coordination 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.250
 When should she play the ball? 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.770
 Exaggerates it with the throw too 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.250
 do not look for the height where you are 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.110
 always feels good doing you 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.970
 nothing artificial about old ones you do not 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.590
 can 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.440
 therefore the right flying height of the 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.380
 balles so that ball throw is enormous 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.600
 important that you also have time, for example 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:11.870
 if we are here now also about time 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.870
 have something like that makes a little show or 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.919
 you could have against it 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.990
 the whole time has something out too 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.759
 to pick up or over angle and 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.759
 just to create an illusion 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.880
 Error number three is also a 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.500
 the mistake is to throw it upside down 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:43.389
 experience also that people you something 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:51.250
 make the body inside 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:55.900
 we turn sideways the other direction 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:58.690
 you will live so much through yourself 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.190
 just directly the the most important 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.710
 starting position around good 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.979
 to be able to play when the ball 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:10.389
 from being thrown up so high that me 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:13.509
 Play yours up here or that's ok 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:16.000
 the body of the conditions is says white 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.039
 too tight then we can not do a good one 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.440
 make driveway then it is really only 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:23.979
 a training run that you do a few times 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.300
 The balls will be high, especially the then 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.130
 come down again and 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.909
 that she does not have that cant after 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:32.680
 outside or to place or questionable on 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.639
 worst conciliatory forward that 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.419
 she here 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:40.930
 Overlay on the place that's why you very much 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:43.000
 important just because he is enormously important 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.680
 the height I have a mistake 2 already 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.349
 What said but just is synonymous 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.409
 important factor where I often see 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:52.060
 focus on starting the markets 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:54.340
 be so on your faster and that you 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.830
 do everything right now and right 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.050
 Cool but ultimately the ball 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.900
 is bad thrown up then it can 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.490
 not a good start if he 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.719
 Take these three tips to heart 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.719
 then you have a good step 

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:08.750
 made sure that we hang up better 

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.790
 hinbekommt 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.530
 that they have good qualitative markups 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.120
 I hope the video has you 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.000
 If yes, give a thumbs up 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.810
 Upwards I am always very amused 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.760
 then you will become our channel 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.500
 notifies about every new video 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.860
 we put online and missed none 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.540
 more 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.540
 my name is jannik haut
