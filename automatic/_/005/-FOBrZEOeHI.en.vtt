take the SIM card out you're going to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.680 
take the SIM card out you're going to
put<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> t-mobile<00:00:46.620> SIM<00:00:46.950> card<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.309> now<00:00:47.690> no

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
put the t-mobile SIM card it now no

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.319 
put the t-mobile SIM card it now no
you're<00:00:49.289> timbo<00:00:49.739> will<00:00:49.950> sim<00:00:50.190> card<00:00:50.520> has<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.090> have

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
you're timbo will sim card has to have

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.410 
you're timbo will sim card has to have
data<00:00:51.930> plan<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:53.160> only<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.270> make

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
data plan if you only have like to make

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.910 
data plan if you only have like to make
phone<00:00:54.629> calls<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.289> will<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:55.559> work<00:00:55.620> because

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
phone calls this will not work because

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.310 
phone calls this will not work because
it<00:00:56.129> needs<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> network<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.570> register<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> sim

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it needs to network to register the sim

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.740 
it needs to network to register the sim
that<00:00:59.070> that's<00:00:59.340> one<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.910> my<00:00:59.969> problems<00:01:00.000> right<00:01:00.449> now

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
that that's one of my problems right now

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.630 
that that's one of my problems right now
so<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.230> need<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> sim<00:01:01.770> card<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.160> bought<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.340> sim

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
so you need a sim card you bought a sim

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.130 
so you need a sim card you bought a sim
card<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.969> i<00:01:03.000> could<00:01:03.149> register<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.750> simple

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
card so i could register that simple

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.740 
card so i could register that simple
t-mobile<00:01:04.769> network<00:01:05.119> but<00:01:06.119> since<00:01:06.420> i<00:01:06.510> don't<00:01:06.570> have

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
t-mobile network but since i don't have

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.450 
t-mobile network but since i don't have
a<00:01:06.840> data<00:01:07.140> plan<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.740> sim<00:01:07.950> card<00:01:08.220> because<00:01:08.400> i

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
a data plan on this sim card because i

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.000 
a data plan on this sim card because i
don't<00:01:08.640> really<00:01:08.760> need<00:01:09.409> t-mobile<00:01:10.409> I'm<00:01:10.590> just

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
don't really need t-mobile I'm just

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.120 
don't really need t-mobile I'm just
doing<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.640> video<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.950> you'll<00:01:13.950> see

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
doing this for the video then you'll see

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.499 
doing this for the video then you'll see
what<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.280> mean<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.760> away<00:01:14.820> when<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.210> put<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
what I mean right away when I put the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.120 
what I mean right away when I put the
sim<00:01:15.720> card<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.080> connects<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> network<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
sim card it connects to the network in a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.200 
sim card it connects to the network in a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
I'll get a voicemail from t-mobile the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.480 
I'll get a voicemail from t-mobile the

until<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:03.159> get<00:02:03.399> this<00:02:03.759> carrier<00:02:04.270> option<00:02:04.690> to

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
until you get this carrier option to

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.220 
until you get this carrier option to
stay<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:06.549> stay<00:02:06.850> there<00:02:07.090> there<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.630> is<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.989> keeps

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
stay to stay there there it is it keeps

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.820 
stay to stay there there it is it keeps
going<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:11.739> keep<00:02:11.860> doing<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.569> keep<00:02:13.569> trying

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:25.890 

turn<00:02:22.230> takes<00:02:23.230> me<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.410> bunch<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.739> times<00:02:23.980> but<00:02:24.900> it

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
turn takes me a bunch of times but it

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.840 
turn takes me a bunch of times but it
does<00:02:26.110> work<00:02:26.319> here<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:26.950> could<00:02:27.250> get<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.519> in<00:02:27.760> a

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
does work here I could get it in a

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:42.470 
does work here I could get it in a
minute<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:40.030> idea<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.569> get<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:40.840> carrier

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
minute the idea is to get that carrier

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.460 
minute the idea is to get that carrier
thing<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.660> stay<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.230> then<00:02:46.019> it's<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.200> glitch

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
thing to stay and then it's a glitch

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.259 
thing to stay and then it's a glitch
it's<00:02:47.680> not<00:02:47.830> an<00:02:47.950> official<00:02:48.400> unlock<00:02:48.700> this<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.090> why

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
it's not an official unlock this is why

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.870 
it's not an official unlock this is why
it's<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.660> I'm<00:02:50.650> doing<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.100> this<00:02:51.220> way<00:02:51.280> so<00:02:51.850> that
