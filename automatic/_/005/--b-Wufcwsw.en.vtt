12-millimeter and just unscrew them put

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.980 
12-millimeter and just unscrew them put
them<00:02:28.900> back<00:02:29.020> in<00:02:29.230> if<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.410> want<00:02:30.480> these<00:02:31.480> here

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
they just sit they just slide right in

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.190 
they just sit they just slide right in
there<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.960> it<00:02:35.110> guides<00:02:35.710> it<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.960> one<00:02:38.080> with

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
there and it guides it and the one with

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.780 
there and it guides it and the one with
the<00:02:38.260> tensioner<00:02:38.710> goes<00:02:39.240> there's<00:02:40.240> a<00:02:41.730> about<00:02:42.730> a

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
the tensioner goes there's a about a

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.900 
the tensioner goes there's a about a
quarter<00:02:43.150> inch<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.570> guess<00:02:43.960> I<00:02:44.860> don't<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.730> got<00:02:45.820> to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
quarter inch I guess I don't you got to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.970 
quarter inch I guess I don't you got to
take<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.210> it<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.140> holds<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.470> bottom<00:02:47.800> bolt

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
take to it and it holds the bottom bolt

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.620 
take to it and it holds the bottom bolt
on<00:02:48.130> otherwise<00:02:48.490> the<00:02:48.760> tensioner<00:02:49.150> holds<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.540> in

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
on otherwise the tensioner holds it in

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.950 
on otherwise the tensioner holds it in
place<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.820> those<00:02:51.820> are<00:02:52.090> ten<00:02:52.420> millimeter<00:02:53.130> so

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
place and those are ten millimeter so

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.360 
place and those are ten millimeter so
after<00:02:55.960> you<00:02:56.080> there's<00:02:56.380> taken<00:02:56.740> off<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:57.190> can

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
after you there's taken off you can

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.010 
after you there's taken off you can
start<00:02:57.610> working<00:02:57.850> on<00:02:57.910> your<00:02:58.000> timing<00:02:58.210> which<00:02:58.870> is

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
start working on your timing which is
