fifth string tune up to B do that a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.110 
fifth string tune up to B do that a
little<00:00:40.649> bit<00:00:40.920> carefully<00:00:41.399> no<00:00:41.579> need<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.850> break

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
little bit carefully no need to break

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.500 
little bit carefully no need to break
and<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.469> sixth<00:00:43.920> string<00:00:44.100> tubes<00:00:44.399> are<00:00:44.579> way<00:00:44.940> down

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
and the sixth string tubes are way down

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.190 
and the sixth string tubes are way down
to<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:48.239> mine's<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.570> little<00:00:48.780> bit<00:00:48.930> flat

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to be the mine's a little bit flat

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.690 
to be the mine's a little bit flat
because<00:00:49.500> when<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.680> can't<00:00:50.010> Bob<00:00:50.190> at<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.399> fifth

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
because when I can't Bob at the fifth

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.119 
because when I can't Bob at the fifth
fret<00:00:50.790> it<00:00:51.450> will<00:00:51.840> raise<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.469> pitch<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.100> that

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
fret it will raise the pitch of that

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.650 
fret it will raise the pitch of that
string<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> little<00:00:53.730> bit<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.120> might<00:00:54.270> find<00:00:54.540> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
string a little bit you might find the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.200 
string a little bit you might find the
same<00:00:54.690> thing<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.800> tune<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> down<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.610> put

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
same thing but tune it down to be put

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.790 
same thing but tune it down to be put
the<00:00:57.329> cover<00:00:57.539> then<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> fifth<00:00:58.200> fret<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the cover then on the fifth fret and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.520 
the cover then on the fifth fret and
then<00:00:59.430> check<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.180> 6th<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.110> 5th<00:01:01.140> strings

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
then check that the 6th and 5th strings

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.340 
then check that the 6th and 5th strings
not<00:01:04.530> more<00:01:04.680> or<00:01:04.800> less<00:01:04.860> an<00:01:05.070> octave<00:01:05.489> apart<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:06.350> good

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
not more or less an octave apart a good

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.740 
not more or less an octave apart a good
test<00:01:07.649> is<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.160> make<00:01:08.280> an<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.550> chord<00:01:09.000> shape<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.539> you

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
test is to make an a chord shape of you

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.620 
test is to make an a chord shape of you
make<00:01:09.929> a<00:01:10.170> move<00:01:10.800> it<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.069> two<00:01:11.310> frets<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.330> just

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
make a move it up two frets and just

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.790 
make a move it up two frets and just
play<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.899> as<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.050> chord<00:01:15.200> that<00:01:16.200> will<00:01:16.380> tell<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
play that as a chord that will tell you

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.150 
play that as a chord that will tell you
if<00:01:17.069> that<00:01:17.399> sounds<00:01:18.259> in<00:01:19.259> tune<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.860> then<00:01:19.979> your

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
if that sounds in tune and then your

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.449 
if that sounds in tune and then your
guitar<00:01:20.459> is<00:01:20.580> nicely<00:01:20.910> into<00:01:21.149> you<00:01:22.130> that's<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.310> for

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.000 

now<00:02:43.630> that<00:02:44.630> there's<00:02:44.900> no<00:02:44.960> real<00:02:45.230> pulse<00:02:45.560> but<00:02:45.770> think

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
now that there's no real pulse but think

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.280 
now that there's no real pulse but think
of<00:02:46.100> it<00:02:46.250> as<00:02:46.460> one<00:02:46.820> and<00:02:47.030> two<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:47.960> three<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.860> then

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
of it as one and two and three and then

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.040 
of it as one and two and three and then
pitch<00:02:51.610> 501<00:02:52.610> so<00:02:52.940> now<00:02:53.090> your<00:02:53.300> ring<00:02:53.540> finger<00:02:53.870> goes

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
pitch 501 so now your ring finger goes

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.310 
pitch 501 so now your ring finger goes
to<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.320> first<00:02:54.620> string<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.960> cut<00:02:56.960> down<00:02:57.170> the

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
six and but it's rhythm is not precise

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.930 
six and but it's rhythm is not precise
just<00:03:17.740> just<00:03:18.740> play<00:03:18.890> with<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.070> lot<00:03:19.190> of<00:03:19.250> freedom<00:03:19.580> in

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
just just play with a lot of freedom in

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.320 
just just play with a lot of freedom in
those<00:03:20.420> notes<00:03:20.660> now<00:03:21.350> move<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:22.070> a<00:03:22.190> shape<00:03:22.700> that

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
those notes now move to the a shape that

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.820 
those notes now move to the a shape that
we<00:03:23.420> looked<00:03:23.630> at<00:03:23.780> when<00:03:24.410> we<00:03:24.440> looked<00:03:24.650> at<00:03:24.710> the

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
we looked at when we looked at the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.040 
we looked at when we looked at the
tuning<00:03:25.190> I<00:03:25.370> play<00:03:26.120> that<00:03:26.330> this<00:03:26.600> time<00:03:26.840> with<00:03:27.020> three

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
tuning I play that this time with three

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.830 
tuning I play that this time with three
fingers<00:03:27.800> like<00:03:28.340> this<00:03:28.580> on<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.000> fourth<00:03:29.390> third

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
fingers like this on the fourth third

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.860 
fingers like this on the fourth third
and<00:03:29.870> second<00:03:30.590> strings<00:03:31.250> because<00:03:31.610> this<00:03:31.940> becomes

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
and second strings because this becomes

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.700 
and second strings because this becomes
quite<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.140> cramped<00:03:33.620> position<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:36.440> three

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 
quite a cramped position so three

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.620 
quite a cramped position so three
fingers<00:03:37.070> like<00:03:37.220> this<00:03:37.430> also<00:03:38.270> we're<00:03:38.450> going<00:03:38.570> to

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
fingers like this also we're going to

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.420 
fingers like this also we're going to
find<00:03:38.840> that<00:03:38.960> we<00:03:39.080> need<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.470> index<00:03:39.890> finger<00:03:40.280> later

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
find that we need the index finger later

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.760 
find that we need the index finger later
on<00:03:40.580> that's<00:03:40.730> another<00:03:40.970> reason<00:03:41.150> why<00:03:41.360> this<00:03:41.770> leaves

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
on that's another reason why this leaves

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.280 
on that's another reason why this leaves
us<00:03:42.920> limited<00:03:43.310> use<00:03:44.209> this<00:03:44.540> shape<00:03:44.840> so<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:45.110> the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
us limited use this shape so that the

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.340 
us limited use this shape so that the
index<00:03:45.560> finger<00:03:45.890> is<00:03:45.920> free<00:03:47.020> here<00:03:48.020> are<00:03:48.110> we<00:03:48.200> going

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
index finger is free here are we going

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.710 
index finger is free here are we going
to<00:03:48.440> play<00:03:48.620> five<00:03:49.310> four<00:03:49.850> three<00:03:49.880> two<00:03:50.840> three<00:03:51.500> four
