00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.219
 hi to all I am given 65 as vi 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.789
 I promised here is a video not 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.080
 I would say exclusive exclusive because 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.660
 I'll show you some gameplay videos 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.240
 of the air supremacy mode ie 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.800
 air supremacy issued for members 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.199
 battlefield premium 3 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.539
 but I being generous decided to 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.160
 post it here so that you too 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.460
 can you see it 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.770
 and now I leave you to taste the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.800
 trailers and then talk about it a little later 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.890
 together then we feel in about one 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.890
 minute 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.950
 and then here 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.020
 beautiful true and of course you always know 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.930
 do an absurdly good job with i 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.390
 this trader must admit it is that 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.290
 you like battlefield 3 whether you don't 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.750
 like 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.580
 they are really trailers more than PCs too 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.500
 for those blows of bass that sometimes 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.470
 they give more than ever this thriler 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.869
 at first they blew me up 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.570
 air practically but above all that 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.400
 what is the mode for superiors t for 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.120
 as far as I know it was introduced into 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.090
 battlefield 1943 but more generally it is 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.620
 a kind of conquest mode where 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.520
 however the players of the two teams 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.620
 adversaries instead of walking 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.110
 they take control of each of a jet 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:37.060
 which obviously will be a f 18 for the 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:40.150
 faction or uses a 35 s for the Russians in 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.200
 so as to capture three flags that in 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.870
 this mode 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.600
 in battlefield 3 will take the name of 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.880
 control notes in English control 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.320
 without even a control point they are gods 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.270
 strange names I hope will come 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.360
 changed before the release of that 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.360
 package of elsie and these are scattered 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.340
 for the map they can be conquered 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.459
 flying with your own jet around but 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.459
 doing so one will be under fire 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.340
 enemy without being able to find any shelter 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.290
 consequently it will be necessary to 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.239
 so-called teamwork then the work of 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.820
 team to be able to conquer it 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.800
 without problems maybe the peculiarity is 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.670
 the fact that however these points of 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.190
 control coincide with three airships 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.750
 which are indestructible so if you 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.810
 dine against are you the ones a 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.910
 explode and are able to move 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.910
 slowly to the map accordingly 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.230
 the mode will be very dynamic 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.810
 the flags not always being in the 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.209
 same point will be more difficult to 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.280
 conquer and consequently also the 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.780
 strategies to be implemented will surely be 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.940
 very particular 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.790
 the map that you can see that between 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:53.380
 the other looks like the last one 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:57.370
 thriler made the analysis yesterday in this 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:00.220
 map there are paddle shovels 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.730
 wind farms that move more than 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.890
 mountains and the airships they do 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.930
 a bit of obstacles so as to render 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.720
 the least busy mode 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.230
 monotonous so as to always have to 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.239
 keep these obstacles in mind for 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.340
 dodge them and maybe use them as 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.190
 covers from enemy fire 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.470
 and just about this there is a 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.880
 problem or a positive thing according to 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.580
 points of view as they can 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.590
 use as seen in the trailer from 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.870
 heat-seeking and missiles 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.000
 consequently in my opinion this will consist 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.740
 in a continuous escape from these missiles 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.570
 as if all the players of a 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.350
 team target a player 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.330
 opponent 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.450
 this will be found later by a 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.510
 twenty missiles so you can 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.790
 use the flare but in my opinion it is not 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.800
 just balanced and for this I hope 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.450
 that at least in private being there is the 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.919
 possibility to use only the 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.140
 machine gun 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.140
 some doubts still remain 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.770
 first and foremost you die going out 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:05.140
 in the vehicle well this in battlefield 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.380
 1943 happened 6 left after 5 seconds 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.850
 one died and here I also believe that 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.500
 it will happen because otherwise it would not be 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.770
 air supremacy if a person can 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.200
 come down to dry land and maybe 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.570
 also take a hosting and mess up 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.430
 the sky even more so I don't think so 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.740
 that this will happen more 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.790
 another question is related to 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.950
 done if the maps 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.480
 of all the game only those of the 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.500
 game you can play in this 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.300
 modality 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.760
 I hope all of them obviously can 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.120
 play but you do n't know for sure there 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.370
 we will find I do not know in food tower 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.040
 then in the maps of the close quarter 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.560
 to fight with jets so not 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.870
 just all but at least I hope the most 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.850
 part yes for example those of arbor 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.430
 beaks thousand will surely be one 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.560
 mode in which I will lose hours 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.620
 hours of my life as it seems 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.470
 really really a real battle of 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.380
 jazz with dozens of flying aircraft 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.420
 on the screen and surely it will be a 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.220
 great skill test for all 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.460
 pilots especially as I said if you can 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.130
 use only the machine gun or 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.310
 possibly it will only happen perhaps 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:19.460
 in private servers so for today it is 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.440
 I hope I have gladdened you with my word 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.620
 with this gameplay trailer 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.570
 sign up if you haven't done it yet 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.280
 because other videos will come in these 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.660
 so days for today is everything and there 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.660
 see you at the next video bye
