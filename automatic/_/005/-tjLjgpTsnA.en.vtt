00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.300
 black and white picture makes it so cool and how 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.250
 you are a tripod you are a centimeter 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.389
 can put down the from what you have 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.389
 everything in this video a lot of fun 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.560
 read dear people here is again 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.850
 luino from memorial photography and today 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.320
 I will be a few very 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.290
 ask interesting questions 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.970
 david what fascinates you so unbelievably 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.620
 in photography not only the 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.809
 Because of that, photography is so fascinating because 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.160
 I thereby have the possibility very much 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.670
 interesting people knows how long the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:46.040
 are even more crazy than myself 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:47.660
 possible is the best example 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.879
 are you the flowers and the sienna of 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.950
 animal feed coffee without the two would be 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.990
 The photography is not as exciting as it is 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.460
 now i think mega cool that too 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.930
 one of photography a piece far 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.540
 can write history, you have the 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.050
 possibility of eternity for the moment 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.489
 to lend 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.729
 and those are the reasons why I am the one 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.990
 photography so fascinating what camera 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:13.369
 has you I like this little sweet, the 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.690
 prospect what is your favorite objective 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.610
 I have so many objective ones 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.950
 that's why it will be easy and 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.380
 though as the plastic fantastic the 50 mm 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.690
 canon and I have a fixed focal length 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.090
 that's why I got it objectively because of it 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.860
 not only cheap I mean 9 9 90 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.150
 euro you get a fixed focal length with 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.370
 a really great picture performance 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.990
 the sharpness is really good and that 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.940
 cups the blur and picture it 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.830
 his next to ote from the 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.180
 Saxon South who is now 100 Euro 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.680
 should have left that objectively or 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.979
 take a closer look at the link in the 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.810
 infobox and I find it really cool it 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.200
 from the photographer actually almost one 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.720
 got to 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.830
 Do you also have my favorite? 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.450
 objectively also a favorite motive 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.950
 favorite picture is in the last year 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.619
 spring emerged 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.960
 friend i think it's so cool with best 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.240
 because it's easy to 100 percent 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.409
 I had to reflect photography 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.990
 observe 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.729
 Also at the end of something I needed luck 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.739
 a lot of patience and I had to do something 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.519
 Try and that's why it's this 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.840
 picture emerged 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.129
 if you look at the picture in more detail 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.379
 one recognizes yes in the middle of the picture 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.720
 a heart and that it will 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.209
 heartwarming has arisen is important 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.940
 picture just really cool what do you say 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.110
 because the black and white pictures max the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.590
 black and white picture I really can not 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.030
 say 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.069
 So I think black and white again 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.629
 really great because they can do a lot 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.400
 feeling transmitted what colored pictures 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.530
 sometimes can not because color can 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.019
 sometimes very distracting when we get there 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.739
 Image has or thinks can I 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.720
 probably will not save 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.510
 try to save it anyway 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.340
 advance picture can be correct in black and white 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.760
 worked well with which 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.470
 image editing program are you doing that 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.910
 because the program is the absolute 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.370
 Madness has been around for several years 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.810
 the picture editing program at all 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.459
 it is always evolving 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.739
 In the beginning there has to be a black and white 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.989
 then finally out in color and the word 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.120
 claim and only one's own 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.430
 imagination can border the program 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.180
 and that's why I like it better 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.599
 so ingenious who does not know the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.470
 masterpieces by mister cray unique 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.910
 and colors 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.250
 especially unique and yours 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.960
 of course, the opinion of the flash is of the 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.000
 Situation dependent if I'm in there now 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.770
 For example, you can take pictures of her 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.070
 leave out because you set high iso 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.930
 can 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.760
 you can not do that then should 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.900
 one always indirect photo cafÃ© that is 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.820
 you may just want to turn around 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.860
 or to the side and to the left to stop 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.020
 throw the light in the wall and the 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.150
 So go back and have already - 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.130
 Call and soften the light when you are 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.400
 but outside photographs then try 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.860
 I give up 95 percent to 70 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.390
 Of course it depends on use 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.190
 rather a reflector and the light too 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.209
 steer when I'm alone it works 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.170
 Of course not then of course I have to 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.640
 to use a joke 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.590
 on the whole, I would say 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.140
 Now you can use it if you know 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.670
 how much time do you spend? 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.370
 ever with the photography 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.910
 I only say one thing is absolute 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.920
 madness 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.290
 I have something to do with photography every day 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.570
 do and five mega cool I'm yes 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.940
 full-time photographer and girl at 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.260
 a company active and part-time 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.550
 I do that with the sources and 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.570
 that's why not quite as many 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.280
 that was actually me 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.859
 but I think that's it 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.830
 rather deliver quality than quantity 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.160
 Do you have other photographers the 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.300
 such a role model is there is the coolest 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.250
 around the world 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.810
 only with the photographer also business 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.820
 and personnel consultant opens at the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.169
 stage gives courses first here and 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.729
 there and just comes to the 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.020
 the whole world down the speech is from 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.690
 calvin hollywood 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.240
 Greetings and now that's the same 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.940
 done a lot faster and faster 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.950
 spontaneous quick photographer i know 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.390
 not but they already knew but I am 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.520
 recently died on it 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.250
 Although came with a tripod with marco 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.650
 Setting the tripod so 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.140
 that you go even lower 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.729
 can as on the description on it says 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.720
 I now have a tripod of crumbles 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:06.210
 that the lennox 480 and if you are now 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.830
 simply turn that column of medium over that 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.390
 the camera is upside down and that 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.860
 colorful lies a tripod in again 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.849
 then you can do the tripod legs so far 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.679
 disassemble 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.479
 The camera almost down on the ground 

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:18.089
 rests and then you can really 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.919
 have been to their working day already 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:20.520
 knew if not then you write the 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:26.009
 Comments 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.659
 really interesting there is that of 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.490
 Thorsten was proudly covered by this 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:35.909
 to make video I'm going to a 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:37.919
 further assist you are also happy 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.279
 as I was then nominated 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.330
 I was really happy about it 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.009
 But I have to say it was real 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.990
 cool video I really enjoy it 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.599
 made that and the lust 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.949
 Certainly I have as much fun 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:53.189
 I wish you all out there now 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:55.800
 Have fun with whatever you are now 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:57.959

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.669

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:00.269
 this channel to no further videos too 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.860

 next video what's at

 they ask for this photo of me 200 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.290
 It does not even see the euro 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.030
 Honestly that's why it's like that 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.560
 expensive 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.060
 if you like something like these jokes 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.650
 with a little more acting 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.940
 power goes then let me 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.740
 Just know, give a video below
