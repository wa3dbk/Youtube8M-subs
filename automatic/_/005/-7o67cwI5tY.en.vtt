boiled<00:00:52.320> potato<00:00:52.649> into<00:00:53.100> cubes<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.699> am<00:00:53.820> going<00:00:54.180> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
boiled potato into cubes I am going to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.910 
boiled potato into cubes I am going to
start<00:00:54.600> by<00:00:54.690> cutting<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.350> bread<00:00:55.530> slices<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:57.920> have

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
start by cutting the bread slices I have

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.849 
start by cutting the bread slices I have
taken<00:00:59.160> here<00:00:59.460> two<00:00:59.670> slices<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.329> bread<00:01:00.859> just

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
taken here two slices of bread just

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.350 
taken here two slices of bread just
roughly<00:01:02.660> cut<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.809> into<00:01:03.989> squares<00:01:04.769> sizes<00:01:05.430> like

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
roughly cut it into squares sizes like

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.480 
roughly cut it into squares sizes like
this

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.390 

so<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.150> bread<00:01:14.390> slices<00:01:14.960> are<00:01:15.140> cut<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:16.100> next

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
so the bread slices are cut the next

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.430 
so the bread slices are cut the next
step<00:01:16.580> is<00:01:16.760> to<00:01:16.909> cut<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.150> potato<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.140> boiled

step is to cut the potato the boiled

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.550 
step is to cut the potato the boiled
potato<00:01:18.830> I<00:01:19.270> have<00:01:20.270> taken<00:01:20.479> here<00:01:20.810> one<00:01:21.110> medium

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
potato I have taken here one medium

sized<00:01:21.860> potato<00:01:22.400> that<00:01:22.670> I<00:01:22.729> have<00:01:22.940> boiled<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:23.630> then

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
sized potato that I have boiled and then

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.920 
sized potato that I have boiled and then
I<00:01:25.159> normally<00:01:25.760> keep<00:01:25.970> it<00:01:26.090> in<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.330> fridge<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:26.810> that

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
I normally keep it in the fridge so that

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.740 
I normally keep it in the fridge so that
it<00:01:27.290> becomes<00:01:27.619> a<00:01:27.740> little<00:01:27.979> hard<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:28.490> I<00:01:29.299> can<00:01:29.509> cut

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
it becomes a little hard and I can cut

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.880 
it becomes a little hard and I can cut
really<00:01:30.310> clean<00:01:31.310> pieces<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.210> potatoes
