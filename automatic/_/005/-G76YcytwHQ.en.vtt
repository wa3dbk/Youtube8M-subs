00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
and I actually set him out in a 4411

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.190 
and I actually set him out in a 4411
formation<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.270> he<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.540> playing<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.869> center

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
formation so he is playing that center

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.380 
formation so he is playing that center
40<00:01:31.530> which<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.770> preferred<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.520> preferred

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
40 which is preferred for a preferred

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.330 
40 which is preferred for a preferred
position<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:34.829> really<00:01:34.890> does<00:01:35.159> suit

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
position and it really really does suit

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.249 
position and it really really does suit
him<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.939> you're<00:01:36.180> looking<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> changeup

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
him so if you're looking at a changeup

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.520 
him so if you're looking at a changeup
maybe<00:01:37.860> bring<00:01:38.159> him<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> cam<00:01:39.200> yeah<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.229> think<00:01:40.320> he

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
maybe bring him to a cam yeah I think he

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.010 
maybe bring him to a cam yeah I think he
would<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.680> decent<00:01:41.159> as<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> cam<00:01:41.579> i<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:42.869> is

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
would be decent as a cam i think is

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.840 
would be decent as a cam i think is
innocent<00:01:43.590> afford<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.189> does<00:01:44.490> suits<00:01:44.700> him

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
innocent afford it does suits him

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.490 
innocent afford it does suits him
because<00:01:45.090> he<00:01:45.210> likes<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.509> overlap<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:45.990> striker

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
because he likes to overlap the striker

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.170 
because he likes to overlap the striker
