00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello love music is supposed to tv spectators 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.670
 Welcome to the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.189
 frankfurt music fair at hk audio booth 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.260
 I like it very much today because it is 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.730
 yes, the linear series already known 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.089
 and there is something new from this now 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.830
 linear series and what do I do with it? 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.539
 There is just a new top part but too 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.920
 We also urgently needed the top team 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.359
 make a new pass because then we 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.119
 created a weapon who have just 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.029
 animal ponto downstairs needs lts top part 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.429
 tsa totally exact moment becomes active too 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.990
 passively also give the new bass bass 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.200
 is the elzer 4000 a 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.640
 we know the l 2000 this is a 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.770
 double room which was also known 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.180
 or is that going to go down a bit? 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.980
 you still wanted to attack 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.050
 sonically so to speak with the 18th 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.879
 since similar rankommen but with more power 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.610
 we just wanted to do much more 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.710
 create draft this time and if it is 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.110
 There is also a good supplement to this 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.670
 we have double a double 12 now 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.260
 a 18er one no double 18 yes but 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.199
 accordingly with proper volume 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.100
 properly made men's material 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.159
 next to proper sound pressure too 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.229
 then come to 137 dbm half six iss 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.299
 lift and on two frequencies 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.890
 Tuned are double venting band 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.950
 just fits the low frequencies 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.090
 tuned to 30 years later around 80 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.650
 to 100 hertz and again right 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.240
 kickers to give it 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.159
 that means he had in the conception 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.009
 also the idea possibly as a supplement 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.990
 as sub bass as sub sub what makes him to the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.439
 linear 2000 but also to pack 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.689
 of course then for very big venues as 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.220
 To establish 18 that is actually the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.049
 thought that we have in addition 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.700
 can install the upload function 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.350
 or install it as me pablo 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.150
 application can use 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.850
 that speaks two trend frequencies 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.399
 on 70 and 100 hertz separated 100 hertz 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.079
 as a system was and 70 r to just as well 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.850
 existing 2000 best easy too 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.009
 integrate to drive so worth the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.470
 Big Venlo has it as upload 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.729
 additionally use stereo preamp the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.760
 is also the first time with a pass 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.280
 Extension possible to build then 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.040
 that was important to them right now 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.480
 here that we have the horizontal version 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.770
 have with two best but like me 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.810
 the side see there is also such a 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.520
 flange around which can also be high, so to speak 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.560
 So yes, that one actually 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.210
 all possibilities upright as one 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.620
 It knows as footpath one above the other stop 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.030
 part on top to the right height 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.490
 to get the right stacking height 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.260
 but so used and live naturally 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.060
 coupling again to increase the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.280
 speaker continues to close the floor 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.410
 get as far as possible 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.720
 easier that means if tech or something 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.460
 as it is offered in the full system 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.320
 if we say again we have one 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.200
 system spread over the big vendor 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.210
 the long pro pack will be in women's hands 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.700
 be two basses and share the lts top 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.680
 then finally and on top of which 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.540
 Target group was the thought is 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.640
 probably not for the 16 year old 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.370
 the punkband have been but rental 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.140
 companies professional tape through the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.560
 definitely wants to buy as a matter of fact 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.680
 so good 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.580
 no target group will be more in the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.170
 profit professional area go home 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.760
 just so existing customers first 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.020
 mainly of course want to say that 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.489
 we want even more with line 5 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.570
 can and want to be more flexible 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.970
 be again 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.030
 of course round off to the top but 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.660
 also typical next generation 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.730
 event engineering has the build 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.800
 the very same this system in the 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.450
 Plan for size from the beginning 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.000
 sometime also to get in 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.300
 combination with the top part is because 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.660
 already available therefore from middle 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.160
 of the year 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.560
 and finally completely into the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.060
 shops from autumn available are yes 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.380
 may already talk about a price 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.010
 about a vp will be around 2400 euro around 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.290
 valued 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.180
 when profiling will see what the 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.920
 market then wants to make it out to everyone 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.440
 case hope that if he then deliverable 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.610
 he is with us in the forum to see and to 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.260
 listen and then they just come 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.420
 times by cologne always worth a visit 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.070
 to wait carnival also during the year 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.960
 we look at you in the showroom and there we have 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.360
 Of course, the eleven 4000 because very good 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.530
 Thank you for your explanation everything else 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.550
 on our website music 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.550
 Thank you
