00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.110 

not<00:01:50.830> really<00:01:50.980> what<00:01:51.160> I<00:01:51.190> would<00:01:51.310> have<00:01:51.490> done<00:01:51.670> but<00:01:52.240> I

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
not really what I would have done but I

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.870 
not really what I would have done but I
guess<00:01:55.120> that's<00:01:55.330> fine<00:01:55.540> I<00:01:56.190> mean<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.580> odds<00:01:57.670> are

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
guess that's fine I mean the odds are

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.080 
guess that's fine I mean the odds are
I'm<00:01:57.970> gonna<00:01:58.150> draw<00:01:58.330> another<00:01:58.480> land<00:01:58.810> before<00:02:00.090> he

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
I'm gonna draw another land before he

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.550 
I'm gonna draw another land before he
does<00:02:01.240> anything<00:02:01.480> super<00:02:01.960> fancy<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.620> I<00:02:04.560> don't

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
does anything super fancy so I don't

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.540 
does anything super fancy so I don't
know<00:02:05.620> that<00:02:05.740> just<00:02:05.890> seems<00:02:05.950> like<00:02:06.040> a<00:02:06.190> really<00:02:06.220> loose

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
know that just seems like a really loose

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.330 
know that just seems like a really loose
play

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340

kitten<00:02:14.090> Fink's

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.670 

I<00:02:19.060> think<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.960> really<00:02:20.140> bad<00:02:20.260> matchup<00:02:20.530> for

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
I think this is a really bad matchup for

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.390 
I think this is a really bad matchup for
the<00:02:20.830> deck<00:02:21.010> -<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.250> just<00:02:21.940> feel<00:02:22.060> like<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:24.160> can't

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
the deck - I just feel like you can't

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.440 
the deck - I just feel like you can't
really<00:02:26.730> profitably<00:02:27.730> get<00:02:27.970> past<00:02:28.240> their

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
really profitably get past their

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.700 
really profitably get past their
creatures<00:02:28.870> like<00:02:29.170> they<00:02:29.320> block<00:02:29.530> with<00:02:29.680> a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
creatures like they block with a

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.990 
creatures like they block with a
sprouting<00:02:30.100> iron<00:02:30.340> axe<00:02:30.490> now<00:02:30.670> they<00:02:30.790> have<00:02:30.880> three

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
sprouting iron axe now they have three

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.670 
sprouting iron axe now they have three
more<00:02:31.210> blockers<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.870> all<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.380> deck<00:02:32.500> early

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
more blockers and all the deck early

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.010 
more blockers and all the deck early
does<00:02:32.800> is<00:02:32.890> attack<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:34.540> don't<00:02:34.690> really<00:02:34.780> do<00:02:34.990> much

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
does is attack you don't really do much

here comes the blood bird elf this

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
here comes the blood bird elf this
probably<00:03:06.940> means<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.180> should<00:03:07.300> have<00:03:07.390> other<00:03:07.510> Swan

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
probably means I should have other Swan

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.570 
probably means I should have other Swan
candidates<00:03:08.170> but<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.290> don't<00:03:08.470> think<00:03:08.650> he<00:03:09.460> would

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
candidates but I don't think he would

lightning<00:03:14.920> bolt<00:03:15.070> when<00:03:15.220> they<00:03:15.310> needed<00:03:15.460> it<00:03:15.550> so

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
lightning bolt when they needed it so

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.430 
lightning bolt when they needed it so
you<00:03:16.390> just<00:03:16.420> have<00:03:16.630> to<00:03:16.750> assume<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.200> he<00:03:17.260> had<00:03:17.350> the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
you just have to assume that he had the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.270 
you just have to assume that he had the
lightning<00:03:17.710> bolt<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:19.890> I'm<00:03:20.890> probably<00:03:21.100> gonna

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
lightning bolt and I'm probably gonna

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.980 
lightning bolt and I'm probably gonna
live<00:03:21.430> is<00:03:21.550> a<00:03:21.580> steel<00:03:21.880> overseer<00:03:22.330> here<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:22.810> take

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
take a LAN through that's that's a fair

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.970 
take a LAN through that's that's a fair
trade<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:48.760> guess<00:03:50.370> let's<00:03:51.370> try<00:03:51.520> this<00:03:51.580> guy<00:03:51.850> again

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
trade I guess let's try this guy again

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.930 
trade I guess let's try this guy again
we're<00:03:53.980> just<00:03:54.100> I'm<00:03:54.190> playing<00:03:54.400> him<00:03:54.490> first<00:03:54.730> is

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
we're just I'm playing him first is

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.780 
we're just I'm playing him first is
because<00:03:55.180> if<00:03:55.270> I<00:03:55.330> play<00:03:55.480> canonist<00:03:56.580> it<00:03:57.580> doesn't

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
because if I play canonist it doesn't

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.700 
because if I play canonist it doesn't
really<00:03:57.910> do<00:03:58.030> much<00:03:58.200> what<00:03:59.200> if<00:03:59.290> I<00:03:59.380> play<00:03:59.530> steel

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
really do much what if I play steel

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.180 
really do much what if I play steel
overseer<00:04:01.530> yeah<00:04:02.530> it's<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.740> be<00:04:02.830> fair<00:04:03.040> if<00:04:03.100> I

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
overseer yeah it's to be fair if I

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.150 
overseer yeah it's to be fair if I
played<00:04:03.370> her<00:04:04.800> couldn't<00:04:05.800> have<00:04:05.890> gotten<00:04:06.040> that

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
played her couldn't have gotten that

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.500 
played her couldn't have gotten that
Terminator<00:04:06.550> I'll<00:04:06.700> terminate<00:04:06.940> off<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.330> blood

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
Terminator I'll terminate off the blood

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.900 
Terminator I'll terminate off the blood
braid<00:04:07.720> off

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.690 

I<00:04:12.650> guess<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.800> reason<00:04:13.920> is<00:04:14.130> because<00:04:14.280> if<00:04:14.460> I<00:04:14.520> play

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
I guess the reason is because if I play

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.000 
I guess the reason is because if I play
her<00:04:14.990> after<00:04:15.990> I<00:04:16.019> play<00:04:16.230> him<00:04:16.470> then<00:04:16.739> he<00:04:16.860> can

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
her after I play him then he can

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.460 
her after I play him then he can
immediately<00:04:17.160> pump<00:04:17.670> her<00:04:18.140> making<00:04:19.140> her<00:04:19.170> just

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
immediately pump her making her just

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.690 
immediately pump her making her just
better<00:04:19.650> but<00:04:19.830> that<00:04:19.980> might<00:04:20.130> be<00:04:20.160> too<00:04:20.280> greedy<00:04:20.910> for

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:34.300 

I'll<00:04:26.700> take<00:04:26.910> three<00:04:27.240> here

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.320 

and<00:04:34.880> it<00:04:35.240> will<00:04:35.330> pass<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.570> time

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.149 

I'm<00:04:40.840> not<00:04:40.990> getting<00:04:41.259> any<00:04:41.379> infect<00:04:41.740> counters<00:04:42.099> from

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159 
I'm not getting any infect counters from

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:50.790 
I'm not getting any infect counters from
that<00:04:42.370> guy<00:04:42.550> that's<00:04:42.729> for<00:04:42.970> sure

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:59.140 

let's<00:04:51.400> see<00:04:51.729> what<00:04:52.060> this<00:04:52.509> does

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:08.770 

and<00:04:59.660> I<00:04:59.750> have<00:04:59.990> this<00:05:00.139> figure<00:05:00.560> man<00:05:00.740> up<00:05:06.729> hmm<00:05:07.820> not

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
and I have this figure man up hmm not

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:19.220 
and I have this figure man up hmm not
too<00:05:09.050> shabby

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.320 

if<00:05:19.710> he<00:05:19.830> has<00:05:19.920> a<00:05:19.950> bolt<00:05:20.220> he<00:05:20.340> has<00:05:20.460> a<00:05:20.490> bolt<00:05:20.790> so<00:05:21.630> I<00:05:23.330> mean

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
if he has a bolt he has a bolt so I mean

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.130 
if he has a bolt he has a bolt so I mean
withers<00:05:24.660> just<00:05:24.900> so<00:05:25.050> bad<00:05:25.230> because<00:05:26.900> if<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:27.990> say

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
withers just so bad because if I say

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.340 
withers just so bad because if I say
pump<00:05:28.380> this<00:05:28.560> guy<00:05:29.450> then<00:05:30.450> he<00:05:30.510> becomes<00:05:30.630> a<00:05:30.780> 44<00:05:31.170> I

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
pump this guy then he becomes a 44 I

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.350 
pump this guy then he becomes a 44 I
could<00:05:31.500> block<00:05:31.680> this<00:05:31.890> guy<00:05:32.100> after<00:05:33.060> comedy

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
could block this guy after comedy

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.040 
could block this guy after comedy
becomes<00:05:33.570> a<00:05:33.660> 1-1<00:05:34.520> and<00:05:35.520> then<00:05:36.330> if<00:05:36.450> he<00:05:36.480> kills<00:05:36.810> this

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
becomes a 1-1 and then if he kills this

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:43.960 
becomes a 1-1 and then if he kills this
guy<00:05:37.170> was<00:05:37.410> like<00:05:37.530> a<00:05:37.560> bolt<00:05:37.910> then<00:05:38.910> they<00:05:39.000> both<00:05:39.150> die

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:51.770 

so<00:05:44.970> not<00:05:45.240> that<00:05:45.390> not<00:05:45.600> the<00:05:45.750> best<00:05:45.900> trade

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.810 

four<00:05:52.380> cards<00:05:52.800> what<00:05:53.550> are<00:05:53.700> they

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:06.980 

no<00:05:59.690> blocks

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:18.680

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.050 

canonist

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.730 

I'm<00:06:57.600> swing<00:06:57.960> in<00:06:58.050> there<00:06:58.169> with<00:06:58.260> the<00:06:58.320> master<00:06:58.710> I

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:11.520 
I'm swing in there with the master I
guess

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:11.530 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.870 

if<00:07:12.530> he<00:07:12.650> has<00:07:12.740> a<00:07:12.770> bolt<00:07:13.040> I<00:07:13.160> lose<00:07:13.370> which<00:07:13.730> is

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:13.880 
if he has a bolt I lose which is

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:25.830 
if he has a bolt I lose which is
unfortunate
