00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
 Halli hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.140
 another jumping kassel guide 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.299
 Today it goes into the fields of 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.910
 devastation and the away brand heliad mine 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.490
 photos go straight to north up to 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.870
 the marked position 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.910
 Here you look around and then see one 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:21.840
 Cave entrance and that you follow until the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:24.539
 end when in the cave since you think 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.000
 turn right immediately and jump onto the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.320
 small metal leaps the enemy 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.689
 can you safely ignore the can 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.360
 do not harm you once you come here 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.350
 the mushrooms are you on the 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.700
 jump metal rods and from here will 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.500
 it's interesting because it always falls 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.480
 again rock from the top down 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.160
 the rocks seem arbitrary 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.200
 be and when they meet you 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.660
 throw them straight back 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.829
 that means when the rock sees 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.600
 stays best 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.370
 I'm on the way there several times 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.360
 that will probably fall to you 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.250
 also happen 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.420
 i would just say problems again 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.260
 It was a really lucky one 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.969
 to depend 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.920
 Unfortunately, it is not safe 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.480
 Make note of the rocks each time 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.829
 somewhere else 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.750
 just follow the path described here 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.710
 you can remember there are 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.390
 several options for diversion 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.220
 but this seems the shortest too 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.220
 and also I think the safest 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.149
 important to the boulders is still too 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.380
 mention when they meet you 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.570
 always straight back 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.670
 that is when you are hit or 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.950
 you see it starts to wiggle presented 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.140
 so there's plenty of room behind you 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.030
 is so for example the long metal rods too 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.530
 a German there would be me too 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.979
 he is taken the way 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.350
 you can continue that puzzling 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.670
 otherwise no further difficulties 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.380
 The hardest part here is really just 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.450
 to find the way the first time 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.380
 otherwise little can happen 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.380
 stone aside 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.690
 Here we are already at the same time 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.849
 the tour 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.980
 Here you see, that was pretty good 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.629
 yield that much here 41 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.950
 I have 73 downgraded 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.569
 get items that is completely in 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.620
 order 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.239
 and that we should be already completed 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.530
 that videos arrived i hope that 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.239
 was helpful and some of you 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.400
 maybe studied coast helped 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.049
 have fun and see you next time and 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.549
 as always comments and suggestions 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.170

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.170
