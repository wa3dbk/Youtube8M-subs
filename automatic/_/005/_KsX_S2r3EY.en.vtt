00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.130
 I think winter is a season 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.630
 perfect to remove a sauna a camera 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.360
 of steam because the same body you 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.670
 asks is not a totally different climate 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.140
 In contrast and today I decided to visit 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.440
 tourists to find out a little more 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.550
 from them 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.550
 someday 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.360
 oh my god what a custom 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.010
 I had this community thank you 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.560
 and in our country there is a great 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.950
 culture of Turkish baths to some cameras 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.050
 of steam or not so much that it just makes 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.340
 few years like this is being a 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.340
 little massifying no 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.610
 the idea is to come to this kind of 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.010
 quiet environments get a 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.260
 total relaxation of the body involving 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.730
 those of the cameras for example us 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.410
 we have what are steam chambers 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.180
 and the camera dry because the difference 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.070
 among them the benefits are the 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.650
 so in what I know with what 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.630
 search with this type of treatments 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.160
 camera is getting just the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.770
 elimination of toxins through the 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.750
 rapid and excessive sweating in short 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.200
 time then in the steam chamber 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.840
 we will have a 100% humid environment not 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.060
 finish the steam in another environment the heat 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.560
 is going to be even much more in the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.200
 It's going to go up but it's going to 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.270
 get sweating but raising the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.200
 atp of the body and with a minimum humidity 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.200
 20 percent 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.450
 and the specific times for each 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.790
 camera vary between more or less than 10 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.310
 minutes to 15 minutes of a4 experience 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.540
 from each person there is a whole protocol what 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.120
 first is to know what to enter 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.760
 totally free of creams oils and 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.540
 others to this type of cameras to record 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.920
 a good shower before washing your hair 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.410
 exfoliate and then enter the chamber 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.330
 initially what I recommend is if 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.490
 he has no experience in the use of this 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.230
 type of cameras is to do it by 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.030
 example just once against 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.070
 temperature or be more or less than 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.110
 10 to 15 minutes according to how you go 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.510
 overcoming the whole process then 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.400
 you retire, we have what the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.990
 Spanish shower and after resting more 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.430
 or less than 15 to 20 minutes until 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.430
 again take the temperature 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.700
 it hurts to be talking 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.160
 permanently with the likes in this 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.490
 kind of places much more much more than 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.790
 hurt 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.340
 a little relaxation 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.950
 so as I say, it 's good to keep 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.020
 let's say to the body rested the mind 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.050
 free of all thoughts then 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.790
 it seeks to find an optimal environment 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.310
 to get all those kindnesses 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.700
 no and apart from that the steam sauna does not 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.890
 you know he has a series of plants 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.470
 medicinal that will be you are in eucalyptus 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.070
 that never cute chamomile has a lot 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.070
 has anise 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.060
 it is also recommended even before and 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:43.159
 The sauna is lightened 23 hours before 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.860
 enter or not immediately enter with 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.930
 this full because we see that it is 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.849
 working all that is let's say the 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.440
 heart is calm and follow me the 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.120
 metabolism then and you're going to 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.739
 overload with the acceleration of 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.870
 circulatory system with the heart 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.370
 much faster is recommended so either 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.530
 spend a lapse of three hours before 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.690
 enter the sauna and eat lightly in 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.980
 reality when leaving the sauna 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.439
 because it is going out of heart this is 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.120
 an accelerated tract a lot of energy but 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.879
 after resting a moment you feel 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.379
 like an instant downer and you need 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.840
 sleep even if I have a while then it 's 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.660
 ideal to schedule with time and do it 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.160
 less two hours before your time to go to 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.079
 sleep so that the effect is 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.070
 totally beneficial and if you're 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.460
 restrictions that you have to have in 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.250
 has this type of camera not for 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.169
 example people who feel heart 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.439
 this hypertensive people 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.330
 people with fever if for example some 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:37.699
 type of inflammation in an area 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.770
 determined and case of hepatitis for the 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.120
 low kidney if barium 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.249
 example but it seems that the process 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.889
 acute chronic let's say there is already a pregnancy 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:48.349
 neither could I could the all 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.580
 the first three months not but after 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.349
 already in agreement 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.389
 we cultivate to the capacity that they have 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.090
 entering and also people who have 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:59.330
 risk during pregnancy have 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.919
 a type of breastfeeding risk because 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.919
 loses fluid 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.120
 usually it always bothers him not to touch 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.120
 six months 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:19.509
 and enjoy 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.610
 good
