I guess hmm I can rotate by sharp for
this<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.299> kind<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.229> think<00:01:16.259> by<00:01:16.590> shop<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:16.950> this

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
this I kind of I think by shop for this

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.910 
this I kind of I think by shop for this
because<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.090> pretty<00:01:18.420> big<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.020> dark<00:01:19.740> side

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
because of the pretty big a dark side

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.289 
because of the pretty big a dark side
producing<00:01:20.340> teams<00:01:20.490> having<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:20.850> team<00:01:21.030> which<00:01:21.180> is

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
producing teams having my team which is

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.550 
producing teams having my team which is
that<00:01:21.450> that's<00:01:21.750> nice<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.110> he<00:01:22.200> has<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> girl

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
that that's nice and he has a girl

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.679 
that that's nice and he has a girl
venture<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.280> don't<00:01:23.850> lead<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.150> by<00:01:24.390> sharp

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
venture so I don't lead with by sharp

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.910 
venture so I don't lead with by sharp
because<00:01:24.869> I'm<00:01:25.080> assuming<00:01:25.470> he's<00:01:25.619> gonna<00:01:25.740> leave

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
because I'm assuming he's gonna leave

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.620 
because I'm assuming he's gonna leave
with<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.369> gal<00:01:26.549> vangelis<00:01:26.970> set<00:01:27.119> with<00:01:27.299> sticky

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
with the gal vangelis set with sticky

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.810 
with the gal vangelis set with sticky
webs<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.020> even<00:01:28.560> could<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.490> he<00:01:29.670> could

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
webs and even could do that if he could

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.800 
webs and even could do that if he could
do<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.240> me<00:01:30.329> there'll<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.570> absolute

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
do that for me there'll be a absolute

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.719 
do that for me there'll be a absolute
greatest<00:01:31.380> thing<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.650> can<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:31.890> because<00:01:32.100> my<00:01:32.520> by

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
greatest thing you can do because my by

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.670 
greatest thing you can do because my by
sharp<00:01:33.000> has<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.360> ability<00:01:33.600> where<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.409> stat

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
sharp has this ability where one stat

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.770 
sharp has this ability where one stat
lowers<00:01:35.100> his<00:01:35.549> attack<00:01:35.850> goes<00:01:36.000> up<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.390> would<00:01:36.659> be

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
lowers his attack goes up so I would be

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.760 
lowers his attack goes up so I would be
great<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.229> would<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.470> great<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.740> I

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
great for that would be great and I

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.550 
great for that would be great and I
could<00:01:37.920> start<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.189> bunch<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.430> days<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:38.880> um<00:01:39.630> what

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
could start a bunch for days but um what

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.319 
could start a bunch for days but um what
should<00:01:40.619> we<00:01:40.770> leave<00:01:40.920> with<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.189> actually<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:42.270> I
