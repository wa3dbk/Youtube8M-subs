00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.530

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.530

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.869
 so that it is all that is not so that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.970
 I thought it was beautiful but I also knew that 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.240
 had to say goodbye and that we didn't 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.240
 good looking 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.000
 just like unique that moment that I went 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.040
 why walk then see the clock fun x 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.110
 the three-minute pressure I switch then goes 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.130
 I go why I would walk the last one 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.479
 three minutes really want hours 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.930
 I will last what the looking every looking 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.579
 round 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.450
 no go now i'm going to start her then 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.130
 Audience already heard and now it just lasted 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.810
 all still a while before day 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.220
 why was you in the crea I still have 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.820
 once rushed I have a muscle tear 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.049
 So 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.960
 audience about my third time 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.970
 i came yes i couldn't last that long 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.289
 Play afterwards went pretty well 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.450
 are we thinking that had a linen that 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.030
 my body was there even though I was two 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.289
 broken legs will continue to run nicely 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.380
 yes it was like much more what I hope for 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.330
 the audience was so excited just 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.149
 we are also very few against us 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.280
 player who had such a goodbye and 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.299
 yes that 's right I think 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.299
 and the best to be proud of 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.220
 everything went around the audience like that 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.420
 standard public account just went 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.939
 that the ball didn't go out 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.400
 all I did not expect to walk 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.019
 the field will allow the permanent names 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.159
 get to food band like me too 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.799
 not at all expected 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.269
 man of that difficult moment yes but yes 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.790
 very nice that 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.560
 tari stand just i do n't know or share 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.480
 so that solution came up 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.239
 of course it is fantastic that that 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.420
 he thinks that yes you do 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.420
 gladly 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.629
 i have one 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.220
 difficult year had a difficult year 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.200
 have always played everything and 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.209
 a seat in which you end up 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.920
 or have her cell stand on the couch 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.900
 seated 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.530
 from week one I find and stocks them 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.530
 always schreuder 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.690
 I have a lot I had little stuff but 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.280
 this this trainer who has really bothered me 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.240
 helped give day and deeper on the 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.610
 right moments 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.800
 and a few minutes today 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.600
 wanted to hang out for a lot with him 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.130
 I really talked about the house 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.360
 group kept talking about football 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.850
 did we speak again 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.290
 replay rover setup over 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.670
 and kept so close to the group 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.120
 my stay is still important 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.560
 made it and had hard elske 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.790
 and then she starts me right you know 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.130
 as i sometimes i didn't want to be with 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.300
 the second player then that also asked 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.560
 not and when I green what we wear 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.210
 perhaps succeed aversion can then play 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.590
 you want to play that way 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.940
 and then she also turned the 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.200
 possibility of it while me 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.730
 am injured for a few minutes 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.290
 play 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.520
 yes then it has got me a whole lot 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.100
 made easy as a like that it 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.480
 had been another trainer or 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.130
 and that said with all of the two 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.250
 the spray yes then it becomes a piece 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.780
 difficult if you have had such a career 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.420
 and he just understood me completely 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.830
 well it wasn't me at all 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.450
 all not so difficult 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.310
 to pick out davis i got whole 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.610
 many people I want to thank them 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.220

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.090

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:49.479
 been top so I just got that 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.620
 another interview sometimes said it is 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.819
 always it is very difficult to 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.740
 job we are such a big club and that 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:55.270
 get everything over it but very much 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.220
 people don't know what they are for 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.780
 mowing for the players has done as well 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.789
 and also for supporters and the above 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.860
 from a cigar who does everything and on 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.509
 to a box with with people who are whole 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.400
 very sick there are many people see 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.110
 not all of that and yes I think so 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.720

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.800
 really one becomes awesome 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.150
 it is still difficult when you see children 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.520
 or at once to the supporters or or 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.100
 a bit going on like that then it is 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.919
