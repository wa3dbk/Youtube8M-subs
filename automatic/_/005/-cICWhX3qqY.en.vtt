ok first get the 2 by 3 black thin set

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.779 
ok first get the 2 by 3 black thin set
it<00:01:00.300> up<00:01:00.449> /<00:01:01.199> bottom<00:01:01.590> then<00:01:02.039> get<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> two<00:01:02.579> by<00:01:02.730> two

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
it up / bottom then get the two by two

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.560 
it up / bottom then get the two by two
yellow<00:01:04.070> square<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> then<00:01:05.400> stick<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.270> one

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
yellow square and then stick it on one

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:15.760 
yellow square and then stick it on one
side<00:01:10.549> and<00:01:11.600> ok<00:01:12.600> let<00:01:13.110> there<00:01:13.320> be<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.650> space<00:01:13.950> left

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
side and ok let there be one space left

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.200 
side and ok let there be one space left
there's<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:16.830> space<00:01:17.220> left<00:01:18.470> ok<00:01:19.580> after<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.729> get

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
there's one space left ok after that get

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.859 
there's one space left ok after that get
these<00:01:21.570> two<00:01:21.869> upside-down<00:01:23.000> triangles<00:01:24.000> 1<00:01:24.450> by<00:01:24.600> 3

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
these two upside-down triangles 1 by 3

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.109 
these two upside-down triangles 1 by 3
yellow<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.590> then<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:27.560> take<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
yellow and then just take it on the

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.289 
yellow and then just take it on the
space<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.799> left<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.939> will<00:01:33.030> be<00:01:33.150> like

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
space that is left so that will be like

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.910 
space that is left so that will be like
this<00:01:34.549> now<00:01:36.380> get<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.770> by<00:01:37.950> two<00:01:38.850> black

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
this now get this one by two black

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.749 
this now get this one by two black
rectangle<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.840> stick<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:44.040> middle<00:01:44.520> of

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
rectangle and stick it in the middle of

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.240 
rectangle and stick it in the middle of
them<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.299> there's<00:01:45.780> two<00:01:46.320> right<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.040> two

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
them so there's two right here and two

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.609 
them so there's two right here and two
right<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:49.250> after<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.619> triangle

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
right there after that get this triangle

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.899 
right there after that get this triangle
green<00:01:53.009> two<00:01:53.340> by<00:01:53.520> two<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:55.369> sticky<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.759> it

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
green two by two and sticky so that it

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.010 
green two by two and sticky so that it
is<00:01:57.119> facing<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.020> opposite<00:01:58.740> way<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.299> point

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
is facing the opposite way of the point

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.830 
is facing the opposite way of the point
apart<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:03.229> facing<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:05.460> way<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.969> not

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
apart so it is facing this way and not

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.389 
apart so it is facing this way and not
this<00:02:07.110> way<00:02:07.459> and<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.879> last<00:02:09.030> two<00:02:09.330> pieces

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
this way and the last two pieces

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.899 
this way and the last two pieces
you<00:02:11.180> get<00:02:11.480> are<00:02:11.769> these<00:02:12.769> two<00:02:13.010> one<00:02:13.159> by<00:02:13.310> one<00:02:13.519> green

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
you get are these two one by one green

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.000 
you get are these two one by one green
and<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.810> just<00:02:15.019> stick<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.439> on<00:02:15.560> top<00:02:15.769> of<00:02:15.829> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
and you just stick it on top of the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.630 
and you just stick it on top of the
green<00:02:16.400> triangle<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.720> bite<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.049> just<00:02:18.640> stick

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
green triangle to bite you just stick

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.140 
green triangle to bite you just stick
them<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.540> got<00:02:20.989> your<00:02:21.230> small<00:02:21.849> so<00:02:22.849> you<00:02:22.909> go

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
them on and you got your small so you go

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.599 
them on and you got your small so you go
thank<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:24.019> for<00:02:24.079> watch<00:02:25.599> goodbye
