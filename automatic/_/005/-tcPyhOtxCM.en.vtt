 irremediably the Mediterranean are 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.939
 yet of southern origin although they 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.519
 are part of the Mediterranean landscape 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.009
 to the point of becoming invasive in 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.519
 some regions the level it comes from 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.730
 end of the world 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.430

 and discovers the subtropical climate of the 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.899
 encircled azure coast ali made 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.370
 a lot of plants that come from 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.589
 end of the world and that's why in 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.039
 1804 the mimosa comes to us from 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.039
 australia 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.920
 botanists have the incredible gift of 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.890
 complicate things 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.650
 hang your mimosa for them 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.810
 botanists it's acacias our acacias to 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.640
 we are the robinia the one who flowers 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.720
 in the spring and which we consume 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.450
 donuts with delight 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.220
 as for mimosas for botanists and 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.170
 this little plant absolutely adorable 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.820
 that we call the sensitive and that soon 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.720
 we touch her leaves they are 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.299
 fold back on themselves 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.670
 so we do not understand anything anymore and we're going 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.380
 continue to say a mimosa of course he 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.700
 exists one thousand two hundred species of 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.170
 mimosa acacia forgiveness as I feel that 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.600
 do you take a last small 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.090
 botanical lesson acacias mimosas 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.780
 is divided into two groups according to 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.539
 shape of their leaves 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.429
 on one side the classic mimosa with its 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.530
 compound leaves pained so very 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.240
 light graceful like the feathers of a 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.640
 bird or a little the fronts of a 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.750
 fern and on the other the mimosas to 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.000
 whole leaves 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.340
 trap attention these are not 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.830
 leaves it's called challenge aude 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.020
 in fact it is the petioles of the 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.360
 sheet that has flattened itself that has 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.850
 long and recognizable by the 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.709
 parallel veins is the peculiarity 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.539
 of his sons' is to allow the 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.910
 plant better to resist drought 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.739
 last little thing the mimosas to 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.709
 entire sheets for example as the 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.180
 mimosa caterpillars acacias longy folha or 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.489
 the one we know very well mimosa 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.970
 four-season acacias retina audet 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.430
 they are a little more cautious than the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.320
 classics it resists around -5 or -8 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.370
 degrees no more this one he can 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.370
 support -10 degrees 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.629
 I propose now to discover 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.340
 some mimosas particularly 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.110
 remarkable some come from the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.790
 national collection of mimosa de 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.500
 sir gÃ©rard cahn is wrong she is 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.989
 on board mimosas of course let's start 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.930
 our series by the leaf mimosas 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.420
 pained very fine compound and the famous 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.849
 acacias dealbata the classic mimosa 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.519
 with some cultivars interesting by 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.319
 Gallic example astier is ideal for the 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.360
 culture in vats it will hardly exceed 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.790
 three meters high on the other hand at 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.590
 side of him the most imposing mirandol 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.000
 he can reach in the open ground this 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.269
 about 8 meters 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.810
 here are beautiful acacias and yana marshal 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.940
 joffre 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.190
 it will naturally take a port 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.540
 falling down he is extremely graceful and 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.880
 he can be recognized by his leaves 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.340
 extremely compact much more 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.540
 small than that of the classic mimosa a 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.910
 plant that we can very well 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.829
 cultivating pot much like the 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.890
 classic mimosas but much more 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.349
 flowering acacia rustic squirrel 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.239
 reaches 2 4 to 6 meters in height 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.459
 they wear mostly very very big 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.010
 generous bunch flowers and if you 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.389
 prefer perfume choose acacia 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.739
 of welcoming a delight lymphadenectomy 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.389
 now let's go to mimosas to 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.290
 whole leaves I remind them that they 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.470
 are pilots 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.200
 gold this one auvity moonlight 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.600
 a delicacy a grace a flexibility 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.370
 absolute it is a mimosa that blooms 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.959
 much later not before march april 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.400
 May however it will feel 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.139
 deliciously good you can 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.450
 succeed without problems in a large bin 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:11.290
 next to a curiosity 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.510
 the mimosa caterpillars acacias longy folha 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.209
 with its long leaves and also 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.760
 its long bunches of yellow flowers that 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.470
 will just come out in the spring this 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.300
 mozin friend who is very dense very 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.580
 compact that can serve as a curtain 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.050
 breaking in areas near the edge 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.110
 because he does not fear 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.729
 spray the mimosa of the four seasons 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.800
 acacias retina death is aptly named 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.599
 because he is raising his flowers 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.490
 are maybe a little less dense than 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.050
 the others but it is renewed in 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.270
 permanence and so we take advantage of his 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.590
 flowers throughout the season 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.510
 attention and a little bit chilly 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.620
 we will finish now by my 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.990
 favorite my favorite 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.240
 acacia bus riana it's a hybrid 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.580
 of two species including the famous mimosas 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.220
 classic acacias dealbata it is 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.350
 adorable with her leaves that are gray 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.730
 velvety practically silver a 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.920
 bloom of a sweetness and a 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.810
 abundance and when you caress her 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.550
 leaves they are all ste that 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.880
 means that it stands up perfectly to the 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.880
 drought 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.030
 install your mimosas in the place 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.170

 he likes deep soils rather acidic 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.670
 also bring a little bit of material 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.380
 organic and a little garden secret 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.090
 if the mimosa really needs to 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.950
 drought during the summer period 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.570
 so that they can form their pimples 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.450
 on the other hand when it is 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.950

 bow to the sun 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.270
 really the art that makes us forget
