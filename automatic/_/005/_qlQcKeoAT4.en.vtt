sprint frame add some extra support to
the<00:02:54.530> hilly<00:02:54.680> region<00:02:56.109> again<00:02:57.109> you<00:02:57.230> can<00:02:57.349> see<00:02:57.470> that

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
the hilly region again you can see that

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.640 
the hilly region again you can see that
those<00:02:57.980> dots<00:02:58.250> all<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:58.670> run<00:02:58.849> through<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.650> the

upper also to know this even though it

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.449 
upper also to know this even though it
is<00:03:06.079> a<00:03:06.109> synthetic<00:03:06.650> version<00:03:06.799> it<00:03:07.129> doesn't

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
is a synthetic version it doesn't

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.729 
is a synthetic version it doesn't
feature<00:03:07.970> sprint<00:03:08.690> foil<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.200> for<00:03:09.379> those<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.680> you

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
feature sprint foil and for those of you

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.259 
feature sprint foil and for those of you
I<00:03:09.829> know<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.040> sprint<00:03:10.340> finalists<00:03:10.819> will<00:03:11.000> take<00:03:11.239> a

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
I know a sprint finalists will take a

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.330 
I know a sprint finalists will take a
look<00:03:11.510> at<00:03:11.629> the<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.290> real<00:03:12.470> synthetic<00:03:12.980> version

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
look at the the real synthetic version

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.270 
look at the the real synthetic version
and<00:03:14.079> is<00:03:15.079> this<00:03:15.260> material<00:03:15.799> that's<00:03:15.919> on<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.099> back

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
and is this material that's on the back

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.580 
and is this material that's on the back
that<00:03:16.489> has<00:03:16.579> this<00:03:16.849> very<00:03:17.510> very<00:03:17.629> flexible<00:03:18.079> pliable

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
that has this very very flexible pliable

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.490 
that has this very very flexible pliable
feel<00:03:19.579> to<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.849> heel<00:03:20.139> makes<00:03:21.139> the<00:03:21.260> boot<00:03:21.379> a<00:03:21.410> little

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
feel to the heel makes the boot a little

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.729 
feel to the heel makes the boot a little
bit<00:03:21.980> lighter<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.430> be<00:03:22.519> honest<00:03:23.260> because<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.590> is<00:03:24.709> a

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
bit lighter to be honest because it is a

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.809 
bit lighter to be honest because it is a
much<00:03:24.949> thinner<00:03:25.060> material<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:28.370> has<00:03:28.579> been

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
much thinner material and that has been

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.970 
much thinner material and that has been
removed<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:29.359> we<00:03:29.540> don't<00:03:29.720> see<00:03:29.989> that<00:03:30.019> on<00:03:30.379> the<00:03:30.650> the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
removed so we don't see that on the the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.979 
removed so we don't see that on the the
Messi<00:03:31.370> version<00:03:31.760> that's<00:03:32.150> one<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.599> the<00:03:32.690> primary

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
Messi version that's one of the primary

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.449 
Messi version that's one of the primary
differences<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.799> then<00:03:33.919> obviously<00:03:34.069> the<00:03:34.430> other

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
differences and then obviously the other

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.330 
differences and then obviously the other
difference<00:03:34.970> is<00:03:35.180> this<00:03:36.639> Sprintweb<00:03:37.639> I<00:03:39.099> had<00:03:40.099> some

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
difference is this Sprintweb I had some

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.189 
difference is this Sprintweb I had some
extra<00:03:40.699> texture<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.419> you<00:03:41.540> can<00:03:41.750> kind<00:03:41.959> of<00:03:42.019> see

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
extra texture and you can kind of see

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.930 
extra texture and you can kind of see
the<00:03:42.379> defining<00:03:42.859> features<00:03:43.190> right<00:03:43.400> here<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:43.819> I

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
the defining features right here is I

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.199 
the defining features right here is I
kind<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.209> zoom<00:03:44.449> in<00:03:44.690> these<00:03:45.260> lines<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:46.430> I<00:03:46.970> run

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
kind of zoom in these lines and I run

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.909 
kind of zoom in these lines and I run
kind<00:03:47.599> of<00:03:47.660> like<00:03:47.750> a<00:03:47.780> zigzag<00:03:47.989> pattern<00:03:48.379> across<00:03:48.680> the
