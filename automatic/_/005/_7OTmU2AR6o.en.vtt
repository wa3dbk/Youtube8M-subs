00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
of just gesture drawing we've just

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.650 
of just gesture drawing we've just
scribbles<00:02:14.910> or<00:02:15.030> whatever<00:02:15.209> um<00:02:15.860> over<00:02:16.860> time<00:02:17.099> that

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
scribbles or whatever um over time that

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.330 
scribbles or whatever um over time that
suckers<00:02:18.080> going<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.290> fill<00:02:18.500> up<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.890> once<00:02:19.220> it

suckers going to fill up and once it
fills<00:02:19.520> up<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.970> just<00:02:20.150> start<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.420> next<00:02:20.540> one<00:02:20.720> and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
fills up you just start the next one and

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.030 
fills up you just start the next one and
eventually<00:02:21.350> what<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.560> can<00:02:21.710> do<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.010> can

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
eventually what you can do is you can

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.290 
eventually what you can do is you can
you<00:02:22.190> start<00:02:22.340> flipping<00:02:22.700> through<00:02:22.940> them<00:02:23.090> and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
you start flipping through them and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.030 
you start flipping through them and
you're<00:02:23.690> going<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.900> see<00:02:24.080> recurring<00:02:24.590> patterns

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
you're going to see recurring patterns

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.700 
you're going to see recurring patterns
right<00:02:25.460> for<00:02:26.150> me<00:02:26.300> a<00:02:26.540> lot<00:02:26.990> of<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.140> stuff<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:27.470> draw

right for me a lot of the stuff I draw

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.320 
right for me a lot of the stuff I draw
is<00:02:27.980> anatomy<00:02:28.520> beats<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:29.090> know<00:02:29.180> like

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
is anatomy beats you know like

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.750 
is anatomy beats you know like
superheroes<00:02:29.960> or<00:02:30.140> something<00:02:30.680> like<00:02:30.740> that<00:02:30.800> so<00:02:31.160> I

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
need to get better at Anatomy I still do

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.910 
need to get better at Anatomy I still do
so<00:02:34.760> what<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:34.940> like<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.300> do<00:02:35.600> is<00:02:35.780> set<00:02:36.590> aside<00:02:36.890> a

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
missing maybe you started to not add

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.949 
missing maybe you started to not add
shadows<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.790> your<00:03:49.910> art<00:03:50.060> maybe<00:03:50.420> you<00:03:50.690> stop

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
rendering maybe you added shadows may be

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.720 
rendering maybe you added shadows may be
added<00:03:53.390> rendering<00:03:54.160> all<00:03:55.160> kinds<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:55.459> things<00:03:55.640> like

that<00:03:55.820> so<00:03:55.940> take<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.120> look<00:03:56.270> at<00:03:56.360> what<00:03:56.390> you're<00:03:56.570> doing

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
that so take a look at what you're doing

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.630 
that so take a look at what you're doing
now<00:03:57.040> compared<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.070> what<00:03:58.250> you're<00:03:58.340> doing<00:03:58.370> before

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
now compared to what you're doing before

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.720 
now compared to what you're doing before
now<00:03:59.180> if<00:03:59.450> you<00:03:59.720> don't<00:03:59.900> keep<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.709> record<00:04:01.070> I<00:04:01.489> know

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
now if you don't keep a record I know

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.160 
now if you don't keep a record I know
some<00:04:02.000> people<00:04:02.030> they<00:04:02.209> just<00:04:02.239> burn<00:04:02.630> or<00:04:02.840> they<00:04:02.930> throw

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
some people they just burn or they throw

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.440 
some people they just burn or they throw
out<00:04:03.290> their<00:04:03.440> sketches<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:04.430> stuff<00:04:04.640> which<00:04:05.300> i

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
out their sketches and stuff which i

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.020 
out their sketches and stuff which i
guess<00:04:05.720> is<00:04:05.750> fine<00:04:06.080> but<00:04:06.620> what<00:04:07.400> that's<00:04:07.610> doing<00:04:07.820> is

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
guess is fine but what that's doing is

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.729 
guess is fine but what that's doing is
that's<00:04:08.239> making<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:08.870> so<00:04:08.989> you<00:04:09.050> can't<00:04:09.380> go<00:04:09.530> back

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
that's making it so you can't go back

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.949 
that's making it so you can't go back
and<00:04:09.800> compare<00:04:10.310> yourself<00:04:10.700> to<00:04:10.730> anything<00:04:10.970> um<00:04:11.300> some

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
and compare yourself to anything um some

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
there's one part there um what was the

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.170 
there's one part there um what was the
time<00:05:11.010> frame<00:05:11.280> for<00:05:11.340> you<00:05:11.550> go<00:05:11.700> from<00:05:11.850> amateur

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
time frame for you go from amateur

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.520 
time frame for you go from amateur
artist<00:05:12.480> to<00:05:12.600> producing<00:05:12.870> art<00:05:13.050> work<00:05:13.200> worthy<00:05:13.380> of

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
artist to producing art work worthy of

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.570 
artist to producing art work worthy of
an<00:05:13.590> audience<00:05:13.800> now<00:05:13.980> this<00:05:14.160> one<00:05:14.280> I<00:05:14.310> think<00:05:14.400> a

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
an audience now this one I think a

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.710 
an audience now this one I think a
little<00:05:14.700> bit<00:05:14.820> of<00:05:14.910> a<00:05:14.940> trick<00:05:15.150> question<00:05:15.270> because<00:05:15.480> I

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
little bit of a trick question because I

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.120 
little bit of a trick question because I
think<00:05:15.750> even<00:05:16.350> if<00:05:16.410> you're<00:05:16.530> only<00:05:16.590> drawing<00:05:16.830> stick

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
think even if you're only drawing stick

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.370 
think even if you're only drawing stick
people<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:18.240> say<00:05:18.420> it's<00:05:18.570> not<00:05:18.690> worthy<00:05:19.110> of<00:05:19.260> an

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
people to say it's not worthy of an

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.170 
people to say it's not worthy of an
audience<00:05:19.590> is<00:05:19.800> probably<00:05:20.280> misleading<00:05:20.850> yourself

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
audience is probably misleading yourself

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.790 
audience is probably misleading yourself
I<00:05:21.360> think<00:05:21.630> I<00:05:21.690> know<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:21.870> know<00:05:22.200> what<00:05:22.500> you're<00:05:22.620> trying

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
I think I know I know what you're trying

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.850 
I think I know I know what you're trying
to<00:05:23.010> say<00:05:23.040> with<00:05:23.310> that<00:05:23.370> um<00:05:23.730> but<00:05:24.450> try<00:05:25.110> to<00:05:25.170> dismiss

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
to say with that um but try to dismiss

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.140 
to say with that um but try to dismiss
that<00:05:26.010> negativity<00:05:26.460> that<00:05:26.730> you<00:05:26.820> give<00:05:27.030> yourself

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
that negativity that you give yourself

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.580 
that negativity that you give yourself
that<00:05:27.690> we<00:05:27.870> all<00:05:27.990> give<00:05:28.110> ourselves<00:05:28.200> where<00:05:28.500> it's

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
if it is just primitive stuff you will

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.200 
if it is just primitive stuff you will
get<00:05:48.960> better<00:05:49.110> over<00:05:49.410> time<00:05:49.490> um<00:05:50.490> so<00:05:50.880> the<00:05:51.000> time

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
get better over time um so the time

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.020 
get better over time um so the time
frame<00:05:51.510> i<00:05:54.740> I<00:05:55.740> don't<00:05:56.040> know<00:05:56.250> i<00:05:56.310> would<00:05:56.610> say<00:05:56.820> it<00:05:56.940> was

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030

if i had to give an actual date for

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.250 
if i had to give an actual date for
myself<00:05:59.820> i<00:05:59.970> would<00:06:00.360> say<00:06:00.480> was<00:06:00.660> probably<00:06:00.990> about<00:06:01.200> a

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
myself i would say was probably about a

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.900
