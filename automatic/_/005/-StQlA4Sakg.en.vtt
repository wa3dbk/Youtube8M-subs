she's she's afraid at times but what I

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.730 
she's she's afraid at times but what I
think<00:01:22.720> where<00:01:22.990> she's<00:01:23.229> really<00:01:23.470> inspirational

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
think where she's really inspirational

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.130 
think where she's really inspirational
that<00:01:24.220> she<00:01:24.340> pushes<00:01:24.729> through<00:01:24.970> that<00:01:25.180> fear<00:01:25.840> so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
that she pushes through that fear so

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.660 
that she pushes through that fear so
that's<00:01:26.409> like<00:01:26.500> true<00:01:26.710> bravery<00:01:26.979> because<00:01:27.430> there's

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
that's like true bravery because there's

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.070 
that's like true bravery because there's
fear<00:01:27.970> involved<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:28.479> know<00:01:28.510> she<00:01:28.659> pushes

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
fear involved you know she pushes

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.260 
fear involved you know she pushes
through<00:01:29.200> that<00:01:29.409> barrier<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.980> I<00:01:30.730> think<00:01:31.120> that's

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
through that barrier and I think that's

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.610 
through that barrier and I think that's
something<00:01:31.420> that's<00:01:31.630> really<00:01:31.810> aspirational<00:01:32.260> and

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
something that's really aspirational and

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.530 
something that's really aspirational and
I<00:01:32.740> actually<00:01:32.920> think<00:01:33.100> it's<00:01:33.280> it's<00:01:33.540> it's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
I actually think it's it's it's

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.810 
I actually think it's it's it's
inspirational<00:01:35.140> not<00:01:35.350> just<00:01:35.980> two<00:01:36.280> females<00:01:36.640> but

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
inspirational not just two females but

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.520 
inspirational not just two females but
also<00:01:36.970> two<00:01:37.120> males<00:01:37.390> because<00:01:37.750> I<00:01:37.930> feel<00:01:38.140> like<00:01:38.170> now

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
also two males because I feel like now

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.040 
also two males because I feel like now
we<00:01:38.950> can<00:01:39.100> relate<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.400> her<00:01:39.610> on<00:01:39.790> that<00:01:39.940> basic<00:01:40.360> human

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
we can relate to her on that basic human

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.440 
we can relate to her on that basic human
level<00:01:41.290> and<00:01:42.010> I<00:01:42.280> think<00:01:42.460> that's<00:01:42.730> a<00:01:42.910> really<00:01:43.300> cool

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
level and I think that's a really cool

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.530 
level and I think that's a really cool
thing

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.330 

it's<00:01:47.470> a<00:01:47.560> really<00:01:47.710> exciting<00:01:48.250> opportunity

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
it's a really exciting opportunity

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.250 
it's a really exciting opportunity
because<00:01:48.940> we<00:01:49.120> didn't<00:01:49.300> want<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.480> just<00:01:49.570> challenge

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
because we didn't want to just challenge

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.960 
because we didn't want to just challenge
what<00:01:50.470> people<00:01:50.800> think<00:01:51.010> of<00:01:51.220> Tomb<00:01:51.550> Raider<00:01:51.610> we

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
what people think of Tomb Raider we

liked playing tomb raider together so
that<00:02:23.620> was<00:02:23.860> really<00:02:23.890> one<00:02:24.490> of<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.610> catalysts

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
that was really one of the catalysts

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.990 
that was really one of the catalysts
into<00:02:25.690> deciding<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.590> add<00:02:26.680> multiplayer<00:02:27.250> the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
into deciding to add multiplayer the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.180 
into deciding to add multiplayer the
conundrum<00:02:28.840> was<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.500> we<00:02:29.560> weren't<00:02:29.740> willing<00:02:30.010> to

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
conundrum was that we weren't willing to

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.280 
conundrum was that we weren't willing to
split<00:02:30.520> our<00:02:30.580> resources<00:02:31.120> because<00:02:31.660> tomb<00:02:32.110> raider

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
split our resources because tomb raider

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.080 
split our resources because tomb raider
it's<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.709> single<00:02:33.070> player<00:02:33.340> experience<00:02:33.370> of

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
it's a single player experience of

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.270 
it's a single player experience of
stories<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.870> what<00:02:35.230> you're<00:02:35.530> going<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:35.890> get<00:02:36.040> tomb

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
stories is what you're going to get tomb

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.699 
stories is what you're going to get tomb
raider<00:02:36.430> for<00:02:36.700> but<00:02:37.540> we<00:02:37.870> knew<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.080> we<00:02:38.410> could<00:02:38.590> do

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
raider for but we knew that we could do

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.140 
raider for but we knew that we could do
something<00:02:38.920> really<00:02:39.070> cool<00:02:39.640> with<00:02:39.700> multiplayer

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
something really cool with multiplayer

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.270 
something really cool with multiplayer
so<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:41.170> worked<00:02:41.440> out<00:02:41.560> perfectly<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.190> our

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
so it worked out perfectly that our

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.850 
so it worked out perfectly that our
sister<00:02:42.580> studio<00:02:42.850> die<00:02:43.030> das<00:02:43.209> montreal<00:02:43.860> they

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
sister studio die das montreal they

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.470 
sister studio die das montreal they
wanted<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.310> take<00:02:45.489> on<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.760> challenge<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.390> so

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
wanted to take on the challenge and so

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.360 
wanted to take on the challenge and so
we<00:02:46.600> didn't<00:02:46.750> have<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.930> divert<00:02:47.290> our<00:02:47.500> resources

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
we didn't have to divert our resources

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.979 
we didn't have to divert our resources
they<00:02:48.760> were<00:02:48.820> already<00:02:49.120> familiar<00:02:49.300> with<00:02:49.660> our

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
they were already familiar with our

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.540 
they were already familiar with our
engine<00:02:50.380> because<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.739> their<00:02:50.860> work<00:02:50.980> on<00:02:51.100> deus<00:02:51.340> ex

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
engine because of their work on deus ex

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.210 
engine because of their work on deus ex
so<00:02:52.209> it<00:02:52.420> was<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> perfect<00:02:52.989> fit<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:54.070> other

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
so it was a perfect fit and the other

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.610 
so it was a perfect fit and the other
reason<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:54.820> I<00:02:55.000> we<00:02:55.660> worked<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.019> hard<00:02:56.050> to

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
reason is that I we worked so hard to

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.229 
reason is that I we worked so hard to
make<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.950> care<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.430> island<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:57.850> character

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
make the care the island a character

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.030 
make the care the island a character
itself<00:02:58.540> so<00:02:59.140> we<00:02:59.470> have<00:02:59.590> all<00:02:59.709> these<00:02:59.830> awesome

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
itself so we have all these awesome

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.080 
itself so we have all these awesome
characters<00:03:00.489> in<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.670> single-player<00:03:01.000> story

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
characters in the single-player story

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.360 
characters in the single-player story
but<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.540> island<00:03:01.930> itself<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.350> this<00:03:02.650> incredible

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
but the island itself is this incredible

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.150 
but the island itself is this incredible
kind<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.030> threatening<00:03:04.769> really<00:03:05.769> diverse

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
kind of threatening really diverse

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.820 
kind of threatening really diverse
setting<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.239> so<00:03:07.600> we<00:03:07.900> feel<00:03:08.170> like<00:03:08.380> people<00:03:08.650> are

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
setting and so we feel like people are

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.320 
setting and so we feel like people are
going<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.130> want<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.430> continue<00:03:10.209> their
