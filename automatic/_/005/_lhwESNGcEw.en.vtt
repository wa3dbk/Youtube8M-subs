on<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> minecraft<00:02:01.320> forums<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.799> noticed<00:02:02.219> that

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
on the minecraft forums I noticed that

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.510 
on the minecraft forums I noticed that
there<00:02:02.520> was<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> lot<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.149> talk<00:02:03.540> about<00:02:03.840> oh<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:05.280> can

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.520 
get a virus through LogMeIn hamachi and
the<00:02:08.340> conclusion<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.539> lot<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> posts

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the conclusion to a lot of the posts

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.999 
the conclusion to a lot of the posts
that<00:02:10.560> I've<00:02:10.709> read

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
that I've read

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.220 
that I've read
that<00:02:11.129> was<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.549> is<00:02:11.700> true<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.269> open<00:02:13.049> up<00:02:13.110> a

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
that was it is true if you open up a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.770 
that was it is true if you open up a
server<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.830> invite<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> bunch<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.239> people<00:02:15.299> onto

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
server and invite a bunch of people onto

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.410 
server and invite a bunch of people onto
the<00:02:15.900> server<00:02:16.200> who<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.340> don't<00:02:17.879> know<00:02:18.090> personally

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
the server who you don't know personally

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.100 
the server who you don't know personally
then<00:02:19.110> that's<00:02:19.500> pretty<00:02:19.950> scary<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:20.909> if<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.810> do

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
then that's pretty scary so if you do

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.580 
then that's pretty scary so if you do
want<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.379> do<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.680> host<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.659> hamachi<00:02:24.659> server<00:02:25.110> to

what I've learned is you need to have a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.089 
what I've learned is you need to have a
good<00:02:39.239> personal<00:02:39.659> firewall<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.470> was<00:02:40.709> one<00:02:40.980> of

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
good personal firewall that was one of

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.619 
good personal firewall that was one of
the<00:02:41.159> big<00:02:41.310> things<00:02:41.609> you<00:02:41.849> need<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.030> encrypt<00:02:42.450> your

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
data because people might of course it's

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:46.819

everything up hamachi is a great program

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.830 
everything up hamachi is a great program
