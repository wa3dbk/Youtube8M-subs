00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.950
Hello friends of analog entertainment and welcome to another episode of Hunter and Cron.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.040
Today with King of Tokyo - Power up! The first
expansion to the monster game by Richard Garfield.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.640
Yes what brings it to the table?
First "Pandakai", a new addition to the monster squad.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.220
Beautiful Monster, beautiful designed as always.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.319
And there are new cards, a new type of cards,
namely evolution cards.

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:30.939
And that is ultimately what many have missed in the main game.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.280
Namely, each monster gets additional special abilities 
that are tailored for the monster.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:45.150
Yes every monster gets its own stack, face down next to him. 
Mixed, of course.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:54.070
And when I roll three hearts in the game I can buy an evolution - 
well I would not say buy..

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.800
When I roll three hearts my monster mutates,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.880
and I peel out this evolution from inside.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:09.130
Gigazaur ... he has something like radioactive waste, primal scream, tail shock. Dinosaur-adaptability.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.019
And the other monsters have abilities that fit more to them, for example Alienoid : Help from the mothership.

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:19.709
There are temporary and permanent evolutions.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:22.520
As we know it from the cards already,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.830
Effects that will permanently improve my monster or have a one-time effect

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.580
with which I can annoy all other monsters.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.200
And theoretically I could have several permanent evolutions active simultaneously

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.820
and mutate into a gigantic monster.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.920
It's also quite cool, that these evolutions take place even
if one is in Tokyo.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.470
That means from now on, if you are in Tokyo and actually wanted to roll a huge attack

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.590
and then somehow roll six hearts.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.730
Then you simply invest the hearts in evolution cards.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.399
Otherwise, the game is extended by the fact that you can play different types of rules.

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:10.150
Either you play that each monster gets its proper evolution stack.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.800
Or you play a variant, where each monster already starts with one evolution.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.199
Or you play mixed-evolution,
then all evolution cards are shuffled

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.110
and everyone gets a wildly mixed stack.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.180
I think this extension fits seamlessly into the game,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.169
It's unobtrusive, small, does not interfere.

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:33.149
It does not make things more complicated, does not make things any longer.

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:36.859
And it's somehow still what many have missed.

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:42.449
I think you don't have to have it, but it is highly recommended.

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.459
It makes King of Tokyo just one inch better.

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.750
After a year of King of Tokyo our gaming group has enthusiastically embraced this extension.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.520
All wanted to be Pandakai.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.389
So I would really recommend it to anyone
who owns the basic game

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.099
and just wants to have a little bit more variety.

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.239
Yes that was it for Power Up!

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.179
There is yet another expansion,
so stay tuned and see you next time.
