00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.429
 Secret of photography 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.429
 It is Hirose 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:24.170
 This time with a wide-angle lens of cherry blossoms 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.170
 How to eat effectively 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:32.500
 I would like to talk about this 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:35.579
 Wide-angle lenses are very important for photography 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:40.770
 It is one of the expressions 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.670
 I think that there are a lot of things that can not be used well 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.760
 What is it 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.550
 It is reflected widely 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.829
 It is easy to enter extras 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.050
 And to 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:59.180
 It means that the pattern of the object is likely to be smaller 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:03.220
 After all distance to solve this problem 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.920
 And angle I think this will be important 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.820
 Let's go here very much 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:15.770
 Though it is a photograph that has a sense of volume of cherry blossoms 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.920
 You know that I am often seen but it is not a little more empty part 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.320
 It is the first time to go 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:30.479
 It has become a state of Edaburi that has been almost uniformly express 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.479
 I will try to work closer to the distance to emphasize the Perth 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.920
 This is true 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.280
 Perth is emphasized and the thickness of Mickey 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:45.170
 I think that the thickness of the trunk looks completely different compared to the previous 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:49.270
 And empty part also has become considerably less we will again look at the previous work 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.890
 The feeling has changed a lot compared to this photo 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:58.130
 But still one 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.790
 Point says that there are a lot of reflections on the water surface 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.390
 this 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.930
 There is a pl filter as a way to deal with it 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.970
 This is where you use the pl filter 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.020
 It looks like this for a work with an el filter, not using pu 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.120
 State 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:26.580
 And using state this way comes considerably out differences 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:30.300
 The color of cherry blossoms also comes out beautifully, and the relative background is that the reflection of water can also be suppressed 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:34.100
 Can make cherry blossoms stand out in the dark 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.100
 I think there is a merit in the sense 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.900
 Thus Perth Oh 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.340
 Emphasis 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.920
 And 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.260
 Color contrast 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.260
 I think that you should be careful about this area
