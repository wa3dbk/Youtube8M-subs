00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.920
 what is the man me july socket snp 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.510
 and I have studies for the internet and I go 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.240
 a is talking about playstation 4 that does not 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.789
 I know if they saw it last night it came out like a 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.499
 live from the conference that I know 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.969
 speaks where the quad p station and taught 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:18.119
 in the controls and that I already 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.039
 they showed the console but I have pallets 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.279
 photos there is in the boat so they can see 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.429
 but if this one that talks about the pal of enjoys 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.769
 this first one is going to talk about the control the 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.419
 control of truth and this friend who gives me 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.099
 fear is that after that I do not know 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.110
 feel good control even if one is 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.270
 He usually gets used to that later but if he's 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.850
 well as a screen in the middle I do not know 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.100
 if they have seen it this way they do not know is going to 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.129
 be well as in Christmas this year 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.550
 in 2013 this one is going to have as a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.140
 rectangular screen in the middle that that 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.210
 it seems that they do not continue to mix the wifi with 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.320
 the playstation 4 control the wrong but 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.600
 if it is something else 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.730
 he was going to see that also a voice 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.010
 and neither is he and what do I know that will serve you 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.859
 merger like that for details and that that 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.780
 you are super nice this but they added 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.030
 this thing that is called as it happens the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.670
 stream 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.159
 what is going to happen to you with your friend 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.100
 will be able to make this life news string 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.220
 to know what that and I have no idea 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.280
 of the jce and what I know are twitch 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:22.460
 youtube and this for the thing that you can 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.670
 stream with that and you can also 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.610
 give your friend that this wish is 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.290
 is playing a game obviously this 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.650
 because as that controlled them your 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.200
 friend without you in the room with you 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.000
 like to virtually control him 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.640
 so that I play in a part bolt and 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.740
 help you with whatever it is not that 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.570
 that is true and the lag that called me the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.120
 attention a lot 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.140
 this one also this put like this 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.120
 suspense mode that this one basically yes 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.340
 is doing something that if I do not know if it's going 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.060
 to be the one for netflix or what is it doing 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.520
 some the fbi this instead of turning it off 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.710
 to do this and then do the other 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.200
 what if I like this one because it's cam 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.910
 safe like that is going to hold that there goes 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.110
 grandma doing something else was going to be able 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.610
 back to what I was doing 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.910
 originally without you lying down 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.280
 without that there is not 26 and that that is 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.820
 pretty lines this visually 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.320
 videogame there this one killzone and I wanted 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.989
 I had listened so it looks more or 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.300
 less and this one and test in and that really 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.020
 I do not have any idea what that game is 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.790
 but if this one I saw there in the conference 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.830
 that if they are pro tell me what 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.110
 think of playstation 4 jesse joy 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.470
 control and that is for me to be of 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.970
 superbikes I do not know I like the photo 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.460
 the control is what calls me the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.650
 consoles attention as I get the same 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.800
 just like that be a little bit bigger 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.610
 but probably only the same 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.830
 size of which we have now enough I think 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.970
 that is like the 400 pesos something like that 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.800
 probably like 450 and this and 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.180
 then only these degrees go down well 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.700
 it may be a year or six months or 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.650
 something like that already with what the playstation 3 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.180
 It was then that he jumped out the 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.990
 principle after they lowered it to costs 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.250
 300 something like that for this one but he likes it 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.560
 the video if you have any information 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.180
 additional can you tell me and that and if 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.370
 they want to give you there the video already counts 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.180
 and as always for the next video 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.180
 may already
