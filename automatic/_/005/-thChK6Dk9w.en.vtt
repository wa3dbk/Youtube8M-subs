I said non Marvel Legends because it's

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.960 
I said non Marvel Legends because it's
technically<00:00:19.680> not<00:00:20.010> it's<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.490> spider-man

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970

technically not it's in this spider-man
movie<00:00:21.359> line<00:00:21.539> but<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:22.800> basically<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.400> Marvel

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
movie line but it's basically a Marvel

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.429 
movie line but it's basically a Marvel
Legends<00:00:24.060> figure<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.539> with<00:00:24.720> lower<00:00:25.170> quality

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
Legends figure just with lower quality

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.589 
Legends figure just with lower quality
if<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.189> can<00:00:26.369> believe<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.970> it's<00:00:27.180> got<00:00:27.359> less

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
if you can believe that it's got less

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.300 
if you can believe that it's got less
quality<00:00:28.050> than<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> standard<00:00:28.650> Marvel<00:00:29.010> Legends

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
quality than a standard Marvel Legends

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.540 
quality than a standard Marvel Legends
figure<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.960> I<00:00:30.960> think<00:00:31.949> that's<00:00:32.099> really<00:00:32.250> saying

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
figure and I think that's really saying

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.160 
figure and I think that's really saying
something<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.090> we'll<00:00:33.300> point<00:00:33.510> out<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.780> issues

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
to look like webbing and I guess it kind

looking I don't care for that and snaps
on<00:00:57.600> new<00:00:57.780> wrists<00:01:00.680> but<00:01:01.680> even<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.100> he<00:01:02.190> does<00:01:02.370> that

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
on new wrists but even if he does that

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.130 
on new wrists but even if he does that
in<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.670> comics<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.390> looks<00:01:03.600> bad<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
in the comics it just looks bad on the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.420 
in the comics it just looks bad on the
toy<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.530> think<00:01:06.560> anyway<00:01:07.560> let's<00:01:07.920> talk<00:01:08.070> about<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
toy I think anyway let's talk about the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.130 
toy I think anyway let's talk about the
paint<00:01:08.640> application<00:01:08.820> first<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.750> some<00:01:09.900> places

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
paint application first in some places

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.230 
paint application first in some places
it's<00:01:10.439> pretty<00:01:10.680> good<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> lines<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
it's pretty good like the lines on the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.140 
it's pretty good like the lines on the
fingers<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:13.229> not<00:01:13.439> perfect<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:15.030> pretty

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
fingers it's not perfect but it's pretty

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.770 
fingers it's not perfect but it's pretty
solid

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
solid

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.620 
solid
it's<00:01:16.140> definitely<00:01:16.380> passable<00:01:17.450> they<00:01:18.450> look

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
it's definitely passable they look

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.210 
it's definitely passable they look
pretty<00:01:18.780> good

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
pretty good

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.010 
pretty good
this<00:01:20.220> spider<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.000> all<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> line<00:01:21.540> work<00:01:21.570> is

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
this spider and all the line work is

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.830 
this spider and all the line work is
actually<00:01:22.590> pretty<00:01:22.860> good<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:24.119> lines<00:01:24.420> are<00:01:24.720> where

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
actually pretty good the lines are where

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.539 
actually pretty good the lines are where
they<00:01:25.020> belong<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.040> kind<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.310> thing

they belong and all that kind of thing

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.100 
they belong and all that kind of thing
but<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> paint<00:01:27.060> needs<00:01:27.240> another<00:01:27.540> coat<00:01:27.630> at

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
but the paint needs another coat at

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.749 
but the paint needs another coat at
least<00:01:28.560> because<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.189> see<00:01:29.369> through<00:01:29.610> it's

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
least because you can see through it's

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.670 
least because you can see through it's
kind<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.270> transparent<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.380> see<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
kind of transparent you can see the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.859 
kind of transparent you can see the
black<00:01:31.890> going<00:01:32.759> through<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:33.360> otherwise<00:01:33.420> it

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
black going through it but otherwise it

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.020 
black going through it but otherwise it
looks<00:01:33.900> pretty<00:01:34.350> good<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.250> eyes<00:01:35.430> are<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.820> kind

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
daikin or Dokken same body their same

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.080 
daikin or Dokken same body their same
torso<00:02:01.469> it's<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.829> slightly<00:02:02.100> cheaper<00:02:02.610> version

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
torso it's a slightly cheaper version

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.520 
torso it's a slightly cheaper version
maybe<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:03.600> because<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.110> plastic

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
maybe it's just because of the plastic

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.490 
maybe it's just because of the plastic
they<00:02:04.649> use<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:06.000> missing<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.079> little<00:02:07.259> bit

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
they use but it's missing a little bit

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.390 
they use but it's missing a little bit
of<00:02:07.619> detail<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.069> some<00:02:08.280> places<00:02:09.709> it<00:02:10.709> has<00:02:10.950> well<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
of detail in some places it has well the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.110 
of detail in some places it has well the
torso<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.849> all<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.150> same<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.780> thigh

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
torso is all the same the thigh

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.360 
torso is all the same the thigh
the<00:02:13.299> knees<00:02:13.840> are<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.080> same<00:02:14.379> and<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:14.890> believe<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
the knees are the same and I believe the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.979 
the knees are the same and I believe the
upper<00:02:15.670> part<00:02:15.879> of<00:02:15.909> the<00:02:16.000> lower<00:02:16.120> leg<00:02:16.420> is<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.629> same

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
upper part of the lower leg is the same

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.140 
upper part of the lower leg is the same
but<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.709> shins<00:02:17.980> are<00:02:18.159> different<00:02:18.549> and<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.940> feet

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
but the shins are different and the feet

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.729 
but the shins are different and the feet
are<00:02:19.180> different<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.870> at<00:02:20.290> first<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:20.590> thought

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
are different and at first I thought

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.289 
are different and at first I thought
they<00:02:20.920> were<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.099> same<00:02:21.370> as<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.879> new<00:02:22.030> Marvel

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
they were the same as the new Marvel

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.270 
they were the same as the new Marvel
legend<00:02:22.629> Spider<00:02:22.989> Man<00:02:23.290> which<00:02:23.920> would<00:02:24.099> make<00:02:24.250> sense

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
legend Spider Man which would make sense

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.009 
legend Spider Man which would make sense
but<00:02:24.790> I'm<00:02:24.909> pretty<00:02:25.150> sure<00:02:25.239> they're<00:02:25.599> not<00:02:25.629> they

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
but I'm pretty sure they're not they

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.320 
but I'm pretty sure they're not they
seem<00:02:26.230> smaller<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.010> cheaper<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.700> thinner<00:02:27.970> and

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
seem smaller and cheaper and thinner and

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.220 
seem smaller and cheaper and thinner and
not<00:02:28.989> sculpted<00:02:29.440> as<00:02:29.560> well<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:31.510> he<00:02:31.750> does<00:02:31.959> have

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
not sculpted as well but he does have

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.160 
not sculpted as well but he does have
the<00:02:32.980> ankle<00:02:33.790> pivot<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.299> is<00:02:34.450> on<00:02:34.599> those<00:02:34.780> figures

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
the ankle pivot that is on those figures

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.050 
the ankle pivot that is on those figures
it's<00:02:35.349> just<00:02:35.560> not<00:02:35.709> quite<00:02:35.950> executed<00:02:36.760> as<00:02:36.879> well

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
it's just not quite executed as well

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.589 
it's just not quite executed as well
it's<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.780> little<00:02:37.930> sloppy<00:02:38.530> looking<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.159> think

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
it's a little sloppy looking I think

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.970 
it's a little sloppy looking I think
maybe<00:02:40.599> I'm<00:02:40.810> being<00:02:40.989> too<00:02:41.079> picky<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.829> don't

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
maybe I'm being too picky but I don't

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.830 
maybe I'm being too picky but I don't
like<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.159> way<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.370> feet<00:02:42.579> are<00:02:42.819> so<00:02:43.090> small<00:02:43.150> and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
like the way the feet are so small and

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.300 
like the way the feet are so small and
then<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.049> ankles<00:02:44.379> are<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:44.620> big<00:02:44.829> it<00:02:44.980> just<00:02:45.010> kind

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
then the ankles are so big it just kind

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.759 
then the ankles are so big it just kind
of<00:02:45.400> throws<00:02:45.609> off<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.849> look<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.739> feet<00:02:47.739> are

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
of throws off the look and the feet are

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:48.869 
of throws off the look and the feet are
really

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
really

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.660 
really
oops<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.930> feet<00:02:50.109> are<00:02:50.140> really<00:02:50.709> flat<00:02:51.010> too

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
oops and the feet are really flat too

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.520 
oops and the feet are really flat too
just<00:02:52.390> little<00:02:52.690> things<00:02:52.810> I'm<00:02:53.019> pointing<00:02:53.290> out<00:02:53.379> of

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
just little things I'm pointing out of

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.460 
just little things I'm pointing out of
course<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:54.370> torso<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.329> abdomen<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:56.049> not<00:02:56.319> the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
course the torso the abdomen is not the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.339 
course the torso the abdomen is not the
same<00:02:56.680> size<00:02:56.859> as<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.730> groin<00:02:58.090> area<00:02:58.390> if<00:02:59.079> you<00:02:59.170> look

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
same size as the groin area if you look

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.270 
same size as the groin area if you look
from<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.530> side<00:03:00.780> there's<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:02.019> large<00:03:02.980> difference

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
from the side there's a large difference

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.369 
from the side there's a large difference
in<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.819> thickness<00:03:04.450> here<00:03:04.480> in<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.049> thickness

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
in the thickness here in the thickness

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.890 
in the thickness here in the thickness
there<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:07.000> don't<00:03:07.299> know<00:03:07.450> if<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.599> can<00:03:07.720> tell

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
there and I don't know if you can tell

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.539 
there and I don't know if you can tell
so<00:03:08.079> much<00:03:08.140> from<00:03:08.379> here<00:03:08.530> but<00:03:08.709> overall<00:03:08.950> it's<00:03:09.310> just

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
so much from here but overall it's just

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.089 
so much from here but overall it's just
there's<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.510> big<00:03:10.780> kind<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.379> bridge<00:03:11.620> going<00:03:11.890> all

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
there's a big kind of a bridge going all

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.199 
there's a big kind of a bridge going all
the<00:03:12.190> way<00:03:12.220> around<00:03:12.579> because<00:03:12.700> they<00:03:12.879> don't<00:03:13.030> fit

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
the way around because they don't fit

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.149 
the way around because they don't fit
together<00:03:13.329> he<00:03:14.230> does<00:03:14.440> have<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.769> extra

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
together he does have this extra

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.220 
together he does have this extra
shoulder<00:03:15.519> pivot<00:03:15.879> in<00:03:16.030> there<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:17.019> works

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
shoulder pivot in there and it works

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.990 
shoulder pivot in there and it works
well<00:03:17.440> enough<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:18.250> paint<00:03:18.519> goes<00:03:18.700> all<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:18.910> way

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
well enough the paint goes all the way

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.589 
well enough the paint goes all the way
in<00:03:19.299> so<00:03:19.510> it's<00:03:19.750> okay<00:03:20.669> the<00:03:21.669> red<00:03:21.910> on<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.120> shoulders

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
in so it's okay the red on the shoulders

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.470 
in so it's okay the red on the shoulders
doesn't<00:03:22.900> match<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.230> other<00:03:23.260> parts<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.889> red

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
doesn't match the other parts of the red

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.089 
doesn't match the other parts of the red
he's<00:03:25.480> got<00:03:25.690> completely<00:03:26.139> new<00:03:26.290> arms<00:03:26.620> as<00:03:26.739> far<00:03:26.769> as<00:03:27.040> I

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
he's got completely new arms as far as I

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.409 
he's got completely new arms as far as I
can<00:03:27.160> tell<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.459> thought<00:03:27.730> these<00:03:27.910> were<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.150> same

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
can tell I thought these were the same

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.930 
can tell I thought these were the same
as<00:03:28.629> the<00:03:28.810> new<00:03:28.959> ones<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:30.129> new<00:03:30.280> Marvel<00:03:30.489> Legends

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
as the new ones the new Marvel Legends

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.180 
as the new ones the new Marvel Legends
ones<00:03:31.150> but<00:03:31.569> I<00:03:31.810> don't<00:03:32.349> think<00:03:32.560> they<00:03:32.709> are<00:03:32.739> after

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
ones but I don't think they are after

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.289 
ones but I don't think they are after
looking<00:03:33.400> at<00:03:33.489> them<00:03:33.639> closer<00:03:33.849> they're<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.150> little

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
looking at them closer they're a little

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.289 
looking at them closer they're a little
bit<00:03:34.480> slimmer<00:03:35.169> and<00:03:35.489> they<00:03:36.489> actually<00:03:36.639> sculpted

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
bit slimmer and they actually sculpted

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.580 
bit slimmer and they actually sculpted
pretty<00:03:37.510> well<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.840> they<00:03:37.959> fit<00:03:38.169> spider-man

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
pretty well and they fit spider-man

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.759 
pretty well and they fit spider-man
pretty<00:03:38.889> nicely<00:03:39.400> but<00:03:40.139> they<00:03:41.139> seem<00:03:41.349> a<00:03:41.379> bit<00:03:41.590> too

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
pretty nicely but they seem a bit too

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.390 
pretty nicely but they seem a bit too
small<00:03:42.190> for<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.609> for<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.419> torso<00:03:43.660> and<00:03:44.400> they

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
small for the for the torso and they

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.750 
small for the for the torso and they
have<00:03:45.519> really<00:03:45.790> big<00:03:45.970> pegs<00:03:47.129> but<00:03:48.129> it<00:03:48.280> does<00:03:48.430> look

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
have really big pegs but it does look

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.659 
have really big pegs but it does look
okay<00:03:49.419> and<00:03:49.680> he's<00:03:50.680> got<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.919> wide<00:03:51.069> jointed<00:03:51.489> hips

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
okay and he's got the wide jointed hips

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.460 
okay and he's got the wide jointed hips
for<00:03:51.849> this<00:03:51.970> body<00:03:52.209> so<00:03:52.629> I'm<00:03:52.900> not<00:03:53.019> a<00:03:53.049> big<00:03:53.230> fan<00:03:53.410> of

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
for this body so I'm not a big fan of

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.869 
for this body so I'm not a big fan of
this<00:03:53.620> body<00:03:53.859> as<00:03:54.040> you<00:03:54.160> guys<00:03:54.310> know<00:03:54.579> from<00:03:54.730> other

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
this body as you guys know from other

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.059 
this body as you guys know from other
videos<00:03:55.299> but<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.019> works<00:03:56.230> well<00:03:56.440> enough<00:03:56.470> for<00:03:56.919> this

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
videos but it works well enough for this

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.319 
videos but it works well enough for this
guy<00:03:57.280> and<00:03:57.579> even<00:03:58.510> though<00:03:58.660> he's<00:03:58.989> lacking<00:03:59.560> some

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
guy and even though he's lacking some

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.849 
guy and even though he's lacking some
quality<00:04:01.329> overall<00:04:01.660> even<00:04:02.230> compared<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.590> Marvel

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
quality overall even compared to Marvel

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.710 
quality overall even compared to Marvel
Legends<00:04:03.160> it's<00:04:03.310> still<00:04:03.489> a<00:04:03.519> decent<00:04:03.760> figure<00:04:04.209> one

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
Legends it's still a decent figure one

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.059 
Legends it's still a decent figure one
of<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.900> biggest<00:04:05.199> things<00:04:05.440> I<00:04:05.590> thought<00:04:05.859> was<00:04:06.010> a

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
of the biggest things I thought was a

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.559 
of the biggest things I thought was a
misstep<00:04:06.370> for<00:04:06.849> this<00:04:07.090> figure<00:04:07.419> is<00:04:07.810> he<00:04:08.019> has<00:04:08.199> no

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
misstep for this figure is he has no

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.289 
misstep for this figure is he has no
neck<00:04:10.569> pivot<00:04:11.049> all<00:04:11.169> he<00:04:11.290> has<00:04:11.470> is<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.799> swivel<00:04:12.299> and

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
neck pivot all he has is the swivel and

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.729 
neck pivot all he has is the swivel and
for<00:04:13.660> spider-man<00:04:14.109> you<00:04:14.230> should<00:04:14.470> be<00:04:14.560> able<00:04:14.650> to

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
for spider-man you should be able to

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.800 
for spider-man you should be able to
make<00:04:14.889> him<00:04:15.010> look<00:04:15.190> up<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.489> down<00:04:15.639> but<00:04:16.389> you<00:04:16.539> can't

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
make him look up and down but you can't

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.129 
make him look up and down but you can't
so<00:04:17.049> that's<00:04:17.260> a<00:04:17.349> big<00:04:17.560> misstep<00:04:17.889> I<00:04:18.160> think<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:19.810> it

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
so that's a big misstep I think is it

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.760 
so that's a big misstep I think is it
worth<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.650> $16<00:04:21.609> price<00:04:21.940> tag<00:04:22.210> at<00:04:22.510> Walmart<00:04:23.140> maybe

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
worth the $16 price tag at Walmart maybe

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.610 
worth the $16 price tag at Walmart maybe
it's<00:04:24.490> it's<00:04:25.300> not<00:04:25.539> definitely<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.050> nice<00:04:26.200> addition

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
it's it's not definitely a nice addition

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.870 
it's it's not definitely a nice addition
to<00:04:26.650> the

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
to the

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.940 
to the
Piderman<00:04:27.060> collection<00:04:27.840> but<00:04:28.320> don't<00:04:28.530> expect<00:04:28.620> a

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
Piderman collection but don't expect a

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.880 
Piderman collection but don't expect a
great<00:04:29.190> figure<00:04:29.430> he's<00:04:29.760> very<00:04:30.210> very<00:04:30.890> just

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
great figure he's very very just

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.250 
great figure he's very very just
satisfactory<00:04:32.880> he's<00:04:33.180> okay<00:04:33.600> enough<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.990> put<00:04:34.170> on

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
satisfactory he's okay enough to put on

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.600 
satisfactory he's okay enough to put on
the<00:04:34.350> shelf<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:35.190> go<00:04:35.310> with<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.490> other

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
the shelf and to go with the other

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.730 
the shelf and to go with the other
spider-man<00:04:36.060> figures<00:04:36.420> but<00:04:36.720> he's<00:04:37.350> not<00:04:37.560> gonna

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
spider-man figures but he's not gonna

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.600 
spider-man figures but he's not gonna
blow<00:04:37.980> anybody<00:04:38.400> away<00:04:38.730> or<00:04:38.970> impress<00:04:39.480> anybody<00:04:40.610> but

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
blow anybody away or impress anybody but

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.220 
blow anybody away or impress anybody but
still<00:04:41.880> if<00:04:42.150> you<00:04:42.240> were<00:04:42.390> big<00:04:42.570> enough<00:04:42.720> spider-man

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
still if you were big enough spider-man

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.280 
still if you were big enough spider-man
fan<00:04:43.470> I<00:04:43.500> guess<00:04:43.740> it's<00:04:43.800> okay<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.310> have<00:04:44.550> him<00:04:44.790> and

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
fan I guess it's okay to have him and

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.980 
fan I guess it's okay to have him and
his<00:04:46.290> stupid<00:04:46.680> shield<00:04:46.920> and<00:04:47.340> his<00:04:47.760> stupid<00:04:48.210> base<00:04:48.780> at

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
his stupid shield and his stupid base at

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.450 
his stupid shield and his stupid base at
least<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:49.320> pegs<00:04:49.560> are<00:04:49.740> run<00:04:49.860> in<00:04:49.980> front<00:04:50.190> of<00:04:50.340> his

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
least the pegs are run in front of his

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.610 
least the pegs are run in front of his
feet<00:04:50.700> so<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.720> can<00:04:51.870> make<00:04:51.990> him<00:04:52.080> stand<00:04:52.350> on<00:04:52.470> the

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
feet so you can make him stand on the

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.900 
feet so you can make him stand on the
base<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:52.800> little<00:04:53.010> bit<00:04:53.160> better<00:04:53.400> than<00:04:53.610> some<00:04:53.640> of

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
base a little bit better than some of

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.810 
base a little bit better than some of
the<00:04:54.000> other<00:04:54.150> figures<00:04:55.160> but<00:04:56.160> either<00:04:56.310> way<00:04:56.550> there

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820
