00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.650
 English grown in phase with a dot 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.660
 paula we are going to learn collegiate - gueiros 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.179
 on the dashboard 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.059
 here we have told the game 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.929
 it's not that we do not want to make it clear that he's going to stay 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:19.739
 conquest lies in the desert 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.249
 here the camera pointing pro as 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.249
 here as what was left 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.849
 started as br agent for example 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.630
 and it was these pecs 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.170
 if I can define the look of the game 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.490
 as 5 point 4 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.580
 4 points 3 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.410
 three points 2 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.470
 six points earned in six class points 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.660
 without giving the name 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.950
 Iggy picked up bigeye here. 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.420
 or those aspects and that are important that you witnessed if you think it is a game 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.800
 creating internet game 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.080
 it is good that they use correct aspect that the internet 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.150
 if you think that would follow in a game that munique in allianz arena is that 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.480
 those that are there on top of squares 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.470
 We're going to have to run. 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.190
 you're using created the prominp 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.810
 very well 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.910
 pictures remembered that very square ne 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.720
 you can also create 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.020
 much and fuzzy and coen what that square has its return 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.990
 so you can choose the sex aspect 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.950
 here you see you have the foot and sticks 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.300
 this proceeds 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.250
 I know it's not tuned with an eye on music 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.160
 good said that the proof is given in the game ip3 ie you can connect is in the 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.090
 game 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.400
 for a while 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.090
 so what I'm going to expose this camera 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.950
 and I'm going to add 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.670
 a camera that I can control after that explains more about it 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.670
 but just to show you all right 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.100
 also here 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.409

 of isos is for you to see if here the president frustrated 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.279
 but the camera 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.909
 the money changer 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.869
 on day 12 in the U-20 selection 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.869

 in the game stages 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.659
 or how many changes that we will learn after so much we create 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.769
 in the textures semtran 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.319

 so much time here 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.029
 yet it takes time to process 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:27.029
 an ore that is a 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.439
 a board 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.509

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.919
 if you control the camera

 o the ipi green program for it to decrease enough quality 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:01.079
 the power of the Pac admitted 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.079
 keita record he also used rivers 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:07.039
 so you are seeing here 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.779
 how beautiful only nine points 3 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.779
 Campinas with 10 5 meters 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:18.419
 another afternoon also adams against the fish it looks like the cliff 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.150
 one thing is also that it's good you know 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.979
 the verbiage is from here the pcp without control 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.469
 a baby to eat 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:30.469
 six maxim ex-team and I will give the training 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.159
 then you have to control the camera 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:36.889
 and if I want to do the test for example 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.689
 decreases the chance of increasing accessibility 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.559
 debris 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:45.009
 coming back here 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.080
 becomes less sensitive 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.699
 stayed in 2 7 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.469
 here for the decreasing amendment increases in sheffield the faithful here 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.449
 this kind of movement the donkey do if you want 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.729
 now I'm going to take the lawsuit 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.520
 and I see that everything returns to normal what came the resourcefulness of being made I 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.509
 I'm back to normal. 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.620
 if you want the changes to remain there is a snag you can both 

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:19.539
 employees then have 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.539
 It's fine if we find it lends itself 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:26.139
 Peixoto children take after 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.569
 this controls that if you want to pause the game 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.229
 it was possible for ice treatment that statistics 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.439
 I can not move, there's a pattern. 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.939

 and if I come back here, I'll spend the next week 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.860
 If I happen to have this scene then it will not do any good. 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:51.330
