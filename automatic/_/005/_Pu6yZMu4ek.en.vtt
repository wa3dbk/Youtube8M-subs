 called and and everything and let's talk about the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.460
 df to give if we will start first 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.160
 with his connection to your pc 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.829
 You can see a usb as usual. 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.370
 products of this plated connectors 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.030
 gold plated to ensure there is a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.280
 better connection with the machine and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.580
 braided fiber to avoid any damage 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.500
 to this car here of this super mouse 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.060
 cool 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.670
 the mouse if visually looks the same as the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.619
 always fall but you follow 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.990
 with me here on his side 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.490
 he gained a new finish of 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.420
 rubber on this side while you 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.430
 side 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.360
 for you to have a firmer footprint more 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.030
 adherent 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.579
 by the time you are playing with him 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.479
 same five buttons he had on it 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.400
 kept 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.790
 I do not know what happened to this 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.490
 finish here above him but he 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.829
 it's noticeably better I do not know 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.860
 explain how but his footprint stayed 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.290
 much cooler much more comfortable 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.430
 gives even more security in order to give 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.799
 shots and what has changed 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.280
 it was also his sensor light sensor 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.899
 now in this version is the 4g sensor 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.209
 better sensor region than they 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.540
 have developed so far and it is not 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.930
 more up to 3,500 from ipi he was 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.969
 up to 6,000 and 400 ipi simply 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.870
 bend the sensitivity of the mouse thing 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.849
 few 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.609
 and this new version also deli now 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.769
 works in synapse 2.0 that as already 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.829
 I mentioned several network products 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.989
 is nothing more than the new drive the 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.299
 network material 00 where all 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.819
 settings that you put in the 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.769
 synapse will be stored in the cloud and 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.799
 anyone you plug your 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.810
 you mouse you download the synapse you 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.150
 will completely pull out the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.329
 your mouse and you will not have to reconfigure 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.030
 the right taking all that I already 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.909
 I just said it was missing talking that the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.010
 The exchange depends on it's fly. 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.209
 sure you can adjust to do this 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.730
 country exchange 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.400
 instantly in the middle of the game without 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.700
 need to stop or make any kind of 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.150
 cause it's instant shifted it's just shot 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.459
 killed did not have fgue anymore what to say 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.950
 another easy to recognize feature 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.859
 in this 2003 version is that the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.260
 his lighting was changed from blue to 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.150
 green that's it folks 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.090
