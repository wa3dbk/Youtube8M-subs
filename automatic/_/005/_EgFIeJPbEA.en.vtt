00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
for another sword stance I didn't really

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.860 
for another sword stance I didn't really
know<00:03:19.739> how<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.220> respond<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.120> another

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
know how to respond to that another

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.630 
know how to respond to that another
sword<00:03:22.110> stances<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.560> course<00:03:22.890> threatening<00:03:23.550> to

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
sword stances of course threatening to

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.300 
sword stances of course threatening to
me<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:24.360> he<00:03:24.540> went<00:03:24.720> for<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:24.959> third<00:03:25.440> swords<00:03:26.160> are

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
me but he went for the third swords are

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.190 
me but he went for the third swords are
putting<00:03:26.700> him<00:03:26.820> on<00:03:26.850> plus<00:03:27.150> 6<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:27.959> that's<00:03:28.140> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
putting him on plus 6 so that's the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.979 
putting him on plus 6 so that's the
equivalent<00:03:28.530> basically<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.400> being<00:03:29.790> on<00:03:29.970> plus<00:03:30.480> 3

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
equivalent basically of being on plus 3

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.780 
equivalent basically of being on plus 3
because<00:03:31.320> he<00:03:31.380> is<00:03:31.470> burned<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:32.100> I<00:03:32.430> go<00:03:32.580> for<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
give him that unburden boost so I was

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.280 
give him that unburden boost so I was
quite<00:03:41.610> upset<00:03:41.640> with<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.390> situation<00:03:42.420> here<00:03:43.110> of

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
quite upset with the situation here of

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.650 
quite upset with the situation here of
course<00:03:43.530> Jefferson<00:03:44.070> isn't<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.400> lot<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:45.060> trouble

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
course Jefferson isn't a lot of trouble

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.840 
course Jefferson isn't a lot of trouble
but<00:03:46.080> luckily<00:03:46.260> for<00:03:46.530> me<00:03:46.650> Jefferson<00:03:46.890> is<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.280> very

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
but luckily for me Jefferson is a very

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.670 
but luckily for me Jefferson is a very
very<00:03:48.060> bulky<00:03:48.330> pokémon<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:48.989> eats<00:03:49.440> up<00:03:49.650> the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
very bulky pokémon and eats up the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.680 
very bulky pokémon and eats up the
acrobatics<00:03:50.250> quite<00:03:50.459> nicely<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:51.270> I<00:03:51.330> go<00:03:51.450> for<00:03:51.630> the

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
acrobatics quite nicely and I go for the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.870 
acrobatics quite nicely and I go for the
hex<00:03:51.900> if<00:03:52.110> this<00:03:52.500> had<00:03:52.709> been<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.950> power<00:03:53.310> hub<00:03:53.580> sky

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
hex if this had been the power hub sky

attack<00:03:54.120> set<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.570> would<00:03:54.810> have<00:03:54.900> been<00:03:55.020> finished

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
attack set I would have been finished

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.020 
attack set I would have been finished
here<00:03:55.770> it<00:03:56.130> probably<00:03:56.550> would<00:03:56.670> have<00:03:56.700> been<00:03:56.790> good

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
here it probably would have been good

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.699 
here it probably would have been good
game<00:03:57.270> this<00:03:57.480> thing<00:03:57.630> would<00:03:57.750> have<00:03:57.840> swept<00:03:58.080> me<00:03:58.260> but

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
game this thing would have swept me but

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.170 
game this thing would have swept me but
luckily<00:03:58.860> for<00:03:59.160> me<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.370> was<00:03:59.459> Sitrus<00:03:59.850> berry<00:04:00.030> for

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
luckily for me it was Sitrus berry for

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.290 
luckily for me it was Sitrus berry for
the<00:04:00.209> unburden<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.870> then<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.800> was<00:04:02.300> acrobatics

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
the unburden and then it was acrobatics

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.080 
the unburden and then it was acrobatics
so<00:04:03.930> I<00:04:04.230> take<00:04:04.410> out<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.800> alutia<00:04:05.130> big<00:04:05.580> threat<00:04:05.850> and

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
so I take out the alutia big threat and

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.630 
so I take out the alutia big threat and
he's<00:04:06.180> been<00:04:06.390> very<00:04:06.600> very<00:04:06.810> highly<00:04:07.080> set<00:04:07.350> up<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.650> my

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
he's been very very highly set up and my

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.000 
he's been very very highly set up and my
opponent<00:04:09.120> Roger<00:04:09.269> here<00:04:09.720> my<00:04:09.930> friend<00:04:10.200> Roger<00:04:10.380> goes

into mr. Walker and does not play around
I<00:04:12.989> was<00:04:13.290> predicting<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.800> water<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.160> sleep

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
I was predicting the water the sleep

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.490 
I was predicting the water the sleep
powder<00:04:14.730> so<00:04:15.330> I<00:04:15.390> was<00:04:15.510> hoping<00:04:15.720> he<00:04:16.140> would<00:04:16.260> sleep

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
powder so I was hoping he would sleep

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.599 
powder so I was hoping he would sleep
out<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:16.830> my<00:04:16.859> other<00:04:17.040> speed<00:04:17.250> then<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:17.459> could

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
out of my other speed then I could

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.979 
out of my other speed then I could
switch<00:04:17.790> her<00:04:17.910> out<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.269> then<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.660> wouldn't<00:04:18.900> have

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
switch her out and then I wouldn't have

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.210 
switch her out and then I wouldn't have
to<00:04:19.080> worry<00:04:19.320> about<00:04:19.440> having<00:04:19.709> another<00:04:19.890> pokemon

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
to worry about having another pokemon

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.219 
to worry about having another pokemon

straight for the giga drain I should

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.560 
straight for the giga drain I should
have<00:04:23.760> predicted<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.330> gone<00:04:24.419> into

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
have predicted that and gone into

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.210 
have predicted that and gone into
Charizard<00:04:24.900> but<00:04:25.169> I<00:04:25.200> did<00:04:25.410> not<00:04:25.620> I<00:04:25.830> did<00:04:25.860> not<00:04:26.130> want

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
and things like that and that's why I

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.740 
and things like that and that's why I
decided<00:05:43.620> to<00:05:43.950> go<00:05:44.039> for<00:05:44.220> the<00:05:44.280> burn<00:05:44.490> opposed<00:05:45.030> to<00:05:45.510> an
