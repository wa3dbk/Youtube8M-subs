the<00:02:52.060> recorder<00:02:52.510> is<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:53.110> rode<00:02:53.910> ntg-2<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.870> that's

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
the recorder is a rode ntg-2 so that's

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.940 
the recorder is a rode ntg-2 so that's
that<00:02:56.980> that's<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.730> main<00:02:58.530> those<00:02:59.530> are<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.770> main

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
that that's the main those are the main

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.880 
that that's the main those are the main
three<00:03:00.220> things<00:03:00.460> we<00:03:00.580> use<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:01.000> record<00:03:01.890> the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
three things we use to record the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.800 
three things we use to record the
episodes<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.520> then<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.670> use<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.000> final<00:03:04.600> cut<00:03:04.780> pro

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
episodes and then I use a final cut pro

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.750 
episodes and then I use a final cut pro
to<00:03:05.560> edit<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.060> use<00:03:07.240> a<00:03:07.270> program<00:03:07.660> called

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
to edit and I use a program called

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.620 
to edit and I use a program called
pluralize<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:12.190> sink<00:03:12.670> our<00:03:12.850> audio<00:03:13.210> and<00:03:13.420> video

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
pluralize to sink our audio and video

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.390 
pluralize to sink our audio and video
because<00:03:13.960> obviously<00:03:14.230> obviously<00:03:14.650> we're<00:03:15.280> not

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
because obviously obviously we're not

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.780 
because obviously obviously we're not
using<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:17.080> the<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.680> audio<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.610> comes

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790

out<00:03:19.000> of<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.239> camera<00:03:19.540> because<00:03:20.110> they<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.680> they

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
out of the camera because they the they

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.940 
out of the camera because they the they
can<00:03:21.820> 70<00:03:22.330> audio<00:03:22.959> that<00:03:23.200> just<00:03:23.350> comes<00:03:23.590> out<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.890> the
