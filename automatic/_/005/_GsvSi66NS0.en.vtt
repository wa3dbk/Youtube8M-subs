now I have also heard some Filipino

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.240 
now I have also heard some Filipino
friends<00:04:51.620> out<00:04:51.770> there<00:04:51.910> that<00:04:52.910> they<00:04:53.150> think<00:04:53.420> the

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
friends out there that they think the

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.940 
friends out there that they think the
rice<00:04:55.250> is<00:04:55.640> automatically<00:04:56.330> fattening<00:04:56.950> actually

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
rice is automatically fattening actually

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.650 
rice is automatically fattening actually
this<00:04:58.160> is<00:04:58.280> false<00:04:59.170> here's<00:05:00.170> why<00:05:00.970> to<00:05:01.970> most<00:05:02.180> people

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
this is false here's why to most people

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.410 
this is false here's why to most people
-<00:05:02.840> especially<00:05:03.050> -<00:05:03.560> most<00:05:03.740> Filipinos<00:05:04.100> who<00:05:04.730> are

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
- especially - most Filipinos who are

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.070 
- especially - most Filipinos who are
really<00:05:06.110> used<00:05:06.380> to<00:05:06.620> eating<00:05:06.800> rice<00:05:07.190> I<00:05:07.810> think<00:05:08.810> their

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
really used to eating rice I think their

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.580 
really used to eating rice I think their
problem<00:05:09.590> is<00:05:09.740> more<00:05:09.980> on<00:05:10.190> behavioral<00:05:10.900> now<00:05:11.900> what

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
problem is more on behavioral now what

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.410 
problem is more on behavioral now what
do<00:05:12.680> you<00:05:12.740> mean<00:05:12.830> by<00:05:12.980> behavioral<00:05:13.810> things<00:05:15.280> since

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
do you mean by behavioral things since

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.560 
do you mean by behavioral things since
Filipinos<00:05:17.420> like<00:05:17.720> to<00:05:17.870> eat<00:05:18.050> rice<00:05:18.550> they<00:05:19.550> tend<00:05:20.480> to

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
Filipinos like to eat rice they tend to

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.470 
Filipinos like to eat rice they tend to
eat<00:05:20.840> more<00:05:21.440> of<00:05:21.500> it<00:05:21.830> so<00:05:22.070> what<00:05:22.850> happens<00:05:23.330> in

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
eat more of it so what happens in

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.810 
eat more of it so what happens in
reality<00:05:23.660> is<00:05:24.290> that<00:05:24.500> they<00:05:25.070> think<00:05:25.430> that<00:05:25.610> they're

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
reality is that they think that they're

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.740 
reality is that they think that they're
only<00:05:25.970> eating<00:05:26.180> a<00:05:26.660> cup<00:05:26.930> of<00:05:27.110> rice<00:05:27.520> but<00:05:28.520> the<00:05:29.510> truth

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
only eating a cup of rice but the truth

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.660 
only eating a cup of rice but the truth
is<00:05:29.930> they're<00:05:30.140> eating<00:05:30.530> two<00:05:31.010> or<00:05:31.220> three<00:05:31.490> more

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
is they're eating two or three more

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.020 
is they're eating two or three more
servings<00:05:32.150> of<00:05:32.390> it<00:05:32.570> so<00:05:33.260> what<00:05:33.920> happens<00:05:34.430> is<00:05:34.700> that

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
servings of it so what happens is that

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.350 
servings of it so what happens is that
they<00:05:35.600> are<00:05:35.900> simply<00:05:36.500> under<00:05:37.100> estimating<00:05:37.940> the

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
they are simply under estimating the

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.140 
they are simply under estimating the
total<00:05:38.720> amount<00:05:39.080> of<00:05:39.490> calories<00:05:40.490> that<00:05:40.760> they<00:05:40.940> are

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
total amount of calories that they are

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.870 
total amount of calories that they are
really<00:05:41.420> eating<00:05:42.160> but<00:05:43.160> it's<00:05:43.340> not<00:05:43.520> the<00:05:43.670> rice<00:05:43.850> that

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880
