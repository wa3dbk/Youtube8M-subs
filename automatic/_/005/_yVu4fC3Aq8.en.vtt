00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
remember to get back in the same vehicle

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.030 
remember to get back in the same vehicle
and<00:01:04.050> once<00:01:04.320> you've<00:01:04.440> done<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.620> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:04.980> just

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
and once you've done that you can just

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.950 
and once you've done that you can just
go<00:01:05.309> ahead<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.550> complete<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.120> mission<00:01:06.150> and

go ahead and complete the mission and
it's<00:01:07.080> pretty<00:01:07.350> easy<00:01:07.700> probably<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> easiest<00:01:09.030> on

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
it's pretty easy probably the easiest on

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:21.550 
it's pretty easy probably the easiest on
our<00:01:09.360> game

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.080 

and<00:01:22.560> once<00:01:22.740> you've<00:01:22.920> dropped<00:01:23.100> off<00:01:23.370> misty<00:01:23.820> this

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
and once you've dropped off misty this

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.490 
and once you've dropped off misty this
is<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.300> first<00:01:24.510> time<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.110> actually<00:01:25.380> get

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
is the first time that you actually get

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.380 
is the first time that you actually get
to<00:01:25.590> roam<00:01:25.770> around<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.150> first

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
to roam around so this is your first

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.000 
to roam around so this is your first
opportunity<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:28.260> go<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.560> store<00:01:28.800> it<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:28.979> your

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
opportunity to go and store it in your

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.249 
opportunity to go and store it in your
garage<00:01:29.220> which<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:30.000> we're<00:01:30.119> going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.270> do

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.210 

so<00:01:34.259> your<00:01:34.410> carriage<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.979> around<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
so your carriage is just around the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:02:04.240 
so your carriage is just around the
corner<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:36.380> it's<00:01:37.380> only<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.619> short<00:01:37.890> trip

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.090 

and<00:02:04.550> there<00:02:04.970> you<00:02:05.030> have<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.300> a<00:02:05.560> first<00:02:06.560> secret<00:02:06.830> car

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
and there you have it a first secret car

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.570 
and there you have it a first secret car
in<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.400> game<00:02:07.630> there's<00:02:08.630> more<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.899> come<00:02:09.050> soon

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.640 

you
