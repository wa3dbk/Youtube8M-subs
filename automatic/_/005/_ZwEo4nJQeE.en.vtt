00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello everyone I'm inés I am me and today 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.109
 day let's talk about the movie book of 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.730
 where the rainbow ends and that many 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.230
 they were doing videos about where 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.330
 will end of ccoo iris I saw that they had 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.429
 reading clubs I saw that there were many 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.260
 videos and that was one of the things that I 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.960
 did delay in this because I feel that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.400
 it got saturated and I did not want to do something very 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.109
 same then I'm going to make a book 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.699
 movie so I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.160
 book after the movie and in the end 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.380
 to make a parallel between both you 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.029
 I deliver editions you see that very many 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.320
 Thank you 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.540
 the book tells us the story about 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.880
 álex and rose hayek and made them the best 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.870
 friends from his childhood all over the world 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.090
 they know that they love each other - they two to me 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.440
 the book more than having a similar plot 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.140
 tells us the life of these two 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.110
 characters as of eight or 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.059
 ten have literally had 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.649
 difficulties about your relationship that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.329
 could have been loving the relationship of 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.190
 friendship this book tells us about the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.960
 transition and how are we facing 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.270
 the problems tailored to our age 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.039
 for example we see very simple problems 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.840
 since you do not invite me to your party 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.640
 number 10 birthday here we are going to 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.830
 study later in college 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.360
 what are we going to do with our children 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.170
 because this book literally 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.810
 account from 10 years to 50 a 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.130
 giant period of time when 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.409
 you write a novel is very difficult 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.540
 manage time because you can write 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.130
 a book that happens in a day you can 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.780
 write a book that happens in an hour or 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.460
 You can write a book that happens almost 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.750
 in forty fifty years as it is but 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.640
 you always have to have different 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.159
 tools to be able to use in this 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.320
 case up to 40 years but it is achieved very 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.150
 well the common thread even though 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.560
 there are more guys we feel we lost 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.000
 but those who do not give of equal 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.350
 form another of the things that called me the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.200
 attention is that the structure of this 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.330
 book is dumping these chats messages 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.640
 of text and anything multimedia that 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.380
 appointment today these messages we 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.330
 allow to meet the voices of a 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.250
 much more own way because they are 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.050
 those who are delivering the message 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.610
 and the interaction what was really achieved 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.619
 well and applaud the author is that 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.720
 how are the messages written in 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.610
 letters if we could see a 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.100
 differentiation of voices when he spoke 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.050
 when the barby did not see the author or 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.179
 when he spoke rossi either but 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.100
 they were different characters they wrote from 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.940
 different form were transferred in a way 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.400
 different 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.470
 a lot because a problem that you 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.930
 you know I found legend and mary 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.750
 lou is that the voices were equal by 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.820
 both parties but in this I do not use the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.560
 another one that I found very interesting is 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.150
 that if it is not explained at the end of the book 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.370
 because it is written with messages and 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.530
 letters sometimes the authors write 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.140
 doing a 20 read or write a 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.850
 way or another but there is not a 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.170
 further explanation is written in 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.210
 letters and in all messages 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.530
 multimedia for a reason and you the 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.840
 explain and this is what I was 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.180
 wait but not everything that shines is 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.010
 gold and there are clearly things that I do not 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.260
 they liked this book like for example 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.150
 that the characters are too 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.190
 frustrating was at first 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.410
 you are 10 years old 15 18 and if you have fears 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.120
 you make mistakes does not mean is 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.800
 give your heart to anyone until no 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.840
 I have completely but you go 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.360
 evolving in your life you are acquiring 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.400
 strangers go more having different 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.200
 experiences that you are doing I do not know if 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.540
 better person than a person who was 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.640
 thinking a little better then let's 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.980
 find a configuration of people 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.000
 we are configuring as it goes 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.540
 Spending time because we're going 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.450
 learning 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.290
 of our seats ok but these 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.870
 characters were not frustrating they had 50 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.060
 years and they had the same fear as 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.370
 10 that at the feet of the 20 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.450
 we are having capabilities or 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.549
 we are acquiring waters 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.829
 some people acquire their experiences 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.750
 for some books for movies 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.489
 things in life but we are changing and 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.829
 we are learning from our mistakes 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.290
 but these characters were having 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.349
 talk about the same mistakes themselves 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.670
 Please be fears or 50 years old 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.389
 affront I ask you how not 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.930
 they learned nothing 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:57.150
 rossi like you did not learn anything then 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.280
 this frustrated me a lot and really 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.470
 more times he wants to throw away the book and 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.909
 I think I once threw it to the ground it was 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.669
 more of the same more of the same the same 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.430
 it's good at 10 to 20 to 30 to 40 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:10.109
 that was how please is now 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.239
 talking about the movie obviously a 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.010
 movie works different than a book a 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.569
 book we have much more time is taken 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.430
 more calmly but the movies we have 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.259
 that reach an audience that does not read the 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.359
 book merge a character is 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.340
 will specify some and I liked this 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.800
 a lot and really should have done it 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.300
 liked even that more some say 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.699
 that have nothing to do but I 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.470
 I found that he was very faithful in the sense 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.690
 of what you could if I had been not 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.280
 I know the director would have used what 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.750
 same because they are too many years to 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.280
 a movie even though I'm sad 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.500
 this resource if it did not seem like it was 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.660
 too fast compared to the book 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.370
 the book was much more years yes maybe 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.840
 but it did have a common thread that the 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.760
 movie was not achieved and sometimes I did not 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.699
 I let myself enjoy the moments and it was 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.050
 as ok 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.090
 and then it ends and it is always 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.100
 you are what happened I thought it was a good 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.870
 adaptation despite the changes I 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.880
 I want totally necessary and I think that 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.100
 some improved and another that I liked about 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.930
 the movie is that lily collins saw me 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.720
 lynn collins has a chemistry 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.040
 spectacular as I like it a lot 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.310
 each one played his character 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.860
 maybe I'm missing a bit of the charisma that 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.479
 I had or this one as frustrating but 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.760
 hate in a different sense that is 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.710
 how to make this equipment a little more 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.690
 funny and I like it very much and the 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.070
 chemistry of the two were very good 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.410
 saying that the movie had more 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.150
 chemistry of what they had abroad 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.380
 version to the book as I said the 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.300
 movie april 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.940
 some gaps that the book had 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.350
 charisma to some characters revived some 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.390
 that were completely dead in the 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.000
 novel the passive characters of the books 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.900
 they were very active and that I with everything 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.900
 my lord 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.730
 I give the book three out of five stars 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.010
 which is frustrating to the soul but if 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.650
 they should read about the movie of life 7 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.540
 of 10 stars I like a lot 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.130
 very good adaptation if you do not want to read 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.570
 the book can see the movies I do not know 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.640
 they are going to die , I recommend them if 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.500
 they are those people who love 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.390
 the love stories so if they want 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.640
 have fun and not find something so 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.430
 heavy where the rainbow ends or the 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.040
 rossi or the unforeseen love is the 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.020
 comedy or the book for you I hope 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.150
 that you have liked this new 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.190
 book the movie was thinking no 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.990
 does much more perhaps one with the theory 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.000
 Do not tell yourself the box 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.470
 of the comments of any book of 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.960
 any movie that they want me to 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.280
 I will be here completely happy of 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.170
 do it maybe from some movie 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.640
 old from an old book that has 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.400
 also an adaptation does not need that 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.650
 be new I do not need that either end 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.470
 completely popular and it can be something 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.060
 very hidden so I want to read everything 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.250
 so give me the comments because 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.050
 I like this and I really like to do 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.670
 these comparisons so I hope that 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.740
 they liked it, do not forget to share and 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.480
 comment do not forget to like it if it's 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.169
 who liked this video and even the 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.050
 seremi 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.759
 friends and all of you that I hope 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.569
 that you liked it and we see the 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.569
 next bye
