00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.730
 is 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.680
 the light radiating from the invisible portraits 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.400
 as maura 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.400
 I feel your presence 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.820
 I have always been a photographer for your life. 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.719
 dialoguing with the light dipping brush 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.719
 magical whole 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.990
 everything portrays a self portrait of this course 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.880
 special education 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.650
 I'm going to open my studio. I 'd like to 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.690
 take them with a trip through 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.580
 universe of portraits of my world 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.110
 through my lens in my 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.110
 references welcome 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.119
 in this trip we will be guided by the 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.000
 our hands 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.030
 the ten fingers in your hands for me are 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.920
 10 key points in the picture in 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.829
 right hand the visible one it sits on 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.700
 front of the brand is the face 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.950
 to pose the person's clothing to have the fame that 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.799
 will turn the background where it was 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.469
 and one touches an object that maybe you use 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.630
 to do portrait on the other side 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.640
 invisible is your visual signature your 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.079
 rhetoric was the language and the left hand 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.209
 which is invisible 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.119
 what no one can take the story 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.709
 will tell you how to focus a milk when 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.909
 with a face that will give 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.909
 the movie you choose 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.710
 welcome to the edge
