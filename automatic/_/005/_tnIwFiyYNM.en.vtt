00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
chances of that happening are very rare

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.740

once<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.250> successfully<00:01:47.490> got<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> clerk

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
once you have successfully got the clerk

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.590 
once you have successfully got the clerk
to<00:01:49.079> fill<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.679> a<00:01:49.829> grocery<00:01:50.340> bag<00:01:50.369> full<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.820> cash<00:01:51.149> he

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
to fill up a grocery bag full of cash he

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.630 
to fill up a grocery bag full of cash he
will<00:01:51.719> drop<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.960> money<00:01:52.229> bag<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.770> ground<00:01:52.890> now

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
will drop a money bag on the ground now

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.910 
will drop a money bag on the ground now
there<00:01:54.179> is<00:01:54.390> some<00:01:54.630> time<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.259> he<00:01:55.409> takes<00:01:55.710> you

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
there is some time that he takes you

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.099 
there is some time that he takes you
know<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.369> fill<00:01:56.640> up<00:01:56.789> the<00:01:56.939> bag<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.509> it's

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
know to fill up the bag so it's

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:59.810 
know to fill up the bag so it's
important<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.799> look<00:01:59.039> around<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.549> store<00:01:59.759> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
important to look around the store and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.149 
important to look around the store and
maybe<00:02:00.390> find<00:02:00.749> a<00:02:00.929> second<00:02:01.350> register<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.009> there

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
maybe find a second register and there

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.099 
maybe find a second register and there
are<00:02:02.369> stores<00:02:02.880> with<00:02:03.149> second<00:02:03.450> registers<00:02:03.810> just

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
are stores with second registers just

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.050 
are stores with second registers just
like<00:02:04.229> I'm<00:02:04.350> showing<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.679> here<00:02:05.039> now<00:02:05.520> normally

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
you would be able to just open them up

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.949 
you would be able to just open them up
by<00:02:08.190> clicking<00:02:08.610> right<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.090> d-pad<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.720> didn't

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
by clicking right on the d-pad I didn't

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.320 
by clicking right on the d-pad I didn't
try<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.670> definitely<00:02:12.030> worth<00:02:12.150> a

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
try that out so it's definitely worth a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.400 
try that out so it's definitely worth a
try<00:02:12.569> but<00:02:12.810> if<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.989> can't<00:02:13.230> get

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
try but if you can't get

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.320 
try but if you can't get
it<00:02:13.500> open<00:02:13.770> just<00:02:14.340> shoot<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.670> thing<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:15.150> shoot

the front of it and a money bag will pop

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.220 
the front of it and a money bag will pop
out<00:02:17.310> you'll<00:02:17.820> be<00:02:17.910> able<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.120> cash<00:02:18.300> in<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.690> see<00:02:19.200> I

got an extra one hundred and thirty

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.310 
got an extra one hundred and thirty
dollars<00:02:20.820> out<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.210> that<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.840> always<00:02:21.990> keep<00:02:22.260> your

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
dollars out of that so always keep your

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.130 
dollars out of that so always keep your
eyes<00:02:22.620> peeled<00:02:23.130> for<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.520> second<00:02:24.090> register<00:02:24.390> now

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
eyes peeled for a second register now

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.580 
eyes peeled for a second register now
step<00:02:25.590> four<00:02:25.920> escaping<00:02:26.820> so<00:02:27.150> most<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.320> time

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
step four escaping so most of the time

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.190 
step four escaping so most of the time
it's<00:02:28.980> probably<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.790> good<00:02:30.060> idea<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.570> just<00:02:30.600> hop<00:02:31.020> in

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
it's probably a good idea to just hop in

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.660 
it's probably a good idea to just hop in
your<00:02:31.320> car<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.890> try<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.130> get<00:02:32.280> away<00:02:32.370> from<00:02:32.490> the

cops and hide in an alley because we

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.720 
cops and hide in an alley because we
know<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.490> cops<00:02:35.700> are<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:35.970> little<00:02:36.270> bit<00:02:36.540> more

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
know that the cops are a little bit more

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.850 
know that the cops are a little bit more
cognizant<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.940> aware<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:40.470> grand<00:02:40.740> theft

cognizant and aware in this grand theft
auto<00:02:41.010> they<00:02:41.340> look<00:02:41.640> more<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.150> they<00:02:42.450> have<00:02:42.600> lines

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
auto they look more and they have lines

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.440 
auto they look more and they have lines
of<00:02:43.050> sight<00:02:43.350> now<00:02:43.920> it's<00:02:44.460> also<00:02:44.670> smart<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.180> just

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
of sight now it's also smart to just

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.450 
of sight now it's also smart to just
look<00:02:45.600> for<00:02:45.870> really<00:02:46.080> close<00:02:46.410> spots<00:02:46.740> like<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.250> did

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
look for really close spots like I did

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.640 
look for really close spots like I did
right<00:02:47.700> here<00:02:48.000> all<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.180> did<00:02:48.450> was<00:02:48.690> run<00:02:49.380> out<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
right here all I did was run out of the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.160 
right here all I did was run out of the
store<00:02:49.920> hop<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.520> fence<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:50.940> left<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.450> laid

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
store hop the fence to the left and laid

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.590 
store hop the fence to the left and laid
low<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:53.100> cops<00:02:53.340> did<00:02:53.580> not<00:02:53.790> find<00:02:54.180> me<00:02:54.390> and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
low and the cops did not find me and

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.410 
low and the cops did not find me and
eventually<00:02:55.260> my<00:02:55.500> wanted<00:02:55.890> level<00:02:55.920> went<00:02:56.370> away<00:02:56.460> so

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
eventually my wanted level went away so

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.940 
eventually my wanted level went away so
honestly<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.990> might<00:02:58.260> want<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.530> scope<00:02:58.800> out

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
honestly you might want to scope out

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.790 
honestly you might want to scope out
some<00:02:59.250> spots<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.880> hide<00:03:00.240> before<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:01.260> rob<00:03:01.560> a

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
some spots to hide before you rob a

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.890 
some spots to hide before you rob a
convenience<00:03:02.040> store<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:03.180> you're<00:03:03.330> able<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.690> lose

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
convenience store so you're able to lose

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.690 
convenience store so you're able to lose
that<00:03:04.080> heat<00:03:04.350> very<00:03:04.560> quickly<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.190> not<00:03:05.340> have<00:03:05.550> to
