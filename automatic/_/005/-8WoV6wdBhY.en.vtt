I<00:02:55.739> could<00:02:55.800> think<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:57.030> stop<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.510> from

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
I could think of to to stop it from

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.850 
I could think of to to stop it from
happening<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.080> really<00:02:58.320> wish<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.560> could<00:02:58.709> give<00:02:58.830> you
