Grainne standing there so patiently
sitting<00:04:55.479> there<00:04:55.599> rather<00:04:55.979> absolutely<00:04:56.979> full<00:04:57.550> of

00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:57.629 
sitting there rather absolutely full of

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:59.700 
sitting there rather absolutely full of
challenging<00:04:58.629> rhythms<00:04:59.139> and<00:04:59.319> I<00:04:59.379> thought<00:04:59.530> you'd

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
challenging rhythms and I thought you'd

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.200 
challenging rhythms and I thought you'd
coach<00:04:59.919> but<00:05:00.129> all<00:05:00.340> of<00:05:00.550> those<00:05:00.669> brilliantly

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
coach but all of those brilliantly

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.790 
coach but all of those brilliantly
because<00:05:01.330> that's<00:05:01.629> what's<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.139> difficult<00:05:02.469> about

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
because that's what's so difficult about

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.679 
because that's what's so difficult about
this<00:05:03.159> because<00:05:03.279> it<00:05:03.490> does<00:05:03.639> cross<00:05:03.939> the<00:05:04.120> music<00:05:04.479> and

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:04.689 
this because it does cross the music and

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.059 
this because it does cross the music and
you<00:05:04.779> did<00:05:04.960> that<00:05:05.080> great<00:05:05.139> fantastic

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 
you did that great fantastic

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.070 
you did that great fantastic

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
cross-section of steps I thought as well
