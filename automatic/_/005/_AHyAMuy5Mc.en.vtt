00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.119 
when Toronto FC came into the picture I
think<00:02:20.299> was<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.450> great<00:02:20.720> thing<00:02:20.989> for<00:02:21.019> for<00:02:21.769> Canon

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
think was a great thing for for Canon

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.699 
think was a great thing for for Canon
for<00:02:22.370> Ontario<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.540> know<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.720> have<00:02:23.930> an<00:02:24.349> MLS

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
for Ontario you know to have an MLS

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.420 
for Ontario you know to have an MLS
franchise<00:02:25.040> right<00:02:25.700> here<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.030> our<00:02:26.120> province<00:02:26.420> and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
franchise right here in our province and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.130 
franchise right here in our province and
it's<00:02:28.430> only<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.700> natural<00:02:28.940> fit<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.660> we<00:02:29.810> should

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
it's only a natural fit that we should

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.970 
it's only a natural fit that we should
be<00:02:31.660> looking<00:02:32.660> at<00:02:32.959> toronto<00:02:33.319> FC<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.799> maybe

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
be looking at toronto FC and maybe

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.789 
be looking at toronto FC and maybe
someday<00:02:34.370> being<00:02:35.360> able<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.750> provide<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:36.470> player

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
someday being able to provide a player

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.979 
someday being able to provide a player
for<00:02:37.130> their<00:02:37.250> first<00:02:37.489> team<00:02:37.790> but<00:02:38.090> i<00:02:38.299> think<00:02:38.900> the

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
for their first team but i think the

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.100 
for their first team but i think the
relationship<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:40.209> any<00:02:41.209> time<00:02:41.510> we<00:02:41.540> can<00:02:41.720> get<00:02:41.959> any

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
relationship and any time we can get any

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.979 
relationship and any time we can get any
of<00:02:42.260> their<00:02:42.379> coaching<00:02:42.799> staff<00:02:43.069> into<00:02:43.430> Thunder<00:02:43.790> Bay

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
of their coaching staff into Thunder Bay

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.259 
of their coaching staff into Thunder Bay
to<00:02:44.989> work<00:02:45.140> with<00:02:45.319> our<00:02:45.410> players<00:02:46.180> for<00:02:47.180> the

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
to work with our players for the

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.539 
to work with our players for the
exposure<00:02:47.629> and<00:02:48.079> for<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.590> development<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.430> our
