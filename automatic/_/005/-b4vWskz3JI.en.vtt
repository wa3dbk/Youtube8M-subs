00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.510
 Now, even if you sprout 5 times 2 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.050
 5 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.590
 Oh minutes this time once again appeared to Finance shoots hear very good 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.009
 I have. 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.279
 Shoot the road in two minutes. 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:30.539
 It's a pardon. It's a pardon. 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.010
 So now you have to practice a little bit about the slope and practice it. 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.850
 It will be more helpful. 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.850
 Anything. 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.940
 It sounds like this. 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:58.360
 Let's just say that nobody really spoken, and our hankyore is so great 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:03.280
 I felt it was real again . 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:06.490
 Now , as I mentioned before, I have studied a little bit of pardon 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:12.310
 I think it will be more helpful if you practice . 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:16.080
 Now, this is my grandfather, who had a great drum legend's very revealing that Steve 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.080
 The pd that you used a lot. 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.869
 In this way Steve Gett 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:32.880
 If you look at a lot of grandfather's videos, you can do a lot of writing. 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:36.130
 Oh, and now I've written some good music to listen to. 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.180
 There is a song called Lee Seung Hwan's little love 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.180
 Now this is just iz 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:48.219
 Listen to the second group before the last refrain. 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.420
 I have this blood and applied the ballad and it is very cool 4 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.740
 It was delicious. 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.969
 So now that I know who drummers have recorded, 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.189
 Our country 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:05.530
 Now you know more than your brother Lee Seung-band drummer air activities 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:07.180
 Very very cool place deoraguyo laid Chunhwa destination destination using it hath 1005 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.959
 uh 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:15.800
 You played. Yes. Air is editable. 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:18.790
 Yes. You have a very nice playing style . So yes. 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:23.800
 Yes, it is. 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.210
 So, no matter how I make copies, I feel the same, 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.870
 I think it's coming out . 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:33.670
 Also, you should try it once and use it nicely. 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.140
 I do not know how to write once, but I 'll show you that. 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.140
 It's a little love song. 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.250
 Ah bird 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.270
 a 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.270
 U 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.270
 U 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.520
 U 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.360
 U 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.360
 U 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.500
 U 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.500
 As a 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:19.480
 U 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.480
 U 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.390
 U 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.590
 In a space where there was nothing like this 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.690
 I have a plan with a very unexpected technique . 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.750
 How to make the first 30 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.220
 It would be great if you could find it and listen to it. 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:54.270
 And besides this slow song , 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.190
 It is very fun to use it at medium tempo and fast tempo. 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:01.130
 I think it could be a job. 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.130
 I'll show you how to use it at medium tempo once 5 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:46.860
 I like it. 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:05:05.749
 Example : endo In this way , depending on which beat is appropriate, 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:08.659
 I saw a lot of different Sore once practiced as a music rest is also another night ttaenggyeoseo 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:13.429
 I think it would be good to practice this kind of voice in the japanese. 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:22.309
 And then it looks like it's alike. I painted two pieces of music. 

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:29.199
 If you look at it well, the first thing that was drawn yesterday is how it feels 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:29.199
 The second is Hunter 3 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.480
 Uh-huh. It's more of an ABBA. 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.780
 No-pitcher 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.100
 Which do you think I am doing well in explanation 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.520
 I understand. 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:49.770
 So it looks the same . 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:54.020
 I feel a lot different when I write 1 burn 1 or this time. 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.020
 I'll show you at the same center. 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.250
 m 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:46.090
 Letting you use to put both exercises 1 and 2 in this way is a great addition 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:52.740
 I think I can apply it with fun. 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:52.740
 45 times to shoot people hear narrow here and now move on to the street
