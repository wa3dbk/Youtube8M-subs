00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
stuff that's closer to you but it's

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.850 
stuff that's closer to you but it's
pretty<00:02:20.480> decent<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.410> just<00:02:21.709> recently

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
pretty decent and I just recently

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.580 
pretty decent and I just recently
uploaded<00:02:22.250> something<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:23.420> YouTube<00:02:23.870> which<00:02:24.410> I

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
uploaded something to YouTube which I

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.970 
uploaded something to YouTube which I
upscaled<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.160> be<00:02:26.290> 1280<00:02:27.290> by<00:02:27.500> 720<00:02:28.420> which<00:02:29.420> is

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
upscaled to be 1280 by 720 which is

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.570 
upscaled to be 1280 by 720 which is
their<00:02:30.980> high<00:02:31.489> def<00:02:31.730> standard<00:02:32.320> 720p<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:33.739> it

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
their high def standard 720p and it

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.380 
their high def standard 720p and it
looked<00:02:34.730> okay<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:36.610> because<00:02:37.610> they<00:02:37.760> downscale<00:02:38.239> it

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
looked okay so because they downscale it

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.470 
looked okay so because they downscale it
again<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:38.750> fit<00:02:39.790> 640<00:02:40.790> by<00:02:40.970> 360<00:02:41.780> display<00:02:43.299> so<00:02:44.299> even

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
again to fit 640 by 360 display so even

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.789 
again to fit 640 by 360 display so even
though<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:44.570> up<00:02:44.810> scaled<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.470> made<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.680> look

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
though I up scaled it and made it look

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.530 
though I up scaled it and made it look
crappy<00:02:46.040> er<00:02:46.280> when<00:02:46.670> they<00:02:46.760> downscale<00:02:47.239> it<00:02:47.360> again

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
crappy er when they downscale it again

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.060 
crappy er when they downscale it again
it<00:02:47.690> looks<00:02:47.989> ok

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.900

sits on top of your helmet not in your
helmet<00:04:45.650> so<00:04:46.010> it's<00:04:46.220> not<00:04:46.400> pushing<00:04:46.820> up<00:04:47.030> against

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
helmet so it's not pushing up against

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.330 
helmet so it's not pushing up against
your<00:04:47.480> nose<00:04:47.980> now<00:04:48.980> a<00:04:49.010> couple<00:04:49.370> of<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.580> cons<00:04:50.419> are

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
your nose now a couple of the cons are

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.360 
your nose now a couple of the cons are
one<00:04:52.340> is<00:04:52.460> it's<00:04:52.940> pretty<00:04:53.180> expensive<00:04:53.419> but<00:04:54.410> if<00:04:55.250> you

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
one is it's pretty expensive but if you

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.030 
one is it's pretty expensive but if you
get<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:55.580> separate<00:04:56.030> DVR<00:04:56.480> and<00:04:56.870> a<00:04:57.050> separate<00:04:57.440> bullet

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
get a separate DVR and a separate bullet

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.950 
get a separate DVR and a separate bullet
camera<00:04:58.250> you're

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
camera you're

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.120 
camera you're
you're<00:04:59.139> gonna<00:04:59.259> be<00:04:59.410> looking<00:04:59.530> at<00:04:59.740> about<00:04:59.919> the

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
you're gonna be looking at about the

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.350 
you're gonna be looking at about the
same<00:05:00.310> price<00:05:00.520> anyway<00:05:02.130> second<00:05:03.130> it<00:05:03.370> encodes

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
same price anyway second it encodes

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.310 
same price anyway second it encodes
directly<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:05.110> X<00:05:05.380> bit<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:05.889> pick<00:05:06.160> for<00:05:06.840> its<00:05:07.840> lossy

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
directly to X bit and pick for its lossy

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.499 
directly to X bit and pick for its lossy
formats<00:05:08.800> so<00:05:09.039> the<00:05:09.130> quality<00:05:09.580> isn't<00:05:09.850> quite<00:05:10.330> as

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
formats so the quality isn't quite as

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.900 
formats so the quality isn't quite as
good<00:05:10.660> as<00:05:10.840> it<00:05:10.870> could<00:05:11.289> be

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
good as it could be

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.909 
good as it could be
they<00:05:13.180> I<00:05:13.509> would<00:05:13.810> like<00:05:13.930> if<00:05:14.080> they<00:05:14.229> had<00:05:14.380> an<00:05:14.500> option

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
they I would like if they had an option

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.560 
they I would like if they had an option
to<00:05:15.039> turn<00:05:15.220> off<00:05:16.229> turn<00:05:17.229> off<00:05:17.289> lossy<00:05:18.449> encoding<00:05:19.449> and

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
to turn off turn off lossy encoding and

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.719 
to turn off turn off lossy encoding and
just<00:05:19.780> go<00:05:19.930> with<00:05:20.199> raw<00:05:21.100> encoding<00:05:23.430> another<00:05:24.430> thing

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
just go with raw encoding another thing

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.270 
just go with raw encoding another thing
another<00:05:25.210> con<00:05:25.419> is<00:05:25.660> that<00:05:25.690> the<00:05:25.990> SD<00:05:26.320> cover<00:05:26.560> will

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
another con is that the SD cover will

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.310 
another con is that the SD cover will
break<00:05:27.729> unless<00:05:28.270> you<00:05:28.449> remove<00:05:28.810> it<00:05:28.840> properly

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
break unless you remove it properly

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.310 
break unless you remove it properly
every<00:05:29.620> time<00:05:30.720> you're<00:05:31.720> gonna<00:05:31.930> be<00:05:32.139> really

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
every time you're gonna be really

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.589 
every time you're gonna be really
tempted<00:05:32.860> to<00:05:33.039> just<00:05:33.340> pull<00:05:33.610> on<00:05:33.639> the<00:05:33.910> screw<00:05:34.240> to

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
tempted to just pull on the screw to

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.740 
tempted to just pull on the screw to
open<00:05:34.900> the<00:05:35.050> port<00:05:35.979> but<00:05:36.910> if<00:05:37.210> you<00:05:37.360> pull<00:05:37.570> on<00:05:37.630> the

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
open the port but if you pull on the

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.450 
open the port but if you pull on the
screw<00:05:38.020> it<00:05:38.229> will<00:05:38.380> eventually<00:05:38.620> weaken<00:05:39.370> the

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
screw it will eventually weaken the

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.279 
screw it will eventually weaken the
plastic<00:05:39.910> and<00:05:40.180> break<00:05:40.599> and<00:05:40.840> then<00:05:40.960> it's<00:05:41.139> no

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
plastic and break and then it's no

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:46.800 
plastic and break and then it's no
longer<00:05:41.550> water-resistant<00:05:45.330> another<00:05:46.330> thing<00:05:46.570> is

longer water-resistant another thing is

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.800 
longer water-resistant another thing is

YouTube and high quality with a couple
of<00:06:45.220> you<00:06:45.520> know<00:06:45.639> by<00:06:46.000> upscaling<00:06:46.449> the<00:06:46.659> video<00:06:46.900> and

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
of you know by upscaling the video and

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.189 
of you know by upscaling the video and
it<00:06:47.139> looks<00:06:47.199> pretty<00:06:47.740> decent<00:06:48.220> so<00:06:48.840> that's<00:06:49.840> it<00:06:49.990> it's

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199
