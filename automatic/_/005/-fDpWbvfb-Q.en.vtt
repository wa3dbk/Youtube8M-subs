I'm<00:00:13.500> challenging<00:00:14.130> myself<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.910> use<00:00:15.570> three

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
I'm challenging myself to use three

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.560 
I'm challenging myself to use three
colors<00:00:16.130> sort<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.340> three-color<00:00:17.910> layout<00:00:18.330> and

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
colors sort of a three-color layout and

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.510 
colors sort of a three-color layout and
I'm<00:00:19.260> going<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.439> go<00:00:19.590> through<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.100> photos<00:00:20.310> that

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
I'm going to go through the photos that

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.820 
I'm going to go through the photos that
I<00:00:20.730> had<00:00:20.939> picked<00:00:21.180> out<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.630> use<00:00:21.840> they<00:00:22.470> are<00:00:22.590> from

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
I had picked out to use they are from

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.769 
I had picked out to use they are from
whale<00:00:23.010> watching<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.699> there's<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.060> lot<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.420> blues

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
whale watching so there's a lot of blues

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.439 
whale watching so there's a lot of blues
whites<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.039> blacks<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.880> I'm<00:00:26.939> going<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> throw

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
whites and blacks and I'm going to throw

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.900 
whites and blacks and I'm going to throw
some<00:00:27.720> yellow<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.080> there<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.070> neutrals<00:00:29.580> I

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
some yellow in there so the neutrals I

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.459 
some yellow in there so the neutrals I
don't<00:00:30.179> necessarily<00:00:30.449> count<00:00:31.170> as<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> color<00:00:32.040> but

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
don't necessarily count as a color but

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.229 
don't necessarily count as a color but
so<00:00:34.469> we're<00:00:34.710> gonna<00:00:34.800> kind<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.520> concentrate<00:00:35.880> on

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
so we're gonna kind of concentrate on

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.840 
so we're gonna kind of concentrate on
black<00:00:36.930> white<00:00:37.200> blue<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:37.950> yellow<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.670> guess

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
black white blue and yellow so I guess

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.940 
black white blue and yellow so I guess
that's<00:00:39.030> four<00:00:39.510> colors<00:00:39.930> but<00:00:40.110> who's<00:00:40.469> counting

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
that's four colors but who's counting

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.000 
that's four colors but who's counting
and<00:00:41.210> whenever<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.420> start<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> project

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and whenever I start with the project

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.340 
and whenever I start with the project

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
helps the process go faster i always

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.420 
helps the process go faster i always
start<00:01:00.449> by<00:01:00.570> laying<00:01:00.870> out<00:01:01.079> my<00:01:01.109> photos<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.039> then

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
start by laying out my photos and then

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.090 
start by laying out my photos and then
kind<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.030> put<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> cards<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.799> empty

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
kind of put the cards in the empty

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.700 
kind of put the cards in the empty
spaces<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.600> photos<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.170> me<00:01:07.320> are<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> most

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
spaces and the photos to me are the most

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.080 
spaces and the photos to me are the most
important<00:01:08.280> they<00:01:08.400> help<00:01:08.640> tell<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.939> story

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
important they help tell the story

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.560 
important they help tell the story
especially<00:01:09.780> because<00:01:10.380> i<00:01:10.409> don't<00:01:10.680> journal<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.250> lot

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
especially because i don't journal a lot

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.960 
especially because i don't journal a lot
so<00:01:12.570> once<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.470> those<00:01:13.680> down<00:01:13.979> I'll<00:01:14.310> start<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
so once I have those down I'll start to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.390 
so once I have those down I'll start to
add<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.390> embellishments<00:01:16.229> I'm<00:01:17.009> already
