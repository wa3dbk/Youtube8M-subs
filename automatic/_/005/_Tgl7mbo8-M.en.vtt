pause there you need to make sure that

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.410 
pause there you need to make sure that
that's<00:00:28.470> checked<00:00:28.890> my<00:00:29.609> owner<00:00:29.820> works<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
that's checked my owner works with the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.139 
that's checked my owner works with the
standard<00:00:30.810> player<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.859> can't<00:00:32.610> use<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.790> with

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
standard player so you can't use it with

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.889 
standard player so you can't use it with
MX<00:00:33.660> player<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.140> example<00:00:35.329> and<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:36.570> happens

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
MX player for example and what happens

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.069 
MX player for example and what happens
is<00:00:37.170> for<00:00:37.440> example<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.370> trailer<00:00:38.640> of

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
is for example this is just a trailer of

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.760 
is for example this is just a trailer of
a<00:00:40.129> film<00:00:41.129> called<00:00:41.340> Noah<00:00:41.719> which<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> recently

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
a film called Noah which is a recently

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.360 
a film called Noah which is a recently
been<00:00:43.980> really<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:44.969> released<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
been really going to be released and

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.740 
been really going to be released and
we're<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> try<00:00:47.850> out<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.180> this

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
we're just going to try out with this

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.139 
we're just going to try out with this
now<00:00:49.230> obviously<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.739> lighting<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.550> is

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
now obviously the lighting is is

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.700 
now obviously the lighting is is
something<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.870> need<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.020> consider<00:00:52.500> as

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
something that you need to consider as

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.639 
something that you need to consider as
well<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.489> way<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> works<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.239> by<00:00:55.079> tracking

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
well and the way it works is by tracking

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.069 
well and the way it works is by tracking
the<00:00:55.860> movement<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.399> your<00:00:56.610> eyes<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.420> that's<00:00:57.960> not

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the movement of your eyes and that's not

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.630 
the movement of your eyes and that's not
to<00:00:58.260> say<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:59.010> keep<00:00:59.219> your<00:00:59.399> head

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
to say that you can keep your head

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.240 
to say that you can keep your head
pointed<00:01:00.059> towards<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.449> screen<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.250> change

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
pointed towards the screen and change

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.740 
pointed towards the screen and change
obviously<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.120> where<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:03.570> eyes<00:01:03.719> are

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
obviously the where your eyes are

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.200 
obviously the where your eyes are
looking<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.589> will<00:01:04.710> stop<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.549> most<00:01:05.880> likely

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
looking and it will stop it most likely

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.149 
looking and it will stop it most likely
won't<00:01:06.420> stop<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.140> depending<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:07.950> obviously

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
won't stop and depending on obviously

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.190 
won't stop and depending on obviously
the<00:01:08.400> lighting<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.930> would<00:01:10.049> actually

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the lighting you that you would actually

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.980 
the lighting you that you would actually
have<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> physically<00:01:11.159> move<00:01:11.549> your<00:01:11.850> head<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
have to physically move your head to the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
right the left up or down and then

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.450 
right the left up or down and then
that's<00:01:15.330> when<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.780> will<00:01:15.930> actually<00:01:16.290> stop<00:01:16.590> it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
that's when it will actually stop it

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.160 
that's when it will actually stop it
just<00:01:17.640> uses<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> eyes<00:01:18.240> as<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> reference
