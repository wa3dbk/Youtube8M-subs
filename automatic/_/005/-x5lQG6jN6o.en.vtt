00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
built-in lightning character which is

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.779 
built-in lightning character which is
good<00:00:49.320> obviously<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.129> would<00:00:50.280> hope<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.460> it

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789

good obviously we would hope that it
would<00:00:50.820> now<00:00:51.420> belkin<00:00:51.809> did<00:00:51.989> come<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:52.559> one

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
would now belkin did come out with one

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.279 
would now belkin did come out with one
of<00:00:52.890> these<00:00:53.010> before<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.940> was<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> be<00:00:54.719> y<00:00:54.989> ou

C<00:00:55.920> solution<00:00:56.760> i<00:00:56.850> guess<00:00:57.030> bring<00:00:57.270> your<00:00:57.390> own<00:00:57.480> cable

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
C solution i guess bring your own cable

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.420 
C solution i guess bring your own cable
the<00:00:58.230> only<00:00:58.410> difference<00:00:58.590> between<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.190> one<00:00:59.370> and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the only difference between this one and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.459 
the only difference between this one and
that<00:00:59.699> one<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.510> kind<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.020> down<00:01:01.199> side

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that one and it's kind of a down side

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.869 
that one and it's kind of a down side
depending<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.070> look<00:01:02.280> at<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
depending on how you look at it is the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.310 
depending on how you look at it is the
one<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.840> provide<00:01:03.989> your<00:01:04.290> own

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
one that you have to provide your own

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
but Apple does not have a solution and I

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.830 
but Apple does not have a solution and I
don't<00:03:44.640> believe<00:03:44.910> they<00:03:45.150> are<00:03:45.180> going<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.690> have<00:03:45.810> a

don't believe they are going to have a

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.720 
don't believe they are going to have a
solution<00:03:46.140> so<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.950> next<00:03:47.100> best<00:03:47.280> thing

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
solution so this is the next best thing

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.670 
solution so this is the next best thing
so<00:03:48.150> let's<00:03:48.390> go<00:03:48.570> ahead<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:48.870> put<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.440> guy<00:03:49.650> on

here this is the ipod nano now that

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.410 
here this is the ipod nano now that
honestly<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.860> looks<00:03:53.040> kind<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.489> weird<00:03:53.549> being

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
honestly that looks kind of weird being

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.539 
honestly that looks kind of weird being
off<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.290> side<00:03:55.470> like<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.130> kind<00:03:56.190> of

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
off to the side like that it kind of

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.920 
off to the side like that it kind of
bothers<00:03:56.940> me<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.480> Lightning<00:03:57.840> connector

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
bothers me that the Lightning connector

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.229 
bothers me that the Lightning connector
is<00:03:58.290> off<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.709> side<00:03:58.920> but<00:03:59.220> that's<00:03:59.519> how<00:03:59.880> Apple

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
is off to the side but that's how Apple

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.050 
is off to the side but that's how Apple
made<00:04:00.390> it<00:04:00.570> so<00:04:00.840> forever<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.769> little<00:04:02.160> iPod<00:04:02.850> Nano

overall the build quality of this thing

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.940 
overall the build quality of this thing
is<00:04:14.489> is<00:04:15.030> pretty<00:04:15.360> comparable<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:16.229> any<00:04:16.500> other

plastic it's not metal or aluminum as it
may<00:04:22.800> look<00:04:23.130> but<00:04:23.520> it<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:23.970> made<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:24.300> hard<00:04:24.479> plastic

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539
