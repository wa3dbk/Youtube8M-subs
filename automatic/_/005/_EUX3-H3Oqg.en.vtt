00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.500
 during our stay from la gomera 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.870
 Let's take a boat trip 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.300
 the north coast of the rugged island 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.580
 there is the famous what 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.770
 just roll the organ out of their 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.970
 gigantic rock wall only from the sea 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.970
 can be admired 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.220
 9 o'clock in the morning we go to santiago 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.020
 board liche know and hope one 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.020
 interesting day to experience 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.480
 the ride along the rugged coast 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.960
 is very varied and offers 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.640
 imposing views in the hope of the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.370
 pass a tasty 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.680
 to serve lunch throw men 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.680
 the crew of the fishing 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.820
 the most attractive thing about this boat trip 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.880
 are the views of the steep coast 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.220
 with lonely bays and gorges 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.580
 Rocky slopes extend from the center of the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.250
 island to the coast and therefore there 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.810
 There are only a few beaches in particular 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.810
 consist of black sand 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.280
 Feel like being on a box seat 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.560
 theaters make the scenery wild 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.830
 jagged inzlingen us past 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.830
 pull 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.460
 The Canary Islands are volcanic 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.600
 origin so also la gomera of board 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.880
 Business is the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.280
 Volcanic landscape with the bizarre out 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.210
 The rock that protrudes from the water is especially good 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.210
 observe 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.630
 we reached the north coast like so 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.440
 You often experience a rough sea here 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.420
 with a wave and toast the coast 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.820
 now extreme caution is required 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.650
 a collision with the rock walls would have 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.920
 serious consequences for ship and 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.920
 crew 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.390
 Captain loud young is an experienced 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.010
 sailor and knows the 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.280
 flow conditions to the 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.800
 basalt rocks of los organs he controls 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.800
 The ship approaches close to the steep bank 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.940
 the organ it is called the innumerable 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.630
 densely packed basalt columns 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.510
 the straight line like the rolls 85 meters 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.670
 up from the sea guess from the country 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.610
 One has because of the inaccessible cliffs 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.060
 coast no chance of this natural wonder 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.060
 see 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.930
 typical of the frozen so why lamas 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.660
 are lined up close together 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.910
 six-sided columns as you can see here 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.910
 the north coast of la gomera can see 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.650
 These structures are tremendous 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.200
 Options in the depths of the ocean and 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.570
 high pressure conditions 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.940
 the huge lava masses in the process 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.100
 were reached 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.930
 finally the sea surface and 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.930
 Form are the islands la gomera 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:47.750
 We were back in calm waters and 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:50.659
 Captain Claudio is looking for a anchorage 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.030
 the lunch break will be on board for all guests 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:55.129
 look forward to it and hope 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.699
 tasty food on board too 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.699
 receive 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.330
 and 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
 cheerfully 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.610
 Euro 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.780
 July 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.220
 lugano 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.990
 Yes 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.580
 the world 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.889
 we ask 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.420
 dolphins are in the coastal waters of the 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.640
 canarian islands 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:07.360
 Your bread is between tenerife 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:09.760
 and rennet captain Claudio investigated 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.070
 trained look in the sea surface 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.850
 and hopes the nimble striker 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.640
 discover 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:20.280
 near the coast, this heat exists 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.280
 usually from 20 to 50 dolphins 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.850
 suddenly they dive on the gregarious 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.520
 to make dolphins fun 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.940
 in the book with the ship and the bet too 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.940
 swim 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.510
 these free-living marine mammals in 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:09.030
 to observe their natural environment 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:11.940
 remains an unforgettable experience and 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:15.920
 forms the conclusion of a beautiful 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.920
 boat trip more
