00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.829
 For my part, it's more or less like that 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:12.429
 yes in the first part 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.879
 Lula traveled to Malaga 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.509
 on our part 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.089
 if a good second part 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.579
 we had talked during 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.649
 two days that we could prepare really match 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.289
 to play as we did the second part 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.640
 play a touch to two touches that also 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.050
 the ideas 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.440
 the ball circulation was correct and that the move 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.970
 ahead of the ball 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.970
 the correct one is not that that has been the case 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.890
 we have played without rhythm as a player 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.950
 by ap londres 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.940
 in the second we talked in the dressing room we have recovered little ideas 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.850
 that we had 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 but the team has touched 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.780
 I only think that among us we have had a great team 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.940
 very well planted in the field very well placed and others 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.940
 you have to know very well 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.100
 the tie I see as at the beginning to 50 ' 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.870
 he has won from china he has danger 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.230
 it is a result we have also kept the door to zero 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.670
 it would be better to win by three or four goals but it is a 0 0 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.020
 and we're going to win them ritchie carry them the tie 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.020
 forward aires 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.490
 because before affirming and reaffirms me that it does not do badly 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.490
 Particularly he tells me that others of honor I do not know if it makes a bad smell 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.930
 he swears to me and perjures that it's not bad that 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.580
 and indisputably meet six players to 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.760
 during this so what can not fail a team that in the playoffs of 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.760
 this caliber are five penalties 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.310
 sources I do not ask publicly because I know they are going to return 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.969
 but I say to leave 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.389
 and that's missing 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.389
 from behind because that way 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.379
 five penalties failed in two games we are not doing well 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.949
 fiat one red bosco a little we are going to fight here and work to get the 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.949
 elimination forward we have nothing lost 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.979
 at night for his part bÃ¡rez 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:36.549
 now soccer 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.549
 the previous thing before the Barcelona forward 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.239
 try it later 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.779
 The Argentinian angel gutierrez points out bulas simply because the player 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:56.149
 the tyrant will take possession 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:59.769
 I am neither a witch nor a fortune teller to know if one is going to fail obama 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.509
 what happens is that I think the penalty is good 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.509
 welbeck stressed 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.489
 vie yes 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.839
 if you do and that annuls a legal goal 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.839
 he has no choice but to accept reality 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:27.809
 it's mistakes that ended in goal 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.649
 I decided that I should make these decisions 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:33.649
 that's why it's an honor for me 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.949
 the team has changed 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.869
 I told them that control 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.269
 the fact has happened time certain moments of the game has known to play with 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.609
 time 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.769
 the first time that the legal value to me that we created danger 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:04.939
 automatically 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.769
 that notice said initiative caused that up 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.619
 two three or four million huelva and then 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:13.619
 the law transported 3 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.329
 I keep saying that he wanted to leave to me it seems lawful 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.129
 because I never said 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:21.319
 I think it's fine 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.319
 the team competes from 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:28.469
 I do not criticize especially its end 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:34.379
 the template is with you and you have to raise today you have to 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.229
 they try to win matches 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.229
 we have to go there to win the brand new 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.889
 milk you have to put your house to have to know how to play to have to measure yourself 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.699
 easy answer as it seems 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.650
 let's see what happens 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.889
 we of course 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.889
 We are not afraid of any kind 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.759
 besides, there are more
