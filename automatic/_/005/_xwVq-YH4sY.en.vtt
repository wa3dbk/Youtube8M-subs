00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 After all, in the attack, and I am her sandy river friends 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.370
 and it will be very very interesting 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.679
 tiebreak vertu strings last game 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.120
 group stage was going tournament friends 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.340
 tomorrow will be the playoffs and all teams 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.070
 will stay in the championship and if na'vi 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.020
 now they win tomorrow the first game 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.480
 naori virtus.pro you did not believe 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.920
 tomorrow we are, in principle, what does it mean 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.160
 today ended tomorrow with this and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.670
 let's start so inspire them choke tea buy 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.920
 writes for scout 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.130
 well frankly milk on i don't 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.660
 I do not quite understand the choice 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.520
 konqueror but because he shoots very 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.230
 rarely if it is fast your explosion 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.960
 some one he only has time 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.399
 shoot well and besides 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.719
 his projectile flies on a hinged trajectory 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.160
 so it flies for a long time and we 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.190
 the question arises how are they going to be him 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.829
 use but what about while go on 9 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.260
 zero vertically bottom entrance to 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.300
 of course through the mountain now 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.170
 I will play there they take the art there 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.670
 conducts now 50 m justcauz 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.979
 neatly on the center the korean went on 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.570
 the virginity of aggressive light give but in 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.040
 this time we let's see already 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.470
 The first light of the planarian we already see 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.200
 cyrilloid on site 140 on dunes 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.360
 katana life navi checked out that there is no 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.750
 opponents on the left flank of the attack and 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.759
 understand what you need to meet right yes 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.650
 now of course you have a colossal 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.360
 experience and especially considering exactly what 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.479
 this map and decided the fate of all 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.759
 last year's season in Warsaw, that's all 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.560
 three seasons of each of the clusters in general 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.600
 that is, a hard year decided on one 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.530
 this map and there a little bit wrong with 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.500
 choosing virtus.pro 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.840
 but now they also play in attack but 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.939
 not completely different 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.360
 form decided to revel in the corner 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.090
 there and apparently they understood that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.860
 guys are not in a hurry and are being delayed 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.450
 on their own and in any case need 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.760
 leave anyway from these positions with 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.470
 flank and 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.180
 in the forehead they will not go to the stop there too 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.440
 it is better not to take that mountain which 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.580
 helps protect everything right here 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.770
 from here they must leave and 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.040
 counterattack guys just now 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.140
 just all tanks break in and will have 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.310
 we rush on the left fund but at this time 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.390
 the whole object is two stb-1 and 50 m 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.060
 guys already principle practically 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.240
 transferred there in a new one to the base 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.670
 standard battle as they say but the board 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.380
 us went to shine right now maybe 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.840
 cover art somehow and help somehow 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.780
 led me all waiting for the plush from the art of an hour she 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.390
 should fly by building think to me 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.430
 until there is simply no one to throw one nickname 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.620
 there is no light now here it is the first light 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.470
 strike and delivery of Japanese and received 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.410
 360 went from art everything was late 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.450
 of course for goals there earlier at this time 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.280
 korean also managed to get my bill 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.410
 Tania, too, they decided to return now 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.900
 team players I understand that the opponent 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.790
 some simply escapes and provokes 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.380
 enter the circle in a circle 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.730
 fired on all sides about not understand 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.620
 what on gerbil 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.790
 important to catch your rivals first 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.950
 from if those would have got there a little bit 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.200
 rumpled tank by half to somehow 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.690
 it was more comfortable when capturing the base 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.209
 that drawdown is the number of tanks in 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.070
 teams virtus.pro so they need 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.530
 now a lot of play damage from 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.750
 artillery planida harder it becomes on 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.519
 seizure first you don't initially have 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.709
 one tank so how do you have art 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.269
 secondly when you get to grab 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.640
 that is, again here's another tank there 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.620
 circle one more think so well minus there 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.870
 but at least half the tank in a battle that 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.090
 should be in one position well in general 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.650
 so far so good for na'vi and one shot 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.030
 got strike 2 what have you got 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:42.050
 some kind of project in general until here it is 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.110
 he this shot of which I waited -2000 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.880
 just turn came sailed i didn't 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.019
 I know he is now just from the river here 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.310
 now just shocked into a corner and 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.810
 curses 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.200
 brown friends for being with him 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.120
 did yes a piece of a shepherd dog wrote out 1 ticket 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.890
 almost in the hangar but here's the answer 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.480
 gets to take on to another shot well in 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.600
 in general, now they saw that power 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.570
 slide it flew in and there is already another 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.930
 the question is what to do with it just jump 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.239
 on him 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.920
 here you can get back immediately 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.689
 lose the tank in this position basically 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.600
 concreor and get it there may 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:19.850
 throw it to him to take it in fact and the 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.560
 meanwhile the korean rode around 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.750
 capture left-handed and immediately opened 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.169
 the balcony is working on a left-hander here in this 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.210
 since we failed to counterattack 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:32.150
 so here's how in the grand final this time 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.550
 all in the hands of gdv all right protection 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.520
 takes a balcony and just breaks minus 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.400
 Left-handed important slide excellent 2 minutes 30 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.020
 seconds, too, do not forget about it 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.490
 Korean shines well but good 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.789
 opportunity but enough time is everything 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.800
 still 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:49.550
 time is the most important guarantee of assault and 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.620
 the seizure of the base of the tartar then now should be 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.340
 something cakes if it wasn't he only 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.870
 that giving a switched piece you will 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.800
 hear he comes right now 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:04.550
 In fact, he rides closer slides down and 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:07.849
 moves to throw over throw 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.030
 here it is possible he will go to finish 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:13.039
 chefs slide though from this position no 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:17.349
 perhaps a summary on eclipse eclipse 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:20.270
 marker now let's see look genes 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:22.849
 arta brother work or not only together 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.780
 he has already bought himself anyway 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.130
 2000 damage is more than that. 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.340
 across the river because here all the same 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.440
 decided on the mash and on finishing the cook 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.960
 JUST substituted minus b to the very 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.699
 the cooks were picked up by Santa's nose 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.740
 Remki decided 319 briknik 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.550
 he is still taken by the cyrilloid so now 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.699
 there will be a flow of arts now 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.770
 taken away 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.530
 for whom will the poker lord should 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.090
 shoot another with a piece watching here 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.880
 strike cannot give yet 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.919
 strike what's the problem object 140 stb-1 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.810
 does not finish everything the second went for Cyril 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:00.199
 this help arte Cyrilloid lit up 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.389
 mouth minus the 1st then my Lord of Art 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.919
 yes, this is what i am saying that he is healing 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.169
 query because this is the most 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.930
 real goal for her and got it finishes 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:11.599
 Well, a piece of shepherd great 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.159
 conducts the entire attack all round on 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:16.669
 sandy river we look at the statistics 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:18.950
 two shots yes you just just two 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.900
 shots and see everything what damage 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.139
 these two shots went into this amount 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.830
 about 3000 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:28.590
 delyit bishop paul vs with a pair of deluxo 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.379
 need a hatch now just apparently 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.449
 trying to pull time yes because 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:35.490
 less than a minute is left to order 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:35.849
 to capture the base now if the tanks 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.520
 navi 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:40.979
 populate virtus did not have time to get on 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.289

00:06:50.969 --> 00:07:01.469
 covered a little bit and there are places for 

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:05.819
 suites and I will visit her so now she will win 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:07.800
