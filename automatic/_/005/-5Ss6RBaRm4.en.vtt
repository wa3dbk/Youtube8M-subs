checked the glass breakage any would

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.279 
checked the glass breakage any would
trigger<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> alarm<00:00:54.539> system<00:00:54.809> anyway<00:00:55.079> these

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
trigger the alarm system anyway these

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.099 
trigger the alarm system anyway these
are<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.920> wires<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.750> this<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.870> also

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
are the can of wires and this is also

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.770 
are the can of wires and this is also
not<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.530> main<00:00:58.859> harness<00:00:59.160> now<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> LED<00:01:00.750> light

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
not the main harness now the LED light

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.990 
not the main harness now the LED light
will<00:01:00.930> start<00:01:01.230> flashing<00:01:01.440> rapidly<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.789> means

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
will start flashing rapidly that means

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.609 
will start flashing rapidly that means
is<00:01:03.120> ready<00:01:03.359> for<00:01:03.480> programming<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.320> notice

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
is ready for programming if you notice

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.740 
is ready for programming if you notice
the<00:01:04.739> lights<00:01:04.920> flashing<00:01:05.250> I'm<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> turn

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the lights flashing I'm going to turn

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.390 
the lights flashing I'm going to turn
the<00:01:06.869> key<00:01:07.049> on

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.280 

and<00:01:15.490> then<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.210> security<00:01:16.690> system<00:01:16.870> will

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
and then the security system will

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.200 
and then the security system will
actually<00:01:17.800> self-programming<00:01:18.400> to<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.850> Kansas

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
actually self-programming to the Kansas

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.420 
actually self-programming to the Kansas
system<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.690> BMW<00:01:20.440> is<00:01:20.920> being<00:01:21.190> programmed

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
system of the BMW is being programmed

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.430 
system of the BMW is being programmed
already<00:01:23.310> yeah<00:01:24.330> now<00:01:25.330> you<00:01:25.690> have<00:01:25.900> to<00:01:26.110> remember

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
already yeah now you have to remember

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.350 
already yeah now you have to remember
that<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.920> alarm<00:01:27.280> system<00:01:27.790> is<00:01:27.940> going<00:01:28.180> to<00:01:28.240> be

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
that the alarm system is going to be

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.380 
that the alarm system is going to be
just<00:01:28.630> as<00:01:28.720> effective<00:01:29.040> as<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.180> installation<00:01:31.180> so

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
just as effective as the installation so

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.030 
just as effective as the installation so
if<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.630> installation<00:01:32.170> is<00:01:32.260> I'm<00:01:32.470> Tony<00:01:32.770> with

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
if the installation is I'm Tony with

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.100 
if the installation is I'm Tony with
t-tops<00:01:33.910> connectors<00:01:34.570> could<00:01:34.780> disconnect

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
t-tops connectors could disconnect

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.570 
t-tops connectors could disconnect
anybody<00:01:35.680> can<00:01:35.830> just<00:01:35.920> connect<00:01:36.190> to<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.340> self

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
anybody can just connect to the self

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.880 
anybody can just connect to the self
explanatory<00:01:37.150> quick<00:01:37.570> disconnects<00:01:38.140> right<00:01:38.350> so

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
explanatory quick disconnects right so

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.350 
explanatory quick disconnects right so
what<00:01:39.010> we<00:01:39.130> do<00:01:39.250> different<00:01:39.610> here<00:01:39.730> chase<00:01:40.030> alarms

in audio we start our the wires now you
can<00:01:48.940> hear<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.300> trip<00:01:49.570> that<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.869> system<00:01:50.260> is

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
can hear the trip that the system is

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.980 
can hear the trip that the system is
already<00:01:50.530> armed<00:01:50.920> 21<00:01:51.340> chirp<00:01:51.640> this<00:01:52.630> on<00:01:52.869> the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
already armed 21 chirp this on the
