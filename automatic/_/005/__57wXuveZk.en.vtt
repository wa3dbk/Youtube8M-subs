00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.320
 capello 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200

 three hours walk in an average 30 percent of their time constantly back and forth 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:12.109
 parts that run on the ball 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.739
 elephants on two legs 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.260
 while 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.579

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.759
 Many circus acts with animals are because of the church

 elephant gardeners use chat with language hooks 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.210
 some electric shocks and clubs to stay in direct control 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.290
