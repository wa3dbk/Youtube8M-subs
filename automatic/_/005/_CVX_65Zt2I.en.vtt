00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.220
 seen from the outside this workshop has nothing 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.080
 original but once the door 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.210
 crossed we enter a place 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.740
 unique in France 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.809
 François xavier richard revives 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.199
 for 13 years to know how to go missing at 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.109
 middle of the twentieth century here we make the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.029
 handmade wallpaper with his team 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.340
 françois xavier right now in charge 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.779
 the restoration of all papers 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.590
 painted from Napoleon's study 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.410
 iii 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.750
 at the castle of fontainebleau he realizes 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.250
 today a frieze that's a little 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.170
 element of this risk was extracted for 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.920
 can redo it to do the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.290
 reconstitution 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.570
 so that's our only base 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.360
 work so they're going to have to 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.219
 restore color by color a 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.770
 frieze made two centuries ago 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.860
 a job that imposes know-how and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.629
 north look good the method is a 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.090
 real spectacle for the eyes 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.309
 we must first draw masters from 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.129
 paper for then lying the bottom 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.800
 that is to say the first layer this 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.609
 operation a peak of people because he 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.949
 must go very fast 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.740
 the paint is mixed with a glue that 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.880
 quickly fix themselves a paper a race 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.880
 against the clock begins 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.360
 to get that hand you have to 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.820
 2 and 3 between is chased it's really 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.649
 the technique of coating funds such 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.100
 for practice on the 18th, we do not have 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.890
 changed that the idea of ​​not changing 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.500
 this technique is really 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.049
 keep the imprint of the hand on the on 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.250
 the work is not at all 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.390
 nostalgia because it's still a 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.159
 little bit binding but the result 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.740
 is not at all the same if it was done 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.869
 to the machine what once the painting 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.850
 unify here they are who improvise 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.800
 balancing the wallpaper is 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.530
 hung on the ceiling to be dried 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.060
 a few hours time for the team 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.060
 working and other colors 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.810
 it's not very blue that's rather than 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.869
 so yes you're going with a go 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.270
 to make a master pretty little overseas 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.350
 now goes to the blue color back 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.720
 natural pigments 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.190
 jérôme is going to have to get closer to 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.489
 near the color present on his 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.520
 sample a learned dosage evaluated at 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.610
 the naked eye 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:30.020
 it's a peek 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:32.090
 it is to succeed in projecting the color 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.800
 as it was at the time because 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.670
 there in fact it is dirty by the years 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.069
 by light and dust 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.790
 so that's also it's also a 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.230
 some form of interpretation of the 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.630
 who will redo the color 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.620
 obviously and after a few minutes of 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.959
 cooked 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.900
 Jerome touches his goal here we are on 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.319
 this color here so we're on 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.030
 something quite clear the frieze is going 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.069
 so be able to start appearing on 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.140
 previously painted strips 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.190
 that we reproduced on different 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.620
 composite planks 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.310
 the drawings of the frieze the banks of 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.280
 wallpaper 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.900
 good then be slipped on this table the 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.170
 pressure to the board is going to power 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.170
 to start 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:21.390
 redoing a job that has been 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.730
 made centuries ago already there are 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.700
 it's very rewarding for us actually 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.049
 it can and it is especially very 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.260
 important to know that to people who 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.909
 trust us in our way 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.340
 to reconstitute the period documents 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.000
 in fact to be the most accurate 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.920
 possible 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.629
 the company to combine the know-how 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.349
 old people with technologies 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.900
 present-day 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.819
 for example a laser beam allows more 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.069
 clarification to obtain fittings 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.349
 perfect we leave a moment jérôme 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.049
 to find françois xavier who 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.310
 strives to set up a strange cradle of 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.079
 orders from the usa goes him 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.760
 allow to use the oldest of the 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.189
 Technical techniques 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.769
 wait and see a process of the seventeenth century 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:04.919
 which involves sticking a fiber on the 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.260
 sticky nature here of silk fiber 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.299
 and sprinkle on the paper and for 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.840
 unify everything is technical is 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.840
 explosive 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.220
 2 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.320
 all that remains now is to pass 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.050
 this paper under a juicer to get 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.990
 the desired effect to embossed paper in 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.660
 be perfectly realized that no 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.310
 modern machine can not match and everything 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.910
 this is born of work and 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.350
 the imagination of françois xavier 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.850
 we still have to imagine that there are 13 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.740
 years we had absolutely nothing to say 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.810
 we left, I did not leave 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.370
 with an existing heritage with a 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.720
 collection of boards drawings what 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.850
 whether it was absolutely nothing 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.850
 that is, everything was built from 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.010
 hazen so I think the real one 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.630
 satisfaction is to have the feeling 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.130
 to have pushed a frontier to have 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.700
 advanced something that is 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.800
 it is not to make a clean sweep of the past 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.080
 at the other end of the workshop the work 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.450
 on the continuous socket we install a 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.190
 another board a third color is going 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.320
 be applied a long process 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.270
 since you have to go back 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.720
 the strip of paper and this for each 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.260
 color in the end and little by little the 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.190
 frieze takes shape 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.690
 to see that the result appears and that 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.170
 it gives pretty much the same thing as it 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.700
 200 years ago we hope that in 100 years or 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.020
 in 200 years ago there are people who will do 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.830
 the same with the papers I have 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.830
 as a bonus today what
