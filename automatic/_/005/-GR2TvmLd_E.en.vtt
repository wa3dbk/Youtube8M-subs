00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.800
 hello to all today we get 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.410
 found for a new video on 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.869
 final fantasy 11.6 that rohff hadwin 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.990
 again so in the 22 students 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.270
 this video follows the two 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.530
 videos that I did previously on the 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.449
 new update that has had on this 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.800
 event that allows us to do it a 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.300
 a lot less players than expected 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.770
 since they were havas 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.230
 fights scheduled for 18 players and 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.430
 now we can do them at six 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.129
 players then in this case of 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.989
 10-8 and I will give you one more 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.860
 times the different jobs then about 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.920
 2 bard 2 monk has samurai a magician 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.270
 white and moenner as well as - years 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.559
 collard as 1 x stone is also 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.590
 I do a little bit two dps that you 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.479
 can see that even though there against it 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.750
 was not really very useful since 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.979
 already so but magic do not do 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.539
 a lot of damage then you 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.310
 see that later we have 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:15.950
 met with some problems on this 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.490
 bosses who did not have so on both 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.410
 other bosses and compared to his tastes 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.190
 maybe better not just use 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:28.280
 damage magic on it so good 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.479
 it's like life like you 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.740
 already know anyway I'm you 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.840
 had already made a video 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.369
 again on like all 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.099
 other delphi bosses so if you 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.720
 want to have different info on the 

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:41.509
 strategy I advise you to go 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.720
 watch this video there what am I going 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.640
 not soon to repeat so the 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.069
 difference from combat 18 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.250
 it's like the other two nm does it 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.039
 to be already alone on stage to have 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.190
 a lot less two dps 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.630
 again the boss does not lose 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.860
 the power of these attacks that's it 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.840
 also something that you really need 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.890
 take into account is that the power 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.960
 of these attacks will always be 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.880
 identical even though he has a lot less 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.950
 buy 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.690
 that the 10-player version is 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.040
 really mainly the hp that are 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.030
 diminished and not the power of these 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.099
 attacks for granted it's very 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.459
 important 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:21.620
 two tons these different skill and 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.800
 So here we come to worries and I 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.030
 believe we had this boss 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.040
 sequels as you will see he could 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.930
 want to turn to the scrums and 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.720
 on the contrary low he turns to me 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.980
 since in fact the buzz therefore has a 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.599
 ability that allows for reset sight 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.019
 so he has two abilities that 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.580
 allow to reset precisely are to 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.380
 big and that's why it takes 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.180
 absolutely the stones unfortunately 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.910
 I had to miss one and it is precisely 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.049
 for that the boss is probably because 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.400
 that with the stone is still a 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.620
 magic that gives a lot of agro it's 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.569
 something that today as 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.160
 that scola we see more in the sense 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.380
 where we do only stun but it's true 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.120
 that at the time already in black blue magician 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.530
 center at the time it was the magician 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.019
 black who were mainly ashton 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.730
 since the square did not even exist 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.319
 it is true that the stun it did not give 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.000
 badly of agro and on angers in more the 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.380
 big black wizard's neck that I'm 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.329
 remember having taken a lot 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.709
 the big cause of this magic there and 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.329
 This is why for example the sco 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.560
 art is good to use magic 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.569
 that I used judgment that had 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.950
 added that allows him to reduce his 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.959
 enemy title something that I think 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.730
 even more aptly used because 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.920
 once again so far I 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.260
 never had any problem as 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.670
 stone but as you can see here 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.310
 it could have been a skill when 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.100
 even more useful or even used on 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.950
 the other dps precisely the other magic 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.010
 of school that increases 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.299
 the enemy just that we receive 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.010
 by making an attack where various 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.389
 actions on the boss this is exactly what 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.389
 kind of magic there that may not be 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:52.310
 very useful in a player manager where 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.650
 just on a lot of other corners 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.239
 in the game who in this fight there 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.400
 become aptly used 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.630
 maybe that's what makes it happen 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.700
 head I find a little bit more 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.840
 interesting that at August 18 be more 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.940
 interesting even as many others 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.880
 event in the game it's because I 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.920
 find that there is really just 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.840
 that we are much less and that still 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.160
 once it's like to repeat but 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.629
 that each of our actions besides 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.190
 of importance in the fight ago 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.709
 a lot more stress compared to 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.269
 fight there is a lot more to it needs 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.370
 be much more attentive to various 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.630
 thing and is once again stayed at 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.300
 what I said in the last video 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.479
 shark I do not know if we really can 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.430
 say that these fights to compare to those to 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.040
 18 players are simpler more 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.370
 complicated it will really depend on 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.419
 makes players and that's it if you think 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.880
 that you can do some things 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.620
 only to 10 players will you do it 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.850
 with the help of some people and where 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.500
 at that moment I do not think you 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.630
 will have many more problems than 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.850
 do it to 18 now it's true that 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.020
 18 who always has that side of if ever 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.880
 we make a mistake in the sale if 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.680
 I never miss 1 stun yachou maybe 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.510
 the other scholar that's going to rain and who 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.130
 will just stone the skill will have 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.820
 always for example someone who will be 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.410
 ready to say how apt ah 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.030
 fix some mistakes that 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.610
 unfortunately when we are a group 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.990
 very reduced to every mistake can 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.160
 unfortunately be fatal and there as 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.710
 you can see it in unfortunately 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.410
 game as the boss for a lot of 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.270
 time finally I'm pretty surprised 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.740
 besides having been to have rather 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.510
 survived as long as it is that the 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.010
 boss in himself I think do not hit 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.289
 really very strong of the month his attacks 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.910
 basic is especially his abilities or 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.919
 the fact that it attacks precisely especially 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.229
 in love as you can see 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.490
 which does a lot of damage and 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.680
 that's exactly why maybe at 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.789
 this level at the he 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.669
 maybe a little more humble 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.770
 precisely to six players only to 18 because 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.820
 that the fact that there is a lot less 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.500
 people who get touched there are 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.020
 much less have city business 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.770
 unfortunately you can see that 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.090
 it is a little shame that I 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.490
 just relax because I had 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.490
 just managed to lose there big so 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.289
 it is enough that will spring proud a little bit 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.500
 faster and I surely stay at 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.090
 survive but that's fine it was the end 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.640
 of the fight that's a little selling age 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:07.120
 it will not be too much 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:09.790
 how to say penalized on this fight there 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.010
 so here we go the boss must 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.870
 die so I hope I listened to you 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.070
