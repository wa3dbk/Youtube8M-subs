00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.049
 to stop it 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.830
 this 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.930
 when I sang 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.829
 so there on them 

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:11.979
 Hanoi Theater 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:15.609
 San Sanych Pikulenko in the morning and turn with 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:17.820
 monday to friday 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.079
 in any weather 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:21.359
 does not pass 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.569
 some 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.009
 that person tried to assure me that 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.749
 CVT there is a torque converter 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:29.869
 I can immediately say no that this option 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.629
 project mechanism transmitting torque 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.629
 motor torque without break 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.610
 imagine italians 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.860
 strap between them 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.650
 on the plate is empty under the influence 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.550
 plate centrifugal forces 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.940
 pressed jiri mother's bag then 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.620
 rises to a large radius then 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.600
 sinks to the bottom 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.309
 this is how the principle of operation works 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.479
 variator but 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:55.619
 a gift since the car can't 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.060
 to move 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.770
 just yes you need a mechanism which 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.630
 allows some slip but to 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.480
 belt sticks to you boxing world 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.540
 Volochkova all the same living with on iron 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.930
 wear fast 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.330
 there are 23 not forward and reverse 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.950
 that is, when you touch forward 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.110
 first start from there late katsu 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.760
 front cordon but a belly like 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.640
 typical who rode dax 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.820
 that is, or electronically 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.420
 controlled with hydraulic 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.460
 but mechanisms in general at the moment of twisting 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.900
 the engine is fed our kiev is through 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.390
 planetary 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.760
 gear 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.050
 and a block of differentials for what because 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.050
 when you drive ahead you turn on 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.860
 first front mates 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.780
 then he adds momentum and drove 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.570
 here half a year but when you need to go back 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.179
 who at this moment have pulleys and brake 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.309
 and besides make them spin in reverse 

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.920
 the side 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.799
 here the rear clutch is already activated 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.700
 the course 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.250
 and go back accordingly 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.490
 reliable stuff 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.220
 fine lately even works 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.200
 on very powerful cars for years to come 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.759
 was considered not suitable for 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.399
 powerful machines for big gears 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:04.740
 big moments 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.240
 but I think it takes what 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.949
 such a middle position between 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:10.820
 what 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.799
 the usual 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.329
 automatic hydromechanical and 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.349
 modern robot than not like 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.960
 variable speed drive 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.960
 but imagine un gives the opportunity 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.760
 create gears on relationships from 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.229
 fifteen to one to three to one 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:26.620
 that is, this is 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.939
 given 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.040
 a little bit more than few possibilities 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.309
 five-speed manual 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.910
 gears 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.939
 that is, you can fine tune 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.939
 engine on a certain 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.139
 number of turns where it was 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.139
 the variator worked optimally 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.109
 it is used 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.450
 and now when tough 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.180
 environmental requirements when 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.650
 strict requirements for turnover variators 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.450
 becoming more popular and 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.389
 more popular 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.019
 I repeat again, at the time my wife 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:56.849
 rather 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.049
 in Tomsk Pushkin's proceeds 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.029
 november tatar inform 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:01.859
 can be pushed
