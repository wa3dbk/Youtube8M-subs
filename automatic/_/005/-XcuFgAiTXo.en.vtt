 new operating system that presented 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.740
 apple in the last keynote of June yes 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.020

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.600
 you can do only from the mac app 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.850
 store you go to the mac app store and very 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.769
 You will easily find Asx Mountain 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.260
 lion the list to download 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:44.110
 It has a price of 15.99 euros 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.210
 in dollars they are almost almost 20 dollars but 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.489
 Well the truth is that it has a system 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.350
 operative with so many improvements in me from 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.989
 my point of view is a purchase 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.250
 essential I already bought it like this 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.200
 that I'm going to show you a little bit how to 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.090
 install there are three ways of installation 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.980
 the first the first way is 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.350
 update you have the system 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.629
 operative lion and you will use monte 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.180
 the lion in this way to disassemble the lion 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.570
 with the same thing that you have the year 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.090
 the same programs and also the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.730
 same the same junk files the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.440
 same bored and possibly if you have 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.300
 some defect the same problems the 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.280
 same defects that's why I would recommend 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.320
 that you did a clean installation but 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.050
 for tastes the colors yes that's true 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.960
 that apple is a guarantee of quality 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.130
 and an update has to be 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.470
 enough for the pse is 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.270
 operative go very fluid but good I 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.910
 I insist that personally I 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.100
 like to install from scratch maybe it's from 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.149
 professional training for all years 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.430
 of experiences that I have had with 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.890
 windows so I'll explain 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.509
 first how to update the system 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.940
 operative to update it because nothing 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.280
 once downloaded from the app brand 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.350
 store it is x mount it I will appear 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.210
 as I told you the landmark icon in the 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.190
 dock then nothing simply from here you 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.410
 to continue with this the data that 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.700
 I ask and it will update or sx mounts 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.469
 in lion 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.439
 if you want to do an installation from 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:08.170
 zero it is best that you do the following 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:12.269
 you do the right button in the iconic 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:16.599
 of the dock you give to show in the finder 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:18.670
 and from here on install in the 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.410
 application install or follow against him 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.870
 You can also give him a right button 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.080
 dais to show content of the package os 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.110
 you are going to content you are going to shared to 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.260
 port and from here you find the file 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.080
 install that point of m &amp; g that this is 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.959
 the source file of the operating system 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.090
 from here you do right button to open 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.620
 with disk utility 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.170
 when the disk utility opens 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.590
 from here we will be able to record a dvd or 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.750
 prepare a usb to be installable 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.519
 or so that it allows us to install or sx 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.760
 Rides the plane from the USB as 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.790
 simple is to record a DVD worth if you choose 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.500
 the image that is here 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.910
 you just have to give it to record and 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.099
 if you have a virgin disc stuck in the 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.549
 dvd is going to record it if not by nando what 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.319
 you put and I will record it sorry if by the 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.450
 Unlike you want to do is record 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.430
 x montan lion on a usb and let it be 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.780
 installable or if you teach how you have to 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.849
 do the first thing we have to do 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.130
 is to click the usb and it only works 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.280
 with a pendrive of a minimum capacity 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.129
 of 8 gigas occupies 4 gigas and peak sx 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.140
 I did not get a pendrive of 4 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.660
 gigas will not take you stage stage a 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.579
 pendrive of 8 gigs what we have to 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.190
 to make this pendrive a 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.410
 installable of mount in lion is to go to the 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.190
 pendrive that is this here we would give 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.310
 to erase we would choose 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:50.060
 in the partition of the mac osx plus format 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.290
 with registration and we give it to erase I'll 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.290
 do with you so that you see it 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.599
 will give you a little bit but in the past 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.209
 seconds may not take long 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.730
 it is already there we have it smooth perfect 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.430
 what we have to do is go to 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.549
 partitions from here we give the 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.230
 first partition we give options and 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.700
 we have to make sure that it is 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.409
 selected the partition table 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.630
 bits in this case I have it 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.289
 selected but the selection eyes and 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.289
 you give to accept 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.780
 we should apply 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.780
 and create partitions 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.830
 well once we 're done we're going 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.870
 to the restore tab and from here 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.940
 what we are going to do is drag the 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.000
 image of montán lion where he puts 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.150
 origin and let's drag the partition 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.700
 that we have created where he places destiny 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.800
 We give the restore button and we give it to 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.110
 delete 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.659
 we must accept and automatically we 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.180
 going to create google pendrive is going to 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:55.580
 convert into a montaigne installer 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.220
 lion 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.710
 well this takes about 15 more minutes or 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.629
 less a process a tad long but 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.099
 Well, I 've explained the three ways 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.319
 what do you have to install mont online 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.240
 first update and then install 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:10.419
 from a dvd or install from a 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.129
 pendrive the fastest is a pendrive 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.990
 good already finished creating the the 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.210
 pendrive mount installer in lion 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.930
 as you see I have it mounted here I open it 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.340
 and here you will see all the files 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.110
 corresponding to the mount in lion all 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.000
 the files that the pendrive needs 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.000
 have to be an installer of 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.289
 ride in lion and nothing has already explained what 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.300
 what do you have to do to create a dvd 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.219
 to create a new sb or to update 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.900
 directly do what you want is worth 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:38.030
 what interests you most 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.110
 if the computer works fine update 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.699
 because you are going to have the same 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.440
 applications you're not going to have to go back 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.969
 to install from scratch the computer we 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.039
 works well if you have some kind of 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.779
 problem to the institut and such is good what 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.490
 more advisable is that you make a 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:52.400
 clean installation through a 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.870
 pendrive or through a dvd this already 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.310
 it's up to you but it's very 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.830
 It is advisable that you have a copy of 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.840
 updated time machine is before 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.820
 to install mount it 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.520
 to connect I do not know what you use 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.370
 you an external hard drive for usb or 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.600
 whatever a time capsule or what 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.430
 you use to make copies of 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.260
 security of time machine but that 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.699
 make a recent copy of time 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.460
 machine so you do not lose any 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.060
 file because it is very important 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.889
 backup 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.780
 Martin is one thing that is very slow that 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.470
 It is very laborious but hey if really 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.090
 are you going to change the computer or are you going to 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.699
 update the operating system with a 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.139
 copy from scratch our option from 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.850
 zero but the truth is that it is very 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.470
 advisable to use time machine well 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.240
 Do not forget before installing 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.220
 mountain layer if you want to have 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.020
 everything as I had it instants make a 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.479
 copy is in machine because you can 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.940
 be a lot of help and nothing more this 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:46.310
 has been a little the mini tutorial of 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.650
 how to install mount lion I hope that you 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.389
 is very useful and nothing we 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.810
 we see in a next video until soon 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.810
 goodbye
