00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.110
 and the boys are definitely 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.119
 looked for pulse of this video and is that in 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.250
 a method of tanks in this season 5 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.590
 all desperately seek champions 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.750
 resistant and big guys like the option 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.699
 perfect for the battle carry is 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.250
 the kart and warrior so you do not 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.630
 you die still serious must die what 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.279
 first that you should keep in mind when 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.020
 struggles against a serious one is that your 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.300
 armor and resistance go up while 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.710
 more time happens in an exchange and it's 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.690
 just what makes it strong a 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.820
 composition for that reason when you're 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.710
 in team battles will be a priority of 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.660
 explode not as soon as possible 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.430
 or you'll end up regretting the expensive face 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.200
 in bot I recommend you champions like kate 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.520
 link or if the first one by its rank 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.770
 broad will be able to control in a 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.090
 Efficient serious cyber has advantage 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.980
 about serious since your shield can 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.079
 block your course forced which are 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.850
 serious spells but at a very far range 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.710
 short and that is your main advantage 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.750
 about who you go with who you go 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.030
 I recommend for attacking njeri game for 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.070
 prevent it from forming properly and doing it 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.110
 losing serious efficiency has a damage 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.550
 super explosive can explode to 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.440
 champions out who in a matter of 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.660
 seconds so try to opt for 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.550
 a moderately defensive composition 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.530
 now comes the good the skills 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.150
 serious make it a perfect champion for 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.980
 doing area damage is not uncommon to see a 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.930
 warrior is dispatching two champions in 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.610
 two against one a co and a last and 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.650
 well-placed will suffice to leave with 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.210
 a quarter of life to a non-tank champion 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.100
 now that you already know what is the mechanics 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.170
 of serious is the solution will be to try 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.090
 do not approach the serious of way montonera 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.220
 that is, do not all go together 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.170
 ball the same is for team battles 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.030
 Grace can make a large amount 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.220
 of enemies if they are all positioned 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.020
 together they try to mobilize to be able 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.090
 exploit it as quickly as possible 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.740
 another curious point is that his last one 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.420
 sees broad in a matter of chura but 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.460
 it really is not so much when you 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.200
 you face wanting one against one treats 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.240
 to use some flash or dash towards a 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.340
 cost when you use the ultimate and you can 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.750
 do it successfully being that 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.880
 connect the last one and you'll have a lot 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.979
 advantage against him since it's basically 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.630
 50% damage in an exchange 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.370
 remember that assaulting is not a champion 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.080
 with escape form except for its damage but 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.270
 it really is used in a more 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.340
 offensive so it will not cost much 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.080
 work catch him on the smoke screen 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.120
 it's a dangerous skill do not trust yourself 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.069
 many do not give much importance and it 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.989
 remain inside this skill is used 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.849
 mainly to start and cut your 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.560
 vision so that the enemy can 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.629
 position yourself in a more effective way 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.150
 so you find out everything so 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.069
 you underestimate it basically with these tips 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.810
 you can go much better with the serious man 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.579
 however I know that it has no secrets 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.109

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.700
