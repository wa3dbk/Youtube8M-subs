to machinima which is why I'm not
uploading<00:01:19.380> those<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.759> all<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.909> just

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
uploading those and so all in all I just

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.760 
uploading those and so all in all I just
don't<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.479> any<00:01:21.600> black<00:01:21.840> ops<00:01:22.080> game<00:01:22.170> plays<00:01:22.530> to

don't have any black ops game plays to
upload<00:01:23.070> right<00:01:23.280> now<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.330> access<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.460 
upload right now that I have access to
and<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.950> figured<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:27.810> know<00:01:27.840> uploading

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and so I figured that you know uploading

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.679 
and so I figured that you know uploading
this<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.860> better<00:01:29.579> than<00:01:29.670> nothing<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.150> mean<00:01:30.299> it's

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
this is better than nothing I mean it's

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.929 
this is better than nothing I mean it's
still<00:01:30.960> called<00:01:31.680> duty<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.250> called<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> d4<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.880> a

with<00:03:37.659> those<00:03:37.810> for<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.049> while<00:03:38.109> but<00:03:40.079> but<00:03:41.079> yes<00:03:41.379> can<00:03:41.650> I

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
with those for a while but but yes can I

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.770 
with those for a while but but yes can I
what<00:03:41.829> I've<00:03:41.919> been<00:03:42.040> doing<00:03:42.189> it's<00:03:43.120> not<00:03:43.269> as<00:03:43.449> good<00:03:43.629> as

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
what I've been doing it's not as good as

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.729 
what I've been doing it's not as good as
playing<00:03:43.959> against<00:03:44.139> real<00:03:44.290> people<00:03:44.319> obviously

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
playing against real people obviously

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.249 
playing against real people obviously
it's<00:03:45.099> not<00:03:45.159> a<00:03:45.250> substitute<00:03:45.519> but<00:03:46.079> actually<00:03:47.079> think

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:47.259 
it's not a substitute but actually think

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:48.749 
it's not a substitute but actually think
it<00:03:47.349> might<00:03:47.470> be<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.650> pretty<00:03:47.859> decent<00:03:48.250> supplement

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:48.759 
it might be a pretty decent supplement

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:50.909 
it might be a pretty decent supplement
so<00:03:49.479> look<00:03:49.840> into<00:03:50.109> that<00:03:50.229> i've<00:03:50.439> been<00:03:50.650> i've<00:03:50.859> been

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
so look into that i've been i've been

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.119 
so look into that i've been i've been
doing<00:03:51.069> that<00:03:51.189> a<00:03:51.280> bit<00:03:51.459> it's<00:03:52.030> pretty<00:03:52.209> fun<00:03:52.419> also

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
doing that a bit it's pretty fun also

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.589 
doing that a bit it's pretty fun also
although<00:03:54.129> don't<00:03:54.489> set<00:03:54.819> them<00:03:55.000> on<00:03:55.120> veteran

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
although don't set them on veteran

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:56.969 
although don't set them on veteran
because<00:03:55.900> he<00:03:56.019> be<00:03:56.139> set<00:03:56.290> them<00:03:56.439> on<00:03:56.530> veteran<00:03:56.859> you'll

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:56.979 
because he be set them on veteran you'll

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.679 
because he be set them on veteran you'll
just<00:03:57.159> end<00:03:57.280> up<00:03:57.400> raging<00:03:57.669> because<00:03:58.269> it's

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:58.689 
just end up raging because it's

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.030 
just end up raging because it's
literally<00:03:59.079> like<00:03:59.229> playing<00:03:59.469> against<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.829> team

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
literally like playing against the team

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.379 
literally like playing against the team
of<00:04:00.069> hackers<00:04:00.370> like<00:04:00.790> i<00:04:00.849> don't<00:04:01.030> think<00:04:01.180> it's<00:04:01.299> even

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
of hackers like i don't think it's even

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.959 
of hackers like i don't think it's even
possible<00:04:01.979> like<00:04:02.979> I<00:04:03.069> literally<00:04:03.400> shot<00:04:03.669> at<00:04:03.790> a<00:04:03.849> guy

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:03.969 
possible like I literally shot at a guy

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.059 
possible like I literally shot at a guy
he<00:04:04.060> spun<00:04:04.329> around<00:04:04.449> and<00:04:04.719> just<00:04:05.169> like<00:04:05.409> locked<00:04:05.829> onto

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
he spun around and just like locked onto

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.599 
he spun around and just like locked onto
me<00:04:06.340> and<00:04:06.729> it<00:04:06.909> happens<00:04:07.180> every<00:04:07.629> time<00:04:07.810> it's<00:04:08.049> crazy

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
me and it happens every time it's crazy

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.800 
me and it happens every time it's crazy
but<00:04:09.609> if<00:04:09.909> you<00:04:10.030> play<00:04:10.180> on<00:04:10.329> something<00:04:10.629> like

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
but if you play on something like

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.309 
but if you play on something like
hardened<00:04:11.650> or<00:04:12.180> our<00:04:13.180> hardcore<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:13.989> don't<00:04:14.229> know

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
hardened or our hardcore I don't know

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.120 
hardened or our hardcore I don't know
what<00:04:14.500> it's<00:04:14.590> gone

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
what it's gone

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.650 
what it's gone
hardened<00:04:16.130> or<00:04:16.190> hardcore<00:04:16.549> or<00:04:16.760> whatever<00:04:17.060> the

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
hardened or hardcore or whatever the

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.060 
hardened or hardcore or whatever the
second<00:04:18.019> hardest<00:04:18.109> difficulty<00:04:18.560> is<00:04:18.859> I<00:04:18.980> mean

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
second hardest difficulty is I mean

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.740 
second hardest difficulty is I mean
they're<00:04:19.190> still<00:04:19.340> challenging<00:04:19.940> but<00:04:20.600> they're

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
they're still challenging but they're

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.480 
they're still challenging but they're
reasonable<00:04:21.500> but<00:04:21.889> they're<00:04:21.980> not<00:04:22.070> like<00:04:22.280> it's<00:04:22.460> not

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
reasonable but they're not like it's not

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.620 
reasonable but they're not like it's not
like<00:04:22.580> playing<00:04:22.910> against<00:04:23.150> a<00:04:23.240> bunch<00:04:23.419> of<00:04:23.510> 8

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
like playing against a bunch of 8

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.510 
like playing against a bunch of 8
butters<00:04:23.900> so<00:04:24.320> that's<00:04:24.889> kind<00:04:25.160> of<00:04:25.190> what<00:04:25.310> I've<00:04:25.400> been

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
butters so that's kind of what I've been

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.469 
butters so that's kind of what I've been
doing<00:04:27.070> but<00:04:28.070> definitely<00:04:28.370> once<00:04:29.090> i<00:04:29.270> get<00:04:29.449> my

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
doing but definitely once i get my

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.450 
doing but definitely once i get my
connection<00:04:30.020> fixed<00:04:30.260> i<00:04:30.530> will<00:04:30.860> definitely<00:04:31.340> go

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
connection fixed i will definitely go

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.750 
connection fixed i will definitely go
through<00:04:31.760> and<00:04:32.949> upload<00:04:33.949> some<00:04:34.130> more<00:04:34.280> black<00:04:34.490> ops

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
through and upload some more black ops

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.320 
through and upload some more black ops
and<00:04:35.000> record<00:04:35.510> some<00:04:35.660> more<00:04:35.810> black<00:04:35.990> ops<00:04:36.260> also<00:04:37.330> and

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
and record some more black ops also and

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.159 
and record some more black ops also and
I<00:04:38.419> came<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.660> a<00:04:38.900> realization<00:04:40.810> actually<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.080> I

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
I came to a realization actually and I

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.409 
I came to a realization actually and I
my<00:04:42.979> friend<00:04:43.250> told<00:04:43.430> me<00:04:43.550> about<00:04:43.639> this<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.120> I<00:04:44.150> tried

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
my friend told me about this and I tried

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.570 
my friend told me about this and I tried
it<00:04:44.540> out<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:44.810> it<00:04:45.500> ended<00:04:45.770> up<00:04:45.889> being<00:04:46.100> absolutely

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
it out and it ended up being absolutely

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.360 
it out and it ended up being absolutely
true<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.030> that<00:04:47.180> is<00:04:47.330> that<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:47.630> npl<00:04:48.260> rapid<00:04:49.100> fire

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
true and that is that the npl rapid fire

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.530 
true and that is that the npl rapid fire
I<00:04:49.760> think<00:04:50.540> might<00:04:50.840> be<00:04:51.110> as<00:04:51.880> good<00:04:52.880> if<00:04:53.150> not<00:04:53.210> better

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
I think might be as good if not better

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.530 
I think might be as good if not better
than<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.260> 70<00:04:54.620> for<00:04:54.830> you<00:04:55.010> I'm<00:04:55.520> not<00:04:56.240> exaggerating

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
than the 70 for you I'm not exaggerating

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.930 
than the 70 for you I'm not exaggerating
I<00:04:57.020> man<00:04:57.169> that<00:04:57.290> thing<00:04:57.620> was<00:04:57.919> like<00:04:58.550> having<00:04:58.760> a

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
I man that thing was like having a

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.030 
I man that thing was like having a
pocket<00:04:59.360> chopper<00:04:59.750> gunner<00:04:59.960> seriously<00:05:00.830> like

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
pocket chopper gunner seriously like

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.280 
pocket chopper gunner seriously like
it's<00:05:01.520> got<00:05:01.700> minimal<00:05:02.330> recoil<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:03.080> has<00:05:03.260> a

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
it's got minimal recoil it has a

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.590 
it's got minimal recoil it has a
ridiculously<00:05:04.280> high<00:05:04.460> fire<00:05:04.760> rate<00:05:04.970> with<00:05:05.180> rapid

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
ridiculously high fire rate with rapid

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.810 
ridiculously high fire rate with rapid
fire<00:05:05.780> on<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:06.169> it<00:05:06.260> just<00:05:06.440> kills<00:05:06.710> so<00:05:07.100> fast<00:05:07.430> and

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
fire on and it just kills so fast and

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.719 
fire on and it just kills so fast and
it's<00:05:08.450> got<00:05:08.600> a<00:05:08.630> 32<00:05:09.200> round<00:05:09.500> magazine<00:05:10.010> also<00:05:10.160> so

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
it's got a 32 round magazine also so

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.290 
it's got a 32 round magazine also so
it's<00:05:11.300> got<00:05:11.470> two<00:05:12.470> more<00:05:12.650> rounds<00:05:12.830> than<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.400> 74<00:05:14.150> you

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
it's got two more rounds than the 74 you

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.500 
it's got two more rounds than the 74 you
so<00:05:15.169> no<00:05:15.500> I<00:05:15.530> mean<00:05:15.800> the<00:05:16.460> MPL<00:05:16.880> with<00:05:17.060> rapid<00:05:17.330> fire<00:05:17.479> I

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
so no I mean the MPL with rapid fire I

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.840 
so no I mean the MPL with rapid fire I
was<00:05:17.660> surprised<00:05:18.080> i<00:05:18.410> tried<00:05:18.710> it<00:05:18.830> before<00:05:19.010> i<00:05:19.460> wasn't

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
was surprised i tried it before i wasn't

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.909 
was surprised i tried it before i wasn't
really<00:05:19.910> a<00:05:20.030> huge<00:05:20.210> fan<00:05:20.330> of<00:05:20.539> it<00:05:20.750> but<00:05:21.530> as<00:05:21.620> it<00:05:21.740> turns

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
really a huge fan of it but as it turns

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.540

why<00:07:11.639> when<00:07:11.820> I<00:07:11.880> first<00:07:11.910> play<00:07:12.300> through<00:07:12.539> it<00:07:12.660> I<00:07:12.720> mean

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
why when I first play through it I mean

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.420 
why when I first play through it I mean
I<00:07:12.960> I<00:07:13.349> just<00:07:13.710> kind<00:07:13.860> of<00:07:13.889> went<00:07:13.979> through<00:07:14.070> the<00:07:14.280> game

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
I I just kind of went through the game

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.909 
I I just kind of went through the game
and<00:07:14.910> I<00:07:14.970> didn't<00:07:15.240> really<00:07:16.199> like<00:07:16.440> memorize

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 
and I didn't really like memorize

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:18.950 
and I didn't really like memorize
anything<00:07:17.190> or<00:07:17.520> anything<00:07:17.880> like<00:07:18.000> that<00:07:18.120> and<00:07:18.599> so

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 
anything or anything like that and so

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.350 
anything or anything like that and so
for<00:07:19.199> me<00:07:19.229> it's<00:07:19.500> not<00:07:19.620> quite<00:07:19.979> a<00:07:20.009> blind<00:07:20.400> run<00:07:20.610> but

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 
for me it's not quite a blind run but

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.640 
for me it's not quite a blind run but
it's<00:07:21.509> pretty<00:07:21.690> close<00:07:21.840> to<00:07:22.199> a<00:07:22.229> blind<00:07:22.409> wrong

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.650 
it's pretty close to a blind wrong

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.350 
it's pretty close to a blind wrong
because<00:07:22.919> I<00:07:22.949> still<00:07:23.340> you<00:07:23.940> know<00:07:23.970> I'm<00:07:24.090> not<00:07:24.210> that
