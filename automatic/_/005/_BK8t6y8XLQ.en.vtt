00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
 ae 

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.960
 the process of hits 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.010
 process 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.010
 those who need 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.750
 for the person to be 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:22.590
 a street suitable for work 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:27.000
 after referencing is the minimum touch of the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.530
 grinding wheel in the play away from us this media 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.560
 past the goal 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.520
 it's a 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.520
 granger salt 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.410
 and depth 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.560
 Let's go through the necklace. 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.500
 a sad leonina 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.710
 in the field the refrigeration 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:03.500
 the fg moon the friction bearing 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.630
 this is what the warming of the earth 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.600
 and she begins to make the same move 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.520
 transverse and longitudinal if mountain 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.500
 on top of the piece 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520
 a depth of care of five 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.740
 hundredths 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.350
 it will generate a flatter surface 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.130
 therefore our surface 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.590
 the best precision of parallelism 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.930
 looking for an old robot is more 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.880
 suitable 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.560
 seems little but this elimination of 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.720
 material 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.030
 she has a very great friction because 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.409
 the machine to act as 2,400 rpm and 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.210
 There is an attack going on 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.460
 of the hydraulic movement of the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.399
 machine and it will eliminate this 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.110
 material to the point that this surface 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.200
 find 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.630
 after the appropriate steps were repeated 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.390
 to reach its size 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.640
 she will be strictly flat 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.320
 the depth 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.320
 I'm going to have a desk return now. 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.090
 she will start to eliminate but will have 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.020
 to find a very flat substitute and with the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.630
 obesity is proper to a desired and 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.830
 What can I do for you? 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:33.180
 The lower the depth, the lower the 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.880
 but finishing and michel you get the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.080
 its machining process that pumping 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.090
 melted 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.440
 the team that it runs through 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.380
 grinding wheel 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.360
 We are watching there, girÃ£o. 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.630
 the longitudinal and transverse movement 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.530
 da mills or leader 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.520
 this refrigeration reimbursement once 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.120
 in friction with the part 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.819
 The strip is generally suitable material 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.859
 repeat that is for finishing 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.090
 It's to make a parallel with a lot of 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.730
 precision 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.450
 is little material that takes half of these 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.450
 issue addresses 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.540
 for the heat treatment soon 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.620
 followed only by hospitalization 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.610
 back to the withdrawal will take out 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.290
 is leaving this training allowance 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.620
 suitable for this and gives a finish 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.500
 desired in the simple machine but a 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.620
 very dangerous machine 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.620
 the process of careful fixing of 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.019
 security goggle operator 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.410
 He is very well protected. 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.530
 suitable so that I am not cruel 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.190
 neither timely nor reached operator 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.290
 but knowing the equipment you 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.750
 get your security 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.480
 now I'll give the last easy I go 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.909
 compare to an identified area 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.030
 with the other that was not identified 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.850
 you will look 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.260
 does not do well, fine 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.260
 three hundredths 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.049
 here the control panel 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.720
 where you turn the wheel of the hydraulic 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.460
 half generation machine and red ones 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.040
 where you enemy 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.419
 here is the rebub head movement 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.750
 where it rains 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.930
 the ne10 and the movements of the table both 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.409
 Longitudinal and transverse to the original 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.879
 transversal 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.879
 we're through 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.580
 we will be able to compare 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.580
 the surface identified 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:07.310
 I Love 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.310
 I was on the machine. 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:15.150
 then dise blanket riding table 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.700
 through the signal you have to return 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.320
 that the light is flashing and that part 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.140
 he was imprisoned through a very powerful 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.900
 of the implantation of the table where 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.580
 hold her tightly 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.820
 allowing it to drop in the process 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.820
 of machining 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:35.820
 now you remove 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:40.770
 can you identify a surface 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.540
 built up a machined surface through 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.500
 Machine Tools 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:50.340
 see roughness 11 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:53.820
 something that is perceptible with the process 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.830
 of finishing and therefore the 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.250
 perfect parallelism 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.250
 OK
