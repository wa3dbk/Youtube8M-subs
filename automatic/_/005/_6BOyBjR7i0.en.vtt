00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:23.049
 good morning everyone is marco squizzato nuisance in the kitchen or like 

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:26.049
 make creative dishes using canned products 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.589
 the recipe we will make is a breath of green asparagus with exif poached eggs 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.380
 of raw ham 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.740
 now let's see the ingredients for a moment 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.940
 we have potatoes cut into cubes 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.910
 of canned asparagus tips 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.470
 2 eggs 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.470
 a little cream with an egg yolk 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.420
 1 shallot 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.390
 some butter 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.390
 and the backs of cut asparagus 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.470
 a bit of vegetable broth here are the slices of ham that we will have 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.590
 dehydrate we begin 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.340
 cod chop the shallot 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.800
 you will not need to finely chop the ingredients 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.800
 because then a small piece of butter will come to attention 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.020
 Brown the shallot 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.730
 afterwards we are the potato cut into cubes 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.220
 if it will serve us from plants 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.370
 as a final result for the cream 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.310
 asparagus if you text 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.030
 that it is very thin asparagus is a sign of 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.390
 product tenderness 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.890
 there is a minimal amount of fiber 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.140
 so it's not that feeling of filemaker go kart 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.240
 let's add some evidence for that 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.150
 and let it boil for some 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.810
 as already mentioned other times in the preparation of the recipe with 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.929
 box products 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.730
 we don't need to stay 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.990
 if necessary, a little bit of pepper series 7 requires it 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.780
 you want the direct boxes are already treated salted with tt so not 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.690
 we have this need there is a corresponding high butt welding 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.300
 to our daily needs therefore we are dealing with products they undergo 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.859
 very careful checks 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.849
 we prepare the poached egg 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.669
 which will come photo for a couple of minutes 2 3 minutes with a little sour water there 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.819
 duration of access stroke 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.819
 and later we will set aside for the final proposition emilia 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:35.369
 it is important and the remaining egg is during this cooking phase 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.879
 we will try to make it form 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.619
 a ball has passed regularly 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.999
 I would say that at this point we are the egg is ready 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.999
 it is important that it remains soft 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.179
 the yolk 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:52.289
 I prefer to leave it 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:55.749
 eventually I don't feel like cooking 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:58.169
 and we lay it down for the moment 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.969
 in a cup where you would take it back 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.900
 let's take it on raw ham 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.900
 and we put it to dehydrate microsd 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:11.719
 it took 15 seconds now to let them evaporate at room temperature 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:16.269
 environment after which they will be ready for the Philadelphia composition 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.859
 at this point the soup abolished for 2 3 minutes if rested a moment now by 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.560
 we will insert in this brico hours we will blend it to compose the final cream 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:27.909
 so a little at a time 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.150
 beta seriamo in the container and let's whisk the cream 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:37.589
 take 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:40.589
 to underline with the ball the egg yolk 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:44.029
 live score has a siena 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.579
 and we're going to pour it 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:47.649
 inside the cream 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:50.909
 these two ingredients will give us a sense of softness of creaminess 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:55.129
 I would say that at this point we have all the elements to compose for the 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:56.679
 final composition of tears 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:04:01.049
 then raw ham, poached egg and asparagus cream we put 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.049
 the cream on the bottom of the plate 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.639
 gently with a spoon 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.639
 let's smile egg yolk 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.969
 and we decorate 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:16.669
 gallbladder ham 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.680
 a light grind of thebes 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.680
 pity chrome 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.440
