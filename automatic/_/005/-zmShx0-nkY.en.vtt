x<00:00:40.950> 17<00:00:41.579> we<00:00:41.730> saw<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:43.020> has<00:00:43.260> 1<00:00:43.500> gigabyte

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
x 17 we saw and then it has 1 gigabyte

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.260 
x 17 we saw and then it has 1 gigabyte
of<00:00:44.040> ram<00:00:44.280> 8<00:00:44.520> gigs<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.180> storage<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.809> LTE<00:00:46.620> too<00:00:46.860> so

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
of ram 8 gigs of storage and LTE too so

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.150 
of ram 8 gigs of storage and LTE too so
where<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.300> asked<00:00:48.600> these<00:00:48.809> tablets<00:00:49.649> with<00:00:49.920> voice

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
where I asked these tablets with voice

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.580 
where I asked these tablets with voice
calling<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.760> nte<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.140> pretty<00:00:52.379> good<00:00:52.530> I

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
calling and nte so it's pretty good I

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.170 
calling and nte so it's pretty good I
guess<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.309> look<00:00:53.489> at<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.640> design<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:53.969> design

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
guess but look at the design the design

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.689 
guess but look at the design the design
is<00:00:54.719> very<00:00:55.050> much<00:00:55.440> similar<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.860> what<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.340> saw<00:00:56.520> in

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
is very much similar to what we saw in

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.060 
is very much similar to what we saw in
the<00:00:56.730> HTC<00:00:57.239> One<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.440> speakers<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the HTC One you have like speakers and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.319 
the HTC One you have like speakers and
earpiece<00:00:59.399> at<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> top<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> bottom

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
earpiece at the top and the bottom

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.420 
earpiece at the top and the bottom
bezels<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> black<00:01:02.070> Bissell

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
bezels and you have the black Bissell

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.390 
bezels and you have the black Bissell
here<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.210> aluminum<00:01:04.049> things<00:01:04.260> over<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.710> top<00:01:04.920> so

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
here the aluminum things over the top so

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.719 
here the aluminum things over the top so
it<00:01:05.489> looks<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> very<00:01:06.240> much<00:01:07.130> HTC<00:01:08.130> One<00:01:08.340> max

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
it looks like a very much HTC One max

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.690 
it looks like a very much HTC One max
max<00:01:09.030> or<00:01:09.330> something<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.979> that's<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
max or something like that so that's the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.260 
max or something like that so that's the
design<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.360> huawei<00:01:13.140> mediapad<00:01:13.350> am<00:01:13.710> 18<00:01:14.270> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
design of the huawei mediapad am 18 so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.820 
design of the huawei mediapad am 18 so
let's<00:01:15.479> go<00:01:15.869> through<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.140> hardware<00:01:16.470> then<00:01:16.619> 8

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
let's go through the hardware then 8

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.670 
let's go through the hardware then 8
