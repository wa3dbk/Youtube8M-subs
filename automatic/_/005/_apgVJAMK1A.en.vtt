 fatally it slows down 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.240
 and in that in that slower shift 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.100
 this Brasilia vehicle came crashing into the 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.300

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.550

 according to information the driver 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.240
 suspected of being drunk would have 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.010
 caused a first accident walking 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.320

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.850
 of sarandi catches the eye is an inspector 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.310
 that nine people were inside a 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.970
 vehicle which is not in good condition 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.490
 of traffic in rainy day is you see 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.990
 which added to the accidents that the 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.090
 people can consider in a natural way 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.220
 the ones that occur daily 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.600
