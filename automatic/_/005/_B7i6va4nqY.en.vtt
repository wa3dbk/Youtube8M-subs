negative I thought that we had a couple
of<00:01:54.090> chances<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.780> get<00:01:55.439> touchdowns<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.399> we

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
of chances to get touchdowns and we

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.789 
of chances to get touchdowns and we

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
ended up having to settle for field

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.580 
ended up having to settle for field
goals<00:01:59.040> and<00:02:00.170> Caleb<00:02:01.170> Sturgis<00:02:01.759> you're<00:02:02.759> garbage
