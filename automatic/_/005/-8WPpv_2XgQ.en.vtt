00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello are you in the plan of noise have you arrived 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.380
 to my channel this time and in my 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.520
 I try to free my hard drive 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.949
 of files then I was browsing 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.620
 for a forum and I came across a topic 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.510
 I had seen that state before 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.460
 status of a phone that is a time 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.190
 it was in my hands and that for x 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.680
 reasons I forgot to do to upload the video 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.610
 edit the video about the telefonito and the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.629
 You'll see when I had a lot of time 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.489
 then it is about 11 m 601 a 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.339
 smartphone phone to mind well is 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.269
 a tablet a phone bigger than 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:46.260
 normal screen 6 inch panel 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:51.649
 Haitian is ips with a resolution of 540 x 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.649
 960 pixels that what they give to circulated 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.640
 sometimes phone is that it's finally the 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.440
 cheapest phone in the market or one 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.380
 of the cheapest that an android has 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.500
 kitkat version 4.4 points and also has 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.370
 a house says inches the processor 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:13.600
 is a dual core of 13 and exercise the mtk 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.610
 of 32 and the mtk are the ones that good before 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.380
 and so far it's still welcome in 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.120
 the generic phones in our like 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.450
 Chinese that used to be slow but that 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.860
 now you can do the phones 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.860
 most known the attic know 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.980
 because I dream time because I did not have that 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:39.510
 team a lot more time from me in my 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.310
 power that is a friend I could not prove the 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.580
 camera make a video capture and 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.990
 I can download it to my computer and 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.220
 so I will not be able to do it like that 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
 you can find the truth that 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.360
 on youtube I could not find more about 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.530
 quality video recording I know 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.800
 that 5 megapixels and 120 to 120 30 frames 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.570
 per second and when but to me in my 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.270
 background if they put pressure that nothing else or 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.369
 less acceptable is that the video was 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.840
 quite fluid however I have not had 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.060
 the province downloaded soles videos 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.720
 now we are playing the browser of the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.950
 phone browser and browsing 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.740
 some pages of a ford party 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.810
 good story is that he frequented this is 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.110
 the latin gamer that says the page of 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.720
 witch because there is already Phoenician and they will see 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.530
 what is moving well enough 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.590
 that supports a lot of protocols 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.050
 like those that flash from youtube and now 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.270
 they will see other formats also not 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.810
 supports and can also browse more 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.810
 fluency 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.400
 i 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.950
 in question the sound when the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.959
 speakers are not very impressive that 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.959
 let's say it's not stereo we can not 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.110
 enter phone abuse so cheap 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.750
 however I really never have very 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.090
 very high expectations talking blocks 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.530
 incorporated in the equipment for if one 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.069
 he wants a new sound he's just going to 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.190
 end by accessing using a part 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.260
 of the hearing aids and this and this is the 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.540
 page of the dub I really like this 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.910
 page because it supports enough 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.580
 protocols let them cross enough 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.890
 things like flash like now they are going to see 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.890
 more to the downloads page of this 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:37.150
 page and where I have one and munich one 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.160
 embedded from the box and the great legacy 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.720
 well the only problem is good 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.780
 is the download speed that you study 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.290
 for internet speed instead 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.510
 but you will see what 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.120
 that is compatible with many 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.549
 applications equation codes 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.810
 both the page and the phone that 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.810
 allows muscle decoration 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.510
 and about a person the time does not reach 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.360
 installing heavier applications is 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.000
 say games that weigh about 50 ones 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.060
 100 megabytes and that really have to have 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.519
 a lot of polygons in 3-d 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.350
 I did not proportion time and because 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.870
 I really had a few minutes what 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.850
 come is a really limited noise but 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.380
 if I arrived here towards the amount 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.820
 download the application called attack 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.530
 away that is no longer available in google 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.020
 play unfortunately not like moments 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.150
 critics but that serves me as 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.340
 reference because that game is downloaded 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.100
 enough equipment like the samsung galaxy 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.610
 s3 and other other versions more 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.220
 after the samsung galaxy and the 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.139
 truth is that in many phones in 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.860
 this progress I can make the game 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:54.979
 responds wrong is a little slow the touch 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.190
 screen is a bit that responds with 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.230
 clumsiness that does not recognize well 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.660
 the fingering of the fingers however 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.760
 in this team the game attack away 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.280
 it worked perfectly and basically I 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.140
 is what I am most interested in playing with 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.630
 team I'm not very interested in high 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.340
 graphics when I'm on a phone 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.870
 because it is a little screen for more than 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.420
 have this kind of inches I'm not going to 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.450
 enjoy I will not appreciate not to be 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.930
 so that you use your equipment in a 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.880
 3d TV not like it was this 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.430
 google cardboard like they are 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:33.080
 Oculus limitations 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:35.180
 and in this case the channel m-601 if I 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.040
 call attention to me yes I would like 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.340
 be able to test the phone with our 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.980
 viewers that amazon sells in the strange 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.110
 shows pages that serve to place 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.240
 any the phone and that has helped 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.180
 with a few lenses turn on the phone 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.980
 I'm in a 3d viewer and I'm more interested 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.350
 this by the separation of the eyes what 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.810
 the biggest screen then the 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.300
 centers on each side of the screen to 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.900
 to focus better on the eyes of a 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.420
 person I've tried is this at a 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.510
 7-inch tablet and I think six 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.920
 inches would be quite interesting 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.310
 much better than a 5 phone 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.890
 inches or 4.5 inches and it can be like 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.100
 I say phone I thought it was interesting 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.960
 to try a 3d viewer if it is 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.440
 has the opportunity to bring one of 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.440
 the China 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.639
 good is already here with my opinions 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.470
 about this apparatus of the osce m-601 but 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.660
 that you liked the video does not stop 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.919
 check my more videos and ask me 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.250
 leaving comments subscribe to the 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.250
 page 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:45.840
 and has no loss of quality
