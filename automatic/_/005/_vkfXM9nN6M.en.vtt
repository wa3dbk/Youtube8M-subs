this<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.560> fresh<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.250> gave<00:01:59.880> us<00:02:00.030> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
this is this is fresh and gave us a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.350 
this is this is fresh and gave us a
whole<00:02:00.390> different<00:02:01.049> way<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.850> relate<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
whole different way to to relate to the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.880 
whole different way to to relate to the
two<00:02:03.509> guys<00:02:03.689> I'll<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.560> matically

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
two guys I'll just think the matically

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.490 
two guys I'll just think the matically
the<00:02:05.100> notion<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.180> movie<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.750> essentially

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the notion that the movie is essentially

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.940 
the notion that the movie is essentially
saying<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.369> okay<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.640> fail<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.860> kind<00:02:10.860> of

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
saying it's okay to fail is kind of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.740 
saying it's okay to fail is kind of
remarkable<00:02:11.430> that's<00:02:11.730> not<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> message<00:02:12.390> films

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
remarkable that's not a message films

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.400 
remarkable that's not a message films
often

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
often

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.290 
often
in<00:02:13.470> vain<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.490> does<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.670> beautifully<00:02:14.910> in

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
in vain and it does it beautifully in

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.180 
in vain and it does it beautifully in
terms<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.660> showing<00:02:15.990> how<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.710> can<00:02:16.920> lead<00:02:17.070> to

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
terms of showing how that can lead to

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.010 
terms of showing how that can lead to
something<00:02:17.400> else<00:02:17.670> or<00:02:17.850> what<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.870> it

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
something else or what that is and it

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.500 
something else or what that is and it
comes<00:02:19.170> at<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.380> time<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.830> their<00:02:19.950> lives<00:02:20.510> they're

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
comes at a time in their lives they're

comes at a time in their lives they're
18<00:02:21.810> years<00:02:21.840> old<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:23.510> they're<00:02:24.510> full<00:02:24.840> of

18 years old and they're full of

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.350 
18 years old and they're full of
themselves<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.770> they<00:02:25.860> think<00:02:26.160> they<00:02:26.340> gonna<00:02:27.030> do

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
themselves and they think they gonna do

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.550 
themselves and they think they gonna do
this<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.900> think<00:02:27.960> they're<00:02:28.260> gonna<00:02:28.380> do<00:02:28.500> that

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
this and I think they're gonna do that

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.290 
this and I think they're gonna do that
and<00:02:29.070> that's<00:02:29.190> their<00:02:29.460> dream<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.060> then<00:02:30.150> your

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
and that's their dream and then your

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.260 
and that's their dream and then your
dreams<00:02:30.510> change<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.860> true<00:02:32.070> test<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.520> a

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
dreams change and the true test of a

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.140 
dreams change and the true test of a
person<00:02:33.750> at<00:02:33.900> anytime<00:02:34.380> but<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.280> particularly<00:02:35.880> at

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
person at anytime but a particularly at

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.330 
person at anytime but a particularly at
college<00:02:36.660> age<00:02:36.840> because<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.710> so<00:02:37.920> defines

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
college age because that so defines

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.980 
college age because that so defines
where<00:02:38.580> you're<00:02:38.670> gonna<00:02:38.730> end<00:02:39.090> up<00:02:39.360> more<00:02:39.840> than

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
where you're gonna end up more than

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.990 
where you're gonna end up more than
likely<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.590> how<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.370> handle<00:02:41.640> that

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
likely is how you handle that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.170 
likely is how you handle that
disappointment<00:02:42.990> that<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.550> curve<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.150> the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
disappointment that that curve in the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.330 
disappointment that that curve in the
road<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.660> that's<00:02:46.110> very<00:02:46.620> true<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:46.980> both<00:02:47.070> of

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
road and that's very true of both of

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.880 
road and that's very true of both of
them<00:02:47.430> but<00:02:47.460> more<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:47.910> for<00:02:47.940> for<00:02:48.870> my<00:02:49.050> ku<00:02:49.350> story<00:02:49.710> is

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
them but more so for for my ku story is

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.760 
them but more so for for my ku story is
very<00:02:49.920> fully<00:02:50.580> told<00:02:50.850> in<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.600> this<00:02:51.720> movie<00:02:52.170> what's

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
very fully told in in this movie what's

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.410 
very fully told in in this movie what's
interesting<00:02:52.920> also<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.970> notion<00:02:54.180> of

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
interesting also the the notion of

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.910 
interesting also the the notion of
showing<00:02:54.810> where<00:02:54.930> friendship<00:02:55.440> came<00:02:55.650> from

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
showing where friendship came from

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.500 
showing where friendship came from
because<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.430> think<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.150> often<00:02:57.300> that

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
because I think that so often that

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.240 
because I think that so often that
shortcutted<00:02:58.110> in<00:02:58.200> movies<00:02:58.470> or<00:02:58.620> in<00:02:58.710> fiction<00:02:59.070> it's

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
shortcutted in movies or in fiction it's

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.700 
shortcutted in movies or in fiction it's
just<00:02:59.430> they<00:02:59.550> were<00:02:59.700> friends<00:03:00.000> because<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.840> it

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
just they were friends because and it

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.350 
just they were friends because and it
really<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.220> see<00:03:02.430> an<00:03:02.550> evolution<00:03:02.670> hearing<00:03:03.270> you

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
really you see an evolution hearing you

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.300 
really you see an evolution hearing you
see<00:03:03.540> all<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.750> rough<00:03:03.960> spots<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.530> define<00:03:05.070> that

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
see all the rough spots that define that

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.820 
see all the rough spots that define that
friendship<00:03:05.790> later<00:03:06.050> yeah<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.350> then<00:03:07.560> and

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
friendship later yeah and then and

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.160 
friendship later yeah and then and
getting<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.550> act<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:10.040> with<00:03:11.040> John<00:03:11.340> Goodman

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
getting to act that with John Goodman

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.150 
getting to act that with John Goodman
