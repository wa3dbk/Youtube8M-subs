Pro<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.600> me<00:00:42.989> also<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.430> think<00:00:44.910> my<00:00:45.120> hair

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
Pro to me also is that I think my hair

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.260 
Pro to me also is that I think my hair
is<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.020> healthiest<00:00:46.739> stage<00:00:47.039> when<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:47.550> text

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
is in a healthiest stage when it's text

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.660 
is in a healthiest stage when it's text
lacks<00:00:48.480> instead<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.170> being<00:00:49.500> relaxed<00:00:49.890> bone

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
lacks instead of being relaxed bone

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.639 
lacks instead of being relaxed bone
straight<00:00:51.120> reason<00:00:51.660> being<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.050> you're<00:00:52.350> not

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
straight reason being is that you're not

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.250 
straight reason being is that you're not
applying<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.730> chemical<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.600> your<00:00:54.750> hair<00:00:55.020> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
applying the chemical to your hair to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.740 
applying the chemical to your hair to
the<00:00:55.350> point<00:00:55.680> where<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.699> destroyed<00:00:57.239> all<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the point where it's destroyed all the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.479 
the point where it's destroyed all the
protein<00:00:58.260> bonds<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.190> you're<00:00:59.370> not

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
protein bonds in your here you're not

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.849 
protein bonds in your here you're not
getting<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.969> here<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.329> bone<00:01:01.079> bone<00:01:01.440> straight

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
getting it here that bone bone straight

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.460 
getting it here that bone bone straight
so<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.129> live<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.399> some<00:01:02.910> texture<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.350> think

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
so you live in some texture so I think

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.289 
so you live in some texture so I think
in<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:04.949> sense<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.610> would<00:01:05.760> tend<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.270> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
in that sense you would tend to have a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.719 
in that sense you would tend to have a
little<00:01:06.540> bit<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:06.960> protein<00:01:07.229> bonds<00:01:07.770> left<00:01:08.520> back

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
little bit more protein bonds left back

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.200 
little bit more protein bonds left back
in<00:01:08.939> your<00:01:09.119> new<00:01:09.360> growth<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.400> those<00:01:11.400> are<00:01:11.640> two<00:01:11.909> main

time that I'll tell you guys to be

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.380 
time that I'll tell you guys to be

mindful of is that your hair will get

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.520 
mindful of is that your hair will get
tangled<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.700> matted<00:01:23.700> very<00:01:24.330> very<00:01:24.720> easily<00:01:25.049> on

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
tangled and matted very very easily on

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.460 
tangled and matted very very easily on
when<00:01:26.220> I'm<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.570> one<00:01:27.750> my<00:01:27.930> hair<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.409> a

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
when I'm on in a one my hair is in a

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.530 
when I'm on in a one my hair is in a
position<00:01:28.650> where<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.159> am<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.520> lot<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.030> exposed

position where I am a lot of exposed

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.830 
position where I am a lot of exposed
probably<00:01:31.079> like<00:01:31.640> eight<00:01:32.640> week<00:01:33.090> school<00:01:33.540> go

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
probably like eight week school go

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.069 
probably like eight week school go
upward<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.560> tend<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.400> find<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.060> my<00:01:36.299> hair<00:01:36.750> gets

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
upward I tend to find that my hair gets

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.090 
upward I tend to find that my hair gets
tangled<00:01:38.040> very<00:01:38.850> easy<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.479> unwashed<00:01:40.049> these

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
tangled very easy and unwashed these

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.249 
tangled very easy and unwashed these
tend<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.430> take<00:01:41.700> me<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> lot<00:01:42.299> longer<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.780> tangle

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
tend to take me a lot longer to tangle

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.890 
tend to take me a lot longer to tangle
my<00:01:43.409> hair<00:01:43.680> before<00:01:44.070> I'm<00:01:44.549> able<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.360> wash<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.810> so
