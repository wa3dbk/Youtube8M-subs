00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:23.970
 the trouble is both to diverge the 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:28.560
 our terminal from the beam but serves 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.050
 also to protect from the teeth of some 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.930
 fish that really can be goiters 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.150
 an example for all the few mouths 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.430
 that look of noble fish high 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.370
 they have really a lot of teeth 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.530
 sharp as well as the looks therefore 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.329
 a bit of shine really 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.500
 safeguard our terminal like 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.050
 even the surf casting when there are 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.960
 crabs that devour our baits the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:05.550
 glazing is definitely the thing 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:08.340
 best to do how to get one 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.660
 perfect shine with just one 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.660
 really content 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.810
 let's take this case even trivial film 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.810
 common iron wire 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.840
 we create from its extremity 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.840
 not semicircle 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.180
 in this way we take 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.119
 of the common nylon thread but could 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.119
 also be traced 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.530
 we put the two garments together 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:02:00.530
 we insert the fore-end and start a 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.530
 brillatura 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.239
 Now 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:31.970
 we will make a shine using 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.970
 directly our love 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.560
 we will pray the hook with a critical knot it is 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.560
 doubled 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.180
 we will take care not to cut the excess 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.180
 which remains 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.170
 insert 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.070
 show estimate 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.070
 we keep the two heads 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.989
 and simply running it in a way 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.989
 simple 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.730
 must die
