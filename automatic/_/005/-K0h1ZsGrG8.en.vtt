00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
my own personal use I am incredibly

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.790 
my own personal use I am incredibly
fussy<00:00:16.450> just<00:00:16.779> like<00:00:16.900> everyone<00:00:17.230> else<00:00:17.380> I've<00:00:17.619> got<00:00:17.650> a

fussy just like everyone else I've got a
lifestyle<00:00:18.520> and<00:00:18.760> a<00:00:18.820> budget<00:00:19.240> that<00:00:19.360> I<00:00:19.420> have<00:00:19.510> to

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
lifestyle and a budget that I have to

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.320 
lifestyle and a budget that I have to
stick<00:00:20.170> to<00:00:20.380> so<00:00:21.070> when<00:00:21.220> Ford<00:00:21.490> asked<00:00:21.850> me<00:00:21.970> to<00:00:22.090> tell

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
stick to so when Ford asked me to tell

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.680 
stick to so when Ford asked me to tell
them

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.690 
them

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.769 
them
what<00:00:22.930> I<00:00:23.050> thought<00:00:23.440> of<00:00:23.680> the<00:00:24.010> Ford<00:00:24.430> Focus<00:00:24.730> c-max<00:00:25.480> I

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
what I thought of the Ford Focus c-max I

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.510 
what I thought of the Ford Focus c-max I
decided<00:00:26.350> the<00:00:26.529> best<00:00:26.619> way<00:00:26.740> to<00:00:26.860> do<00:00:27.100> that<00:00:27.250> was<00:00:27.490> to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
decided the best way to do that was to

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.939 
decided the best way to do that was to
spend<00:00:27.940> a<00:00:28.029> day<00:00:28.240> with<00:00:28.270> one<00:00:28.660> so<00:00:29.080> tomorrow<00:00:29.529> we're

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
spend a day with one so tomorrow we're

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:37.049 
spend a day with one so tomorrow we're
going<00:00:30.070> to<00:00:30.160> find<00:00:30.430> out<00:00:30.640> how<00:00:31.240> it<00:00:31.390> performs<00:00:36.059> first

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
going to find out how it performs first

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.240 
going to find out how it performs first
test<00:00:37.420> for<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:37.840> c-max<00:00:38.200> is<00:00:38.470> getting<00:00:39.070> the

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
test for the c-max is getting the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.729 
test for the c-max is getting the
children<00:00:39.520> to<00:00:39.760> school<00:00:39.910> some<00:00:40.870> mornings<00:00:41.320> it<00:00:41.500> can

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
children to school some mornings it can

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.440 
children to school some mornings it can
be<00:00:41.890> like<00:00:42.100> herding<00:00:42.489> cats

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
be like herding cats

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.410 
be like herding cats
so<00:00:43.660> it's<00:00:43.930> important<00:00:44.559> that<00:00:44.590> when<00:00:44.890> they<00:00:45.070> are

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
so it's important that when they are

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.840 
so it's important that when they are
eventually<00:00:46.420> ready<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:47.440> car<00:00:47.680> is<00:00:47.829> -<00:00:48.100> I<00:00:48.340> wonder

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
eventually ready the car is - I wonder

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.920 
eventually ready the car is - I wonder
what<00:00:48.969> they'll<00:00:49.120> make<00:00:49.360> of<00:00:49.540> it

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.510 

you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.080> see<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.530> mmm

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
you can see it mmm

been on my wish list of cars as I'm sure

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.589 
been on my wish list of cars as I'm sure
it<00:07:45.710> hasn't<00:07:45.919> been<00:07:46.219> for<00:07:46.550> a<00:07:46.580> lot<00:07:46.819> of<00:07:46.849> people<00:07:47.360> but

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 
it hasn't been for a lot of people but

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:50.439 
it hasn't been for a lot of people but
having<00:07:48.020> lived<00:07:48.349> with<00:07:48.560> it<00:07:48.680> for<00:07:48.710> 24<00:07:49.460> hours<00:07:49.789> I<00:07:49.940> have

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:50.449 
having lived with it for 24 hours I have

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:53.260 
having lived with it for 24 hours I have
completely<00:07:50.990> changed<00:07:51.110> my<00:07:51.500> mind<00:07:51.710> the<00:07:52.580> c-max<00:07:52.969> has

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:53.270 
completely changed my mind the c-max has

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.019 
completely changed my mind the c-max has
plenty<00:07:53.779> of<00:07:53.810> space<00:07:54.110> it<00:07:54.770> really<00:07:55.279> does<00:07:55.580> Drive

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:56.029 
plenty of space it really does Drive

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:58.629 
plenty of space it really does Drive
very<00:07:56.659> well<00:07:57.020> and<00:07:57.289> it<00:07:57.560> has<00:07:57.680> a<00:07:57.949> reasonable<00:07:58.400> price

00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 
very well and it has a reasonable price

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:01.269 
very well and it has a reasonable price
tag<00:07:58.969> but<00:07:59.240> perhaps<00:07:59.479> the<00:07:59.960> most<00:08:00.219> important<00:08:01.219> thing

00:08:01.269 --> 00:08:01.279 
tag but perhaps the most important thing

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:03.369 
tag but perhaps the most important thing
of<00:08:01.520> all<00:08:01.669> is<00:08:01.879> that<00:08:02.270> it<00:08:02.509> fits<00:08:02.750> in<00:08:02.930> with<00:08:03.080> my

00:08:03.369 --> 00:08:03.379 
of all is that it fits in with my

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:06.309 
of all is that it fits in with my
lifestyle<00:08:03.949> and<00:08:04.099> my<00:08:04.180> family<00:08:05.180> so<00:08:05.629> well<00:08:05.990> and<00:08:06.289> that

00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 
lifestyle and my family so well and that

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.100 
lifestyle and my family so well and that
has<00:08:06.949> to<00:08:07.159> be<00:08:07.190> the<00:08:07.430> most<00:08:07.759> important<00:08:08.750> thing<00:08:08.930> when

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:09.110 
has to be the most important thing when

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:13.000 
has to be the most important thing when
you're<00:08:09.199> considering<00:08:09.740> buying<00:08:09.949> any<00:08:10.340> new<00:08:10.520> car
