with his reputation guy you've heard

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.929 
with his reputation guy you've heard
about<00:03:00.769> that<00:03:01.099> carries<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.549> heads<00:03:01.730> off<00:03:01.909> of

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
about that carries the heads off of

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.929 
about that carries the heads off of
people<00:03:02.389> it<00:03:02.930> wasn't<00:03:03.290> fun<00:03:04.010> do<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.519> know<00:03:04.639> to<00:03:04.700> tell

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
people it wasn't fun do you know to tell

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.819 
people it wasn't fun do you know to tell
him<00:03:05.120> that<00:03:05.299> so<00:03:05.540> they<00:03:05.689> flipped<00:03:05.989> it<00:03:06.170> on<00:03:06.319> and<00:03:06.739> it

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
him that so they flipped it on and it

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.819 
him that so they flipped it on and it
was<00:03:06.980> like<00:03:07.069> five<00:03:07.519> big<00:03:07.819> blotches<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.629> I'm<00:03:09.530> like

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
was like five big blotches and I'm like

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.759 
was like five big blotches and I'm like
no<00:03:10.340> what's<00:03:11.269> that<00:03:11.359> and<00:03:11.810> they<00:03:12.079> saw<00:03:12.379> those<00:03:12.590> are

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
no what's that and they saw those are

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.220 
no what's that and they saw those are
blockages<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.879> suppose<00:03:14.299> that<00:03:14.329> flunked<00:03:15.049> I

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
blockages and suppose that flunked I

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.189 
blockages and suppose that flunked I
felt<00:03:15.799> fine<00:03:16.099> but<00:03:16.400> they<00:03:17.060> did<00:03:17.239> an<00:03:17.359> angiogram<00:03:18.019> I

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:18.199 
felt fine but they did an angiogram I

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.809 
felt fine but they did an angiogram I
guess<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.709> then<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:19.040> next<00:03:19.310> day<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.669> was<00:03:19.790> a

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
guess and then the next day it was a

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.470 
guess and then the next day it was a
five<00:03:20.269> way<00:03:20.449> bypass<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.319> so<00:03:22.160> what<00:03:22.879> was<00:03:23.060> baffling

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
five way bypass and so what was baffling

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.390 
five way bypass and so what was baffling
about<00:03:23.810> is<00:03:23.959> that<00:03:24.139> I<00:03:24.230> didn't<00:03:24.440> have<00:03:24.560> any<00:03:24.709> signs

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
about is that I didn't have any signs

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.670 
about is that I didn't have any signs
