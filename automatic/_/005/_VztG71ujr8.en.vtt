00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
model so refer I do continue on I will

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.470 
model so refer I do continue on I will
do<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.200> usual<00:00:23.410> routine<00:00:24.040> and<00:00:24.280> if<00:00:24.670> to<00:00:25.390> the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
do the usual routine and if to the

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.240 
do the usual routine and if to the
people<00:00:25.810> you<00:00:25.840> do<00:00:26.080> not<00:00:26.110> you<00:00:26.530> do<00:00:26.710> not<00:00:26.740> know<00:00:27.130> what

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
people you do not you do not know what

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.490 
people you do not you do not know what
this<00:00:27.430> is<00:00:27.700> it's<00:00:28.390> basically<00:00:28.510> where<00:00:28.960> I<00:00:29.020> compare

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
this is it's basically where I compare

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.519 
this is it's basically where I compare
the<00:00:29.740> shutdown<00:00:30.400> bhutto<00:00:30.880> and<00:00:31.150> even<00:00:32.050> how<00:00:32.169> long<00:00:32.230> it

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
the shutdown bhutto and even how long it

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.040 
the shutdown bhutto and even how long it
takes<00:00:32.739> to<00:00:32.800> render<00:00:33.190> a<00:00:33.219> video<00:00:33.629> for<00:00:34.629> both<00:00:34.899> these

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
takes to render a video for both these

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.310 
takes to render a video for both these
computers<00:00:35.620> now<00:00:36.190> ones<00:00:36.940> running<00:00:37.420> leopard<00:00:37.899> and

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
computers now ones running leopard and

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.979 
computers now ones running leopard and
another<00:00:38.710> is<00:00:39.010> running<00:00:39.700> vista<00:00:40.239> so<00:00:40.870> i'll

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
another is running vista so i'll

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.130 
another is running vista so i'll
probably<00:00:41.200> not<00:00:41.530> be<00:00:41.590> using<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.160> same<00:00:42.400> exact

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
probably not be using the same exact

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.900 
probably not be using the same exact
program<00:00:44.140> to<00:00:44.440> render<00:00:44.739> these<00:00:44.890> videos<00:00:45.250> so

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
program to render these videos so

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.240 
program to render these videos so
therefore<00:00:46.360> i'll<00:00:46.420> probably<00:00:46.660> use<00:00:47.010> imovie<00:00:48.010> for

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
therefore i'll probably use imovie for

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.630 
therefore i'll probably use imovie for
my<00:00:49.060> macbook<00:00:49.480> pro<00:00:49.750> and<00:00:50.079> for<00:00:50.380> my<00:00:50.470> laptop<00:00:50.710> Adele

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
my macbook pro and for my laptop Adele

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.830 
my macbook pro and for my laptop Adele
most<00:00:52.120> likely<00:00:52.420> you<00:00:52.570> sony<00:00:52.840> vegas<00:00:53.290> and<00:00:54.840> well

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
most likely you sony vegas and well

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
most likely you sony vegas and well
let's<00:00:56.290> continue<00:00:57.660> ok<00:00:58.660> so<00:00:58.719> both<00:00:59.079> computers<00:00:59.500> are

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
let's continue ok so both computers are

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.510 
let's continue ok so both computers are
off<00:01:00.130> as<00:01:00.460> my<00:01:01.350> env3<00:01:02.350> i'm<00:01:02.860> going<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.160> have<00:01:03.280> it<00:01:03.399> as<00:01:03.489> a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
off as my env3 i'm going to have it as a

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.330 
off as my env3 i'm going to have it as a
stopwatch<00:01:03.880> so<00:01:04.809> I'm<00:01:04.869> just<00:01:05.079> kind<00:01:05.229> of<00:01:05.350> get<00:01:06.130> down

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
stopwatch so I'm just kind of get down

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:16.620 
stopwatch so I'm just kind of get down
here<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:09.329> add<00:01:10.329> my<00:01:10.719> thumb<00:01:11.049> on<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:14.969> three<00:01:15.969> two

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
here and add my thumb on this three two

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:27.790 
here and add my thumb on this three two
one<00:01:17.159> go

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.990 

it<00:01:27.950> is<00:01:28.550> 10<00:01:28.940> seconds<00:01:29.510> and<00:01:30.580> got<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.700> apple<00:01:31.970> logo

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
it is 10 seconds and got the apple logo

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.020 
it is 10 seconds and got the apple logo
on<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.840> macbook<00:01:33.110> pro<00:01:33.560> liddell<00:01:34.550> we<00:01:34.790> have<00:01:34.880> it's

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
on the macbook pro liddell we have it's

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:43.980 
on the macbook pro liddell we have it's
loading<00:01:35.510> microsoft<00:01:36.470> corporation

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.990 

and<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:46.040> mac<00:01:46.220> pro<00:01:46.520> booted<00:01:46.970> up<00:01:47.120> in<00:01:48.580> 30<00:01:49.580> seconds

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
and the mac pro booted up in 30 seconds

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.960 
and the mac pro booted up in 30 seconds
after<00:01:50.930> 27<00:01:51.500> 27<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.970> now<00:01:53.570> we<00:01:53.660> have<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.970> dell

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
after 27 27 and now we have the dell

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:04.420 
after 27 27 and now we have the dell
booting<00:01:56.450> up<00:01:56.510> right<00:01:56.720> now<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:02.390> there<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.430> it

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
booting up right now and there and it

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.469 
booting up right now and there and it
booted<00:02:04.820> up<00:02:05.030> in<00:02:05.590> 44<00:02:06.590> seconds<00:02:06.980> so<00:02:07.730> i<00:02:08.090> think<00:02:08.149> we

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
booted up in 44 seconds so i think we

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.220 
booted up in 44 seconds so i think we
can<00:02:08.570> clearly<00:02:08.780> say<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.710> macbook<00:02:10.070> pro<00:02:10.100> is

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
can clearly say that the macbook pro is

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.030 
can clearly say that the macbook pro is
almost<00:02:12.230> two<00:02:12.590> times<00:02:12.770> faster<00:02:13.370> than<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.580> dell

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
almost two times faster than the dell

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.330 
almost two times faster than the dell
when<00:02:16.040> it's<00:02:16.250> actually<00:02:16.460> a<00:02:16.700> booting<00:02:17.570> up<00:02:17.690> now

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
when it's actually a booting up now

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.780 
when it's actually a booting up now
we're<00:02:19.340> going<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.580> actually<00:02:19.900> shut<00:02:20.900> them<00:02:21.080> off

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
we're going to actually shut them off

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.240 
we're going to actually shut them off
now<00:02:22.790> absolutely<00:02:23.390> go<00:02:23.540> here<00:02:23.930> here<00:02:24.820> start

now absolutely go here here start

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.070 
now absolutely go here here start

it<00:03:10.810> drink<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.079> macbook<00:03:11.470> pro<00:03:11.500> two<00:03:11.980> seconds<00:03:12.519> so

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
it drink the macbook pro two seconds so

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.259 
it drink the macbook pro two seconds so
again<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.560> think<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:15.549> macbook<00:03:15.909> pro<00:03:16.150> is

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
again I think the macbook pro is

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.509 
again I think the macbook pro is
definitely<00:03:16.690> faster<00:03:16.900> than<00:03:17.379> the<00:03:17.620> laptop<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:18.250> far

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
definitely faster than the laptop so far

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.300 
definitely faster than the laptop so far
a<00:03:18.730> dell<00:03:19.150> laptop<00:03:19.230> but<00:03:20.230> then<00:03:20.409> again<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.950> macbook

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
a dell laptop but then again the macbook

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.699 
a dell laptop but then again the macbook
pros<00:03:21.549> at<00:03:21.730> two<00:03:21.849> points<00:03:22.030> 66<00:03:22.659> gigahertz<00:03:22.989> Intel<00:03:23.560> to

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
pros at two points 66 gigahertz Intel to

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.399 
pros at two points 66 gigahertz Intel to
Joe<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.760> laptop<00:03:25.180> has<00:03:25.329> a<00:03:25.359> 2.0<00:03:26.139> gigahertz

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
Joe and the laptop has a 2.0 gigahertz

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.119 
Joe and the laptop has a 2.0 gigahertz
so<00:03:27.280> there<00:03:27.489> is<00:03:27.579> a<00:03:27.609> big<00:03:27.819> difference<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:29.799> here<00:03:30.069> I

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
so there is a big difference so here I

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.589 
so there is a big difference so here I
am<00:03:30.280> with<00:03:31.470> my<00:03:32.470> two<00:03:32.530> computers<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.489> I'm<00:03:34.359> back<00:03:34.569> to

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
am with my two computers and I'm back to

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.009 
am with my two computers and I'm back to
render<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.230> same<00:03:35.849> same<00:03:36.849> image<00:03:37.180> it's<00:03:37.870> actually

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
render the same same image it's actually

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.530 
render the same same image it's actually
a<00:03:38.260> picture<00:03:38.560> of<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.680> tree<00:03:39.010> on<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.480> I'm<00:03:40.480> a

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
a picture of a tree on that I'm a

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.740 
a picture of a tree on that I'm a
macbook<00:03:40.930> pro<00:03:41.139> and<00:03:41.470> same<00:03:42.250> thing<00:03:42.280> on<00:03:42.790> my<00:03:43.450> laptop

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
macbook pro and same thing on my laptop

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.470 
macbook pro and same thing on my laptop
and<00:03:44.230> here's<00:03:44.769> kind<00:03:44.950> of<00:03:45.069> hit<00:03:47.519> move<00:03:48.519> it<00:03:48.699> yeah

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
and here's kind of hit move it yeah

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.189 
and here's kind of hit move it yeah
there<00:03:49.660> we<00:03:49.720> go<00:03:49.769> then<00:03:50.769> these<00:03:51.549> are<00:03:51.760> both<00:03:52.199> 141

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
there we go then these are both 141

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:57.750 
there we go then these are both 141
kilobytes<00:03:53.650> so<00:03:54.400> let's<00:03:54.879> go<00:03:55.060> save<00:03:56.250> save<00:03:57.250> over

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
kilobytes so let's go save save over

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.699 
kilobytes so let's go save save over
here<00:03:58.799> and<00:04:00.239> say<00:04:01.500> here<00:04:02.519> three<00:04:03.519> two<00:04:03.819> one<00:04:03.849> go<00:04:04.709> that

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
here and say here three two one go that

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.119 
here and say here three two one go that
started<00:04:06.569> and<00:04:07.569> i<00:04:08.139> will<00:04:08.290> come<00:04:08.530> back<00:04:08.709> and<00:04:08.980> tell

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
you how long it actually took to render

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.539 
you how long it actually took to render
this<00:04:13.060> video<00:04:13.419> there<00:04:14.019> they<00:04:14.530> are<00:04:14.769> rendering<00:04:15.340> in

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
this video there they are rendering in

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.750 
this video there they are rendering in
720p<00:04:16.979> 720p<00:04:18.359> 6fps<00:04:19.680> so<00:04:20.680> i<00:04:21.099> will<00:04:21.280> come<00:04:21.430> back<00:04:21.549> and

and<00:04:24.900> for<00:04:25.919> for<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:26.949> macbook<00:04:27.220> pro<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.669> render

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
and for for the macbook pro to render

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.810 
and for for the macbook pro to render
that<00:04:28.150> image<00:04:28.570> tenement<00:04:29.409> image<00:04:29.710> it<00:04:30.099> took<00:04:30.490> them

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
that image tenement image it took them

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.290 
that image tenement image it took them
around<00:04:31.210> I<00:04:31.930> believe<00:04:32.500> 12<00:04:32.830> minutes<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.370> from<00:04:34.210> my

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
around I believe 12 minutes and from my

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.560 
around I believe 12 minutes and from my
laptop<00:04:34.510> it<00:04:34.930> took<00:04:35.139> around<00:04:35.289> 20<00:04:36.159> minutes<00:04:36.570> 19

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
laptop it took around 20 minutes 19

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.570 
laptop it took around 20 minutes 19
minutes<00:04:37.780> so<00:04:38.409> there's<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.770> difference<00:04:39.430> over

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
minutes so there's a difference over

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.990 
minutes so there's a difference over
there<00:04:39.820> a<00:04:40.090> little<00:04:40.870> humor<00:04:41.380> difference<00:04:41.800> so<00:04:42.340> again

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
there a little humor difference so again

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.879 
there a little humor difference so again
if<00:04:43.270> you<00:04:43.570> if<00:04:43.960> you're<00:04:44.050> looking<00:04:44.289> for<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:44.470> faster

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
if you if you're looking for a faster

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.670 
if you if you're looking for a faster
machine<00:04:45.250> and<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:46.750> would<00:04:47.139> definitely<00:04:47.320> suggest

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
machine and I would definitely suggest

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.370 
machine and I would definitely suggest
the<00:04:47.979> macbook<00:04:48.310> pro<00:04:48.340> i<00:04:48.520> would<00:04:48.789> actually<00:04:49.380> overall

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
the macbook pro i would actually overall

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.640 
the macbook pro i would actually overall
suggest<00:04:51.039> the<00:04:51.130> macbook<00:04:51.460> pro<00:04:52.050> because<00:04:53.050> it<00:04:53.349> has<00:04:53.620> a

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
suggest the macbook pro because it has a

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.010 
suggest the macbook pro because it has a
good<00:04:53.979> spec<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.669> even<00:04:54.940> if<00:04:55.090> it<00:04:55.240> runs<00:04:55.539> leopard

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
good spec and even if it runs leopard

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.300 
good spec and even if it runs leopard
does<00:04:56.320> not<00:04:56.500> make<00:04:56.710> much<00:04:56.950> of<00:04:57.010> it

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
does not make much of it

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.160 
does not make much of it
difference<00:04:57.610> really<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.420> same<00:04:58.630> thing<00:04:58.660> but

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
difference really the same thing but

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.200 
difference really the same thing but
just<00:04:59.830> a<00:04:59.890> different<00:05:00.190> operating<00:05:00.460> system<00:05:00.580> and

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
just a different operating system and

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.580 
just a different operating system and
now<00:05:02.080> here<00:05:02.800> we<00:05:02.890> go<00:05:02.920> for<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.280> last<00:05:03.550> I<00:05:04.260> last<00:05:05.260> test

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
now here we go for the last I last test

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.950 
now here we go for the last I last test
let's<00:05:05.800> just<00:05:05.950> say<00:05:06.100> I'm<00:05:07.000> gonna<00:05:07.180> go<00:05:07.300> exit<00:05:07.780> that

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
let's just say I'm gonna go exit that

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.260 
let's just say I'm gonna go exit that
out<00:05:08.170> here<00:05:09.990> okay<00:05:11.100> exit<00:05:12.100> it<00:05:12.250> out<00:05:12.370> now<00:05:13.210> the

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
out here okay exit it out now the
