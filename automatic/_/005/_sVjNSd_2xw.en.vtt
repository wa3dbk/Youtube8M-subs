 shooter new generation in pfr and 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.070
 Warframe is very colorful exciting 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.870
 a game 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.030
 it combines various elements 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.500
 Parkour and acrobatics can be done 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.420
 all sorts of tricks flips jumping 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.400

 run around the walls go down under the thick 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.360
 many other interesting and beautiful 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.970
 tricks and even combinations many of 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.900
 which do not immediately come to mind 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.239
 starting the game you get assault 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.100
 rifle gun and sword that go 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.690
 games you will pump and improve to 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.180
 As long as will not allow himself 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.920
 replace them with better weapons in 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.960
 the game you can craft yourself a weapon from 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.059
 the simplest to the rarest 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.310
 for this you need to buy or 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.890
 knock out the necessary drawings and mine 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.600
 various resources on missions even into the game 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.729
 and you can invest real money to buy 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.890

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.690
 no imbalance since all the best stuff 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.090
 You can not only buy for real but also 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.190
 do it yourself without investing in 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.810
 game not a drop of money in the course of the game you 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.400
 will find getting beat out 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.470
 a variety of combat skills cards and 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.540
 various improvements some of them 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.670
 ordinary useless but some extremely 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.590
 rare and needed and which ones and how 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.780
 use to be solved only by you 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.430
 you choose your style of play 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.360
 weapons with which you will be neat 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.909
 neutralize enemies 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.740
 either turn them into meat you can 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.659
 cut the enemy in half or cut him down 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.880
 one or more limbs can 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.830
 contemplating a copious spray of blood which 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.370
 unfortunately it is so rare to meet 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.140
 lie 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.480
 online games well, in general, lovers 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.460
 dismemberment here will surely enjoy 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.130
 the brutality of the game is impressive 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.630
 the brutality of the grafon of this game right away 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.520
 recalled not the last crisis 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.170
 which is definitely me very strong 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.060
 pleased and repeatedly strengthened 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.590
 the impression of the game while warframe 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.000
 you can play almost any 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.190
 computer as in the video settings 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.590
 you can enable or disable any of 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.140
 multiple effects smoothing waiting 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.360
 reflection dynamic lighting nvidia 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.770
 physics and much more in lauch itself 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.810
 or even before starting the game you can 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.700
 enable or disable gives support 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.180
 x11 and enable and disable 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.650
 support for 64-bit systems right away 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.450
 after starting the game you automatically 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.970
 start a short teaching mission 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.280
 get stuck on it i won't go through it 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.200
 not difficult though the game has a mass 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.270
 various opportunities to master 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.430
 the whole model is unlikely to work out right away 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.680
 controls are very comfortable and thoughtful 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.380
 so getting started in the game will be easy 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.320
 the game itself is divided into a huge set 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.390
 knead the first level to 40 and above 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.790
 and gradually you are with your friends or with 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.350
 random players or if you want to 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.360
 alone you will be pumped and 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.310
 open access to new missions myself 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.140
 far not all has seen and not all 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.810
 they know to but let it stay for 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.730
 surprise us for the near future can 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.290
 just to say that besides the usual missions 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.550
 the game periodically appear unique 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.400
 bonus missions 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.200
 who give you special prizes though 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.350
 initial missions are quite similar to each other 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.150
 friend that by the way does not make them less 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.709
 exciting and spectacular later missions 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.940
 start to differ from each other in 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.560
 first missions you will need 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.570
 sweep through the corridor my compartments 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.120
 huge space ship exterminating 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.280
 on their way the enemy soldiers but soon 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.930
 you will understand that this is just warming up and 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.730
 have mrs m preparing you for more 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.920
 challenging missions your future 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.720
 tasks will be the destruction of different 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.090
 bosses with different opinions and 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.040
 battle tactics the release of hostages and 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.290
 on the contrary, capture and unusual capture 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.910
 enemies and many other mission cards on 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.739
 there are different mission cards 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.810
 closed type such as space 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.239
 various ships and forts and buildings 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.830
 also open where you can 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.630
 observe the beautiful scenery and 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.519
 fight the hordes of enemies open 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.019
 the sky is quite often closed 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.790
 the space is perfectly aligned with 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.560
 natural expanses and when after 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.299
 hard meat in narrow corridors you 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.100
 finally leaving the enemy base 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.390
 literally feel like lungs 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.730
 filled with oxygen 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.320
 locations themselves whether they are open or 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.900
 closed worked to the smallest 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.340
 details of which details depends 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.100
 only on the capabilities of your computer 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.530
 find fault with just no point everything is beautiful 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.420
 colorful this world seems to be living its 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.400
 life and these are just the little initial ones 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.310
 levels on the first planets what then 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.570
 will be on the main missions 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.160
 not specifically telling himself not particularly 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.670
 delving into this information so as not to spoil 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.080
 you and yourself a future impression of the game 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.050
 of the minuses is of course the absence 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.510
 mass pvp but somehow sure that 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.580
 it's a matter of time because the game came out less 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.380
 six months ago, by the way, as far as I am 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.510
 know in later stages of our 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.330
 development duel will be available to us one 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.100
 On one and if already there is regime 11 means 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.590
 and larger battles are around the corner 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.420
 the more mechanics of the game are clearly sharpened 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.490
 just under this based on reviews 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.160
 developers are always adding to the game 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.540
 innovation all goodies yes I myself for 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.280
 these two days have been great 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.930
 playing time had noticed that 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.330
 developers are very active 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.220
 developing collaborate with players so 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.170
 how several times flashed the message 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.430
 invitation to video online conference 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.330
 developers with everyone 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.850
 gamers 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.470
 I really unfortunately I missed 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.180
 was very absorbed in the game and this 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.840
 the invitation went out completely from me 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.340
 from the head 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.200
 One of the features and for someone 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.880
 a possible disadvantage is the restriction 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.370
 number of times full per day 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.260
 if you are killed more than four times a day 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.300
 until next day you have to play 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.639
 very neatly since i died for you 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.190
 will have to start the mission again with 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.200
 so if you play team and you are smart 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.270
 You could learn more about this restriction. 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.669
 pretty soon not even if 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.680
 enemies will destroy your shield and inflict on you 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.240
 mortal damage to your fellow mates 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.100
 the team will have enough time to 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.230
 heal your wounds and put you on 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.300
 legs before you die 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.340
 in general, friends download the game 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.280
 add me as my gaming friend 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.940
 nobody there zap and maybe though 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.400
 for sure 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.290
 I will be very glad we will do 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.700
 joint lectures link to 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.310
 registration and download in app free 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.500
 is under the video register 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.360
 don't waste time waiting for you right now 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.250
 yourself in friends for now thanks for 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.849
 attention with you was tony and up to new 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.849
 meetings yet
