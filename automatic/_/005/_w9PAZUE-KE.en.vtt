00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello people with you oleg down the hall now 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.810
 all media are trumpeting about developing new 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.849
 playstation 5 sony computer console 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.710
 entertainment posted a list of jobs 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.139
 on their resources and they need 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.089
 programmer chief programmer coming 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.109
 when it's probably not soon new consoles 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.340
 she's here and 3 soon 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.900
 obviously that if playstation 5 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.359
 announces it will be definitely not in 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.490
 the nearest one was not searched and not on this e3 but 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.529
 the fact of such an early development of a new 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.300
 console on one side and delight with 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.369
 the other grieves a little 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.550
 conclusions that can be drawn from all 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.890
 this is what sony is about 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.960
 serious about their products and fit in 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.050
 this time oh how same in advance the same time 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.370
 scary they have shortened their lifespan 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.110
 current generation 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.239
 we can now observe such 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.219
 the trend is that with each generation the term 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.949
 the life of this generation itself decreases 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.110
 DPS has two lived very long passage 3 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.850
 less the worst thing here is 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.660
 too short a time between 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.870
 by generations 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.969
 there is no need to wait 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.220
 watch watch only time 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.530
 will show maybe so serious 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.200
 The early approach seems to hint at all 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.710
 on a revolutionary further generation 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.470
 now the ps4 competitor has no xbox one on 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.420
 order is worse in many aspects and i 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.610
 I say this as the owner is not necessary there 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.299
 shout out a comment though you can shout 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.299
 don't give a damn 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.460
 however, e3 at from and T-shirts and can something 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.400
 show may be some games also 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.340
 there were rumors of clear console versions 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.320
 the current generation that sounds quite 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.329
 realistic and adequate however those 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.400
 the vacancy I spoke above to this 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.329
 Well, no, and include as it says 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.110
 about the new project about the new console and 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.840
 people 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.390
 For this new console , I can take pictures 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.399
 say that Huang Huang can safely 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.930
 chop off for it's damn healthy 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.930
 brick that can kill 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.000
 case of a fall on the skull but after 4 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.310
 it would be interesting to cut nowhere 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.310
 see the slim version of how they contrive 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.399
 or redo it also goes the rumor about 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.439
 eradicating drive for drive but know 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.600
 it's all very doubtful especially on 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.310
 ps4 slim this definitely will not be well 100 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.180
 percent can only be on playstation 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.310
 5 possible but again questionable sony 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.100
 work on everyone up to very big 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.930
 consumer buyer and i'm not sure what 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.560
 in five years the whole world will be right 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.660
 ready to give up drives in principle he and 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.570
 can now exist without disks on 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.970
 jester current gaming circle but take 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.900
 a situation when a person drives for example 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.850
 around the world from the console there are bags and does not have 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.620
 some fast internet always accurate 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.570
 constantly moving there are such people this 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.030
 one hundred percent there are people like this one hundred 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.030
 percent so he downloaded somewhere in there 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.000
 way 30 40 GB yes of course does 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.220
 There are certainly many such people, but to the rescue 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.200
 always come shops with physical 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.420
 carriers in any country at any point 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.460
 the world you can go buy a dice i 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.890
 I think it is very important despite 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.030
 the fact that we are mostly who 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.790
 watching this video now 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.370
 who plays games this problem well not 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.650
 we feel and we are on the side of the disc does not drive 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.870
 exist then down does not exist we all 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.870
 swing I myself bought all a couple of disks on 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.760
 ps4 bought everything else in the digital number 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.010
 it seems to me not ready for this yet 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.960
 coup in rejection of drives when 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.000
 will be ready then drives probably also 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.140
 will sell but exclusively 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.440
 collectibles 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:33.460
 with figures with posters undershirts therefore 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.020
 fps 5 vangyu will drive maybe he 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.360
 will be as a separate stray 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.120
 and the console itself will be sold without 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.980
 drive that is the basis and accordingly 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.690
 it will cost less and who is there 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.430
 travels drive and you are important to whom 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.150
 descried not buy drive separately 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.630
 this is possible just to 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.940
 save space 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.570
 This option is reasonable but it is quite 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.570
 other story 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.270
 Take a look at the game channel z play games 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.300
 the author makes passing and various games 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.060
 also makes the most epic cut of 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.770
 killing battlefield channel link 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.770
 is in the video description
