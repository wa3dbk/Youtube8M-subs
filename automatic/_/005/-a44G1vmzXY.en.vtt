guy down you'll notice as usual I took

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.200 
guy down you'll notice as usual I took
note<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> ballistas<00:00:26.640> reload<00:00:27.000> time

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
note of the ballistas reload time

capacity<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.420> damage<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.199> let's<00:00:31.470> begin

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
capacity and damage so let's begin

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.040 
capacity and damage so let's begin
starting<00:00:32.640> with<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> reload<00:00:33.480> time<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
starting with the reload time of the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.569 
starting with the reload time of the
ballista<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> ballista<00:00:34.980> will<00:00:35.160> reload<00:00:35.430> in

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
ballista the ballista will reload in

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.250 
ballista the ballista will reload in
about<00:00:35.760> three<00:00:36.000> seconds<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.750> isn't<00:00:37.170> too

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
about three seconds and this isn't too

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.990 
about three seconds and this isn't too
bad<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:37.800> about<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> three<00:00:38.280> second<00:00:38.610> reload<00:00:38.879> you

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
bad with about a three second reload you

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.369 
bad with about a three second reload you
can<00:00:39.180> buy<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.540> fine<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.899> won't<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.200> too

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
can buy just fine you won't have too

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.200 
can buy just fine you won't have too
many<00:00:40.530> issues<00:00:40.950> reloading<00:00:41.460> although<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.180> course

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
many issues reloading although of course

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.360 
many issues reloading although of course
as<00:00:42.600> usual<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.440> cut<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.800> number<00:00:44.040> down<00:00:44.160> by

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
as usual you can cut this number down by

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.830 
as usual you can cut this number down by
buying<00:00:44.670> sleight<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.059> hand<00:00:45.329> although<00:00:45.510> I

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
buying sleight of hand although I

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.540 
buying sleight of hand although I
wouldn't<00:00:46.350> recommend<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.829> as<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.129> didn't<00:00:47.399> just

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
wouldn't recommend it as you didn't just

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.040 
wouldn't recommend it as you didn't just
get<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.059> get<00:00:48.210> by<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.360> fine<00:00:48.600> without<00:00:48.840> it

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
get you can get by just fine without it

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.779 
get you can get by just fine without it
and<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.379> course<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.860> always<00:00:49.980> tap<00:00:50.340> why<00:00:50.579> why

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and of course you can always tap why why

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.430 
and of course you can always tap why why
during<00:00:51.059> your<00:00:51.270> reload<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.629> actually<00:00:51.989> speed<00:00:52.320> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
during your reload to actually speed it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.720 
during your reload to actually speed it
up<00:00:52.500> without<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.949> need<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.100> sleight<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.430> hand

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
up without the need of sleight of hand

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.760 
up without the need of sleight of hand
moving<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.870> your<00:00:55.020> movement<00:00:55.410> speed<00:00:55.440> with

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
moving on to your movement speed with

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.290 
moving on to your movement speed with
the<00:00:55.860> ballista<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> ballista<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.000> hand

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
the ballista with the ballista in hand

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.610 
the ballista with the ballista in hand
you'll<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.570> moving<00:00:57.719> at<00:00:57.960> about<00:00:58.050> ninety<00:00:58.500> five

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you'll be moving at about ninety five

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.260 
you'll be moving at about ninety five
percent<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> base<00:00:59.489> speed<00:00:59.730> just<00:01:00.030> give<00:01:00.180> you

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
percent of the base speed just give you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.939 
percent of the base speed just give you
a<00:01:00.300> little<00:01:00.420> bit<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.660> reference<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> weapon

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
a little bit of reference with a weapon

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.009 
a little bit of reference with a weapon
like<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.399> pistol<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.090> submachine<00:01:03.660> gun<00:01:03.840> or

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
like a pistol a submachine gun or

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.359 
like a pistol a submachine gun or
shotgun<00:01:04.500> you'll<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.739> moving<00:01:04.860> at<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.250> hundred

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
shotgun you'll be moving at one hundred

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.039 
shotgun you'll be moving at one hundred
percent<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> base<00:01:06.210> movement<00:01:06.689> speed<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
percent of the base movement speed and

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.210 
percent of the base movement speed and
I'd<00:01:07.170> say<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.500> five<00:01:07.710> percent<00:01:08.070> difference

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
I'd say this five percent difference

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.130 
I'd say this five percent difference
isn't<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.270> much<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.689> hindering

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
isn't really that much of a hindering

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.500 
isn't really that much of a hindering
effect<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.950> mean<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.790> are<00:01:12.030> gonna<00:01:12.210> run<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> little

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
effect I mean you are gonna run a little

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.090 
effect I mean you are gonna run a little
bit<00:01:12.869> slower<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.320> find<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.890> train

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
bit slower but I find that I can train

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.950 
bit slower but I find that I can train
just<00:01:14.430> fine<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.270> would<00:01:15.479> say<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.810> this

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
just fine and I would say that this

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.570 
just fine and I would say that this
ballista<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.619> not<00:01:16.830> really<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> weapon<00:01:17.490> you

about 130 rounds and this is sort of

about 130 rounds and this is sort of

right in the middle of the pack it's a

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.580 
right in the middle of the pack it's a

little bit higher than the DSR and the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.530 
little bit higher than the DSR and the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.810 
bear it but it's unfortunately lower
than<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> SVU<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:59.189> feels<00:01:59.460> though<00:01:59.610> with<00:01:59.759> a

than the SVU and it feels though with a

than the SVU and it feels though with a
hundred<00:02:00.000> thirty<00:02:00.210> rounds<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> can<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.810> just

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
hundred thirty rounds you can do just

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.870 
hundred thirty rounds you can do just
fine<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.380> remember<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:02.040> wall<00:02:02.520> weapon

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
fine but remember this is a wall weapon

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.249 
fine but remember this is a wall weapon
so<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.360> actually<00:02:03.540> if<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.899> use<00:02:04.079> your

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
so you can actually if you use your

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.319 
so you can actually if you use your
points<00:02:04.500> right<00:02:04.680> virtually<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.670> unlimited

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.190 
ammo and never really run dry so ammo
capacity<00:02:08.879> isn't<00:02:09.539> really<00:02:09.720> too<00:02:09.869> much<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.110> a

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
capacity isn't really too much of a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.960 
capacity isn't really too much of a
problem<00:02:10.319> with<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.860> deal<00:02:11.129> with<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> ballista

will be a one-shot kill after around 25
it<00:02:18.780> will<00:02:18.930> no<00:02:19.080> longer<00:02:19.110> be<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.800> one-shot<00:02:20.130> kill<00:02:20.640> and

this is not too bad of a damaged you

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
gotta remember this is a bolt-action

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.420 
gotta remember this is a bolt-action
sniper<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.960> typically<00:02:25.260> those<00:02:25.620> are<00:02:25.920> expected

sniper and typically those are expected
to<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.700> high<00:02:26.880> damage<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.510> damages<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.470> it

to have high damage in it damages and it

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.340 
to have high damage in it damages and it
will<00:02:28.740> not<00:02:28.890> be<00:02:29.070> as<00:02:29.250> high<00:02:29.490> as<00:02:29.520> able<00:02:29.970> as<00:02:30.090> ed<00:02:30.510> SR<00:02:30.780> but

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
will not be as high as able as ed SR but

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.380 
will not be as high as able as ed SR but
it<00:02:31.470> will<00:02:31.620> still<00:02:31.830> do<00:02:32.130> just<00:02:32.490> fine<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.060> feel<00:02:33.240> so

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
it will still do just fine and I feel so

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.790 
it will still do just fine and I feel so
if<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.600> want<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.810> good<00:02:33.900> sniper<00:02:34.140> rifle<00:02:34.560> that'll

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
if you want a good sniper rifle that'll

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.680 
if you want a good sniper rifle that'll
kill<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> zombie<00:02:35.040> with<00:02:35.460> a<00:02:35.490> good<00:02:35.700> head<00:02:35.880> shot<00:02:35.940> the

kill a zombie with a good head shot the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.270 
kill a zombie with a good head shot the
ballista<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.350> good<00:02:37.680> weapon<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.070> go<00:02:38.220> to

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
ballista is a good weapon to go to

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.980 
ballista is a good weapon to go to
although<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.880> DSR<00:02:39.390> would<00:02:39.510> do<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.630> little<00:02:39.840> bit

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
although the DSR would do a little bit

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.300 
although the DSR would do a little bit
better<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.530> could<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.770> course<00:02:40.800> always

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
increases damage by picking yourself up

increases damage by picking yourself up
double<00:02:43.860> tap<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.550> will<00:02:44.880> double<00:02:45.210> your<00:02:45.240> damage

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
double tap that will double your damage

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.750 
double tap that will double your damage
and<00:02:45.840> probably<00:02:46.200> be<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> one-shot<00:02:46.830> kill<00:02:47.310> into<00:02:47.610> the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
and probably be a one-shot kill into the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.270 
and probably be a one-shot kill into the
early<00:02:48.090> 30s<00:02:48.570> so<00:02:49.200> that's<00:02:49.560> all<00:02:49.710> I<00:02:49.740> have<00:02:49.830> for<00:02:50.010> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
early 30s so that's all I have for the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.040 
early 30s so that's all I have for the
ballista<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.940> overall<00:02:51.420> I'd<00:02:51.630> say<00:02:51.660> it's<00:02:51.960> a

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
ballista in overall I'd say it's a

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.170 
ballista in overall I'd say it's a
mediocre<00:02:52.380> sniper<00:02:52.830> rifle<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.370> find<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:53.940> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
mediocre sniper rifle I find that the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.150 
mediocre sniper rifle I find that the
rate<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.420> fire<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.750> not<00:02:55.320> very<00:02:55.620> fun<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.010> work

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
rate of fire is not very fun to work

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.770 
rate of fire is not very fun to work
with<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.640> feel<00:02:56.850> that<00:02:57.030> well<00:02:57.210> I<00:02:57.240> do<00:02:57.390> have<00:02:57.720> a

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
with and I feel that well I do have a

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.050 
with and I feel that well I do have a
great<00:02:57.990> supply<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.620> ammo<00:02:58.980> it's<00:02:59.520> not<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.820> great

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
great supply of ammo it's not that great

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.610 
great supply of ammo it's not that great
and<00:03:00.450> especially<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.020> later<00:03:01.230> rounds<00:03:01.320> I

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
and especially in the later rounds I

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.110 
and especially in the later rounds I
find<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:01.980> have<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.130> hard<00:03:02.370> time<00:03:02.550> killing<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
find that I have a hard time killing the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.790 
find that I have a hard time killing the
hordes<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.510> zombies<00:03:03.570> even<00:03:04.230> with<00:03:04.380> such<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> high

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
hordes of zombies even with such a high

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.440 
hordes of zombies even with such a high
damage<00:03:05.070> because<00:03:05.430> I'm<00:03:05.520> killing<00:03:05.790> him<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.090> slowly

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
damage because I'm killing him so slowly

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.050 
damage because I'm killing him so slowly
