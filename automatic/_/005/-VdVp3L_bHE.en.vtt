the board and get the rotation but they

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.090 
the board and get the rotation but they
don't<00:01:42.369> try<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:42.610> land<00:01:42.910> on<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.300> board<00:01:44.100> another

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
don't try to land on the board another

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.590 
don't try to land on the board another
big<00:01:45.310> issue<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.789> people<00:01:46.149> like<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.390> put<00:01:46.539> their

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
flipped and spun the board perfectly if

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.950 
flipped and spun the board perfectly if
you<00:01:51.340> just<00:01:51.520> let<00:01:51.729> your<00:01:51.850> feet<00:01:52.090> dangle<00:01:52.539> in<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.780> air

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960

you just let your feet dangle in the air
and<00:01:53.259> wait<00:01:53.649> for<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.920> grip<00:01:54.100> tape<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.430> come

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
and wait for the grip tape to come

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.520 
and wait for the grip tape to come
around<00:01:54.759> and<00:01:55.060> stop<00:01:55.330> down<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:56.229> will<00:01:56.320> eventually

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
around and stop down you will eventually

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.120 
around and stop down you will eventually
land<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.130> trick<00:01:58.380> another<00:01:59.380> issue<00:01:59.590> you<00:01:59.800> may

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130
