00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.069
 I told people , I 'm a rodrigo and see the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.469
 we have here if it is not the good old 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.420
 symphony 5 not so old so 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.460
 more important is that he has the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.929
 update for android lollipop one 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.340
 thing that was stopped for a long time 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.170
 phone users 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.449
 It was not yesterday, there is already a certain 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.449
 range but only because my hands now 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.369
 and I will talk about what I found neither 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.439
 most apparent changes the first of them 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.869
 You are already already seeing here that 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.730
 notification on the treatment screen 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.380
 is not showing the contents of the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.380
 notification because I put it there 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.850
 I chose to hide the content 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.590
 confidential but everyone if I touch 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.239
 here he would go straight to twitter that 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.149
 in the case is the notification that is 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.789
 showing up let's unlock and people 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.480
 enter the home screen which is very close 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.820
 of what we were already accustomed to 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.770
 sliding here we realize that the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.949
 notification bar is in the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.800
 Opium pattern of sliding in two phases 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.870
 justifications appear low and the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.479
 There are no controls on top of those 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.790
 two bars that existed initially 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.710
 Phone calls, I think I liked it. 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.630
 because it bothered me with the two bars 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.850
 even with some time of use 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.729
 even though it was not so 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.960
 ipop has two phases . 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.360
 used twice to get the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.340
 Controls but finally Minutes Notification 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.799
 You want I can answer you from here. 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.460
 I can 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:31.259
 to give it away is a change that is 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.799
 highly significant that we 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.869
 a lot of these bars good if you give 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.299
 a look at these options here will give 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.000
 to realize that he has the option of 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.680
 one-handed use only inform us 5 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.470
 This is something that only happened in 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.329
 flowers did I do not see much use 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.189
 I think they will not put it there right? 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.200
 who else puts it because he was like this 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.380
 also good to use with your hand 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.320
 everyone can resize it 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.880
 use the size that you think is best 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.380
 I think this is a better problem. 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.530
 There will be a moment that you will need to use 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.719
 so all batayneh one thing that 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.610
 they put let's talk about this because 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.790
 I found it interesting and clear in the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.020
 application manager you now 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.660
 can 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.930
 choose which applications are going 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.610
 or not to start with the android 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.840
 to repeat the andrÃ© is heavy that has 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.310
 a lot of things not installed 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.220
 necessarily heavy 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.240
 running a background and now you 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.800
 can is put what it is that it goes 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.750
 start automatically or not 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.210
 example may allow detachment 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.540
 or some other application start alone 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.180
 what would be a help there in memory branch 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.800
 and finally I think andrade knows 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.290
 manage ram memory in a way 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.240
 his last elections 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.240
 of course if you touch the 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.450
 many tests the test that will be already in 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.510
 cardigan those android pop cards 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.600
 so this was more than expected gt tem 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.950
 what to do like this to dismiss them here 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.720
 there is the option to set a screen in the home 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.240
 that is, you leave a fixed table without 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.090
 pass on to others I honestly do not 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.970
 I really use this for myself, but anyway. 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.900
 it may be that someone has an idea 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.820
 best 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.320
 as I have generally said, of course 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.870
 this here also this animation of 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.590
 entry in the apps drawer is android 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.810
 pop 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.920
 but since the data have not changed icons 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.709
 very 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.720
 that mixture is of the material 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.540
 design brought by mercadolivre.com 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.550
 that Asian style of those icons of the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.730
 gallery cv that stays the same thing 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.500
 It is more or less an issue that many 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.750
 People should ask themselves right away is 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.060
 how was the battery on iphone 5 after 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.540
 pop offspring transaction and I 'll say a 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.459
 thing is the number no no we always 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.000
 expects it to improve because battery 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:57.120
 iphone 5 is not bright but she is a 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.980
 same thing if it's not a little worse 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.170
 but this is kind of a kick because the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.360
 battery consumption varies greatly even 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.300
 a person from one day to the next is 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.090
 much more does it vary 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.650
 so we have here o o o battery 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.000
 is almost fully charged use well 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.660
 little time in the making 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.320
 we are already there with 94% screens and see that it has 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.540
 11 minutes of use 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.700
 in recent days after the star 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.750
 pop noticed that it arrives at the notification 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:29.770
 15% charge with about 10 hours of 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.020
 I use 11 hours and at most 2 hours of 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.060
 screen attached sometimes a little less a 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.980
 little else means it was not 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.320
 bright even uses iphone continues 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.970
 being a device that if you are a 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.430
 hard user if you use enough 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.220
 during the day you will need in some 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.960
 plugged in or a 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.890
 You come home and go with it. 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.170
 dying but still realizing it 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.810
 That thing, we just hoped he would. 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.130
 could improve the battery a little 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.630
 software update only has 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.880
 importance for the management of 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.820
 load but I think it was not much that 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.440
 but it happened anyway pop oe wheel 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.660
 very well here in us on headphones 51 too 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.880
 is not that case and say poxa updated 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.950
 It was the crap that came in not him 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.830
 remains very fast in five is a 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.990
 phone and I think whoever 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.300
 want to upgrade to pay for these little things 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.220
 here the pop blog goes after 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.390
 notifications on the screen last treatment 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.460
 this one bar is worth asus 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.130
 curiously removed the file from 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.920
 update the les pops of your site 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.620
 official so if you want I'll go 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.080
 let me leave you a look in the description 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.820
 of the video for you to download is a link 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.200
 from the website of Asia they drew a link 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.110
 not to take a file from the server 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.690
 So to update how you do it 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.550
 leaves your iphone 5 in the latest version 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.180
 you will be able to update here 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.860
 even when setting on and 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.270
 looking for the update if you 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.090
 last updates 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.220
 leave this version and get a file 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.340
 of the helipad places in the root of the card 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.620
 micro sd and no pass in the root put 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.320
 reboot the phone and there 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.320
 will appear update the detected such 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.270
 If you will update these my impressions 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.590
 That means some things changed. 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:20.560
 it's the visual that those two new things 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.610
 cool ipod line but battery on 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.930
 a lot 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.760
 I still think the transaction that 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.500
 it's worth it because not 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.690
 if you have just as I told you 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.670
 file is there in the description of the video already 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.950
 that withdrew from the site and since 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.590
 it until the time of publication of this 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.690
 video here he does not update himself and 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.480
 does not update the pop blog yet 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.400
 have even files to kiss the site 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.320
 data for those who were dissatisfied but 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.810
 It was not my case I'm not staying for 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.670
 here guys leave it just for you and said 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.020
 Who knows I liked writing this? 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.020
 New history , I went there.
