they've included a fully printed manual

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.179 
they've included a fully printed manual
really<00:01:57.540> looking<00:01:57.840> good<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.829> that's<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> bottom

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
really looking good so that's the bottom

really looking good so that's the bottom
section<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.000> then<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.750> top<00:02:01.110> section<00:02:01.500> is

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
section and then the top section is

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.510 
section and then the top section is
obviously<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.040> microphone<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.450> I'm<00:02:03.600> assuming

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
obviously the microphone so I'm assuming

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.160 
obviously the microphone so I'm assuming
that<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:06.060> take<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.479> mic<00:02:06.689> out<00:02:06.899> like

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
that we can just take the mic out like

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.520 
that we can just take the mic out like
so<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.700> go<00:02:08.849> look<00:02:09.179> at<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.629> this

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
so and here we go look at this this

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.720 
so and here we go look at this this
looks<00:02:10.890> very<00:02:11.430> very<00:02:12.000> special<00:02:12.540> indeed

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
looks very very special indeed

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.940 
looks very very special indeed
so<00:02:13.879> we've<00:02:14.030> got<00:02:14.180> controls<00:02:14.690> on<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.290> back<00:02:15.500> for

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
so we've got controls on the back for

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.970 
so we've got controls on the back for
power<00:02:16.340> we've<00:02:17.239> also<00:02:17.450> got<00:02:18.019> some<00:02:18.290> filter

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
power we've also got some filter

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.520 
power we've also got some filter
controls<00:02:19.400> here<00:02:19.700> as<00:02:19.819> well<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.239> DB<00:02:21.080> gain<00:02:21.319> which

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
controls here as well and DB gain which

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.960 
controls here as well and DB gain which
goes<00:02:21.769> from<00:02:21.950> minus<00:02:22.159> 10<00:02:22.610> DB<00:02:22.849> to<00:02:23.690> plus<00:02:24.110> 20<00:02:24.769> DB<00:02:24.970> the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
goes from minus 10 DB to plus 20 DB the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.600 
goes from minus 10 DB to plus 20 DB the
main<00:02:26.150> power<00:02:26.420> on/off<00:02:26.720> switch<00:02:27.140> this<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.739> metal

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
main power on/off switch this is metal

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.640 
main power on/off switch this is metal
construction<00:02:29.420> as<00:02:29.540> well<00:02:29.569> we've<00:02:30.140> got<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:30.349> mount

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
construction as well we've got a mount

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.030 
construction as well we've got a mount
here<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.160> go<00:02:31.310> on<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.879> your<00:02:32.180> camera<00:02:32.690> on<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.739> side

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
here to go on to your camera on the side

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.830 
here to go on to your camera on the side
here<00:02:34.400> I'm<00:02:34.730> assuming<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:35.599> where<00:02:35.750> the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
here I'm assuming this is where the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.789 
here I'm assuming this is where the
battery<00:02:36.019> goes<00:02:36.610> yeah<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:37.879> 9<00:02:38.299> volt<00:02:38.810> battery<00:02:39.349> goes

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
battery goes yeah so 9 volt battery goes

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.839 
battery goes yeah so 9 volt battery goes
in<00:02:40.010> here<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:42.200> beautifully<00:02:43.040> constructed<00:02:43.340> this

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
in here so beautifully constructed this

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.509 
in here so beautifully constructed this
is<00:02:44.000> very<00:02:44.360> very<00:02:44.629> solid<00:02:44.959> now<00:02:45.829> around<00:02:46.129> on<00:02:46.340> this

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
is very very solid now around on this

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.170 
is very very solid now around on this
side<00:02:46.579> we<00:02:47.329> have<00:02:47.360> got<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:48.140> balanced<00:02:49.129> outputs<00:02:49.730> so

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
side we have got the balanced outputs so

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.539 
side we have got the balanced outputs so
these<00:02:50.329> are<00:02:50.569> the<00:02:50.629> mini<00:02:50.900> XLR<00:02:51.379> outputs<00:02:52.040> left<00:02:52.340> and

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
these are the mini XLR outputs left and

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.530 
these are the mini XLR outputs left and
right<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:54.220> then<00:02:55.220> Rams<00:02:55.730> on<00:02:55.879> the<00:02:55.970> bottom<00:02:56.329> here

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
right and then Rams on the bottom here

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.729 
right and then Rams on the bottom here
we've<00:02:56.780> got<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.930> microphone<00:02:57.230> output

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
we've got a microphone output

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.190 
we've got a microphone output
three-and-a-half<00:02:58.549> millimeter<00:02:59.200> microphone

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
three-and-a-half millimeter microphone

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.910 
three-and-a-half millimeter microphone
output<00:03:00.470> as<00:03:00.769> well<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.280> then<00:03:01.849> these<00:03:02.030> are<00:03:02.090> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
output as well and then these are the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.890 
output as well and then these are the
true<00:03:03.920> condenser<00:03:04.910> capsules<00:03:05.299> these<00:03:05.480> are<00:03:05.629> match

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
true condenser capsules these are match

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.750 
true condenser capsules these are match
two<00:03:06.200> capsules<00:03:06.650> as<00:03:06.829> well<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.340> these<00:03:07.459> are<00:03:07.670> going

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
two capsules as well so these are going

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.210 
two capsules as well so these are going
to<00:03:07.819> give<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:08.120> your<00:03:08.450> stereo<00:03:08.989> audio<00:03:09.349> capture

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
to give you your stereo audio capture

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.270 
to give you your stereo audio capture
and<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:11.060> just<00:03:11.269> looks<00:03:11.510> absolutely<00:03:11.989> amazing<00:03:12.650> and

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
and it just looks absolutely amazing and

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.220 
and it just looks absolutely amazing and
we've<00:03:13.430> also<00:03:13.640> got<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:14.450> right

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
we've also got this right

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.830 
we've also got this right
Lyra<00:03:15.530> technology<00:03:16.370> on<00:03:16.519> here<00:03:16.819> which<00:03:17.359> gives<00:03:17.690> you

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
Lyra technology on here which gives you

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.349 
Lyra technology on here which gives you
some<00:03:18.169> sort<00:03:18.859> shock<00:03:19.130> mounting<00:03:19.639> on<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:19.849> little

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
some sort shock mounting on the little

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.150 
some sort shock mounting on the little
capsules<00:03:20.870> you<00:03:21.440> can<00:03:21.590> see<00:03:21.829> that<00:03:22.040> they're

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
capsules you can see that they're

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.729 
capsules you can see that they're
actually<00:03:22.250> mounted<00:03:22.970> on<00:03:23.200> this<00:03:24.200> sort<00:03:24.680> of

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
actually mounted on this sort of

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.890 
actually mounted on this sort of
suspension<00:03:25.160> system<00:03:25.819> so<00:03:26.180> none<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.750> the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
suspension system so none of the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.319 
suspension system so none of the
vibrations<00:03:27.680> coming<00:03:28.370> up<00:03:28.549> through<00:03:28.849> your<00:03:29.000> tripod

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
vibrations coming up through your tripod

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.539 
vibrations coming up through your tripod
into<00:03:30.109> your<00:03:30.260> camera<00:03:30.500> are<00:03:30.769> actually<00:03:31.099> gonna<00:03:31.250> make

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
into your camera are actually gonna make

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.670 
into your camera are actually gonna make
it<00:03:31.730> through<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:32.599> microphone<00:03:32.840> capsules

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
it through to the microphone capsules

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.129 
it through to the microphone capsules
just<00:03:34.280> ensures<00:03:34.639> a<00:03:34.760> really<00:03:35.150> high-quality<00:03:35.389> audio

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
just ensures a really high-quality audio

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.890 
just ensures a really high-quality audio
capture<00:03:36.889> so<00:03:37.669> that<00:03:37.910> is<00:03:38.090> pretty<00:03:38.389> much<00:03:38.510> all

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
capture so that is pretty much all

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.110 
capture so that is pretty much all

this delivers on its promises I've got
no<00:04:04.609> reason<00:04:04.879> to<00:04:05.060> doubt<00:04:05.329> it<00:04:05.599> but<00:04:06.109> I<00:04:06.169> will<00:04:06.349> bring
