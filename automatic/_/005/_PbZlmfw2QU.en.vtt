hey whats up guys its narky 46 and today

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.550 
hey whats up guys its narky 46 and today
I<00:00:03.330> have<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.780> video<00:00:04.080> about<00:00:05.009> an<00:00:05.370> automatic<00:00:06.560> cactus

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
I have a video about an automatic cactus

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.730 
I have a video about an automatic cactus
farm<00:00:07.830> for<00:00:08.309> feed<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.030> beast<00:00:09.349> now<00:00:10.349> basically

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
farm for feed the beast now basically

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.709 
farm for feed the beast now basically
what<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.219> does<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:12.120> automatically

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
what this does is it automatically

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.400 
what this does is it automatically
harvests<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.860> cacti<00:00:14.309> from<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.839> system

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
harvests the cacti from this system

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.980 
harvests the cacti from this system
right<00:00:16.770> here<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.400> basically<00:00:18.180> every<00:00:18.660> time<00:00:18.869> it

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
right here and basically every time it

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.490 
right here and basically every time it
grows<00:00:19.260> passed<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.699> breaks<00:00:21.510> off<00:00:21.750> instantly

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
grows passed to it breaks off instantly

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.109 
grows passed to it breaks off instantly
because<00:00:22.859> as<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.250> see<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.519> can't<00:00:23.820> place

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
because as you can see you can't place

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.279 
because as you can see you can't place
cactus<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.650> when<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.550> grows<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.779> instantly

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
cactus so when it grows it instantly

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.830 
cactus so when it grows it instantly
just<00:00:28.650> drops<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> item<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:30.359> have<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> water

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
just drops the item and I have a water

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.190 
just drops the item and I have a water
flow<00:00:31.170> system<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.920> pushes<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.969> cactus<00:00:33.870> down

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
flow system that pushes the cactus down

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.750 
flow system that pushes the cactus down
and<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.620> all<00:00:34.800> goes<00:00:34.980> into<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> central

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and it all goes into the central

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.150 
and it all goes into the central
drainage<00:00:36.300> hole<00:00:36.540> which<00:00:37.530> I'm<00:00:37.710> just<00:00:37.950> spoiling

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
drainage hole which I'm just spoiling

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.869 
drainage hole which I'm just spoiling
right<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.879> drops<00:00:39.239> into<00:00:39.450> there<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
right here you drops into there and

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.720 
right here you drops into there and
basically<00:00:41.879> at<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.809> bottom<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.010> hole<00:00:44.399> on

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
basically at the bottom of that hole on

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.450 
basically at the bottom of that hole on
that<00:00:45.170> keeps<00:00:46.170> going<00:00:46.500> down<00:00:46.620> another<00:00:46.860> set<00:00:47.309> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that keeps going down another set of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.049 
that keeps going down another set of
water<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:49.140> let<00:00:49.260> me<00:00:49.350> make<00:00:49.469> my<00:00:49.739> way<00:00:49.950> over<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
water and let me make my way over to

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.510 
water and let me make my way over to
where<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.890> all<00:00:53.039> under<00:00:53.070> ground

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
where that is I have it all under ground

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.250 
where that is I have it all under ground
so<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.090> don't<00:00:54.300> see<00:00:54.480> any<00:00:54.570> pipes<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
so that you don't see any pipes and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.709 
so that you don't see any pipes and
basically<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:59.100> goes<00:00:59.850> down<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> water<00:01:00.390> flow

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
basically it goes down the water flow

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.779 
basically it goes down the water flow
and<00:01:01.020> then<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.680> very<00:01:01.829> end<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.250> water<00:01:02.460> flow

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and then the very end of the water flow

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.690 
and then the very end of the water flow
I<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.180> fall<00:01:03.420> into<00:01:03.719> an<00:01:04.229> obsidian<00:01:04.559> pipe<00:01:04.979> now

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
I have it fall into an obsidian pipe now

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.450 
I have it fall into an obsidian pipe now
this<00:01:06.150> will<00:01:06.390> also<00:01:06.750> work<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.770> new<00:01:07.890> minecraft

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
this will also work in the new minecraft

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.670 
this will also work in the new minecraft
snapshot<00:01:09.030> which<00:01:09.479> will<00:01:09.750> soon<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.260> coming<00:01:10.409> out

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
snapshot which will soon be coming out

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.149 
snapshot which will soon be coming out
you<00:01:11.549> know<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.090> actual<00:01:12.840> full<00:01:13.439> release<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.070> you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
you know the actual full release and you

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.160 
you know the actual full release and you
could<00:01:14.369> replace<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.090> obsidian<00:01:15.390> piping<00:01:15.990> with

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
could replace that obsidian piping with

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.590 
could replace that obsidian piping with
a<00:01:16.200> hopper<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.610> would<00:01:17.729> pick<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.330> item

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
a hopper and that would pick up the item

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.969 
a hopper and that would pick up the item
and<00:01:18.720> then<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.990> could<00:01:19.140> probably<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
and then you could probably just have a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.700 
and then you could probably just have a
regular<00:01:20.159> chest<00:01:20.790> under<00:01:21.090> there<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.540> which<00:01:22.500> would

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
regular chest under there on which would

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.280 
regular chest under there on which would
which<00:01:22.950> would<00:01:23.130> also<00:01:23.310> work<00:01:24.110> forum<00:01:25.110> regular

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
which would also work forum regular

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.350 
which would also work forum regular
minecraft<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.820> isn't<00:01:27.150> just

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
minecraft so this this isn't just

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.140 
minecraft so this this isn't just
strictly<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:28.080> feed<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> beast<00:01:28.619> or<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
strictly for feed the beast or the

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.990 
strictly for feed the beast or the
BuildCraft<00:01:30.150> pipes<00:01:30.420> mod<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.610> use<00:01:32.790> this

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
BuildCraft pipes mod so you can use this

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.380 
BuildCraft pipes mod so you can use this
method<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:34.500> new<00:01:35.250> minecraft<00:01:35.759> when<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.270> is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
method for new minecraft when it is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.990 
method for new minecraft when it is
officially<00:01:36.570> released<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.159> snapshot<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
officially released on the snapshot and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.670 
officially released on the snapshot and
in<00:01:39.299> feed<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> beast<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> obsidian

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
in feed the beast with the obsidian

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.920 
in feed the beast with the obsidian
piping<00:01:41.040> now<00:01:41.759> basically<00:01:42.180> what<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.630> cactus

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
piping now basically what this cactus

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.530 
piping now basically what this cactus
does<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.590> comes<00:01:43.799> down<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.610> end<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.060> drops

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
does is it comes down the end it drops

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.929 
does is it comes down the end it drops
right<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.899> there<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.399> goes<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.640> that

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
right in there and then it goes to that

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.789 
right in there and then it goes to that
piping<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.079> gets<00:01:49.170> transferred<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.740> a

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
piping and then it gets transferred to a

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.550 
piping and then it gets transferred to a
chest<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.390> this<00:01:51.390> system<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.960> don't<00:01:52.079> have<00:01:52.380> to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
chest and this system you don't have to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.130 
chest and this system you don't have to
touch<00:01:52.770> at<00:01:53.100> all<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.850> always<00:01:54.329> automatic<00:01:54.960> you
