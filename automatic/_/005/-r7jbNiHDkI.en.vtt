00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:23.449
 Draw a donkey that can play with 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.449

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.329
 without working you 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.870
 I have an idea I know someone very 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.560
 strong that could pull the wheelbarrow 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.320
 with the two above 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.320
 if he could even take us to the three 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:15.050
 wait for me and I'll be back 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.050
 and good friends have first 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:31.240
 and it was going crazy I'm going to draw a 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.930
 donkey friends want to draw a donkey 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.930

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.280

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:48.390
 true to draw a donkey start 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.870
 for his head is long 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.080
 then he added two long donkey ears 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.320
 jordi two points for your eyes a 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:04.050
 semicircle for your ace and with good for 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:08.789
 the nose and mouth that drew his back and 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:16.380
 now I make his legs and a two his 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:21.300
 belly and two legs plus 3 and 4 then I do 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:24.870
 its more nails so very well i like and 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:30.080
 now I go up to the head with a line 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.080
 only missing his nice mane I do 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.580

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.580

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.200
 the tail will be a long line with a 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.310
 tuft of hair at the end and now friends 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.310

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000

 I raise your weight plus the time invested 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:28.130
 minus the driver's age gives us 6 if 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.850

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:36.870

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.690
 they misunderstood I said that I could not that I 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.540
 I would 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.910

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.010

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.690
 long head 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.669

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.220

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.490
