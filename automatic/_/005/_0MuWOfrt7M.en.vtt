first off I thought I owed you guys this
video<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.089> explain<00:00:15.420> why<00:00:16.020> I'm<00:00:16.500> going<00:00:17.130> from<00:00:17.369> one

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
channel to another Channel

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.040 
channel to another Channel
and<00:00:19.890> believe<00:00:20.279> me<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.820> not<00:00:20.970> my<00:00:21.330> choice<00:00:21.630> I

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
and believe me it's not my choice I

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.750 
and believe me it's not my choice I
didn't<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.529> anything<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.920> do<00:00:23.039> with<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.340> so

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
didn't have anything to do with this so

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.220 
didn't have anything to do with this so
here's<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.150> really<00:00:24.449> short<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.140> point

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
here's the really short and to the point

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.679 
here's the really short and to the point
version<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.980> had<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> trademark<00:00:26.789> someone<00:00:27.510> else

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
version I had a trademark someone else

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.050 
version I had a trademark someone else
had<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> trademark<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.710> they<00:00:29.670> were<00:00:29.730> too

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
had a trademark and they were too

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.150 
had a trademark and they were too
similar<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.810> guess<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.560> was<00:00:31.679> all<00:00:31.830> out<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:31.980> my

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
similar I guess it was all out of my

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.700 
similar I guess it was all out of my
control<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.790> had<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> lawyer<00:00:33.870> at<00:00:34.290> 20

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
control I had to get a lawyer at 20

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.740 
control I had to get a lawyer at 20
years<00:00:34.920> old<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.940> didn't<00:00:36.149> want<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> get<00:00:36.480> sued

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
years old and I didn't want to get sued

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.170 
years old and I didn't want to get sued
because<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.230> would<00:00:37.350> pretty<00:00:37.590> much<00:00:37.680> ruin<00:00:38.520> my<00:00:38.940> life

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
because I would pretty much ruin my life

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.270 
because I would pretty much ruin my life
so<00:00:39.480> thankfully<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.930> didn't<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.800> had<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.100> make

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
so thankfully I didn't but I had to make

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.520 
so thankfully I didn't but I had to make
a<00:00:41.489> ton<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.149> changes<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.989> had<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> new

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
a ton of changes I had to get a new

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.529 
a ton of changes I had to get a new
Facebook<00:00:44.129> page<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.640> had<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.879> change<00:00:45.120> my<00:00:45.270> Twitter

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
Facebook page I had to change my Twitter

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.900 
Facebook page I had to change my Twitter
username<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.160> process<00:00:47.370> of

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
username and I'm in the process of

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.049 
username and I'm in the process of
getting<00:00:48.450> new<00:00:48.989> graphics<00:00:49.620> new<00:00:49.860> logos<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.670> new

getting new graphics new logos and new

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.600 
getting new graphics new logos and new
everything<00:00:51.329> else<00:00:51.870> because<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.620> takes<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
everything else because that takes a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.799 
everything else because that takes a
long<00:00:53.760> time<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.390> that's<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
long time to do and that's one of the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.420 
long time to do and that's one of the
reasons<00:00:55.140> why<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.410> been<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:55.860> long<00:00:56.039> since<00:00:56.100> I've

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
reasons why it's been so long since I've

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.830 
reasons why it's been so long since I've
made<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> video<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.090> had<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.300> figure<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:57.629> all<00:00:57.750> the

legal stuff and then after I did that I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.330 
legal stuff and then after I did that I
had<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.930> focus<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> graphics<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
with his first happened to me I was

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.020 
with his first happened to me I was
really<00:01:51.630> down<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:52.259> as<00:01:52.470> time<00:01:52.740> went<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.460> kind

really down but as time went on I kind

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.880 
really down but as time went on I kind
of<00:01:54.180> learned<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> see<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> blessing<00:01:55.770> in

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
of learned to see it as a blessing in

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.499 
of learned to see it as a blessing in
disguise<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.700> big<00:01:56.909> reason<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.420> me

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
disguise and a big reason for me

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.300 
disguise and a big reason for me

thinking that is because of your guys's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.310 
thinking that is because of your guys's
support<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.030> coming<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.840> channel<00:02:01.200> and
