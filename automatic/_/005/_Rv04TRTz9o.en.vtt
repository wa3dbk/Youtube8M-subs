00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
sometimes are trying to just create this

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.340 
sometimes are trying to just create this
angle<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.600> approach<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.899> ball<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.140> makes

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
angle of approach to the ball that makes

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.330 
angle of approach to the ball that makes
it<00:00:34.530> go<00:00:34.649> up<00:00:34.739> into<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> air

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
it go up into the air

it go up into the air
what<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.940> here<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.180> we've<00:00:36.329> got<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.510> tree

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
what we have here is we've got a tree

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.660 
what we have here is we've got a tree
right<00:00:37.110> here<00:00:37.350> which<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.739> perfect<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.579> this

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
right here which is perfect for this

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.160 
right here which is perfect for this
situation<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.719> going<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.899> allow

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
situation because this is going to allow

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.590 
situation because this is going to allow
us<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.920> work<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.340> our<00:00:41.460> angle<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:42.000> approach<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
us to work on our angle of approach and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.779 
us to work on our angle of approach and
getting<00:00:43.110> out<00:00:43.710> from<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.399> call<00:00:44.579> being

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
getting out from what we call being

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.150 
getting out from what we call being
stuck<00:00:45.090> or<00:00:45.239> underneath<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.110> club<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.039> let

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
stuck or underneath the the club so let

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.950 
stuck or underneath the the club so let

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
hit this ball up over this tree my chest

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.660 
hit this ball up over this tree my chest
is<00:00:52.230> gonna<00:00:52.410> work<00:00:52.590> differently<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.399> I'm<00:00:53.520> gonna

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
is gonna work differently so I'm gonna

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.889 
is gonna work differently so I'm gonna
stand<00:00:53.940> here<00:00:54.059> when<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> try<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> create

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
stand here when I try to create

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.040 
stand here when I try to create
trajectory<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.860> I'm<00:00:56.309> gonna<00:00:56.430> keep<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:57.690> chest

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
trajectory and I'm gonna keep my chest

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.590 
trajectory and I'm gonna keep my chest
back<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.640> stay<00:01:00.090> back<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.480> that

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600

now<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:04.080> start<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.409> keep<00:01:04.559> our<00:01:04.710> chest<00:01:05.040> back

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
now as we start to keep our chest back

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.740 
now as we start to keep our chest back
what<00:01:05.519> happens<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> club<00:01:06.659> is
