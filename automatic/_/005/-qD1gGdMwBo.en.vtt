up<00:01:53.840> at<00:01:54.940> incognito<00:01:56.200> although<00:01:57.200> they<00:01:57.320> might<00:01:57.440> not

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.710 
so basically this is one of the things
you<00:02:01.310> can<00:02:01.430> modify<00:02:01.670> using<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.150> game<00:02:02.270> black<00:02:02.510> and

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
you can modify using the game black and

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.420 
you can modify using the game black and
it<00:02:03.560> pretty<00:02:03.860> much<00:02:03.970> puts<00:02:04.970> it<00:02:05.920> it's<00:02:06.920> pretty<00:02:07.280> much

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
it pretty much puts it it's pretty much

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.609 
it pretty much puts it it's pretty much
a<00:02:07.490> Brotherhood<00:02:08.090> style<00:02:08.480> meter<00:02:08.810> it's<00:02:09.410> not

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
a Brotherhood style meter it's not

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.420 
a Brotherhood style meter it's not
exactly<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.250> same<00:02:11.650> namely<00:02:12.650> because<00:02:12.860> like<00:02:13.310> in

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
exactly the same namely because like in

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.070 
exactly the same namely because like in
Brotherhood<00:02:13.730> once<00:02:14.060> you've<00:02:14.240> dropped<00:02:14.750> below

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
Brotherhood once you've dropped below

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.450 
Brotherhood once you've dropped below
incognito<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.040> could<00:02:16.190> never<00:02:16.370> get<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.670> back

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
incognito you could never get it back

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.770 
incognito you could never get it back
whereas<00:02:19.460> with<00:02:19.700> this<00:02:19.850> meter<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.330> can<00:02:20.480> fill<00:02:20.690> it

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
whereas with this meter you can fill it

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.150 
whereas with this meter you can fill it
all<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.930> way<00:02:21.080> back<00:02:21.260> up<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.710> you<00:02:21.770> can<00:02:21.800> still

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
all the way back up and you can still

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.900 
all the way back up and you can still
get<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.370> 450<00:02:23.060> points<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.650> it's<00:02:25.430> not<00:02:25.610> really

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
get the 450 points so it's not really

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.310 
get the 450 points so it's not really
you<00:02:26.240> know<00:02:26.330> initially<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.750> kind<00:02:26.960> of<00:02:26.990> tweeted

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
you know initially I kind of tweeted

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.810 
you know initially I kind of tweeted
about<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.680> meter<00:02:27.890> changes<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.490> it<00:02:28.550> was<00:02:28.640> like

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
about the meter changes and it was like

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.190 
about the meter changes and it was like
oh<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.060> can<00:02:29.300> choose<00:02:29.480> between<00:02:29.600> Brotherhood

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
oh you can choose between Brotherhood

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.660 
oh you can choose between Brotherhood
and<00:02:30.380> revelations<00:02:30.920> now<00:02:31.130> meters<00:02:31.400> it's<00:02:31.550> not

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
and revelations now meters it's not

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.220 
and revelations now meters it's not
exactly<00:02:32.030> how<00:02:32.240> it<00:02:32.360> works<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:32.810> really<00:02:33.050> just

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
exactly how it works it's really just

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.840 
exactly how it works it's really just
you<00:02:33.800> determine<00:02:35.440> where<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.590> starts<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.730> can

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
you determine where it starts you can

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.370 
you determine where it starts you can
also<00:02:37.970> see<00:02:38.210> how<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.450> multipliers<00:02:38.960> work<00:02:39.170> here

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
also see how the multipliers work here

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.750 
also see how the multipliers work here
that<00:02:39.500> was<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.650> hidden<00:02:39.830> kill<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.400> doubles<00:02:40.730> my

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
that was a hidden kill so it doubles my

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.750 
that was a hidden kill so it doubles my
450<00:02:41.450> points<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:42.080> 900<00:02:42.500> s<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:42.890> I'd<00:02:43.340> mentioned

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
450 points to 900 s so I'd mentioned

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.750 
450 points to 900 s so I'd mentioned
this<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:44.030> another<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.320> frantic<00:02:45.680> mode<00:02:46.010> but

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
this in another in the frantic mode but

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.070 
this in another in the frantic mode but
you<00:02:46.790> couldn't<00:02:47.000> really<00:02:47.120> see<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:47.480> because<00:02:47.720> they

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
you couldn't really see it because they

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.820 
you couldn't really see it because they
they<00:02:49.010> didn't<00:02:50.140> put<00:02:51.140> in<00:02:51.260> any<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:51.740> those

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
they didn't put in any of those

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.470 
they didn't put in any of those
multipliers<00:02:52.370> for<00:02:52.459> frantic<00:02:52.940> mode<00:02:53.120> but<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:53.360> can

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
multipliers for frantic mode but you can

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.979 
multipliers for frantic mode but you can
see<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.720> here<00:02:53.870> now<00:02:55.480> basically<00:02:56.480> how<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.959> works

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
see it here now basically how it works

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.690 
see it here now basically how it works
as<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:57.739> mentioned<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.190> other<00:02:58.220> video<00:02:58.430> is

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
as I mentioned in the other video is

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.380 
as I mentioned in the other video is
that<00:02:59.680> the<00:03:00.680> different<00:03:01.010> types<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.340> kills<00:03:01.640> like

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
that the different types of kills like

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.680 
that the different types of kills like
acrobatic<00:03:03.230> hidden<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.100> grab<00:03:04.250> kill<00:03:04.690> instead

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
acrobatic hidden and grab kill instead

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.150 
acrobatic hidden and grab kill instead
of<00:03:05.780> being<00:03:05.959> flat<00:03:06.140> point<00:03:06.380> bonuses<00:03:06.830> will<00:03:07.070> now

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
of being flat point bonuses will now

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.520 
of being flat point bonuses will now
multiply<00:03:07.730> kind<00:03:08.300> of<00:03:08.360> your<00:03:08.510> base<00:03:08.780> action<00:03:10.060> and

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
multiply kind of your base action and

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.620 
multiply kind of your base action and
see<00:03:12.530> here<00:03:12.739> I'd<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:13.370> initially<00:03:14.150> thought<00:03:14.180> I'd<00:03:14.420> try

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
see here I'd I initially thought I'd try

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.110 
see here I'd I initially thought I'd try
to<00:03:14.660> get<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:15.130> hidden<00:03:16.130> but<00:03:16.310> my<00:03:16.459> mind<00:03:16.670> still<00:03:16.910> kind

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
to get a hidden but my mind still kind

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.690 
to get a hidden but my mind still kind
of<00:03:17.150> in<00:03:17.330> a<00:03:17.540> little<00:03:17.690> bit<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.350> c3<00:03:18.860> /<00:03:19.040> revelation

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
of in a little bit of a c3 / revelation

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.430 
of in a little bit of a c3 / revelation
mainly<00:03:20.270> a<00:03:20.300> c3<00:03:20.690> most<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:20.959> was<00:03:21.050> like<00:03:21.140> oh<00:03:21.260> I'll<00:03:21.410> just

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
mainly a c3 most I was like oh I'll just

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.220 
mainly a c3 most I was like oh I'll just
make<00:03:21.709> up<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:21.830> points<00:03:22.100> by<00:03:22.370> getting<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.790> an

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
make up the points by getting a an

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.290 
make up the points by getting a an
ambush<00:03:24.230> well<00:03:24.830> there's<00:03:24.950> no<00:03:25.070> ambush<00:03:25.489> in<00:03:25.640> this<00:03:25.850> at

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
ambush well there's no ambush in this at

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.300 
ambush well there's no ambush in this at
least<00:03:26.480> not<00:03:26.630> in<00:03:26.660> this<00:03:26.930> setup<00:03:27.739> anyway<00:03:28.190> I<00:03:28.220> don't

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
least not in this setup anyway I don't

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.410 
least not in this setup anyway I don't
know<00:03:28.459> if<00:03:28.550> it<00:03:28.640> still<00:03:28.850> exists<00:03:29.209> or<00:03:29.300> not

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
know if it still exists or not

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.020 
know if it still exists or not
and<00:03:31.110> so<00:03:31.800> I<00:03:31.830> really<00:03:32.160> should<00:03:32.370> have<00:03:32.400> stayed<00:03:32.790> in

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
and so I really should have stayed in

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.970 
and so I really should have stayed in
that<00:03:33.360> hidden<00:03:33.540> group<00:03:33.810> because<00:03:34.110> getting<00:03:34.830> a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
that hidden group because getting a

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.330 
that hidden group because getting a
hidden<00:03:35.300> incognito<00:03:36.300> in<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.950> mode<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.160> worth

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
hidden incognito in this mode is worth

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.010 
hidden incognito in this mode is worth
900<00:03:38.880> points<00:03:39.030> which<00:03:39.270> is<00:03:39.420> kind<00:03:39.600> of<00:03:39.660> ridiculous

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
900 points which is kind of ridiculous

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.830 
900 points which is kind of ridiculous
it's<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:40.880> you<00:03:41.880> have<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.030> huge<00:03:42.330> incentive<00:03:42.600> to

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
it's so you have a huge incentive to

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.770 
it's so you have a huge incentive to
gofer<00:03:43.140> for<00:03:43.380> hidden<00:03:43.680> kills<00:03:43.980> here<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.780> so

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
gofer for hidden kills here and so

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.199 
gofer for hidden kills here and so
basically<00:03:46.050> those<00:03:46.290> multipliers<00:03:47.030> like<00:03:48.030> the

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
basically those multipliers like the

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.000 
basically those multipliers like the
hidden<00:03:48.450> bonus<00:03:48.840> will<00:03:49.410> multiply<00:03:49.709> your<00:03:49.830> base

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
hidden bonus will multiply your base

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.310 
hidden bonus will multiply your base
kill<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.550> then<00:03:50.640> anything<00:03:50.910> else<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.510> get<00:03:51.750> kind

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
kill and then anything else you get kind

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.810 
kill and then anything else you get kind
of<00:03:52.380> adds<00:03:52.620> on<00:03:52.830> top<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:53.430> if<00:03:53.550> I<00:03:53.610> got<00:03:53.790> a

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
of adds on top of it so if I got a

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.890 
of adds on top of it so if I got a
hidden<00:03:54.470> focused<00:03:55.470> skill<00:03:56.570> it<00:03:57.570> would<00:03:57.720> basically

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
hidden focused skill it would basically

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.470 
hidden focused skill it would basically
be<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:59.100> know<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.250> double<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.850> 900<00:04:00.330> points

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
be you know a double it to 900 points

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.790 
be you know a double it to 900 points
and<00:04:00.660> then<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.810> would<00:04:00.900> add<00:04:01.050> on<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.290> 150<00:04:01.709> it

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
and then it would add on the 150 it

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.500 
and then it would add on the 150 it
doesn't<00:04:02.040> double<00:04:02.340> your<00:04:02.640> entire<00:04:02.940> score<00:04:03.360> which

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
doesn't double your entire score which

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.550 
doesn't double your entire score which
would<00:04:03.690> just<00:04:03.840> be<00:04:03.900> even<00:04:04.560> more<00:04:04.890> ridiculous

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
would just be even more ridiculous

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.250 
would just be even more ridiculous
anyway<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:07.620> this<00:04:07.950> is<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.970> forget<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.989> name<00:04:10.140> I

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
anyway so this is a I forget the name I

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.840 
anyway so this is a I forget the name I
think<00:04:10.350> is<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.709> cutthroats<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.670> keeps

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
think is the cutthroats that keeps

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.810 
think is the cutthroats that keeps
killing<00:04:12.060> me<00:04:12.239> this<00:04:12.420> is<00:04:12.540> rainin<00:04:12.900> actually<00:04:13.290> I<00:04:14.100> do

which<00:04:31.380> kind<00:04:31.590> of<00:04:31.680> cuts<00:04:31.860> both<00:04:32.040> ways<00:04:32.100> right

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
which kind of cuts both ways right

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.340 
which kind of cuts both ways right
because<00:04:32.850> on<00:04:33.419> one<00:04:33.600> hand<00:04:33.870> I'm<00:04:34.020> probably<00:04:34.169> not

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
because on one hand I'm probably not

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.690 
because on one hand I'm probably not
giving<00:04:34.590> him<00:04:34.710> as<00:04:34.800> many<00:04:34.979> points<00:04:35.340> as<00:04:35.430> a<00:04:35.460> lot<00:04:35.669> of

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
giving him as many points as a lot of

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.980 
giving him as many points as a lot of
the<00:04:35.820> other<00:04:36.000> targets<00:04:36.360> but<00:04:36.479> at<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.630> same<00:04:36.810> time

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
the other targets but at the same time

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.890 
the other targets but at the same time
it<00:04:37.650> also<00:04:37.740> means<00:04:38.130> he's<00:04:38.850> taking<00:04:39.419> me<00:04:39.510> out<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:39.660> lot

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
it also means he's taking me out a lot

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.600 
it also means he's taking me out a lot
and<00:04:39.960> kind<00:04:40.320> of<00:04:40.440> hindering<00:04:40.740> my<00:04:40.950> scores<00:04:41.310> so

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
and kind of hindering my scores so

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.880 
and kind of hindering my scores so
that's<00:04:42.390> kind<00:04:42.600> of<00:04:42.630> interesting<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:43.350> think<00:04:43.740> right

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
that's kind of interesting I think right

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.740 
that's kind of interesting I think right
here<00:04:44.250> I<00:04:44.280> go<00:04:44.550> for<00:04:44.790> a<00:04:44.820> grab<00:04:45.030> kill<00:04:45.270> you<00:04:45.390> can<00:04:45.510> see

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
here I go for a grab kill you can see

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.930 
here I go for a grab kill you can see
that<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.110> grab<00:04:46.290> kill<00:04:46.560> is<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:47.010> times<00:04:47.520> 3<00:04:49.640> yes<00:04:50.640> so

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
that the grab kill is a times 3 yes so

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.240 
that the grab kill is a times 3 yes so
definitely<00:04:51.360> one<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:52.440> best<00:04:52.650> kind<00:04:52.950> of<00:04:53.010> kills

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
definitely one of the best kind of kills

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.250 
definitely one of the best kind of kills
that<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:53.940> can<00:04:54.090> do<00:04:54.240> still<00:04:54.570> so<00:04:54.810> even<00:04:55.020> though<00:04:55.080> the

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
that you can do still so even though the

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.420 
that you can do still so even though the
250<00:04:55.710> points<00:04:56.070> gets<00:04:56.910> multiplied<00:04:57.360> up<00:04:57.479> to<00:04:57.600> 750<00:04:58.430> now

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
250 points gets multiplied up to 750 now

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.640 
250 points gets multiplied up to 750 now
rainin<00:04:59.820> did<00:05:00.030> was<00:05:00.630> also<00:05:00.900> recording<00:05:01.320> these<00:05:01.440> and

rainin did was also recording these and

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.860 
rainin did was also recording these and
so<00:05:01.800> if<00:05:01.919> you<00:05:02.010> go<00:05:02.100> check<00:05:02.130> his<00:05:02.490> channel<00:05:02.760> out<00:05:03.030> you
