00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270 
Cataclysm has come out them end up the
way<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.450> originally<00:00:40.260> imagined<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:41.010> think

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
way you originally imagined it I think

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.440 
way you originally imagined it I think
it<00:00:41.399> ended<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.760> maybe<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.030> little<00:00:42.180> bit<00:00:42.329> more

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
it ended up maybe a little bit more

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.819 
it ended up maybe a little bit more
cataclysmic<00:00:43.110> than<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.739> originally

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
cataclysmic than what we originally

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.650 
cataclysmic than what we originally
envisioned<00:00:44.339> so<00:00:44.879> what<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.239> one<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.480> your

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
envisioned so what is one of your

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.479 
envisioned so what is one of your
favorite<00:00:46.079> changes<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> old<00:00:46.710> whoa<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.160> would

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
favorite changes to the old whoa I would

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.709

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
say my favorite change the old worlds

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.840 
say my favorite change the old worlds
probably<00:00:49.170> either<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.679> the<00:00:49.859> silver<00:00:50.339> pines<00:00:50.579> own

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
probably either in the silver pines own

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.590 
probably either in the silver pines own
or<00:00:51.269> in<00:00:51.929> some<00:00:52.289> town<00:00:52.499> mountains<00:00:53.120> what's<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.359> fan

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
or in some town mountains what's the fan

or in some town mountains what's the fan
reaction<00:00:55.140> bit<00:00:55.410> about<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.460> world<00:00:56.699> changing<00:00:57.329> i

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
reaction bit about the world changing i

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.229 
reaction bit about the world changing i
would<00:00:57.870> say<00:00:58.019> that<00:00:58.050> has<00:00:58.620> evolved<00:00:59.399> over<00:00:59.460> time<00:00:59.609> we

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
would say that has evolved over time we

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.029 
would say that has evolved over time we
first<00:01:00.719> announced<00:01:00.929> the<00:01:01.140> expansion<00:01:01.230> there<00:01:01.949> was

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
first announced the expansion there was

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.799 
first announced the expansion there was
definitely<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.519> lot<00:01:02.579> more<00:01:02.819> worried<00:01:03.179> about<00:01:03.480> what

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
definitely a lot more worried about what

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.350 
definitely a lot more worried about what
they<00:01:03.989> screw<00:01:04.230> this<00:01:04.350> up<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:05.940> this<00:01:06.060> all

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
they screw this up and what if this all

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.210 
they screw this up and what if this all
goes<00:01:06.420> badly<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:07.530> not<00:01:07.740> as<00:01:07.830> cool<00:01:07.980> as<00:01:08.100> it

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
goes badly and it's not as cool as it

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.460 
goes badly and it's not as cool as it
used<00:01:08.370> to<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.420> game<00:01:09.659> loses<00:01:09.990> its<00:01:10.170> soul

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
used to be and the game loses its soul

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.410 
used to be and the game loses its soul
cuz<00:01:11.159> Blizzard<00:01:11.520> always<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.090> put<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.300> a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
cuz Blizzard always just put that a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.270 
cuz Blizzard always just put that a
bunch<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.690> crap<00:01:12.900> right<00:01:13.110> yeah<00:01:13.620> well<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.250> know

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
bunch of crap right yeah well you know

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.640 
bunch of crap right yeah well you know
everybody<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.330> mess<00:01:15.480> that<00:01:15.690> up<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.020> yeah<00:01:16.290> we

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
everybody can mess that up but yeah we

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.990 
everybody can mess that up but yeah we
tried<00:01:16.980> very<00:01:17.160> hard<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.400> make<00:01:17.610> sure<00:01:17.730> that<00:01:17.910> we

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
tried very hard to make sure that we

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.340 
tried very hard to make sure that we
retain<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.480> soul<00:01:18.660> of<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.810> game<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
retain the soul of the game and the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.810 
retain the soul of the game and the
spirit<00:01:19.800> of<00:01:19.830> those<00:01:20.040> zones<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.550> their<00:01:20.700> original

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
spirit of those zones in their original

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.270 
spirit of those zones in their original
intent<00:01:21.480> and<00:01:21.750> kind<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.080> feel<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.980> think<00:01:23.160> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
intent and kind of feel and I think the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.980 
intent and kind of feel and I think the
players<00:01:23.490> started<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.480> hopefully

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
players started to see that hopefully

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.980 
players started to see that hopefully
that<00:01:25.140> magic<00:01:25.560> has<00:01:25.680> been<00:01:25.860> recaptured

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.050 

is<00:01:30.530> there<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.799> challenge<00:01:31.520> that<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:31.670> can<00:01:31.880> think

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
is there a challenge that you can think

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.080 
is there a challenge that you can think
of<00:01:32.299> like<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:32.810> specific<00:01:33.380> zone<00:01:33.619> or<00:01:34.250> something

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
of like a specific zone or something

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.600 
of like a specific zone or something
like<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.270> that<00:01:35.450> was<00:01:35.899> a<00:01:35.930> little<00:01:36.170> bit<00:01:36.610> harder

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
like that that was a little bit harder

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.730 
like that that was a little bit harder
than<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:37.970> were<00:01:38.060> expecting<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:39.080> sunken<00:01:39.560> city

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
than you were expecting the sunken city

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.899 
than you were expecting the sunken city
of<00:01:39.860> this<00:01:39.979> year<00:01:40.159> would<00:01:40.340> be<00:01:40.369> a<00:01:40.460> great<00:01:40.670> example

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
of this year would be a great example

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.179 
of this year would be a great example
that<00:01:41.119> since<00:01:41.899> it's<00:01:42.049> an<00:01:42.170> underwater<00:01:42.530> zone<00:01:42.649> we've

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
that since it's an underwater zone we've

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.100 
that since it's an underwater zone we've
always<00:01:43.340> had<00:01:43.580> water<00:01:44.060> in<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.390> game<00:01:44.539> and<00:01:44.869> you've

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
always had water in the game and you've

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.990 
always had water in the game and you've
always<00:01:45.320> been<00:01:45.409> able<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.710> swim<00:01:45.979> but<00:01:46.729> it<00:01:46.880> was

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
always been able to swim but it was

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.910 
always been able to swim but it was
never<00:01:47.149> very<00:01:47.330> good<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:48.020> whenever<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:48.740> had<00:01:48.860> to
