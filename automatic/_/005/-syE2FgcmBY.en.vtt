 and then guys on youtube a video of today 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.809
 I'll teach you how to pass the image of 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.570
 your notebook from your computer to 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.170
 watching on television is basically the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.619
 that you will use an hdmi cable and I do not know 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.130
 if you can see right but it is very easy 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.240
 to find that hdmi cable and then by 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.239
 What are you going to have to do? 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.840
 put is the car at the hdmi entrance in your 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.250
 Television is and also in the hdmi input and 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.860
 your computer or notebook 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.070
 from there you go in the configurations of your 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:53.070
 choose where you connect or 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:56.640
 for example I commented on h &amp; m 4 and 3 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:03.930
 ready is already passing the image of the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.769
 notebook is the television show to 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.090
 you 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.090
 the opening of our video 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.710
 then guys that's for those who then is 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.380
 there is not 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.159
 the hdmi cable what can you do 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.959
 can buy is a car from that is from 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.869
 computer will be going here in the 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:36.719
 corner of the screen is this image that you 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.189
 buy this car or if you do not have one 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:43.770
 entrance is on your TV has no input nor 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.770
 for hdmi cable which is what we did 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.289
 was the computer cable video cable 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.899
 computer that is what we go through 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:56.369
 by the image is you can also buy 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:59.819
 An adapter cable is if your TV does not 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.140
 you have is the former cable is a bit more expensive is 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.869
 he 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.270
 instead of putting a hdmi cable in the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.690
 you put the video cable 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.260
 component that famous three colors 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.030
 yellow and white is that it 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.530
 works on any television 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.940
 so for you that does not have a television 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.609
 with hdmi input or pc input you 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.609
 have to buy this car that 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:28.019
 make the hdmi the pc for the cable 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.730
 conventional video 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.269
