been around for many many years many
centuries<00:00:52.280> perhaps<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.780> why<00:00:54.019> should<00:00:54.260> the

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
centuries perhaps and why should the

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.009

everybody should be allowed to make them
to<00:01:01.639> sell<00:01:02.059> them<00:01:02.269> if<00:01:02.420> they<00:01:02.600> want<00:01:02.869> to<00:01:03.079> even<00:01:03.530> if

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
to sell them if they want to even if

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:04.810
