puzzles<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.859> stuff<00:02:16.099> feels<00:02:16.400> pretty<00:02:16.640> tacked

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
puzzles this stuff feels pretty tacked

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.699 
puzzles this stuff feels pretty tacked
on<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.359> a<00:02:17.390> little<00:02:17.629> gimmicky<00:02:18.079> but<00:02:18.560> it's

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
on and a little gimmicky but it's

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.589 
on and a little gimmicky but it's
actually<00:02:19.040> pretty<00:02:19.219> cool<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.790> really<00:02:20.239> adds<00:02:20.450> to

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
actually pretty cool it really adds to

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.500 
actually pretty cool it really adds to
the<00:02:20.689> original<00:02:21.170> game<00:02:21.349> in<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.950> decent<00:02:22.189> way<00:02:22.400> on<00:02:23.180> top

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
the original game in a decent way on top

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.490 
the original game in a decent way on top
of<00:02:23.659> that<00:02:23.780> you've<00:02:23.959> got<00:02:24.140> two<00:02:24.349> different

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
of that you've got two different

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.979 
of that you've got two different
playable<00:02:24.950> characters<00:02:25.549> so<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.510> game<00:02:26.689> takes

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
playable characters so the game takes

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.839 
playable characters so the game takes
about<00:02:27.140> six<00:02:27.650> or<00:02:27.769> seven<00:02:28.040> hours<00:02:28.129> to<00:02:28.430> finish<00:02:28.609> the

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
about six or seven hours to finish the

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.369 
about six or seven hours to finish the
first<00:02:29.030> time<00:02:29.269> through<00:02:29.569> so<00:02:29.810> when<00:02:30.019> you<00:02:30.140> add<00:02:30.260> it

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
first time through so when you add it

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.050 
first time through so when you add it
all<00:02:30.500> up<00:02:30.530> there's<00:02:31.189> actually<00:02:31.519> quite<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.760> bit<00:02:31.939> of

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
all up there's actually quite a bit of

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.369 
all up there's actually quite a bit of
lasting<00:02:32.450> value<00:02:32.480> be<00:02:32.900> ready

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
lasting value be ready

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.349 
lasting value be ready
that's<00:02:33.650> not<00:02:33.859> even<00:02:33.980> accounting<00:02:34.430> for<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.849> four

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
that's not even accounting for the four

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.000 
that's not even accounting for the four
player<00:02:35.599> multiplayer<00:02:35.840> mode<00:02:36.379> that's<00:02:36.560> also<00:02:36.889> in

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
player multiplayer mode that's also in

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.369 
player multiplayer mode that's also in
there<00:02:37.250> as<00:02:38.120> for<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.569> multiplayer<00:02:38.900> there's

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
there as for the multiplayer there's

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.110 
there as for the multiplayer there's
both<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.739> cooperative<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.579> competitive

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
both a cooperative and a competitive

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.879 
both a cooperative and a competitive
mode<00:02:41.389> but<00:02:41.840> in<00:02:41.959> both<00:02:42.109> cases<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.680> don't

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:42.889 
mode but in both cases you don't

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.069 
mode but in both cases you don't
actually<00:02:43.129> see<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:44.209> other<00:02:44.359> players<00:02:44.689> on<00:02:44.959> the

running around with you on screen it's
not<00:03:05.510> necessarily<00:03:06.109> all<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.409> engaging<00:03:06.799> one<00:03:07.579> of

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
compared to with the original is that it

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.580 
compared to with the original is that it
doesn't<00:03:11.389> necessarily<00:03:11.900> look<00:03:11.930> quite<00:03:12.379> as<00:03:12.530> good

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
doesn't necessarily look quite as good

doesn't necessarily look quite as good
the<00:03:13.250> graphics<00:03:13.669> do<00:03:13.849> look<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.060> little<00:03:14.180> washed<00:03:14.449> out

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
the graphics do look a little washed out

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.659 
the graphics do look a little washed out
and<00:03:15.019> take<00:03:15.199> some<00:03:15.229> getting<00:03:15.650> used<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.979> and<00:03:16.069> there

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
and take some getting used to and there

well the Resident Evil series is

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.589 
well the Resident Evil series is
notorious<00:03:25.250> for<00:03:25.280> having<00:03:25.760> characters<00:03:26.419> that

notorious for having characters that

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.780 
notorious for having characters that
control<00:03:26.900> like<00:03:27.109> tanks<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.829> then<00:03:27.949> you<00:03:28.340> push<00:03:28.549> up

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
control like tanks and then you push up

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
to make your character move forward and

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.740 
to make your character move forward and
you<00:03:30.889> kind<00:03:31.190> of<00:03:31.280> turn<00:03:31.459> left<00:03:31.699> and<00:03:31.849> right<00:03:31.940> feels<00:03:32.629> a

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
you kind of turn left and right feels a

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.270 
you kind of turn left and right feels a
little<00:03:32.870> clunky<00:03:33.229> at<00:03:33.440> first<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.889> definitely

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
little clunky at first and definitely

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.219 
little clunky at first and definitely
takes<00:03:34.549> a<00:03:34.639> little<00:03:34.760> while<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.510> get<00:03:35.599> up<00:03:35.659> to<00:03:35.900> speed

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:36.229 
takes a little while to get up to speed

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.319 
takes a little while to get up to speed
ultimately<00:03:37.190> though<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.430> system<00:03:37.909> does<00:03:38.090> work

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
ultimately though the system does work

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.599 
ultimately though the system does work
well<00:03:38.659> because<00:03:39.229> it<00:03:39.530> helps<00:03:39.829> keep<00:03:40.040> you<00:03:40.099> oriented

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
well because it helps keep you oriented

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.789

the sound effects are really excellent

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.059

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:54.229 
separation on the DS even makes it easy

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:56.050 
separation on the DS even makes it easy
to<00:03:54.439> tell<00:03:54.650> where<00:03:55.129> some<00:03:55.370> of<00:03:55.400> your<00:03:55.519> enemies<00:03:55.939> are
