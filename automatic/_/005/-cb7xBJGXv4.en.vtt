00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
little bit so that just that emotion

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.039 
little bit so that just that emotion
just<00:01:01.829> twinkles<00:01:02.760> all<00:01:02.879> back<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.600> sits<00:01:03.989> back

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
just twinkles all back in and sits back

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.710 
just twinkles all back in and sits back
in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> muscle<00:01:04.860> or<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> joint<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.790> your<00:01:06.390> organ

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
in the muscle or the joint or your organ

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.109 
in the muscle or the joint or your organ
or<00:01:06.869> wherever<00:01:07.500> did<00:01:07.770> wherever<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.340> resides<00:01:08.880> in

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
or wherever did wherever it resides in

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.310 
or wherever did wherever it resides in
the<00:01:09.240> body<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.600> these<00:01:12.810> negative

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the body and so it's these negative

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.679 
the body and so it's these negative
emotions<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:14.430> were<00:01:14.580> holding<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.360> all<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
emotions that were holding in all the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.660 
emotions that were holding in all the
time<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:16.650> will<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:16.860> get<00:01:17.070> stressed<00:01:17.490> or

time and then will we get stressed or
anxious<00:01:17.790> or<00:01:18.320> frustrated<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.820> we<00:01:20.820> quite<00:01:21.330> often

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540

somewhere<00:02:42.360> they'll<00:02:42.630> be<00:02:43.019> dense<00:02:43.319> energy<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:44.099> a

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
somewhere they'll be dense energy in a

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.039 
somewhere they'll be dense energy in a
joint<00:02:44.489> or<00:02:44.819> an<00:02:44.910> organ<00:02:45.390> or<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.569> muscle<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:48.180> if

are<00:02:52.019> all<00:02:52.140> like<00:02:52.380> every<00:02:52.860> single<00:02:53.130> kind<00:02:53.250> of

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
are all like every single kind of

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.589 
are all like every single kind of
something<00:02:53.579> half<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.060> reach<00:02:54.239> for<00:02:54.269> food

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
something half of you reach for food

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.750 
something half of you reach for food
reach<00:02:54.840> for<00:02:55.049> food<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.440> obviously<00:02:56.190> what<00:02:56.610> we're

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
reach for food and obviously what we're

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.580 
reach for food and obviously what we're
reaching<00:02:56.940> for<00:02:57.299> something<00:02:57.569> that's<00:02:57.930> more

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
reaching for something that's more

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.949 
reaching for something that's more
acidic<00:02:59.160> as<00:02:59.280> well<00:02:59.459> generally<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.329> then<00:03:00.840> we're

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
acidic as well generally and then we're

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.930 
acidic as well generally and then we're
pushing<00:03:01.260> up<00:03:01.500> further<00:03:01.709> dawn<00:03:02.069> I'm<00:03:02.400> making<00:03:02.730> even

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
pushing up further dawn I'm making even

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.559 
pushing up further dawn I'm making even
more<00:03:03.000> dense<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.900> acidic<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.819> toxic<00:03:05.819> so

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
more dense and acidic and toxic so

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.229 
more dense and acidic and toxic so
eventually<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:07.140> turns<00:03:07.560> up<00:03:07.709> as<00:03:07.890> arthritis<00:03:08.790> or

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
eventually it turns up as arthritis or

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.099 
eventually it turns up as arthritis or
and<00:03:09.680> osteoporosis<00:03:10.680> or<00:03:11.239> just<00:03:12.239> tighten<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:12.989> the

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
and osteoporosis or just tighten of the

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.240 
and osteoporosis or just tighten of the
muscles<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.590> things<00:03:14.130> like<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:16.250> just

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
muscles and things like that so and just
