about technology in a shoe normally you
think<00:00:31.310> of<00:00:31.400> technology<00:00:31.940> associated<00:00:32.540> with

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
think of technology associated with

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.190 
think of technology associated with
clubs<00:00:33.050> yeah<00:00:33.980> you<00:00:34.040> know<00:00:34.280> so<00:00:34.490> footwear

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
clubs yeah you know so footwear

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.910 
clubs yeah you know so footwear
technology<00:00:36.200> is<00:00:36.320> really<00:00:36.440> in<00:00:36.680> its<00:00:36.800> infancy

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
technology is really in its infancy

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.280 
technology is really in its infancy
there's<00:00:37.820> a<00:00:37.880> long<00:00:38.150> way<00:00:38.329> to<00:00:38.390> go<00:00:38.630> in<00:00:38.810> the<00:00:38.900> industry

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
there's a long way to go in the industry

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.860 
there's a long way to go in the industry
is<00:00:39.410> I<00:00:39.590> think<00:00:39.740> been<00:00:40.100> stuck<00:00:40.460> doing<00:00:41.120> things<00:00:41.630> the

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
is I think been stuck doing things the

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.720 
is I think been stuck doing things the
way<00:00:42.050> they've<00:00:42.290> done<00:00:42.530> them<00:00:42.680> for<00:00:42.920> years<00:00:43.220> the

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
way they've done them for years the

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.000 
way they've done them for years the
entire<00:00:44.030> industry<00:00:44.510> uses<00:00:44.900> two<00:00:45.200> attachment

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
entire industry uses two attachment

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.250 
entire industry uses two attachment
system<00:00:46.130> for<00:00:46.579> cleats<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.090> they're<00:00:47.960> fairly

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
system for cleats and they're fairly

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.680 
system for cleats and they're fairly
thick<00:00:48.680> so<00:00:49.280> for<00:00:49.550> us<00:00:49.579> we<00:00:49.940> knew<00:00:50.180> that<00:00:50.210> if<00:00:50.480> we<00:00:50.510> were

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
thick so for us we knew that if we were

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.690 
thick so for us we knew that if we were
going<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:50.840> achieve<00:00:51.560> our<00:00:52.010> ultimate<00:00:52.040> goal<00:00:52.520> of

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
going to achieve our ultimate goal of

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.220 
going to achieve our ultimate goal of
bringing<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.090> golfers<00:00:53.480> foot<00:00:53.720> closer<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.140> the

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
bringing the golfers foot closer to the

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.950 
bringing the golfers foot closer to the
ground<00:00:54.410> we<00:00:55.040> had<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:55.370> reinvent<00:00:56.120> that<00:00:56.510> system

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
ground we had to reinvent that system

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.200 
ground we had to reinvent that system
reengineer<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.710> system<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.730> industry<00:00:59.180> is

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
reengineer the system the industry is

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.990 
reengineer the system the industry is
here<00:00:59.660> with<00:00:59.809> fast<00:01:00.140> twist<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:00.770> q<00:01:00.980> locke<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.430> we

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
here with fast twist and q locke and we

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.450 
here with fast twist and q locke and we
created<00:01:02.450> a<00:01:02.510> new<00:01:02.630> system<00:01:03.020> called<00:01:03.079> fintech<00:01:03.800> so

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
created a new system called fintech so

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.039 
created a new system called fintech so
tell<00:01:04.789> me<00:01:04.819> what<00:01:05.059> kind<00:01:05.149> of<00:01:05.269> challenges<00:01:05.840> were

tell me what kind of challenges were
associated<00:01:06.889> with<00:01:06.920> creating<00:01:07.759> thin<00:01:07.999> tech<00:01:08.240> well

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
associated with creating thin tech well

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.270 
associated with creating thin tech well
you<00:01:09.259> know<00:01:09.350> we<00:01:09.439> took<00:01:09.590> this<00:01:09.740> really<00:01:10.069> seriously

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
we didn't want to just make the same

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.719 
we didn't want to just make the same
product<00:01:12.649> that<00:01:12.829> was<00:01:12.920> out<00:01:13.069> there<00:01:13.249> in<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.490> in<00:01:13.670> the

case so how did you guys go about doing
this<00:01:48.709> a<00:01:49.069> long<00:01:49.639> process<00:01:50.060> really<00:01:50.599> three<00:01:50.959> years

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
this a long process really three years

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.370
