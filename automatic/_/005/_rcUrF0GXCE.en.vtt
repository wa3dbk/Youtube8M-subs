00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:17.610
 the title in the best if of minecraft 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:19.230
 Well the best system is the best 78 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.430
 It is stable and good 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.120
 we'll see 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.120
 what we have 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.500
 the greater is worth or is very first 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.360
 until finished is what there is more 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.050
 and it's worth we offer next to a 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.050
 villa 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.760
 to a pirate villa of this pyramid but 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.760
 let's see what there is not 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.820
 and the best friends 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.990
 that is 13 gold ingots and a wood 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.770
 to agree 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.780
 16 bones 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.740
 to have 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.740
 the amount I understand is another 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.740
 opportunity 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.040
 others and another person 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.299
 so kiss 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.890
 we go for everyone to this position 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.000
 what do I fall 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.790
 they are all 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.400
 with two grills 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.060
 when I grow some clear bookstores 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.060
 there and what matters most to us 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.310
 usual 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.160
 two 52 iron swords and targets with 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.270
 diamond eyes and two apples 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.580
 we go to another place 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.580
 this is the description 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.989
 I do not want to have 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.340
 well I think this to begin with 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.790
 it is quite frequent 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.890
 we do not show them here 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:02.990
 and not 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.990
 to see to see I'm sorry for this 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.150
 here we have 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.380
 this we have already know that it seems without weird 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.810
 it seems real 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.860
 but they are two together or this is 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.760
 you may not see again 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.760
 although life is worth 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.709
 the next would be that my father 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.709
 little girl 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.180
 that by the way I do not know 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.180
 I think this is 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.930
 well then nothing else you will find the 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.930
 book 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.550
 and we go to the third village 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.810
 and that is agreed time 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.280
 I repeat that he will have it in the description and 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.180

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.400
 spanair sister 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.470
 this skeleton the one we have is worth 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.920
 for now now normal 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:21.329
 but not 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.329
 we have all this and go to another site 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:30.340

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.340

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.630

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:39.340

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.910
 site 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.910
