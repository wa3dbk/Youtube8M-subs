in<00:00:03.690> my<00:00:03.929> Mobius<00:00:04.440> setup<00:00:05.100> review<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.939> comparison

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:06.149 
in my Mobius setup review and comparison

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:08.780 
in my Mobius setup review and comparison
video<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.439> there<00:00:08.040> has<00:00:08.220> been<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.430> couple<00:00:08.670> of

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
video and there has been a couple of

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.480 
video and there has been a couple of
questions<00:00:09.210> from<00:00:09.900> subscribers<00:00:10.260> around<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
questions from subscribers around the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.060 
questions from subscribers around the
latency<00:00:12.090> now<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.690> latency<00:00:13.200> when<00:00:13.950> you're

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
latency now the latency when you're

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.550 
latency now the latency when you're
talking<00:00:14.400> about<00:00:14.610> first<00:00:15.120> person<00:00:15.540> video<00:00:15.660> or<00:00:16.019> fpv

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
talking about first person video or fpv

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.710 
talking about first person video or fpv
is<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.130> delay<00:00:17.430> between<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.849> camera<00:00:18.180> seeing

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
is the delay between the camera seeing

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.960 
is the delay between the camera seeing
something<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:20.100> appearing<00:00:20.580> on<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.940> screen

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
something and it appearing on the screen

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.000 
something and it appearing on the screen
on<00:00:21.510> either<00:00:21.780> your<00:00:21.990> goggles<00:00:22.350> or<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.800> ground

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
on either your goggles or the ground

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.620 
on either your goggles or the ground
station<00:00:23.280> that<00:00:23.580> you're<00:00:23.699> using<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.119> look<00:00:24.449> at<00:00:24.539> the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
station that you're using to look at the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.450 
station that you're using to look at the
image<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.529> i<00:00:25.560> thought<00:00:25.770> the<00:00:25.890> easiest<00:00:26.279> way<00:00:26.400> to

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
image so i thought the easiest way to

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.620 
image so i thought the easiest way to
actually<00:00:27.240> show<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.570> what<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.470> delay<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.220> like

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
actually show you what the delay is like

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.599 
actually show you what the delay is like
because<00:00:30.630> all<00:00:30.750> cameras<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> delay<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:32.489> a

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:32.609 
because all cameras have a delay just a

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:36.590 
because all cameras have a delay just a
case<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.420> how<00:00:34.370> slow<00:00:35.370> or<00:00:35.519> fast<00:00:35.550> they<00:00:35.969> are<00:00:36.149> for

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
case of how slow or fast they are for

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.209 
case of how slow or fast they are for
the<00:00:36.690> easiest<00:00:36.989> way<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.140> do<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.499> would<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:37.679> to<00:00:37.829> set

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
the easiest way to do it would be to set

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.369 
the easiest way to do it would be to set
this<00:00:38.429> up<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:39.179> a<00:00:39.210> little<00:00:39.539> fpv<00:00:39.929> transmitter

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
this up with a little fpv transmitter

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.000 
this up with a little fpv transmitter
have<00:00:41.069> it<00:00:41.399> by<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.179> side<00:00:42.449> of<00:00:42.780> my<00:00:42.870> little<00:00:43.559> ground

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
have it by the side of my little ground

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.489 
have it by the side of my little ground
station<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.729> then<00:00:45.510> do<00:00:45.870> something<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.260> wag

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:46.499 
station and then do something like wag

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:48.319 
station and then do something like wag
on<00:00:46.649> my<00:00:46.739> finger<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.159> front<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.460> lens<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.850> see

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
on my finger in front the lens and see

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.289 
on my finger in front the lens and see
the<00:00:48.839> delay<00:00:49.139> between<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.920> live<00:00:50.219> action<00:00:50.429> and<00:00:50.850> it

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:51.299 
the delay between the live action and it

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.719 
the delay between the live action and it
appearing<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.199> video<00:00:52.409> screen<00:00:52.469> I'll<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.579> it

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
appearing on the video screen I'll do it

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.250 
appearing on the video screen I'll do it
with<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> couple<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.239> versions<00:00:54.389> of<00:00:54.629> firmware<00:00:54.839> in

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
with a couple of versions of firmware in

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.049 
with a couple of versions of firmware in
case<00:00:55.709> there's<00:00:56.010> any<00:00:56.100> optimization<00:00:56.909> with<00:00:56.999> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
case there's any optimization with the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.389 
case there's any optimization with the
later<00:00:57.209> versions<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.899> hopefully<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.309> will

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
later versions and hopefully that will

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.309 
later versions and hopefully that will
answer<00:00:59.639> those<00:01:00.269> that<00:01:00.690> were<00:01:00.749> asking<00:01:01.139> the

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:01.319 
answer those that were asking the

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.529 
answer those that were asking the
question<00:01:01.679> so<00:01:02.549> let<00:01:02.729> me<00:01:02.760> put<00:01:02.879> some<00:01:03.030> kit<00:01:03.329> together

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
question so let me put some kit together

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.550 
question so let me put some kit together
and<00:01:03.809> I'll<00:01:04.500> come<00:01:04.799> straight<00:01:04.890> back<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.380> we've

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and I'll come straight back so we've

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.230 
and I'll come straight back so we've
connected<00:01:07.830> all<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.310> equipment<00:01:08.910> up<00:01:09.030> now<00:01:09.180> we

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
connected all the equipment up now we

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.300 
connected all the equipment up now we
have<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> little<00:01:09.870> 25<00:01:10.500> milli<00:01:10.710> watt<00:01:10.860> transmitter

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
have a little 25 milli watt transmitter

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.280 
have a little 25 milli watt transmitter
of<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> little<00:01:11.910> dipole<00:01:12.300> aerial<00:01:12.720> that's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
of the little dipole aerial that's

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.590 
of the little dipole aerial that's
connected<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.950> dipole<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.610> top<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.300> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
connected to the dipole on top of the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.390 
connected to the dipole on top of the
transmitter<00:01:15.990> itself<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.920> connected<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
transmitter itself just connected to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.730 
transmitter itself just connected to
that<00:01:17.490> one<00:01:17.700> sin<00:01:18.000> battery<00:01:18.660> that's<00:01:19.140> running<00:01:19.410> both

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
that one sin battery that's running both

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.920 
that one sin battery that's running both
the<00:01:19.890> screen<00:01:20.190> and<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:21.330> little<00:01:21.450> transmitter

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the screen and the little transmitter

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.170 
the screen and the little transmitter
and<00:01:22.590> we've<00:01:22.710> got<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> good<00:01:23.310> ole<00:01:23.430> Mobius<00:01:23.850> over

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and we've got the good ole Mobius over

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.650 
and we've got the good ole Mobius over
here<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.170> version<00:01:25.490> 1.2<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> firmware

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
here this is version 1.2 of the firmware

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.570 
here this is version 1.2 of the firmware
so<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> simplest<00:01:28.740> way<00:01:28.980> for<00:01:29.010> me<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.280> show<00:01:29.400> you

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
so the simplest way for me to show you

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.550 
so the simplest way for me to show you
the<00:01:29.790> lag<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.300> said<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.960> walk<00:01:31.230> all<00:01:31.410> my

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the lag it said if I just walk all my

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.550 
the lag it said if I just walk all my
finger<00:01:32.010> in<00:01:32.220> front<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> lens<00:01:33.570> very

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
finger in front of the lens very

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.000 
finger in front of the lens very
scientific<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:36.120> what<00:01:36.300> I'll<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.660> is<00:01:37.010> I'll

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
scientific but what I'll do is I'll

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.620 
scientific but what I'll do is I'll
actually<00:01:38.280> use<00:01:38.730> the<00:01:38.910> video<00:01:39.060> editing<00:01:39.600> software

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
actually use the video editing software

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.380 
actually use the video editing software
to<00:01:40.620> work<00:01:40.650> out<00:01:41.040> how<00:01:41.220> many<00:01:41.400> frames<00:01:41.790> there<00:01:42.240> are

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
to work out how many frames there are

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.149 
to work out how many frames there are
between<00:01:43.050> my<00:01:43.710> finger<00:01:44.220> moving<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.910> the<00:01:45.630> Mobius

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
between my finger moving on the Mobius

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.580 
between my finger moving on the Mobius
and<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.370> appearing<00:01:47.940> on<00:01:48.120> the<00:01:48.600> diversity<00:01:49.230> screen

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and it appearing on the diversity screen

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.540 
and it appearing on the diversity screen
but<00:01:50.370> you<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.670> see<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:52.040> there<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.190> slight

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
but you can see that there is a slight

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.440 
but you can see that there is a slight
lag<00:01:54.260> but<00:01:55.260> it's<00:01:55.470> slight<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> what<00:01:57.090> I'm<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.360> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
lag but it's slight so what I'm going to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.680 
lag but it's slight so what I'm going to
do<00:01:57.659> now<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.170> I'm<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.530> going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.450> update<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
do now is I'm just going to update the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.490 
do now is I'm just going to update the
firmware<00:02:01.760> so<00:02:02.760> that<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.510> the<00:02:03.900> latest<00:02:04.050> version

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
firmware so that it's the latest version

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.830 
firmware so that it's the latest version
and<00:02:04.920> we'll<00:02:05.610> come<00:02:05.850> back<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.330> we'll<00:02:06.390> try<00:02:06.810> it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and we'll come back and we'll try it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.629 
and we'll come back and we'll try it
again<00:02:09.799> okay<00:02:10.799> so<00:02:10.859> I've<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.189> put<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.430> all<00:02:11.519> back

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:11.639 
again okay so I've just put it all back

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.129 
again okay so I've just put it all back
together<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.239> camera<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.689> now<00:02:12.870> running

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:13.139 
together the camera is now running

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.090 
together the camera is now running
version<00:02:13.469> 2.2<00:02:14.189> five<00:02:14.549> of<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.849> firmware<00:02:15.090> will<00:02:15.810> do

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
version 2.2 five of the firmware will do

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.980 
version 2.2 five of the firmware will do
same<00:02:16.310> finger<00:02:16.700> test<00:02:16.940> so<00:02:17.600> I've<00:02:17.720> done<00:02:17.870> the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
same finger test so I've done the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.550 
same finger test so I've done the
analysis<00:02:18.410> now<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.340> version<00:02:20.330> 1.2<00:02:20.840> 0<00:02:21.230> and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
analysis now of the version 1.2 0 and

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.160 
analysis now of the version 1.2 0 and
2.25<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:22.970> it's<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.120> pretty<00:02:23.300> consistent<00:02:23.870> number

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
2.25 and it's a pretty consistent number

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.410 
2.25 and it's a pretty consistent number
looking<00:02:24.890> at<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.100> video<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.910> frame<00:02:26.150> rate

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
looking at the video and the frame rate

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.140 
looking at the video and the frame rate
every<00:02:27.110> frame<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.190> editing<00:02:28.760> software

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
every frame and the editing software

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.700 
every frame and the editing software
that<00:02:29.240> I'm<00:02:29.330> working<00:02:29.510> at<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.900> moment<00:02:30.050> is<00:02:30.380> about

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
that I'm working at the moment is about

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.760 
that I'm working at the moment is about
40<00:02:31.280> milliseconds<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:32.480> it's<00:02:32.660> five<00:02:33.020> frames

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
40 milliseconds and it's five frames

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.000 
40 milliseconds and it's five frames
delay<00:02:34.430> on<00:02:34.700> both<00:02:35.570> firmware<00:02:36.080> versions<00:02:36.560> between

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
delay on both firmware versions between

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.880 
delay on both firmware versions between
me<00:02:37.160> moving<00:02:37.490> my<00:02:37.520> finger<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.540> same<00:02:38.900> motion

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
me moving my finger and that same motion

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.430 
me moving my finger and that same motion
showing<00:02:40.610> on<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.910> screen<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.480> that's<00:02:42.080> five

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
showing on the screen so that's five

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.610 
showing on the screen so that's five
lots<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.370> 40<00:02:43.700> milliseconds<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.480> it's<00:02:44.690> 200

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
lots of 40 milliseconds so it's 200

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.100 
lots of 40 milliseconds so it's 200
milliseconds<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:46.940> it's<00:02:47.090> point2<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.720> second

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
milliseconds so it's point2 of a second

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.650 
milliseconds so it's point2 of a second
is<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.590> lag<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:49.370> this<00:02:49.730> particular<00:02:50.060> test

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
is the lag in this particular test

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.870 
is the lag in this particular test
between<00:02:50.990> me<00:02:51.470> doing<00:02:51.680> something<00:02:52.370> on<00:02:52.460> the<00:02:52.550> camera

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
between me doing something on the camera

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.730 
between me doing something on the camera
and<00:02:53.060> seeing<00:02:53.300> it<00:02:53.450> in<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.600> goggles<00:02:53.960> which<00:02:54.470> for

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
and seeing it in the goggles which for

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.680 
and seeing it in the goggles which for
most<00:02:54.920> fpv<00:02:55.520> flying<00:02:55.850> is<00:02:56.090> going<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.600> be

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
most fpv flying is going to be

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.750 
most fpv flying is going to be
absolutely<00:02:56.990> fine<00:02:57.380> so<00:02:58.340> hopefully<00:02:58.610> that

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
absolutely fine so hopefully that

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.820 
absolutely fine so hopefully that
