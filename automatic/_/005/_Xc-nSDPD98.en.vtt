 and good morning he won on Wednesday 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.440
 absolutely not expected because I wanted to 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.389
 post review Saturday but I made it 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.849
 I realize that there is really very little 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.129
 to say right game and I wanted anyway 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.550
 do it because if I have to describe in two 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.289
 words I can only say that is a ficata 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.289
 hallucinating and therefore knowing you can 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.980
 guess that this is a driving fps 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.380
 sporty no jrpg a rpg in of created 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.509

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.260
 also known as francesco 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.950
 piccolelli and matteo nicolotti and then 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.290
 incredible this is the first game 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.670
 grows cisco developed entirely by 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.989
 Italian 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.160
 history history is so simple 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:48.280
 how unique nigel mike giorni and francis 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.170
 are four nerd nerds that one day 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.109
 like another they find themselves at home 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.780
 gold gamesmaster benjamin to make himself 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.829
 a heavy match the usual heavy moon 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.870
 dungeons and dragons 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:04.449
 but to a new game of andy that is two 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.080
 right each one of them chooses one 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.940
 magician warrior ninja and pirate class e 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.290
 after a few minutes after entering 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.840
 a strange room is found again 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.550
 catapulted into a fantasy world 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.550
 threatened by the evil dark eidos 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.860
 and to have fun there will not be only i 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.750
 protagonists that every time 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.480
 they will open their mouth they will shoot blasts 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.760
 crazy but there are quotes and parodies 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.070
 to no end of the most famous video games 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.630
 and movies and anime 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.460
 therefore we cannot the fans 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.550
 do nothing but play for the whole 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.170
 time with a smile on his face 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.330
 the gameplay is very popular with the gg pg 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.860
 those out on nes and super put 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.910
 then in 2d with the flight view 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.220
 bird bought turn-based fights 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.070
 which are shown to us from the bar in 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.890
 so high as to be able to understand what I know 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.570
 which enemy to bat first 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.660
 each character will specialize in 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.180
 one of the four main parameters 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.310
 power, dexterity, grit and sympathy that 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.890
 we could pump level reviews is that 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.890
 every few points will give power points 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.870
 that are used to equip skills 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.330
 passive and the techniques you buy 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.160
 from the merchants that obviously come 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.160
 also equipment and healing objects 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.990
 but not similar shit potions but that 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.990
 stop adaptive beer pizza 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.519
 and it's all very nice and fast 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.170
 although in my opinion not exaggerated a little 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.989
 with random encounters home seems to 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.659
 play the iv fantasy ball but at least yes 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.879
 he manages to escape the game easily 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.439
 offers from 10 to 15 hours based on 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.870
 how much is given to the missions 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.939
 secondary and trust that there are 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.859
 several and they are many if they are 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:52.129
 we compare with the price 5 euros on 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:55.069
 desulo 400 microsoft points ultra 60 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.870
 while on windows phone it was free 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.040
 you had to take advantage of the first suckers 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.680
 now it's at 99 cents I can buy 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.030
 a coffee and bueno and from there are prices 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.650
 ridiculous 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.900
 I think it is a must for lovers 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.250
 of the genre but it is also to be tried for 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.720
 all the others 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.700

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.459

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.069
