00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
magic I see there's what physical can go

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.310 
magic I see there's what physical can go
through<00:01:09.030> ok<00:01:09.930> that's<00:01:10.260> kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.890> weird<00:01:11.250> let's<00:01:11.760> go

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
through ok that's kind of weird let's go

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.469 
through ok that's kind of weird let's go
for<00:01:13.320> setup<00:01:13.860> will<00:01:14.100> still<00:01:14.549> see<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
for setup will still see what the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.390 
for setup will still see what the
rectangle<00:01:16.259> goes<00:01:16.439> well<00:01:16.680> I'm<00:01:16.799> not<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> get

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400

rectangle goes well I'm not going to get
in<00:01:17.670> ok<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.020> snuck<00:01:19.259> over<00:01:19.320> there

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
in ok and you snuck over there

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.480 
in ok and you snuck over there
why<00:01:20.680> must<00:01:21.009> you<00:01:21.280> be<00:01:21.790> so<00:01:22.350> bothersome<00:01:23.490> like

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
why must you be so bothersome like

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.789 
why must you be so bothersome like
foreal<00:01:24.850> here<00:01:25.180> so<00:01:25.509> let's<00:01:25.780> this<00:01:25.990> control<00:01:26.619> the

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
foreal here so let's this control the

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.730 
foreal here so let's this control the
ground<00:01:27.130> is<00:01:27.640> no<00:01:27.820> for<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.270> best<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:29.470> throw

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
ground is no for the best to throw

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.070 
ground is no for the best to throw
things<00:01:30.009> around<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.970> animal<00:01:31.450> clean<00:01:31.720> up<00:01:31.899> the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
things around the animal clean up the

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
things around the animal clean up the
mess<00:01:32.490> saturated<00:01:33.490> time<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.539> guess<00:01:35.079> gear<00:01:35.560> counts

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
mess saturated time I guess gear counts

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.670 
mess saturated time I guess gear counts
as<00:01:36.220> physical<00:01:36.909> don't<00:01:37.299> know<00:01:37.390> about<00:01:37.509> that<00:01:37.680> there

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
as physical don't know about that there

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.560 
as physical don't know about that there
you<00:01:38.799> go<00:01:38.979> when<00:01:39.250> though<00:01:39.429> you<00:01:39.490> finally<00:01:40.119> appeared
