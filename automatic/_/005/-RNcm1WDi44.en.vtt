00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.770
 is that good 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.630
 God 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.279
 during the e3 sawing is dying light 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.650
 passing an open world I sang one 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.239
 the warner brothers on the market in 2014 ' 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.770
 bring hope and that soft one actually 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.930
 very good looking 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.820
 it is a game where we enter the e3 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.739
 saw for any part of the day 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.239
 so we saw that by day 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.220
 huge open game world 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.470
 especially can run and climb to those 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.780
 Huge numbers of zombies to escape and 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.879
 it felt good 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.350
 refresh the idea that you are not so much into it 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.809
 weapons depend on 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.550
 for example dead rising but that you 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.539
 more is the game-play trail 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.320
 where you especially 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.320
 can run and climb 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.289
 well that was convincing we now have something 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.659
 seen more of and 8 shared and that is 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.920
 something different because at night then 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.450
 those zombies are becoming a lot 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.340
 writers eat here they become a lot 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.689
 more aggressive and perhaps even more so 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.520
 more important is to get a small one 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.289
 bit of the same skills that you have 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.579
 so they can also run fast or they 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.380
 can rider anyway 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.299
 and so they can actually climb 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.860
 you get the weapons you need from 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.509
 have about day to miss that so 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.539
 also at night and that makes it a lot much 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.459
 harder to escape from them 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.349
 there is also a kind of aggression 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.119
 system so everything you do whatever 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:47.490
 cause a noise and run 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.950
 for example, but also zombies 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.630
 chop or shoot 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.280
 that will make them aggressive making them 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.840
 just not being inclined anymore 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.489
 to turn on at 8 am 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.079
 luckily you can do something during the day 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:59.489
 prepare every night 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.420
 what more bearable you can 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.310
 for instance 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.750
 put traps and have number 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.970
 examples of that 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.039
 so you can for example that yes I am looking 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.110
 his plate with huge nails the ring 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.600
 you can focus so that when you get there 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.239
 at night with a kind of sliding underneath 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.739
 by that thing falls down and 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.810
 all zombies that are after you or after you 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.209
 at least the largest part of it 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.750
 crush what we also saw is kind 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.310
 you can fall during the day 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.660
 say the switch 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.579
 and at night if you are fast enough 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.750
 itself a touch interest rates to nothing the 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.239
 hand with the zombies following you 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.250
 which are electrocuted 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.440
 And then you are in any case 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.569
 temporarily safe again 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.940
 so you can do it during the day 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.880
 set a kind of trail 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.850
 of work involving some safe 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.790
 place where you enter at night 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.799
 at least a little breath of hair again 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.120
 take a breath point because yes it is at night 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.130
 just dangerous to be quick 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.239
 but as long as you make sure you like that 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.470
 put traps then you have at least 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.470
 occasionally some air 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.600
 what else saw is that you are kind 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.190
 We have had a horse upgrade throughout 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.360
 seen little actually wanted the 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.520
 developers are not too concerned about it 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.690
 but you can use your skills 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.610
 upgrade 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.480
 for example you can go to them kind of 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.110
 to 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.850
 wrestling posture involving zombies 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.459
 in a sort of hold over your shadow 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.290
 can flicker but actually that is 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.520
 maybe not even the most important thing 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.470
 especially the you can be broad you 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.270
 weapons and then you do n't have to 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.920
 think of dead rising that is quite 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.290
 very over the top it is that much 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.989
 small scale so what we for example 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.430
 sawing is that you can make sandwiches 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.560
 can make fireworks that seem whole 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.910
 simple and it is actually also on 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.800
 otherwise it is not that special 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.510
 just kind screaming to cook 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.220
 can throw on the ground but of course 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.000
 thing makes shows make light thing 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.230
 noise 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.930
 That ensures that you at least 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.780
 again briefly with those traps h 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.550
 get to the well 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.670
 it works as a kind you can kind 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.730
 and find recipes in your own base 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.280
 because who you have you can who who who 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.739
 you can make those weapons and take them as 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.419
 you set off at night or during the day 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.890
 that basis concerns there you have is one 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.169
 from the beginning of the game and like it 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.600
 well you get the days last me 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.390
 am no more of it is what i said one 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.610
 big open game world and there are one 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.860
 number of zones but that is exactly it 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.510
 point where the makers are actually still 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.890
 didn't want to tell anything about so how 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.780
 that is with the developing traffic 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.910
 developing new weapons 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.500
 but they can actually want this 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.820
 moment nothing about letting go that is 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.590
 a shame because that actually means I have 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.020
 not such a very good picture of the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.490
 game can get that run and that 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.620
 climbing the dust and that is exactly 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.419
 what sets the game apart from others 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.820
 zombie game they depend on much more 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:57.510
 are just plain ram and that is 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.160
 really absolute here in that case so that 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.750
 that run that's a cool part how 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.430
 that is precisely where development is concerned 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.470
 that you go through you get harder 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.970
 opponents it seems to get well 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.440
 you have more options it seems so 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.660
 unfortunately I cannot yet go there 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.220
 telling too much about what I can do 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.430
 tell on the game on all sorts 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.979
 platforms comes out windows 360 xbox one 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.669
 playstation 3 playstation 4 but beware 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.669
 2014 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.980
 Yes
