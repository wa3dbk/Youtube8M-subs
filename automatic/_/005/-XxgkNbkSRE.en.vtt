 super easy prepared for us 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.460
 we needed these two ingredients and 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.320
 though bananas and oatmeal 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.060
 You can do a lot of different things 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.800
 variants do as it is on 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.300
 best tastes in the beautiful thing about it 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.220

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.260
 produce and gave only perfect if 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.300
 visit announced at the door 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.720
 because they are super fast 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.309
 super easy 15 minutes of baking too 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.350
 really short so that's why you have 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.030
 always on the fast what you can 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.739
 because ingredients as pure as you 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.450
 Of course this is also perfect 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.160
 you can shape yourselves like you 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.500
 want 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.989
 I have the little version now 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.829
 of urban and oatmeal, staring 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.200
 I just do a little bit more 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.510
 community vanilla pure then I have here 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.449
 the favorites in my family and that 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.719
 Three have since kathrin are few 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.850
 nuts and peter nissen and chocolate 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.480
 drop and then I still have here 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.990
 a banana version made that is 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.180
 once with cocoa-dried bananas 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.189
 and pb to peanut butter 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.570
 but I would have a bit more of that 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.500
 I have to do that , I have that 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.450
 always do it a bit 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.040
 Feel and there would have been a bit quiet 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.810
 more of them will otherwise have the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.580
 i can definitely give you a mechanic 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.470
 only recommend it so if you are now 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.150
 want to know how fast and easy that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.189
 Whole you can prepare yourself 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.930
 ingredients you needed and everything 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.930
 I'll show you a lot more fun now 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.150
 so the whole thing is great 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.619
 so let's just take three 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.640
 Bananas I'm doing three now 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.670
 different variations and gives the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.320
 just because 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:49.600
 in a bowl or in my case of 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:54.149
 three bowls, but we take each other 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.149
 just a gift and to press 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.580
 really nice to press that long 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:13.280
 her really nice macho from the banana 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.379
 I'll do that with one now 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.940
 three bowls so after we do the whole thing 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.629
 just done just like that 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.019
 A small coffee cup and give the 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:28.940
 full with oatmeal just that 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.940
 are about 50 grams 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.580
 you just have to look like 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:39.390
 they have the whole gold and ever 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.269
 After so many people I find 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.160
 the best with the 50 gram 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:50.000
 I have a ball here now 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.310
 these are nuts and peanuts now 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.900
 cashewkerne then we just take each other 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.569
 I have a few more chocolate drops 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:07.650
 Now this one to bake reeve 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:13.079
 and just give us some more 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:16.160
 show with that and then the whole will 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.160
 already mixed 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:32.650
 and you see that I'm one of those 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.650
 beautiful smooth mass of it forms 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.810
 but if you like that hammer 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:45.070
 have worked then are the first 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.510
 cookies already finished and take us 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:51.610
 yes I just sometimes thought a whole 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.720
 normal very small version of yes the 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.000
 and just a little taste 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.320
 I just want to go there now 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.610
 a little vanilla community was just for that 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.610
 and from the mixed as well 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.299
 then it is already the second version 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:19.810
 we're all done now and there 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.579
 just chocolate banana out the heart 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.220
 just stands a bit character 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:28.690
 so it's not too cacau about it 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:33.760
 but backhaus and then have here 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.470
 dried banana goes perfectly with 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.419
 but you can also taste bananas 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.600
 take any other fruits 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.010
 cranberries mangoes whatever but 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.870
 I now find easy to this 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:49.060
 Banana cookies first also stop the 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.340
 dried bananas very good and 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.370
 bad me just another 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:58.330
 small piece and then I give 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.770
 a bit of pipi thum with chocolate 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.740
 just add another one 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.740
 bit of the liquid taste gets 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.930
 and then that is already mingled 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.560
 and then it's already the third variation 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.669
 the very simple oat cookies who so 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.660
 then I'll just get my tin 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.550
 and then I always agree 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.669
 a little something from it just like that 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.950
 a little sun little ball and 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:32.289
 pushes that a bit flat and 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:34.930
 put simply so again why sheet 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.789
 small mini meatballs but would be 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.520
 not the whole format myself too 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:42.010
 already in front of the oven 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.979
 in my case now to 180 degrees 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.080
 so that then the same for about 15 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.640
 minutes in the oven 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.930
 My loved ones are ready then too 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.960
 our cookie is now 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.940
 here are the normal banana cookies 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.600
 with a bit of vanilla 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:03.220
 These are the ones with chocolate droplets 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:06.700
 and all the spoon and this one here 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:11.530
 are now with yes with 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:14.320
 cocoa powder and the dried bananas 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.400
 and a bit of a pipi tour 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.169
 I also try this one though 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.909
 still pretty hot but i can 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.860
 hardly wait I'm really curious 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:24.180
 For me personally, it would be quiet 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.180
 can offer a little more 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.300
 is not now but tastes like 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:36.340
 then of course they are delicious and delicious 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.690
 that they are healthier, of course 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.890
 I need other cookies 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.010
 Certainly tell me because you have 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:44.380
 just no sugar in it no 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.720
 refined white nothing really only 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.050
 To have delicious healthy ingredients 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.190
 These clones at the clinical on 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.200
 every case very delicious 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.540
 the riper the bananas are the sweeter 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.230
 Of course, the kuki will be up later 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.170
 every case a very delicious 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.160
