00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.920 
suicide maybe there was some elaborate
plan<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.700> take<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.180> airplane<00:01:57.630> somewhere

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
plan to to take this airplane somewhere

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.870 
plan to to take this airplane somewhere
and<00:01:58.290> do<00:01:58.380> something<00:01:58.770> with<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.520> all<00:01:59.700> those

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
and do something with it but all those

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.740 
and do something with it but all those
things<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.210> we're<00:02:00.390> thinking<00:02:00.570> about

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
things that we're thinking about

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.660 
things that we're thinking about
yesterday<00:02:01.079> with<00:02:01.409> catastrophic<00:02:01.799> kinds<00:02:02.579> of

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
yesterday with catastrophic kinds of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.990 
yesterday with catastrophic kinds of
things

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
things

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.730 
things
we're<00:02:03.420> probably<00:02:03.659> leaning<00:02:04.170> more<00:02:04.350> towards

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
we're probably leaning more towards

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.560 
we're probably leaning more towards
something<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.219> those<00:02:05.520> pilots<00:02:06.030> or<00:02:06.210> one<00:02:06.450> of

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
something that those pilots or one of

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.930 
something that those pilots or one of
those<00:02:06.689> pilots<00:02:07.200> did<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:08.310> involve<00:02:08.640> something

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
those pilots did that involve something

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.699 
those pilots did that involve something
catastrophic<00:02:09.360> what<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.140> deliberate<00:02:10.560> act

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
catastrophic what that deliberate act

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.730 
catastrophic what that deliberate act
make<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:11.129> still

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740

other big news of the day we thought

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.470 
other big news of the day we thought
that<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.070> airplane<00:02:18.520> could<00:02:18.790> have<00:02:18.940> crashed<00:02:19.210> at

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
that this airplane could have crashed at

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.510 
that this airplane could have crashed at
the<00:02:19.570> 49<00:02:19.990> minute<00:02:20.260> mark<00:02:20.470> we<00:02:20.650> now<00:02:20.860> know<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.400> it

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
the 49 minute mark we now know that it

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.670 
the 49 minute mark we now know that it
flew<00:02:21.700> for<00:02:21.910> four<00:02:22.210> to<00:02:22.360> five<00:02:22.540> hours<00:02:22.900> think<00:02:23.470> about

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
flew for four to five hours think about

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.380 
flew for four to five hours think about
how<00:02:23.860> far<00:02:24.100> that<00:02:24.280> airplane<00:02:24.700> could<00:02:24.880> have<00:02:25.000> gone<00:02:25.180> in

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
how far that airplane could have gone in

how far that airplane could have gone in
fortified<00:02:25.720> we<00:02:26.140> know<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.620> from<00:02:26.920> some<00:02:27.220> us

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
fortified we know this from some us

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.060 
fortified we know this from some us
capability<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.540> am<00:02:28.780> assuming<00:02:29.230> does<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:29.770> mean

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
capability I am assuming does this mean

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.550 
capability I am assuming does this mean
that<00:02:30.310> we<00:02:30.760> also<00:02:31.030> know<00:02:31.390> pretty<00:02:31.840> much<00:02:32.110> exactly

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
that we also know pretty much exactly

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.860 
that we also know pretty much exactly
where<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.040> plane<00:02:33.250> is<00:02:33.280> unfortunately<00:02:34.210> not<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
where the plane is unfortunately not the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.870 
where the plane is unfortunately not the
data<00:02:35.080> that<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.380> apparently<00:02:36.250> is<00:02:36.400> coming<00:02:36.580> out

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
data that that apparently is coming out

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.120 
data that that apparently is coming out
just<00:02:37.330> says<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.020> airplane<00:02:38.470> was<00:02:38.680> airborne

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
just says that the airplane was airborne

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.980 
just says that the airplane was airborne
it<00:02:39.370> doesn't<00:02:39.730> tell<00:02:39.880> us<00:02:39.910> what<00:02:40.270> direction<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.900> was

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
it doesn't tell us what direction it was

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.960 
it doesn't tell us what direction it was
going<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.500> doesn't<00:02:41.710> tell<00:02:42.010> us<00:02:42.040> how<00:02:42.340> fast<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.880> was

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
going it doesn't tell us how fast it was

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.420 
going it doesn't tell us how fast it was
going<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.720> all<00:02:43.960> we<00:02:44.170> know<00:02:44.410> was<00:02:44.710> this<00:02:44.950> airplane

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
going so all we know was this airplane

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.280 
going so all we know was this airplane
was<00:02:45.610> flying<00:02:45.640> which<00:02:46.450> means<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:46.900> could<00:02:47.110> be

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
was flying which means it could be

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.800 
was flying which means it could be
anywhere<00:02:47.680> within<00:02:47.740> about<00:02:48.190> 2,000<00:02:48.910> 2,500<00:02:49.180> miles

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
anywhere within about 2,000 2,500 miles

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.410 
anywhere within about 2,000 2,500 miles
and<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.320> it<00:02:50.500> possible<00:02:50.710> as<00:02:51.340> bob<00:02:51.730> was<00:02:51.970> reporting

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
and is it possible as bob was reporting

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.880 
and is it possible as bob was reporting
is<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.630> possible<00:02:53.230> this<00:02:53.440> plane<00:02:53.680> could<00:02:53.860> have

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
is it possible this plane could have

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.950 
is it possible this plane could have
landed<00:02:54.400> someplace<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.150> we<00:02:55.210> have<00:02:55.450> no<00:02:55.630> idea

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
landed someplace and we have no idea

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.560 
landed someplace and we have no idea
there<00:02:56.290> it's<00:02:56.920> possible<00:02:57.610> it's<00:02:57.880> possible<00:02:58.420> but

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
there it's possible it's possible but

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.660 
there it's possible it's possible but
boy<00:02:58.810> that<00:02:59.050> would<00:02:59.170> be<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.350> stretch<00:02:59.800> following<00:03:00.550> a

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
boy that would be a stretch following a

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.790 
boy that would be a stretch following a
new<00:03:00.970> twist<00:03:01.360> in<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.720> clues<00:03:02.020> tonight<00:03:02.350> as<00:03:02.650> you

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
new twist in the clues tonight as you

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.650 
new twist in the clues tonight as you
said<00:03:03.010> what<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.190> difference<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.760> day<00:03:03.790> makes<00:03:04.090> in

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
said what a difference a day makes in

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.740 
said what a difference a day makes in
