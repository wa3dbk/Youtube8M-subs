00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
that I've never had trouble going

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.990 
that I've never had trouble going
through<00:01:07.590> an<00:01:07.680> airport<00:01:07.830> security<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:08.760> this

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
through an airport security with this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.789 
through an airport security with this
even<00:01:09.659> though<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.049> not<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.260> court<00:01:10.619> size

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
even though it's not a court size

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.130 
even though it's not a court size
see-through<00:01:11.369> bag<00:01:11.549> or<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> sip<00:01:12.060> lock<00:01:12.270> bag<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.750> I

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
see-through bag or a sip lock bag and I

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.260 
see-through bag or a sip lock bag and I
believe<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.770> reason<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.340> because<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:15.000> is

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
believe the reason is because this is

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.539 
believe the reason is because this is
actually<00:01:15.450> see-through<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.770> they<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.369> just

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
actually see-through so they can just

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.399 
actually see-through so they can just
see<00:01:17.820> right<00:01:18.090> through<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:18.900> flight<00:01:19.110> open

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
see right through it if it's flight open

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.050 
see right through it if it's flight open
though<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> never<00:01:19.979> actually<00:01:20.460> take<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.759> off<00:01:20.850> out

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
though I never actually take it off out

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.640 
though I never actually take it off out
of<00:01:21.240> my<00:01:21.330> suitcase<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.290> through<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.619> and
