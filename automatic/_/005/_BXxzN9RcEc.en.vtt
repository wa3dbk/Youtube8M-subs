00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
stick kind of thing that connects the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.030 
stick kind of thing that connects the
the<00:00:28.439> front<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.010> back<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.369> your<00:00:29.609> violent

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
that's rolling around in the violin so

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.869 
that's rolling around in the violin so
what<00:00:36.750> should<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.200> do<00:00:37.410> she<00:00:37.770> still<00:00:38.250> was<00:00:38.520> playing

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
on it and but the violence sounded

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.350 
on it and but the violence sounded
terrible

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
terrible

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.450 
terrible
so<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.570> should<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.200> if<00:00:46.500> your<00:00:46.770> sound<00:00:47.070> post

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
so what should you do if your sound post

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.389 
so what should you do if your sound post
falls<00:00:47.879> down<00:00:48.239> let<00:00:49.200> me<00:00:49.350> first<00:00:49.590> explain<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.219> you

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
falls down let me first explain to you

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.819 
falls down let me first explain to you
what<00:00:50.730> exactly<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.170> function<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
what exactly is the function of the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.360 
what exactly is the function of the
sound<00:00:53.070> post<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:54.059> sound<00:00:54.360> post<00:00:54.770> gives<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
sound post the sound post gives the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.000 
sound post the sound post gives the
Fabray<00:00:56.789> shion's<00:00:57.149> from<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> front<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
Fabray shion's from the front to the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.400 
Fabray shion's from the front to the
back<00:00:59.129> because<00:00:59.579> it's<00:01:00.000> stuck<00:01:00.750> between<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
back because it's stuck between the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.869 
back because it's stuck between the
front<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> back<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.219> should<00:01:02.489> never<00:01:02.670> be

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
front and the back it should never be

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.329 
front and the back it should never be
glued<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.140> glued<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.710> can't

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
glued because if it's glued it can't

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.649 
glued because if it's glued it can't
pass<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.909> vibrations<00:01:06.630> because<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:08.659> it

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
pass the vibrations because it's it

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.859 
pass the vibrations because it's it
can't<00:01:09.960> move<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.670> has<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.119> fitted<00:01:12.390> very

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
can't move so it has to be fitted very

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.770 
can't move so it has to be fitted very
well<00:01:13.049> by<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> violin<00:01:13.950> builder<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:15.330> should

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
well by a violin builder and it should

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.130 
well by a violin builder and it should
stay<00:01:16.229> there<00:01:16.619> because<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.850> fits<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.390> well<00:01:18.810> and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
stay there because it fits so well and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.160 
stay there because it fits so well and
it<00:01:19.560> should<00:01:19.740> also<00:01:19.979> fill<00:01:20.939> out<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> shape<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.689> of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
it should also fill out the shape of of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.499 
it should also fill out the shape of of
the<00:01:22.500> front<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.890> back<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.400> violin<00:01:23.909> so

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the front and back of your violin so

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.780 
the front and back of your violin so
it's<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:25.290> optimally<00:01:26.960> give<00:01:27.960> through<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
it's can optimally give through the

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.710 
it's can optimally give through the
vibrations<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:31.110> also<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.369> has<00:01:32.610> a

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
vibrations and and also it has a

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.050 
vibrations and and also it has a
constructional<00:01:33.720> function<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.829> because<00:01:35.759> if

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
constructional function and because if

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.319 
constructional function and because if
you<00:01:36.450> don't<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.110> sound<00:01:37.409> posts<00:01:38.100> then<00:01:38.460> your

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
you don't have a sound posts then your

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.510 
you don't have a sound posts then your
bridge<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> strings<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.799> all<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
bridge and the strings and all the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.700 
bridge and the strings and all the
pressure<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.939> comes<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.990> which<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.500> be

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
pressure that comes on it which can be

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.530 
pressure that comes on it which can be
around<00:01:43.979> 25<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.700> 35<00:01:45.450> kilos<00:01:46.759> its<00:01:47.759> resting<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
around 25 to 35 kilos its resting on the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.660 
around 25 to 35 kilos its resting on the
front<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> violin<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.710> then<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.310> bridge

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
front of the violin and then the bridge

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.060 
front of the violin and then the bridge
can<00:01:51.000> break<00:01:51.329> through<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.409> front<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
can break through the front of the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.209 
can break through the front of the
violin<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.790> your<00:01:54.509> violin<00:01:55.020> will<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.590> pieces

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
violin and your violin will be in pieces

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.609 
violin and your violin will be in pieces
so<00:01:56.460> what<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.329> falls<00:01:57.659> down

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
so what to do if it falls down

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.179 
so what to do if it falls down
obviously<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.579> can't<00:01:59.909> play<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:00.960> you

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
obviously you can't play on it so you

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.749 
obviously you can't play on it so you
have<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.340> stop<00:02:02.579> playing<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.450> to

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
have to stop playing on it you have to

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.359 
have to stop playing on it you have to
put<00:02:05.759> all<00:02:05.969> your<00:02:06.140> strings<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.619> tune<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.190> that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
put all your strings out of tune so that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.240 
put all your strings out of tune so that
they're<00:02:08.550> really<00:02:09.119> loose<00:02:09.750> put<00:02:10.649> away<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.039> bridge

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
they're really loose put away the bridge

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.130 
they're really loose put away the bridge
somewhere<00:02:11.819> because<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.360> bridge<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.569> also

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
somewhere because the bridge is also

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.730 
somewhere because the bridge is also
loose

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
loose
