through the new supreme total one stick

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.950 
through the new supreme total one stick
so<00:00:11.170> for<00:00:11.950> all<00:00:12.009> of<00:00:12.040> you<00:00:12.190> supreme<00:00:12.820> 195<00:00:13.420> users<00:00:13.839> i

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
so for all of you supreme 195 users i

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.030 
so for all of you supreme 195 users i
think<00:00:14.170> you're<00:00:14.259> going<00:00:14.380> to<00:00:14.440> be<00:00:14.559> really<00:00:14.830> happy

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040 
think you're going to be really happy

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.620 
think you're going to be really happy
with<00:00:15.280> the<00:00:15.400> updates<00:00:15.759> that<00:00:15.969> we've<00:00:16.120> made<00:00:16.300> to<00:00:16.510> the

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
with the updates that we've made to the

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.510 
with the updates that we've made to the
stick<00:00:16.930> there<00:00:17.650> are<00:00:17.740> a<00:00:17.800> couple<00:00:17.890> things<00:00:18.220> that<00:00:18.430> we

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
stick there are a couple things that we

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.580 
stick there are a couple things that we
didn't<00:00:18.970> want<00:00:19.240> to<00:00:19.330> change<00:00:19.570> about<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:19.990> 195<00:00:20.560> and

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
didn't want to change about the 195 and

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.320 
didn't want to change about the 195 and
moving<00:00:21.100> to<00:00:21.220> the<00:00:21.340> total<00:00:21.670> wine<00:00:21.790> I<00:00:21.820> think<00:00:22.210> the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
moving to the total wine I think the

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.510 
moving to the total wine I think the
first<00:00:22.510> thing<00:00:22.660> is<00:00:22.990> the<00:00:23.470> Flex<00:00:23.770> profile<00:00:24.280> so

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
first thing is the Flex profile so

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.970 
first thing is the Flex profile so
amplified<00:00:25.120> mid<00:00:25.420> kick<00:00:25.660> from<00:00:25.930> the<00:00:26.050> supreme<00:00:26.380> 195

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
amplified mid kick from the supreme 195

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.160 
amplified mid kick from the supreme 195
we'll<00:00:27.610> come<00:00:27.850> over<00:00:28.060> into<00:00:28.330> the<00:00:28.450> supreme<00:00:28.840> total

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
we'll come over into the supreme total

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.600 
we'll come over into the supreme total
one<00:00:29.320> and<00:00:29.530> what<00:00:29.680> that<00:00:29.860> is<00:00:30.010> all<00:00:30.190> about<00:00:30.220> is

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
one and what that is all about is

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.790 
one and what that is all about is
creating<00:00:30.850> a<00:00:31.300> shot<00:00:31.810> with<00:00:31.990> the<00:00:32.110> maximum<00:00:32.560> amount

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
creating a shot with the maximum amount

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.650 
creating a shot with the maximum amount
of<00:00:32.950> energy<00:00:33.130> with<00:00:33.640> the<00:00:33.670> minimum<00:00:34.210> amount<00:00:34.330> of

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
of energy with the minimum amount of

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.080 
of energy with the minimum amount of
input<00:00:34.810> it's<00:00:35.320> just<00:00:36.250> so<00:00:36.370> that<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:36.640> can<00:00:36.850> shoot

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
input it's just so that you can shoot

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.940 
input it's just so that you can shoot
the<00:00:37.120> puck<00:00:37.420> a<00:00:37.450> lot<00:00:37.720> easier<00:00:37.900> get<00:00:38.590> a<00:00:38.620> lot<00:00:38.920> of

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
the puck a lot easier get a lot of

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.010 
the puck a lot easier get a lot of
energy<00:00:39.190> output<00:00:39.730> and<00:00:39.760> just<00:00:40.360> have<00:00:40.570> it<00:00:40.720> happen

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
energy output and just have it happen

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.200 
energy output and just have it happen
for<00:00:41.230> you<00:00:41.290> very<00:00:41.530> easily<00:00:41.820> another<00:00:42.820> technology

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
for you very easily another technology

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.430 
for you very easily another technology
that<00:00:43.690> you'll<00:00:43.870> notice<00:00:44.050> right<00:00:44.290> away

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
that you'll notice right away

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.610 
that you'll notice right away
graphically<00:00:45.840> will<00:00:46.840> be<00:00:46.960> this<00:00:47.140> text<00:00:47.440> stream

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
graphically will be this text stream

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.319 
graphically will be this text stream
carbon<00:00:48.010> fiber<00:00:48.250> so<00:00:48.610> you're<00:00:48.820> familiar<00:00:49.090> with

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
carbon fiber so you're familiar with

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.360 
carbon fiber so you're familiar with
that<00:00:49.480> if<00:00:49.810> you've<00:00:50.170> seen<00:00:50.350> our<00:00:50.470> vapor<00:00:50.650> x<00:00:50.890> 60<00:00:51.280> and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
that if you've seen our vapor x 60 and

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.040 
that if you've seen our vapor x 60 and
what<00:00:51.460> that<00:00:51.610> allows<00:00:51.760> us<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.270> do<00:00:52.450> is<00:00:52.660> create<00:00:52.930> a

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
what that allows us to do is create a

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.900 
what that allows us to do is create a
stick<00:00:53.380> that's<00:00:53.590> going<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:53.800> have<00:00:54.010> that<00:00:54.520> same

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
stick that's going to have that same

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.750 
stick that's going to have that same
kind<00:00:55.150> of<00:00:55.300> pop<00:00:55.540> that<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.290> 195<00:00:56.860> did<00:00:57.100> but<00:00:57.310> lasts<00:00:57.550> a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
kind of pop that the 195 did but lasts a

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.639 
kind of pop that the 195 did but lasts a
lot<00:00:57.940> longer<00:00:58.020> another<00:00:59.020> thing<00:00:59.260> that<00:00:59.290> helps<00:00:59.560> us

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
lot longer another thing that helps us

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.650 
lot longer another thing that helps us
do<00:00:59.800> is<00:00:59.950> reduce<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.460> overall<00:01:00.760> way<00:01:01.000> to<00:01:01.060> stick<00:01:01.480> by

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
do is reduce the overall way to stick by

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.870 
do is reduce the overall way to stick by
about<00:01:01.870> 35<00:01:02.350> grams<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:03.310> other<00:01:03.489> thing<00:01:03.850> that

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
about 35 grams the other thing that

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.310 
about 35 grams the other thing that
really<00:01:04.180> helped<00:01:04.510> people<00:01:04.659> fall<00:01:04.989> in<00:01:05.110> love<00:01:05.229> with

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
really helped people fall in love with

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.800 
really helped people fall in love with
the<00:01:05.440> 195<00:01:06.040> was<00:01:06.310> way<00:01:06.580> that<00:01:06.760> the<00:01:06.880> blade<00:01:07.180> felt<00:01:07.510> so

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
the 195 was way that the blade felt so

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.770 
the 195 was way that the blade felt so
power<00:01:08.560> core<00:01:08.920> 2<00:01:09.100> +<00:01:09.370> 195<00:01:09.790> has<00:01:10.150> been<00:01:10.300> updated<00:01:10.750> to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
power core 2 + 195 has been updated to

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.260 
power core 2 + 195 has been updated to
power<00:01:11.050> 4<00:01:11.409> 3<00:01:11.710> and<00:01:11.860> what<00:01:11.979> that<00:01:12.130> means<00:01:12.400> is<00:01:12.610> we<00:01:13.090> use

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
power 4 3 and what that means is we use

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.510 
power 4 3 and what that means is we use
our<00:01:13.420> arrow<00:01:13.690> foam<00:01:14.080> in<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.800> heel<00:01:15.010> and<00:01:15.190> that's

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
our arrow foam in the heel and that's

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.710 
our arrow foam in the heel and that's
going<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.729> help<00:01:15.850> prevent<00:01:16.150> the<00:01:16.330> blade<00:01:16.540> from

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
going to help prevent the blade from

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.539 
going to help prevent the blade from
opening<00:01:17.290> up<00:01:17.440> or<00:01:17.650> deflecting<00:01:18.190> when<00:01:18.340> you<00:01:18.430> make

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
opening up or deflecting when you make

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.580 
opening up or deflecting when you make
impact<00:01:18.909> for<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.120> puck<00:01:19.330> but<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.049> power<00:01:20.260> core

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
impact for the puck but the power core

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.039 
impact for the puck but the power core
material<00:01:21.130> which<00:01:21.729> gives<00:01:22.000> you<00:01:22.120> that<00:01:22.240> nice<00:01:22.570> great

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
material which gives you that nice great

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.170 
material which gives you that nice great
puck<00:01:23.350> feel<00:01:23.620> really<00:01:24.280> responsive<00:01:24.940> you<00:01:25.060> know

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
puck feel really responsive you know

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.640 
puck feel really responsive you know
exactly<00:01:25.600> where<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.840> puck<00:01:26.020> is<00:01:26.049> on<00:01:26.320> your<00:01:26.440> blade

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
exactly where the puck is on your blade

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.260 
exactly where the puck is on your blade
that's<00:01:27.130> going<00:01:27.400> to<00:01:27.460> come<00:01:27.670> through<00:01:28.000> in<00:01:28.210> the

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
that's going to come through in the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.270 
that's going to come through in the
supreme<00:01:28.990> total<00:01:29.290> one<00:01:29.440> but<00:01:29.650> the<00:01:29.740> thing<00:01:29.920> about<00:01:29.950> it

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
supreme total one but the thing about it

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.789 
supreme total one but the thing about it
is<00:01:30.400> we've<00:01:30.610> made<00:01:30.820> that<00:01:30.850> light<00:01:31.299> or<00:01:31.479> two<00:01:31.799> we've

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
is we've made that light or two we've

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.440 
is we've made that light or two we've
also<00:01:32.979> incorporated<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.729> pure<00:01:33.970> shop<00:01:34.180> blade

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
also incorporated the pure shop blade

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.390 
also incorporated the pure shop blade
profile<00:01:34.900> into<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.380> new<00:01:35.530> supreme<00:01:35.890> stick<00:01:36.159> and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
profile into the new supreme stick and

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.550 
profile into the new supreme stick and
what<00:01:36.580> that<00:01:36.610> allows<00:01:36.850> us<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.330> do<00:01:37.540> is<00:01:37.750> create<00:01:38.470> a

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
what that allows us to do is create a

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.620 
what that allows us to do is create a
blade<00:01:39.130> that's<00:01:39.340> going<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.580> again<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.150> deflect

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
blade that's going to again and deflect

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.539 
blade that's going to again and deflect
a<00:01:40.780> lot<00:01:40.960> less<00:01:41.260> and<00:01:41.560> what<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.070> means<00:01:42.280> is<00:01:42.400> you

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
a lot less and what that means is you

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.700 
a lot less and what that means is you
this<00:01:42.850> shot<00:01:43.180> is<00:01:43.450> going<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:43.930> go<00:01:44.110> where<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.470> want

then<00:02:08.289> into<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.709> blade<00:02:08.889> so<00:02:09.099> you're<00:02:09.249> going<00:02:09.340> to

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
then into the blade so you're going to

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.440 
then into the blade so you're going to
get<00:02:09.549> that<00:02:09.700> maximum
