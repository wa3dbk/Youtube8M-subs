00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.600
 good afternoon today to our test 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.480
 hit the chimney sample produced in 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.280
 St. Petersburg by popular 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.070
 some technology manufacturers with 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.869
 using wata rockwool light mo 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:23.279
 In principle, probably someone is familiar with the appearance 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:28.769
 learns we want to test so 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.700
 as a manufacturer from Denmark claims 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.480
 that hand holds 150 degrees but 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.500
 chimney manufacturers who 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.079
 use this product claim that 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.570
 the chimney with it is able to withstand 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.710
 900 degrees well then let's see what 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.770
 will show 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.690
 experiment for this we will put this 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.100
 sample 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:58.020
 firm oven preheated to 850 degrees and 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:00.660
 hold it for half an hour and so we collected 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.930
 chimney back and put it in terms 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.930
 bake 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:18.649
 regret is cut off 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:24.560
 every but the less science defeated him 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:29.000
 fit so we see temperatures not 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:32.090
 it is time now we have three hours 40 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.770
 minutes well and half an hour later respectively 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.569
 we will come and see what happened to 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.619
 by sample he passed half an hour and now we 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:48.979
 we want to get our sample from the oven 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:50.959
 which robot is the most but already visible 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.599
 that the insulator has changed in volume and 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.759
 inner tube just 

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:59.259
 floor on the outside I look like a hook 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.259
 become to show us closer 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:09.110
 to get not very convenient because well, 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.239
 change of pipe geometry to residence 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.780
 not quite turned out in volumes but not 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.430
 less even being without any 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.380
 pressure isolator top 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.380
 departed 2 surfaces 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.590
 trying somehow to show you closer 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.859
 burn father baked 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.640
 get it now to show 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.640
 what what 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.940
 That is generally that is probably obvious 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.180
 just burned out and i suspect that i lost 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.879
 its elasticity as a museum 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:56.250
 the samples that we give were tested and 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:59.280
 just crumbles and therefore no 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.719
 constant sizes between the inside 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.989
 external external pipe 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:07.680
 we are no longer talking and further 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.530
 operation after such exposure 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.099
 temperature a huge income is not suitable 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.099
 silence
