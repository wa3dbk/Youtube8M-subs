00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
me not to do I did it in a practice and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.480 
me not to do I did it in a practice and
Indiana<00:01:21.600> became<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> best<00:01:22.229> at<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.439> yeah<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.280> I

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
Indiana became the best at it yeah and I

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.300 
Indiana became the best at it yeah and I
think<00:01:23.759> that's<00:01:23.970> why<00:01:24.180> instead<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.750> being

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
think that's why instead of just being

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.969 
think that's why instead of just being
physical<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.420> brute<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.860> be

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
physical and and brute I can be

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.240 
physical and and brute I can be
technical<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.079> way<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:32.070> may<00:01:32.220> be

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
technical and and in a way it may be

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.399 
technical and and in a way it may be
elegant<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.939> well<00:01:32.970> yeah<00:01:33.450> because<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.229> never

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
elegant as well yeah because I never

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.480 
and I think in the end the moment where
you<00:01:52.020> really<00:01:52.500> really<00:01:52.530> really<00:01:53.100> got<00:01:53.219> to<00:01:53.369> play

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
you really really really got to play

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.190

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
be really when you get older and when

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.910 
be really when you get older and when
the<00:02:00.630> pressure<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:01.289> for<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.740> perform

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the pressure is there for you to perform

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.740 
the pressure is there for you to perform
because<00:02:02.460> first<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.850> all<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.149> your<00:02:03.270> job<00:02:03.450> you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
because first of all it's your job you

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.620 
because first of all it's your job you
need<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.829> keep<00:02:05.009> yourself<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.579> job<00:02:05.759> and

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
need to keep yourself in the job and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.389 
need to keep yourself in the job and
second<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.170> all<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.530> because<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.070> a<00:02:08.250> lot

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
second of all this because of a lot

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.100 
second of all this because of a lot
there's<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.789> lot<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.030> responsibilities<00:02:09.899> but

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
there's a lot of responsibilities but

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.010 
there's a lot of responsibilities but
when<00:02:10.800> you're<00:02:10.979> young<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.720> don't<00:02:12.720> agree<00:02:12.930> with

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
when you're young I don't agree with

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.770 
when you're young I don't agree with
with<00:02:13.769> trainers<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.910> kind<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.390> put

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
with trainers that that kind of put

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.990 
with trainers that that kind of put
players<00:02:16.110> into<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> mold<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:17.040> think<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.489> if

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
players into a mold I think that if

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.839 
players into a mold I think that if
anything<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:19.530> should<00:02:19.560> have<00:02:19.950> everything<00:02:20.700> and

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
anything you should have everything and

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.580 
anything you should have everything and
see<00:02:21.060> everything<00:02:21.090> experience<00:02:22.019> everything<00:02:22.440> and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
see everything experience everything and

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.530 
see everything experience everything and
then<00:02:22.709> from<00:02:22.950> there<00:02:23.160> on<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.580> specialize<00:02:24.269> when

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
then from there on you specialize when

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.910 
then from there on you specialize when
the<00:02:24.629> players<00:02:24.870> get<00:02:25.050> maybe<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.379> little<00:02:25.560> bit<00:02:25.739> older

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
the players get maybe a little bit older

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:41.900 
the players get maybe a little bit older
here

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.970
