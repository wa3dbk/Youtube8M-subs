00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.870 
actually bad is because you can only
transfer<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:46.380> time<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.159> once<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.579> transfer

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
transfer one time so once you transfer

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.260 
transfer one time so once you transfer
your<00:01:48.119> players<00:01:48.630> over<00:01:49.259> from<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> xbox<00:01:50.369> 360<00:01:51.030> to

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
your players over from the xbox 360 to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.230 
your players over from the xbox 360 to
the<00:01:51.420> xbox<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:52.229> your<00:01:52.890> players<00:01:53.220> values<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
the xbox one your players values on the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.590 
the xbox one your players values on the
xbox<00:01:54.899> 360<00:01:55.500> will<00:01:55.860> be<00:01:56.040> zero<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:57.060> will<00:01:57.090> still

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
xbox 360 will be zero you will still

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.690 
xbox 360 will be zero you will still
have<00:01:57.630> those<00:01:58.140> cards<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:59.219> they<00:01:59.399> will<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.670> no

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
have those cards but they will have no

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.830 
have those cards but they will have no
value<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.869> xbox<00:02:01.409> 360<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.030> complete

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
value on the xbox 360 so if you complete

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.649 
value on the xbox 360 so if you complete
the<00:02:04.170> transfer<00:02:04.799> make<00:02:05.369> sure<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.270> are<00:02:06.600> not

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
the transfer make sure that you are not

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.729 
the transfer make sure that you are not
trying<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.500> trade<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.819> xbox<00:02:09.270> 360<00:02:09.929> now<00:02:10.530> on

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
trying to trade on the xbox 360 now on

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.190 
trying to trade on the xbox 360 now on
the<00:02:10.920> Xbox<00:02:11.430> one<00:02:11.819> they<00:02:12.090> will<00:02:12.239> still<00:02:12.569> have

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the Xbox one they will still have

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.170 
the Xbox one they will still have
used<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.560> would<00:02:13.709> still<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:13.980> your<00:02:14.280> normal<00:02:14.550> cards

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
used it would still be your normal cards

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.390 
used it would still be your normal cards
but<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.930> reason<00:02:16.140> they<00:02:16.379> do<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:17.250> so

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
but the reason they do this is just so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.009 
but the reason they do this is just so
you<00:02:17.459> can't<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:17.879> duplicate<00:02:18.450> cards<00:02:18.870> or

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
you can't have duplicate cards or

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.199 
you can't have duplicate cards or
something<00:02:19.260> like<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.760> have<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.090> have

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
something like that and you have to have

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.080 
something like that and you have to have
the<00:02:21.330> same<00:02:21.569> gamertag<00:02:22.319> so<00:02:22.680> if<00:02:22.920> you're<00:02:23.220> if<00:02:23.580> you're

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
the same gamertag so if you're if you're

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.000 
the same gamertag so if you're if you're
trying<00:02:24.360> if<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.840> made<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.080> new<00:02:25.349> profile<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
trying if you made a new profile in the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.190 
trying if you made a new profile in the
xbox<00:02:26.310> one<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:27.090> will<00:02:27.239> not<00:02:27.450> be<00:02:27.690> able<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
xbox one you will not be able to

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.559 
xbox one you will not be able to
complete<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.769> transfers<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:30.090> that

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
complete that transfers that that

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.020 
complete that transfers that that
transfer<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.319> just<00:02:31.530> keep<00:02:31.709> that<00:02:31.769> in<00:02:31.950> mind<00:02:32.280> and

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
you can only transfer one time per game

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.940 
you can only transfer one time per game
attack<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:36.690> just<00:02:36.900> keep<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.319> mind<00:02:37.650> also
