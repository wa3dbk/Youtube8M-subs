00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.430
 woman introduces you here in barcelona 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:10.320
 an evolution of his 820 that we had 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.990
 reviewed and proven the glory or even 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.460
 the mini area with this cover is a 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.250
 software made by the lion that does 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.449
 become this smartphone suitable for 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.779
 blind because as you see the cover 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:30.449
 induces invitation to move on the keys 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.610
 see you are able to press right in 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.960
 so who can move a lot 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.050
 well because there are also these 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.290
 references this age that these these 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.809
 lines but the nice thing is not this but it is 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.879
 in the software because once we 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.570
 let's make a slide and then unlock 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.890
 phone now making a lot of noise but 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.300
 each menu is elected see 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.829
 simplified but above all the telephone 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.430
 he's telling us what menu we have 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.280
 selected 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.010
 many also the visual aids we try to 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.010
 come in we cr to read gods 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.049
 text the color function what is the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.040
 color function we give ourselves the okay 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.299
 we frame a color and the phone there 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.770
 he says at this point I'm feeling it 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.490
 in English you don't because he's here 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.710
 a confusion said 99 percent 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.200
 green think of the usefulness of this 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.750
 function for those who are blind 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.119
 dress for example but in the morning 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.240
 in addition to this the phone can activate 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.700
 the camera and tell us if the light in a 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.360
 certain environment is on or off 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.789
 very useful for those who don't see 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.950
 is a device that will be sold at the price 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.810
 of 500 euros obviously the price can 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.880
 seem out of proportion but you can buy too 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.050
 the license of the software you have based 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.630
 on android with 820 methods and based on 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.910
 on android that basically this 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.340
 poor makes a phone 30 in 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.860
 combination with proper software of its own 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.690
 to this TV category 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.780
 but gold in barcelona also brings 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.080
 another important novelty is the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.410
 420 mini gift and I'll do it right away 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.410
 to see 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.600
 colleague 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.720
 and say hello to roberto here he is 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.360
 golden liberto 820 mini the interface 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.520
 remains the same as the device 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.250
 we had proven that no angel had 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.190
 tested for us hardware features 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.250
 which drop slightly to level for 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.410
 a price however that does not reach 200 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.790
 euro that I show all and some 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.500
 all the various sides all the various 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.920
 angles a 5 megapixel camera 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.290
 obviously only GPS button 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.950
 assistance regarding the 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.989
 gold coin software told us that 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.470
 has been modified and improved respect 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.630
 to what we have tried maybe 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.330
 we will look for an elderly person can 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.640
 also try this 820 mini and why 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.170
 no we would also like to find a non 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.520
 sighted to understand if the interaction with 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.260
 the gold specially designed for 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.880
 this category of people is really 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.880
 functional or not
