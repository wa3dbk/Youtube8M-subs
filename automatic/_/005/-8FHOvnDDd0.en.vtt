00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.500
 as the hp boss decreases in each 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.990
 saved on wraith will act 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.330
 a special aura intensifying with time 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.760
 when a new aura include old 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.859
 besides disappears in each of you 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.710
 will be called upon big from which 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.359
 also have to understand before 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.800
 I advise you to carefully consider 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.779
 screenshot at the beginning of the video on which 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.059
 shows in detail where and how should 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.730
 stand raid with the boss during the whole fight 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.620
 the following abilities are used 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.360
 the first malicious touch to hang sen 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.070
 random player and absorbs big 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.410
 the amount of heal that is a man and not 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.270
 bribe rice while on it add it you can 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.280
 about dispel but he jumps 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.750
 on another player dispel him 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.129
 accordingly when the player 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.129
 little HP left 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.140
 the second is the edict of judgment three times 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.270
 cause aoy damage in a radius of a selected 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.460
 player damage is divided equally among all 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.100
 hurt by players but with every tick 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.439
 radius decreases avoid advance 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.860
 stipulated place to take theron better 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.049
 total this place will serve mile camp 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.060
 the third is the print of expansion here 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.310
 you're the one adding on the current tanks reducing 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.049
 10 percent per stack 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.020
 tanks should change as you get 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.430
 Stacks should be changed to 3 stacks 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.530
 first phase 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.540
 players should stand in this phase 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.670
 dispersed keeping distance each 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.590
 between the other 5 meters tanks should 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.570
 put the bosses white mark holding it 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.360
 face side yellow and tank so 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.130
 the whole battle of burrow acts aura of repression 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.430
 inflicting damage whenever a player 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.170
 moves about every half second 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.600
 damage aura damage is increased by 10 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.619
 percent every five seconds 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.840
 accordingly, the whole ray should move 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.530
 only in extreme cases about such cases 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.149
 quite a few first blow cone annihilation 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.310
 Oh e to the cost of one of the players 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.740
 the direction of the strike is indicated by the arrow 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.479
 under the boss and zauya need to drink everything 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.969
 whom it hurts takes damage and 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.680
 pick up fire geyser appears through 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.049
 a few seconds geyser jet 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.100
 flame damage and toss 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.869
 the air of all who did not run out of it 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.149
 that player for whom this one is being cast 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.250
 spell must either move away so that the damage 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.170
 don't hit nearby players either 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.830
 players themselves should move away from the hero 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.340
 far away 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.230
 2 infernal storm current ou e by 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.660
 the whole raid besides causing damage 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.760
 fire geysers under the feet of players from 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.470
 nato geysers run out should 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.600
 exactly beyond the geyser and no further 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.420
 so as not to disturb others herself neatly 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.520
 will break their square shape into 90 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.350
 percent hp and lari calls ancient 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.209
 guards free tank should 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.370
 pick it up and turn it away from the raid 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.470
 the guard lets fiery before him 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.569
 the scope of which flies in a straight line to the wall and 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.730
 then comes back contact with 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.489
 Sphere deals damage and causes fire 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.739
 geyser under the feet of hell need to kill but 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.569
 the primary task of the raids is 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.720
 transfer to the next phase therefore it 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.959
 should be lowered cool and dotami second 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.120
 phase 2 phase starts at 70 percent 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.980
 hp boss on raid night act aura 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.250
 contempt which does not give off the rate 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.640
 above 80 percent efficiency approximately every 15 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.260
 seconds 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.299
 the effect of the aura will increase by 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.980
 an extra five percent in the very 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.660
 early type as all mardel heel 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.489
 should run down the red mark like 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.799
 shown in the screenshot at the beginning of the video 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.739
 the boss still remains turned in 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.480
 side yellow standing white on this phase 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.690
 you will encounter the following 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.250
 with floors 1 buy spoilage 50 second 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.730
 debuff that hangs on random 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.920
 players 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.470
 love with this debuff also gets 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.910
 damage from crushing shadows but has 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.370
 insensitivity to their audi 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.200
 component players with this debuff 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.970
 must stick together in the blue tags 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.310
 but a few seconds before dropping yes 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.190
 Baba run across green and after 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.870
 add will fall back to red mark 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.030
 ancient forerunner appears at 60 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.400
 percent and by faith and tank free 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.690
 tank she periodically tries to heal 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.269
 Cass boss need to shoot down 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.760
 if you skip the cast you can spray 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.320
 the boss himself with each successive cast 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.670
 its rate increases by 15 percent 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.880
 so this hell must be operational killers 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.310
 third phase at 40 percent a.p. 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.170
 villari moves to the last rate phase 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.790
 is affected by an aura of wickedness 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.040
 which increases the damage taken by 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.290
 ten percent a applied on 20 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.870
 every five seconds the effect is enhanced 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.850
 additional 10 percent bastion 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.500
 dispute deals damage to a tank and several 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.139
 random players leave them under 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.730
 feet will be the zone until the end of the breakwater maul 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.800
 the despot deals damage to the entire raid 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.020
 throws back plus deals extra 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.940
 damage in eight seconds all ray should 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.430
 gather at the tanks and roll the boss along 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.139
