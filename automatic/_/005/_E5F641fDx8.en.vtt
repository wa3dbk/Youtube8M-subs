00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.920
 very good to everyone to go to the classroom 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.720
 we are in the rimac and we are going to start 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.820
 today a small series that will be a 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.150
 travel through all the dungeons and 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.890
 bands that exist here in the wow in the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.020
 which will explain the lords can 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.419
 get also try to teach 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.369
 more or less how tickets are made 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.430
 of each and more or less a little the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.899
 double that we know is not that 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.059
 there is a lot of information of all but 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.220
 good what can be removed because what 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.130
 we will explain on this occasion I count on 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.130
 the help of the capo yo este de negro bueno 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.640
 the first one we will do is the first 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.200
 you can do or be 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.950
 if it does not come out when you wait 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.950
 Clear 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.420
 and nothing 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.450
 because nothing that the first line that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.880
 you can either mean when you're going up 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.829
 when you are level 15 that is when you 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.140
 unlock the first dungeons in the 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.569
 first thing that comes to you and pretty much the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.479
 you can do queuing up to level 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:23.729
 21 I think it's pretty much though 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.740
 always manual I think it was at level 10 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.380
 that can start to enter but let's go 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.750
 fucked up feeling at level 10 you alone 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.250
 as it will not saturate much and apart 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.530
 that you will not have missions until it is 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.899
 at level 15 is to enter well apart from that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.099
 they're going to kill you, you're not going to get the 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.430
 missions that really help you 

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:43.230
 very much at the time of uploading 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.350
 level and we are not going to 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.600
 to enter to walk on so that 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.630
 you know you also have three entrances I 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.880
 I'll go through the one that usually enters 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.600
 but you have this site to enter are 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.600
 the depths 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.150
 of the weather is not in 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.640
 that is what the shadows here ' 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.380
 the entrance as you see this is one the other 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.110
 it's next to the hairdresser over there and 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.270
 the other is where the professions 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.570
 more or less out there then we will enter by 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.570
 is 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.290
 as you see here in circus of the shadows 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.120
 to hurt us 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.519
 once we are here you see this is a 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.400
 another of the entries and the other one is 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.640
 where the t 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.690
 here 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.000
 so we put on here as you see 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.880
 here is the invocation stone does not have 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.490
 much mystery and here inside the entrance 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.610
 so let 's go, the base is very difficult 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.260
 for us they are a level 90 so if 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.790
 we die let's go we can erase 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.760
 directly character 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.049
 you will enter as you see are so missions and 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.939
 I do not have them done so I'm going to 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.510
 accept will not give me many things but 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:59.810
 good so they are very easy missions 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.819
 are I think they are all about killing things 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.140
 they do not ask you to lie to another 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.180
 this pick up objects and others from 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.590
 wake up the guards or rescue them or 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.590
 something like that we're going to do it 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.420
 if it's a little 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.590
 likewise the dungeon now you see it 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.720
 this is also changed before 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.879
 that you could not see where each voice was 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.319
 and that leaves you every forest that is a 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.780
 vastly sincerely 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.810
 before it was different blackman changed 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.499
 totally the design of the dungeon and 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.900
 before it was much more difficult 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:51.760
 the truth was longer and a little more 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.139
 difficult now it is very simple to see 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.260
 totally the route that you have to 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.980
 do and everything has been simplified 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.830
 very much 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.569
 but that's a curiosity before has not 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.819
 changed that does very little as you see 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.459
 here I get 05 this 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.569
 you see now down in the bottom corner 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.569
 right it comes out 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.270
 s 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.220
 put the big pearl 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.220
 two 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.920
 he always usually leaves a gun look 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.210
 today geo has left the pants 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.210
 Look, look bad 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:38.760
 This path will welcome you from the mission of 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:42.830
 these guards talk to you 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.830
 and that's the insurance and carrying 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.970
 that is, we are going to die 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.520
 Imagine 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:13.360
 Young beautiful up there was the snout 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.360
 would you like it 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.619
 if you do not give me the rope 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.619
 here is another voice 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.410
 How sad we continue to rescue the 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.410
 guys from these good guys 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:40.300
 this 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:44.909
 I do not like short anything right 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.909
 now we are left to kill explorers 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.620
 it does not matter that you kill everything 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.530
 with more or less go where the 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.570
 eggs they teach the shortest way 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.680
 this is another forest will change by 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.680
 full this bonus was 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.440
 that there was like a demon so there was 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.370
 a demon on the egg 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.370
 the best the truth 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.410
 all have rescued me missing one by 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.889
 rescue but in the end there are those who 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.889
 missing 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.330
 now we go here and in the end you see that 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.300
 it's super short before it was quite more 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.710
 long and active since you see that you see me 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.810
 it comes out in the mission that has to be here 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.280
 but you see the range is huge and now 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.850
 When you get here, there's a lot of life 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.290
 33 to rescue imagine yourself if you 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.730
 you have left by the way do not pass to 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.630
 little could discard three with 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.630
 rescued streets 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.790
 then we rescue these beige 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.650
 to make it a little easier if it fits 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.810
 you can deliver the missions right here 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.200
 not having to go to the entrance 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:06.750
 and raise this level or 4 insurance because it follows 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.730
 doing the mammora is easily can 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.430
 go up two levels delivering the 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.650
 missions is a vast 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.150
 I've always done it 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.740
 dungeon I do them whenever you can 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.300
 whenever you can be a dungeon 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.910
 new machines for this because the one of the 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.710
 missions because it is a last part 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.470
 that earns you a lot of money in the 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.480
 experience is brutal that you take and 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.980
 nothing this has been everything or a video 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.560
 party in a dungeon also very 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.980
 short 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:37.550
 and nothing like that the logos that you can get 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:40.460
 here is just one or that is the order you make 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:42.800
 image and that achievement and then the other as 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.690
 much is the achievement of brotherhoods by 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.460
 have made you imagine to jump 

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.230
 the achievement of the mandate you have to be 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.870
 minimum three people of the brotherhood 

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.610
 so that the achievement skips if I am minimal 

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.350
 three people out of five jump to 

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.150
 to manage and be there is of 

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.410
 moment has no more achievements so this 

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:01.540
 it's all I hope you liked it and a 

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.540
 kiss goodbye then
