00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.560
 yyyy 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.560
 and and 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.560
 and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.980
 Allison wanted to make their filter in 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.380
 racing world 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.570
 but they have failed many will say a 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.300
 it is fine that you persecute , etc. and the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.789
 like you forget one and playing on 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.500
 Consoles are on my computer I can not unload 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.250
 graphics to maximum peer into 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.620
 teksturki well than that probably but I 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.820
 spent the fungus on 20 thousand rubles 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.910
 new console 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.519
 I want grafona I want normal physics 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.870
 and where is all yubisoft will answer me only 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.870
 what are you eating 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.500
 In general, this is all forte but let's not about 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.420
 this and we will not breed srach 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.370
 I don't like this trend at all 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.320
 ubisoft they all start to make love 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.690
 they let out shitty aspens 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.430
 squid hands i have okay accent i 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.369
 read like a real game journalist 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.250
 and then rolled out the unity with the gods lags and 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.160
 here pk-shnik at all unlucky why 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.490
 do not respect kashniks and weights until what 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.290
 break this I waited 2 fucking years 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.509
 cycle by running it 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.540
 and that she writes me that an error has occurred 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.430
 the server happens I thought 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.920
 but going into the game and saw the picture 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.410
 low resolution and cows which 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.600
 run in cars and trees that sodomy 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.720
 on the screen but then I drove here dad 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.850
 the field has increased the car goes dergano review 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.250
 pressing some inhibited don't let 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.300
 god you go to the curb fuck you 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.970
 will unfold 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.649
 what the hell do you want 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.990
 Realism then do so 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.289
 my wheels nafig pulled out of collision 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.720
 this fucking curtain okay I pumped 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.360
 car management somehow became more 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.640
 good but i thought right there 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.920
 multiplayer and started looking for people in the lobby 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.710
 this game was looking for 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.450
 searched-searched and I realized that while she 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.540
 I will find rivals for me 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.220
 raise grandchildren well I calm my nerves 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.190
 and played forzy 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.049
 so back in the game there is a plot where 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.450
 we are told about the main character 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.310
 planted for no reason he sat and came 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.079
 revenge for the murdered brother city 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.269
 dominates the gang and we are recruited to 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:24.930
 we broke into their confidence and understood 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:27.150
 who finished our bro at all 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.870
 the presence of the plot in the race cherry definitely 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.400
 it is good that he is here just why 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.739
 gameplay we have here racing around fights 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.209
 in a straight line before driving through the points although everything is there 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.670
 Race is a kind of stage. 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.920
 because the game supposedly allows us to cut 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.560
 the path on the highway is actually the moment where 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.239
 you can cut very little but often 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.610
 we are forced to ride for a while and 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.010
 This can not be scratched up to the way cars 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.680
 very strange dents are broken with 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.489
 time tighten 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:08.060
 I'm not joking as terribly in the terminator 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:10.189
 so strange so one card is awesome this 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.900
 by the way plus cities are like their 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.840
 real twins but unfortunately they 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.120
 pustovat and the SRs are not remembered at all 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.489
 Yes, and just promised beauty is not enough 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.709
 really beautiful las vegas will come out at night 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.049
 funny that you can move as 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.180
 to your car either by plane or by 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.099
 of course I like the train more 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.139
 option on the car as the road 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.790
 scattered mini chellendzhi that give 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.819
 experience and detail on cars 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.980
 Well, for the most lazy there is just 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.349
 instant transfer to events where you are 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.689
 drove or even start it 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.450
 straight from the cards and it turns out that because 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:46.790
 while titus is quite for romantics 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.069
 but not scary for this is how I spoke on 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.010
 the picture is very much remembered and 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.769
 beautiful places and generally you know what 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.290
 did fox developers and auto tuning 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.169
 yes there are several for each car 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.120
 types of tuning are the most juicy is 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:04.519
 the last kind of tuning that make from 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.349
 no super sports car in your car 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.180
 monster 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.889
 the rest is honest about nothing but 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.229
 effect on driving performance cars 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:14.419
 for example, when not road tuning machine 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:15.109
 more rolls and does not slow down on 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.659
 off road 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.789
 although it slows down in street tuning 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:22.009
 fields but perfectly managed in the city on 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.259
 Asphalt is cool that we are given to choose 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.300
 bumper interior trim wheels 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:29.000
 side mirrors repaint auto hang 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.039
 vinyls and so on can't just be spent 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.080
 blood money on the inside upgrade 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.360
 for separate any suspension improvements 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.909
 engine and such other things you will 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.220
 get free for racing 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:42.259
 passed on the bronze get a new thing which 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.900
 gives plus 2k speed passed on gold 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.300
 This new thing will give plus 8 already 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.340
 this way really motivates 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.500
 pereprohodit race for gold even more 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.880
 fine that the machines are all licensed 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.300
 there is a first person view 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.669
 so where do without him 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.190
 As a bonus, there are keels that 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.650
 especially nothing give different statistics and 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.060
 tournaments from developers can be on the map 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.520
 search satellite dishes and 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.440
 abandoned hot delivery but I do not want 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.690
 stretch the review talking about the whole 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.300
 this in detail because it closed 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.280
 came out to an amateur here sometimes frankly 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.110
 furious physics annoying you 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.060
 the map is driven by real people who are not 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.030
 away yourself bump and wind you up 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.729
 Challenge and the graphics are not as striking 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.409
 I would like the game is perfect for 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.449
 multiplayer fans pokatushek 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.190
 traveling around the cities and admiring them 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.610
 all kinds of car tuning 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.319
 but the wait is still a patch on this at 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.150
 I was with you all Anton you are mine 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.039
 review for shut down thank you for 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.479
 view do not forget to like and 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.669
 subscribe to the channel 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:47.240
 and most importantly do not forget to play only 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.990
 good games on love but not serious 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.469
 forget 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.039
 Well, why do not you do not play shit, but here 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:56.210
 shut down 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:59.240
 Well, as there is a report , somehow there you can 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:03.620
 there is something there can find there while 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:06.800
 whom cup 980 of this graphon bend 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.789
 can be like that on the console as without packs 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.789
 worker as
