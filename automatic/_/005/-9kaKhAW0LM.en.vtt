00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 with 17 about the movie in the intoxication of 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.460
 deep seen when sciarrinos 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.080
 main actor against two freedivers 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.790
 the mutually the world records 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.469
 Stores and that was actually for me 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.179
 this moment when you thought 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.099
 just that he made about me as a kid 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.410
 envelope in the hamburger if you look 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.910
 who can stop the air longer and 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.260
 which usually always won 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.970
 and then I discovered there is 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.760
 in sport because there are cool guys there 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.740
 Heroes whom one can emulate and always 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.710
 my dream was to be a hero it is 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.080
 for me something very important simply 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.630
 show that you can achieve everything in life 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.920
 can do what you want to achieve 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.380
 copy nobody 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.090
 then probably went better again 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.280
 less if he breaks the record 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.750
 but then made award sometime 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.090
 times that good with the record 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.649
 if you can do something like that now 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.450
 he created one of the first new ones 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.100
 People who dived a high 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.260
 earlier always believed it works 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.360
 not at all he was the first one on over 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.579
 5000 meters above sea level is dipped 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.920
 the doctor we explained in the experiment 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.719
 Strangely enough, they sit rather 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.090
 thank goodness while next to this 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.769
 challenge part including for more 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.689
 Eismann is free that is 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.040
 actually this classic world record 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.659
 will also put up somewhere in the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.710
 indoor pool 25 26 degrees water temperature 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.180
 people are going to create but one man 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.640
 back at the start and try the whole thing 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.290
 again that's just not enough 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.880
 always needed a lot more challenge 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.659
 many challenges especially in the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.229
 mental area 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.119
 so diver then under ice of 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.329
 one hole to the other there is no 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.140
 Chance this day can cancel 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.630
 water temperature is 2 degrees 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.770
 my heartbeat separated 15 to 20 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.270
 beats per minute 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.159
 and it's actually what's me 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.170
 you have to be interested in the last one 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.450
 be one hundred percent sure 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.159
 that they are physically and mentally on the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.079
 not arrived on the other side 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.880
 one hundred percent sure then I need 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.439
 start this day as not at all and that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.130
 is actually this extraordinary 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.560
 In these projects I should be at the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.180
 massage challenge the 10,000 euro 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.590
 then I would win the complete one 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.380
 use money around 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.259
 I realize my biggest dreams 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.780
 would like in april 2015 and nordpol 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.910
 go freediving it would be the first 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.220
 friday at the attempt at the north pole 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.830
 you have planned together with mine 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.569
 friend markus feeling from australia den 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.160
 to reach the north pole on foot and then 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.690
 there just at minus 40 degrees 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.640
 outdoor temperature two degrees 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.230
 water temperature the first two 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.540
 to do dives the whole thing is 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.000
 no world record but the whole thing 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.250
 then much more serious ulterior motives 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.799
 I want to be with this action on the 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.329
 problems of our planet indicate that 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.000
 few people know it or even 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.950
 villages 15 years you have permanently over 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.360
 the global warming talked about that 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.340
 last 15 years has occurred to me 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.440
 unfortunately that hardly anyone about it 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.780
 speaks and we move up here 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.220
 a huge catastrophe towards the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.680
 north pole is almost gone 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.510
 every year more and more goes back and forth 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.629
 so that you have so far the policy here 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.549
 creates among the population worldwide 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:59.660
 Let's try this action 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.660
 to attract attention
