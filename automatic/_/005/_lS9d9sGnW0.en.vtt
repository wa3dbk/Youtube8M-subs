 songs that speak of being in favor 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.070
 of equal marriage of 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.290

 end is a disk that 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.170
 focused different facets of themes 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.670
 current on television that the 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.290
 we can see in graduates how was the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.800
 experience say to analyze together 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:10.300
 good a good a good experience 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.700
 there we have done professional therapy 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.760
 when I did not have product that worked 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.100
 of luthier and good groups like that 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.970
 people who have to work together 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.860
 so good in graduates we 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.860
 We had a lot of fun we had a great time 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.850
 ridicule us a bit and on the things 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.880
 that were in the graduates script is 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.560
 true that he is the one who composes yes yes yes 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.959
 yes everything that was in the script because 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.530
 they sent us a script and then I 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.020
 I wrote it 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.330
 then we all try to put as much 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.019
 Real may even lie the 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.760
 boy fights all that 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.889
 then real and so yes that 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.540
 they compose any that composer and 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:56.120
 producer of all the songs of 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.389
 all the disks and the one that takes care of 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.799
 management to guide a bit of the duo and I 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.659
 I'm more focused towards the more 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.639
 theatrically most theatrical 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.530
 I can not stop wondering why 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.719
 those who are born that we have a year 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.120
 two years three years five and twenty 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.859
 we remember the pegate the return as it is 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.750
 listen to it in all generations and 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.569
 make it a usual joke when 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.209
 even when one turns the door and well 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.219
 it's a very big emotion, not because it's 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.799
 that's being able to be after 30 years 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.629
 those celebrations of the 30 years and power 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.629
 have seen generations go by in these 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:32.780
 30 years so it's good that it continues like this 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.579
 forget but turn the anthem and that the 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.400
 people listening to us and that with that song 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.379
 for us it is a very strong and it is 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.239
 a very big thank you not what 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.459
 generates of that thanks would be 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.870
 imaginable thinking of yourself without your brother 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.780
 above the tables no 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.340
 to the career as a singer not for nothing 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.200
 tomorrow when the good 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.599
 circumstance others 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.480
 you have to be more medical in addition to the 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.830
 acting one of other things but 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.300
 solo singers 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.519
 for example, free time that does not 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.670
 they are on tour they also share moments 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.030
 together to make family everything is mixed 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.150
 then out there on Sundays 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.110
 we are going to have lunch with our mother 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.620
 thank god is still next to 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.350
 us and we tell ourselves in family or in 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.020
 house or let's go outside 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.940
 it is not a vacation not to everyone 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.020
 by his side but then good 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.020
 familiarly yes no 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.880
 good works out there also in the 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.320
 stage an important bet there is a 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.540
 important investment in putting 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.100
 scene obviously that is a product that 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.810
 It's been many years since 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.389
 developing and every time they're going 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.380
 adding more things should not be easy 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.050
 says it's not easy to dance with your 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.150
 sister not in the night nor should 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.710
 be easy 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.360
 sing all your life with your little sister 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.290
