00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.210
 hello welcome to this new tutorial 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.550
 let's see what we need to start 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.709
 well let's decorate a towel to go 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.920
 to the beach we will need a cloth 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.869
 stamped with pretty motifs a 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.529
 American terry towel or terry cloth 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.019
 also some thread scissors a 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.529
 tape measure but we also need 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.410
 a cotton shirt that we're going to 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.360
 decorate with fire with this towel to 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.950
 This will make an application on fabric 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.440
 this same fabric printed with what 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.289
 let's decorate the towel so that we 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.520
 is a very nice set to go to 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.140
 the beach this summer 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.610
 good the application we will place it here 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.330
 and now let's see how it is done 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.760
 the measurements of the towel you have in 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.010
 my blog below I will leave a link to 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.660
 that you can access it good we are going to 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.090
 see this application on web like the 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.310
 we put on the shirt and as the 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.140
 We know the machine because the first thing is 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.600
 put some textile glue on it 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.180
 behind you can use textile glue 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.800
 or fiselina if you do not have any of 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.010
 You can both hold the 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.780
 cloth application with pins for 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.210
 then sew it to machine with a lot 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.130
 Be careful that it does not move well 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.160
 finished placing the textile glue 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.869
 now I'm going to put the application on the 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.690
 shirt more or less where I want that 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.340
 go and do some pressure with the 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.340
 hands so that it is stuck 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.130
 then the co - host machine with 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.780
 a very closed zig zag point and with a 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.660
 thread that matches any of the 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.640
 colors that are in this application 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.280
 specifically I will use a red thread 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.670
 let's round out this whole application 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.960
 as I tell you with the zigzag point good 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.180
 Well, it's already passed through the machine 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.130
 see how beautiful the fabric has been 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.170
 it's a little bit wrinkled around here but 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.540
 nothing happens because the ironing goes away 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.850
 to be all well and good 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.979
 finished you see the zig zag point is very 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.590
 closed to stand out in this 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.240
 good application well let's continue 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.160
 now with the towel to see how the 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.890
 we decorate this is the fabric that we have 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.130
 used for the towel as I say 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.530
 you have the size of the towel in my blog 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.590
 Well, how are we going to place it for 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.790
 sew it right in here in this area of the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.790
 towel in the lower part 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.870
 the measurements of the fabric are also in 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.760
 my blog, well, as you can see, we put it 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.620
 this way on the towel doing 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.110
 Match the edges and let's sew 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.630
 around here and also on the other 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.490
 What we are going to leave free is this 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.140
 part of up here 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.200
 good to sew I'm going to place 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.510
 pins and so it will be easier to go through 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.670
 the machine without moving the fabric like 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.770
 You see I've sewn the seams three 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.990
 seams and here is the here and the 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.830
 on the other side and what was left free 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.810
 as I told you is the area above 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.810
 well now let's turn the 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.120
 I'm going to turn the towel over 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.640
 work on that side 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.400
 and you have to take out the corners with 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.640
 You can be very careful with some 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.640
 scissors 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.739
 with caution that it does not break 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.400
 on the fabric is not damaged but we have to 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.189
 go removing the corners that have been 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.860
 good as you see this edge here is 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:35.099
 a little bulky we're going to spend a 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.129
 seam very close to the edge like a 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:42.530
 half a centimeter for this to be a 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.530
 little bit flatter and better finished 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.180
 the next thing is to make a hem on 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.000
 the top part we had left here 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.860
 about 4 centimeters without sewing good then 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.850
 we simply fold the cloth over itself 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.960
 same 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.960
 we form a hem 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.819
 in this way and we will go placing 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.359
 pins 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:13.239
 to the entire length of the fabric to be able 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:13.239
 Sew it more easily on the machine 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.209
 this cloth and this towel are from the store 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.030
 from minube.com I'll leave a link 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.770
 down so you can visit your store 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.960
 online and see what beautiful fabrics 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.960
 they have good I have already placed the 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.940
 pins 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.610
 in this part of above also in the 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.030
 bottom part and I'm going to sew it now to 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.030
 machine 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.470
 will be much better finished with this 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.800
 next seam that we are going to do now 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.560
 what are you going to see 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.190
 in the machines we use a normal foot and 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:53.500
 a step of 2 and a half we go as 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.500
 I tell you as close as possible to the edge 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.780
 remember that if you have any questions 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.000
 about this tutorial what do you want to do to me? 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.800
 some comment below in the box 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.510
 comments you can leave me your message 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.569
 I'm going to answer you and try 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.819
 help you as much as you can 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:13.830
 well just when we get to a 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.409
 corner we turn the cloth we go back to 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.949
 place the foot where it should go and we continue 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.949
 sewing 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.190
 after this what we will do is the 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.770
 hem of the rest of the towel for 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.530
 we have done a hem of a 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.300
 and a half centimeter and 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.600
 we are using a thread that remains 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:38.290
 totally camouflaged because it is the same 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.889
 color that this green towel 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.840
 lime or green pistachio also call it 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:47.139
 you can use a thread for example red 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.910
 that stands out that goes to the game with the 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.949
 cloth application that we have made in the 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.050
 shirt and also with the print of 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:57.210
 the cloth of course and so too 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.210
 you give a decorative touch to this seam 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.450
 you can use pins to catch 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.880
 all this hem or just go 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.760
 with careful space folding the 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.920
 fabric to an inch and a half and we passed 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.560
 the machine without the need to put 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.820
 pins that depends on your dexterity 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.290
 well then it will leave this set so 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.820
 nice we have been to go to the beach 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.500
 this summer I recommend that you 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.650
 T-shirt be cotton because it is more 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.640
 fresquita much better for children 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.830
