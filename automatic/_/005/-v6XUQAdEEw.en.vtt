 sergio glass window 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.260
 since there is the assessor glass and i 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.220
 transport both by road and rail 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.420
 by sea they have been reduced to the extreme 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.549
 we are also carrying out one 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.040
 class action because these politicians 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.439
 they must assume their responsibilities 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.500
 they have destroyed public transport 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.420

 transport yourself in another way but also to 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.350
 the environment because the more it is destroyed the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.790
 iron transport more increase more 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.979
 the rubber one increases and therefore increases 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.960
 Also pollution alongside the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.670
 users of the circumvesuviana have fallen 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.799
 in the field the regional delegate a

 stornaiuolo per giuliana represents the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.380
 highest point of an iceberg that a true one 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.990
 and just snatch the Neapolitan citizens 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.810
 with respect to the right to mobility with i 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.850
 cuts with the ideas of the giuliane 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.670
 of the other companies in Naples will be 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.040
 difficult to maintain the right to 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.170
 mobility especially for commuters and 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.770
 so the weaker people than this one 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.770
 our city
