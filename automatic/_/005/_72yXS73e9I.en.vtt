00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.270
 hello how about how are you in the video 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.490
 today we are going to make a date with fabric 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.930
 shirt or with trapillo I 'm not going to 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.150
 teach or anything because I want you to see 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.960
 the final result that will come after 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.960
 from step by step 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.199
 a plastic basket 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.650
 old t-shirts or shirts that 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.060
 we have disused 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.100
 another rogue 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:41.180
 thread and needle a button that is big 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.180
 the tin soldering iron 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.380
 if you are going to do it with t-shirt fabric 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.950
 The first thing is that you take out the strips 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.950
 of the shirt 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.030
 when we have a lot of bandages like that 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.199
 we throw it 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.199
 and jealousy wrinkles 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.980
 and it looks exactly like the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.660
 trapillo that comes to do the same 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.960
 cut into a fairly long strip of 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.960
 trapillo 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.610
 and here we can make a knot 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.610
 or sew 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.289
 and now we're going to go around the handle with 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.289
 all the cloth 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.580
 when we have surrounded the whole handle 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.890
 we passed the tip of the trapillo 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.330
 one of the holes for now and 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.330
 surrounding all this piece 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.000
 and here on the back we're going to 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.540
 give a few stitches so as not to make another 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.970
 knot 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.620
 and we can cut what we have left 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.290
 now we have cut pieces of 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.360
 trapillo approximately you can about 15 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.000
 centimeters or so 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.160
 you try on your date if you like more 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.610
 shorter and longer since 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.560
 first then you are cutting the others 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.400
 and we have to do many many 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.860
 bits 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.880
 that we will walk 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.880
 to date 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.629
 I already have my sixth completely covered 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.730
 with the pieces of cloth - in this 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.430
 bit that there were no holes for 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.170
 where to spend it and here for the part 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.670
 then beneath the welder 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.099
 I'm going to open tin 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.560
 holes and I'm going to take advantage of 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.280
 to put a button and that the basket 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.280
 stay closed 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.860
 we know the button 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.400
 we pass a piece of cloth for two 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.400
 holes 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.520
 that this will help us to close the 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.770
 bag when we go through the button 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.390
 we pull from here to calculate how much 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.700
 We want you to close your bag always 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.110
 taking into account that you have to take the 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.680
 tape below the button that is 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.719
 great 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.719
 and here we'll do a couple of knots 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.860
 and now the only thing is to keep going 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.989
 pieces of cloth through the holes to 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.290
 finish filling it we'll have to 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.820
 help the scissors 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.270
 because these holes are a little more 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.270
 little ones 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.970
 and I already have it covered completely 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.430
 we see a little the color is 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.479
 inevitable that is also not worrisome and 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.759
 Now what we have to do is 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.319
 cut out what you see that 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.319
 They are too long and we like them 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:45.340
 so we've turned an affect so 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:48.960
 simple like this and we have transformed it 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.960
 in this other so original 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:55.619
 Well, here the finished design looks 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.760
 the truth is that very casual 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.040
 she is very funny because he has done 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.840
 in this color but if you want to 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.240
 Take it all year round in shades 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.250
 black browns that sects do not have 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.350
 why be something exclusive summer to 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.590
 see who said that we can not 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.020
 take all year and we like it because no 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.600
 You can also make it to fringes a 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.150
 blue strip a red strip a strip 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.340
 white that already depending on the fabric that 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.340
 you have and well what with what 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.630
 you want to combine I wanted to tell you that 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.090
 of the big ball has left me this 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.650
 little bit of the big ball I think 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:38.230
 how easy it is because this is what we 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:41.930
 And I'll have delayed, as I say 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.710
 I did it in two afternoons about six hours already 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.710
 of order to make them 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.020
 Well, this was the video, I say what 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.240
 same as always I hope that I have 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.060
 liked or at least entertained or 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.710
 I send a lot of kisses and I hope that we 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.710
 let's see in the next video goodbye 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.989
 of work that the cell has but 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.230
 it's worth it because it's so 

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:27.300
 pretty 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.220
