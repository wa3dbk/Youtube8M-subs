again

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.319 
again
okay<00:00:48.629> because<00:00:49.500> that's<00:00:49.860> not<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> good<00:00:50.340> idea<00:00:50.760> okay

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
okay because that's not a good idea okay

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.150 
okay because that's not a good idea okay
so<00:00:51.390> what<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.530> first<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.010> all

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
so what you want to do is first of all

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.680 
so what you want to do is first of all
if<00:00:53.940> your<00:00:54.180> power<00:00:55.020> lines<00:00:55.699> if<00:00:56.699> you're<00:00:56.969> using<00:00:57.270> your

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
if your power lines if you're using your

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.590 
if your power lines if you're using your
cell<00:00:57.719> phone<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:59.250> thing<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.789> do<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.180> take

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
cell phone one thing you can do is take

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.399 
cell phone one thing you can do is take
off<00:01:00.930> your<00:01:01.289> shoes<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.190> ground<00:01:03.180> yourself<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
off your shoes and ground yourself to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.300 
off your shoes and ground yourself to
the<00:01:04.530> earth<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:06.439> what<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.650> does<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.159> it

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the earth and what that does is it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.550 
the earth and what that does is it
allows<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.720> electricity<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> flow<00:01:09.900> through

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
allows the electricity to flow through

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.789 
allows the electricity to flow through
your<00:01:10.950> body<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.780> stuck<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.560> it

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
your body and not just be stuck in it

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.510 
your body and not just be stuck in it
like<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.310> were<00:01:14.430> wearing<00:01:14.700> rubber<00:01:15.320> shoes<00:01:16.520> if

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
like if you were wearing rubber shoes if

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.920 
like if you were wearing rubber shoes if
you're<00:01:17.729> wearing<00:01:18.000> rub<00:01:18.270> your<00:01:18.390> chute<00:01:18.689> rubber

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
you're wearing rub your chute rubber

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.770 
you're wearing rub your chute rubber
shoes<00:01:19.290> you're<00:01:19.500> insulated<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.549> you're<00:01:21.540> not

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
shoes you're insulated and you're not

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.539 
shoes you're insulated and you're not
allowing<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.439> electricity<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.310> leave

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
allowing that electricity to leave

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.149 
allowing that electricity to leave
peacefully<00:01:24.049> and<00:01:25.049> when<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.380> not<00:01:25.619> doing<00:01:26.130> that

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
peacefully and when it's not doing that

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.649 
peacefully and when it's not doing that
then<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.030> probably<00:01:27.299> causing<00:01:28.259> all<00:01:28.530> kinds<00:01:29.189> of

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
then it's probably causing all kinds of

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.319 
then it's probably causing all kinds of
nervousness<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.930> dis<00:01:31.590> orders<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.400> brain

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
nervousness so dis orders and brain

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.020 
nervousness so dis orders and brain
problems<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.560> know<00:01:34.680> people<00:01:35.130> get<00:01:35.310> exposed<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
problems you know people get exposed to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.380 
problems you know people get exposed to
electricity<00:01:36.780> every<00:01:37.200> day<00:01:37.590> all<00:01:37.979> day<00:01:38.040> long<00:01:38.549> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
electricity every day all day long and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.200 
electricity every day all day long and
then<00:01:39.659> they're<00:01:39.780> not<00:01:39.960> grounded<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.880> who<00:01:41.880> knows

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
then they're not grounded and who knows

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.649 
then they're not grounded and who knows
how<00:01:42.689> many<00:01:42.770> problems<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.040> causing<00:01:44.479> for<00:01:45.479> their

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
how many problems it's causing for their

to<00:02:18.870> avoid<00:02:19.880> cellphone<00:02:21.290> EMF<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.190> leave<00:02:23.400> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
to avoid cellphone EMF is to leave the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.360 
to avoid cellphone EMF is to leave the
cell<00:02:23.819> phone<00:02:24.150> off<00:02:24.739> see<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.920> button<00:02:26.340> right

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
cell phone off see that button right

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.600 
cell phone off see that button right
there<00:02:26.630> just<00:02:27.630> turn<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.260> off<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.500> don't<00:02:29.160> keep<00:02:29.430> it

your calls at the same time while you're

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.100 
your calls at the same time while you're
grounded<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.099> earth<00:02:44.390> preferably<00:02:45.390> if<00:02:45.900> it's

grounded to the earth preferably if it's
cold<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.680> winter<00:02:46.920> time<00:02:47.130> you'll<00:02:47.400> have<00:02:47.519> to

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
cold in the winter time you'll have to

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.490 
cold in the winter time you'll have to
use<00:02:47.849> one<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.090> those<00:02:48.269> indoor<00:02:48.870> grounding

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
use one of those indoor grounding

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.030 
use one of those indoor grounding
methods<00:02:49.890> from<00:02:50.010> Les<00:02:50.280> EMF<00:02:50.760> comm<00:02:51.650> but<00:02:52.650> if<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:52.860> do

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
methods from Les EMF comm but if you do

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.039 
methods from Les EMF comm but if you do
all<00:02:53.069> that<00:02:53.280> then<00:02:53.790> it'll<00:02:54.060> minimize<00:02:54.390> your

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
all that then it'll minimize your

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.890 
all that then it'll minimize your
exposure<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.310> many<00:02:56.640> things<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.480> we<00:02:57.660> need

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
exposure and so many things that we need

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.140 
exposure and so many things that we need
to<00:02:58.079> do<00:02:58.290> in<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:58.680> life<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.250> stay<00:02:59.459> healthy<00:02:59.670> are

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
to do in this life to stay healthy are

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.620 
to do in this life to stay healthy are
things<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.959> are<00:03:01.790> premeditated<00:03:02.790> we<00:03:03.299> think

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
things that are premeditated we think

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.130 
things that are premeditated we think
about<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.230> first<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.980> then<00:03:05.489> we<00:03:05.640> plan<00:03:05.940> ahead<00:03:06.180> we

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
about it first and then we plan ahead we

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.640 
about it first and then we plan ahead we
use<00:03:07.350> our<00:03:07.590> brains<00:03:08.690> okay<00:03:09.690> sometimes<00:03:10.380> when

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
use our brains okay sometimes when

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.759 
use our brains okay sometimes when
you're<00:03:10.829> in<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.040> chaotic<00:03:12.200> traveling<00:03:13.200> thing<00:03:13.470> like

like it is more in the camera but that's
actually<00:04:13.510> roughly<00:04:14.159> it<00:04:15.159> large<00:04:15.700> that<00:04:16.060> pole<00:04:16.419> you

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
actually roughly it large that pole you

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.840 
actually roughly it large that pole you
