people<00:03:16.230> transform<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:16.980> other<00:03:17.519> people<00:03:17.970> and

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
people transform and other people and

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.050 
people transform and other people and
that's<00:03:18.450> enough<00:03:18.690> for<00:03:18.720> me<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.790> was<00:03:20.940> pretty

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
that's enough for me so that was pretty

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.300 
that's enough for me so that was pretty
much<00:03:21.209> what<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.540> movie<00:03:21.690> is<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.170> I<00:03:22.530> loved<00:03:22.920> it

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
much what this movie is and I loved it

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.570

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
so for them to show the fact that he

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.759 
so for them to show the fact that he
really<00:03:26.909> does<00:03:27.810> want<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:28.230> get<00:03:28.379> rid<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.620> like

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
he gets that desperate point where he

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.039 
he gets that desperate point where he
just<00:03:35.190> takes<00:03:35.400> all<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.610> pills<00:03:35.879> and<00:03:36.209> then<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.959> you

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
and they can't fix it I don't know it

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.520 
and they can't fix it I don't know it
was<00:03:48.360> really<00:03:48.480> good<00:03:48.659> now<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.110> whole<00:03:49.290> thing<00:03:49.409> with

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
was really good now the whole thing with

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.070 
was really good now the whole thing with
the<00:03:49.620> storm<00:03:49.920> um<00:03:50.540> storms<00:03:51.540> are<00:03:51.659> always<00:03:51.870> really

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
the storm um storms are always really

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.259 
the storm um storms are always really
interesting<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.590> use<00:03:52.709> in<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.890> movie<00:03:53.159> for<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.120> lot

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
interesting to use in a movie for a lot

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.410 
interesting to use in a movie for a lot
of<00:03:54.360> different<00:03:54.569> reasons<00:03:54.659> but<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.680> know<00:03:55.769> storms

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
of different reasons but you know storms

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.789 
of different reasons but you know storms
historically<00:03:57.420> mean<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.439> know<00:03:58.560> it's

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
historically mean that you know it's

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.110 
historically mean that you know it's
foreshadowing<00:03:59.370> something<00:03:59.730> bad<00:03:59.879> is<00:04:00.060> gonna

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
foreshadowing something bad is gonna

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.839 
foreshadowing something bad is gonna
happen<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.959> could<00:04:01.110> just<00:04:01.140> do<00:04:01.379> a<00:04:01.409> lot<00:04:01.620> of

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
happen you could just do a lot of

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.660 
happen you could just do a lot of
symbolic<00:04:02.849> stupa<00:04:03.030> storms<00:04:03.510> but<00:04:04.019> um<00:04:04.319> it's<00:04:05.129> the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
symbolic stupa storms but um it's the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.399 
symbolic stupa storms but um it's the
way<00:04:05.819> that<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.120> movie<00:04:06.360> ended<00:04:06.599> was<00:04:06.840> like<00:04:07.140> I

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
way that the movie ended was like I

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.460 
way that the movie ended was like I
wanted<00:04:08.159> to<00:04:08.310> cry<00:04:08.549> with<00:04:08.610> joy<00:04:08.819> I<00:04:09.269> was<00:04:09.420> so<00:04:09.870> happy

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
wanted to cry with joy I was so happy

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.289 
wanted to cry with joy I was so happy
because<00:04:10.760> towards<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.939> end<00:04:12.030> of<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.150> movie

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
because towards the end of the movie

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.910 
because towards the end of the movie
when<00:04:12.510> they<00:04:12.989> ended<00:04:13.140> up<00:04:13.200> going<00:04:13.409> to<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.709> cellar

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
when they ended up going to the cellar

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.679 
when they ended up going to the cellar
and<00:04:14.189> it's<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.909> know<00:04:14.939> the<00:04:15.150> storm<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.569> you

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:15.689 
and it's you know the storm and you

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.090 
and it's you know the storm and you
think<00:04:15.870> oh<00:04:15.959> it's<00:04:16.199> happening<00:04:16.320> is<00:04:16.650> happening

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
think oh it's happening is happening

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.890 
think oh it's happening is happening
and<00:04:17.250> then<00:04:17.940> when<00:04:18.120> Jessica<00:04:18.510> Chastain's

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
and then when Jessica Chastain's

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.360 
and then when Jessica Chastain's
character<00:04:19.290> says<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.680> know<00:04:19.770> I<00:04:19.800> don't<00:04:20.070> hear

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
character says you know I don't hear

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.340 
character says you know I don't hear
anything<00:04:20.550> there's<00:04:21.030> nothing<00:04:21.480> storms<00:04:22.020> over

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
anything there's nothing storms over

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.840 
anything there's nothing storms over
there's<00:04:22.530> nothing<00:04:22.800> there<00:04:22.950> let<00:04:23.190> us<00:04:23.310> out<00:04:23.460> I

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
there's nothing there let us out I

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.250 
there's nothing there let us out I
thought<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:24.390> this<00:04:24.660> movie<00:04:24.960> was<00:04:24.990> going<00:04:25.200> to

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
thought that this movie was going to

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.290 
thought that this movie was going to
take<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.470> really<00:04:25.680> weird<00:04:25.890> turn<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.580> he<00:04:27.150> was

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
take a really weird turn and he was

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.320 
take a really weird turn and he was
going<00:04:27.420> to<00:04:27.510> end<00:04:27.690> up<00:04:27.900> like<00:04:28.200> keeping<00:04:29.130> them<00:04:29.340> you

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
going to end up like keeping them you

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.150 
going to end up like keeping them you
know<00:04:30.480> captive<00:04:31.140> in<00:04:31.350> there<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.740> he<00:04:31.830> was<00:04:31.980> never

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
know captive in there and he was never

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.770 
know captive in there and he was never
going<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.400> open<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:33.120> doors<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:33.510> I<00:04:33.630> thought

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
going to open the doors and I thought

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.060 
going to open the doors and I thought
that<00:04:33.900> they<00:04:34.020> were<00:04:34.110> like<00:04:34.260> gonna<00:04:34.380> die<00:04:34.470> in<00:04:34.680> there<00:04:34.890> I

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
that they were like gonna die in there I

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.230 
that they were like gonna die in there I
honestly<00:04:35.580> thought<00:04:35.730> that<00:04:35.790> was<00:04:36.030> where<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.210> was

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
honestly thought that was where it was

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.490 
honestly thought that was where it was
going<00:04:36.420> to<00:04:36.510> go<00:04:36.630> which<00:04:37.230> would<00:04:37.380> have<00:04:37.440> been

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
going to go which would have been

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.280 
going to go which would have been
interesting<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:38.250> scary<00:04:38.460> but<00:04:39.360> um<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:39.930> sad

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
interesting and scary but um and sad

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.070 
interesting and scary but um and sad
because<00:04:40.640> yeah<00:04:41.640> obviously<00:04:42.120> that<00:04:42.690> definitely

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
because yeah obviously that definitely

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.250 
because yeah obviously that definitely
could<00:04:43.920> have<00:04:43.980> been<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:45.060> know<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.210> possible<00:04:45.990> way

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
could have been you know a possible way

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.480 
could have been you know a possible way
that<00:04:46.290> this<00:04:46.680> movie<00:04:47.010> was<00:04:47.040> going<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.370> go

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
that this movie was going to go

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.400 
that this movie was going to go
especially<00:04:48.420> I<00:04:48.750> thought<00:04:48.990> he<00:04:49.050> was<00:04:49.110> gonna<00:04:49.230> do

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
especially I thought he was gonna do

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.440 
especially I thought he was gonna do
some<00:04:49.530> crazy<00:04:49.710> like<00:04:50.100> swallow<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.120> key<00:04:51.300> or
