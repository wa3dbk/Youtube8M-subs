00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
hard and I don't feel it at my elbow

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.940 
hard and I don't feel it at my elbow
anymore<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:06.960> because<00:02:07.229> I've<00:02:07.439> turned<00:02:07.770> my

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
anymore just because I've turned my

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.369 
anymore just because I've turned my

joint the opposite way I'm no longer

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.410 
joint the opposite way I'm no longer
stressing<00:02:11.039> my<00:02:11.160> ligaments<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.450> reduces

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
stressing my ligaments so that reduces

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.930

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
and bottom line is you're gonna hit

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.900 
and bottom line is you're gonna hit
every<00:02:19.900> punch<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.349> throw<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:21.190> sometimes<00:02:21.730> you

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
every punch you throw so sometimes you

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.160 
every punch you throw so sometimes you

break your elbow it's almost like a very
mild<00:02:39.819> sprain<00:02:40.420> but<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.170> will<00:02:41.350> cause

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
mild sprain but it will cause

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.890 
mild sprain but it will cause
inflammation<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:42.910> swelling<00:02:43.120> in<00:02:43.510> your<00:02:43.540> joint

and it can affect your power for the
remainder<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.150> fight<00:02:46.360> now<00:02:46.750> there's<00:02:46.930> two

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
remainder of the fight now there's two

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.140 
remainder of the fight now there's two
other<00:02:47.170> concepts<00:02:48.069> in<00:02:48.190> punch<00:02:48.459> dynamics<00:02:49.090> that

other concepts in punch dynamics that

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.380 
other concepts in punch dynamics that
are<00:02:49.440> incredibly<00:02:50.440> important<00:02:51.310> one<00:02:51.850> of<00:02:51.910> which<00:02:52.209> is

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
are incredibly important one of which is

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.509 
are incredibly important one of which is
