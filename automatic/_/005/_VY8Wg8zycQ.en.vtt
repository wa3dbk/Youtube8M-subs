00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.810 
I felt like this color actually went
perfectly<00:00:38.219> with<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.910> looks<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:43.820> then

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
perfectly with the looks and then

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.430 
perfectly with the looks and then
afterwards<00:00:45.329> were<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.660> me<00:00:45.809> perfecting<00:00:46.410> that

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
afterwards were just me perfecting that

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.930 
afterwards were just me perfecting that
transition<00:00:47.070> color<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.700> little<00:00:47.820> bit

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
transition color so it's a little bit

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:57.240 
transition color so it's a little bit
more<00:00:48.090> visible<00:00:48.510> when<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.050> apply<00:00:49.469> our<00:00:49.680> lashes

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.610 

but<00:00:57.970> for<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.270> center<00:00:58.630> of<00:00:58.660> the<00:00:58.900> lid<00:00:59.110> I<00:00:59.260> decided

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
but for the center of the lid I decided

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.190 
but for the center of the lid I decided
to<00:00:59.770> go<00:00:59.920> with<00:01:00.130> a<00:01:00.190> very<00:01:00.520> light<00:01:00.940> grey<00:01:01.450> she<00:01:01.989> didn't

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
to go with a very light grey she didn't

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.079 
to go with a very light grey she didn't
really<00:01:02.290> have<00:01:02.560> much<00:01:02.590> going<00:01:03.100> on<00:01:03.370> there<00:01:03.640> since<00:01:03.910> it

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
really have much going on there since it

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.060 
really have much going on there since it
was<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.239> very<00:01:04.390> natural<00:01:04.750> look<00:01:05.290> that<00:01:05.560> I<00:01:05.770> decided

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
was a very natural look that I decided

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.000 
was a very natural look that I decided
to<00:01:06.310> use<00:01:06.430> that<00:01:06.610> great<00:01:06.850> tone<00:01:07.090> on<00:01:07.330> that<00:01:07.510> area

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
to use that great tone on that area

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.920 
to use that great tone on that area
sometimes<00:01:09.010> I<00:01:09.220> have<00:01:09.400> a<00:01:09.430> tendency<00:01:09.700> of<00:01:10.000> kind<00:01:10.810> of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
sometimes I have a tendency of kind of

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.810 
sometimes I have a tendency of kind of
blending<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.650> shadows<00:01:12.040> a<00:01:12.250> bit<00:01:12.490> with<00:01:12.640> my
