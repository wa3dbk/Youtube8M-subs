00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
of views field of vision will be like

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.120 
of views field of vision will be like
squish<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.470> stretched<00:01:16.920> across

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
squish like just like stretched across

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.450 
squish like just like stretched across
all<00:01:17.640> three<00:01:17.720> screens<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.950> need<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> program

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
all three screens so you need a program

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.179 
all three screens so you need a program
called<00:01:20.850> widescreen<00:01:21.509> fixer<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
called widescreen fixer and I have that

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.990 
called widescreen fixer and I have that
right<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.509> then<00:01:24.630> basically<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.439> just

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
right here and then basically you just

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.170 
right here and then basically you just
as<00:01:27.619> map<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.040> hotkeys<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.790> tells<00:01:29.970> you

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
as map for the hotkeys and it tells you

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.440 
as map for the hotkeys and it tells you
awe<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:31.170> watch<00:01:31.829> K<00:01:32.189> equals<00:01:32.640> what<00:01:32.850> number<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
awe like watch K equals what number and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.680 
awe like watch K equals what number and
the<00:01:34.020> 0<00:01:34.350> key<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> numpad<00:01:35.180> hey<00:01:36.180> I'll<00:01:36.299> find<00:01:36.600> it

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
the 0 key on the numpad hey I'll find it

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
the 0 key on the numpad hey I'll find it
the<00:01:39.320> 0<00:01:39.590> key<00:01:39.890> on<00:01:40.010> the<00:01:40.130> numpad<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.760> 96<00:01:41.570> I<00:01:41.810> put<00:01:42.050> 96
