this<00:00:02.370> video<00:00:02.730> is<00:00:02.939> about<00:00:03.090> enzymes<00:00:03.659> it<00:00:04.259> would

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
this video is about enzymes it would

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.079 
this video is about enzymes it would
explain<00:00:04.680> what<00:00:04.890> enzymes<00:00:05.250> are<00:00:05.460> what<00:00:05.910> they<00:00:06.029> do

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
explain what enzymes are what they do

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.600 
explain what enzymes are what they do
and<00:00:06.450> how<00:00:06.870> they<00:00:06.899> work<00:00:07.290> we<00:00:08.160> will<00:00:08.250> look<00:00:08.429> at<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
and how they work we will look at the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.310 
and how they work we will look at the
different<00:00:08.970> factors<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.480> affect<00:00:09.960> how<00:00:10.139> well

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
different factors that affect how well

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.830 
different factors that affect how well
enzymes<00:00:10.769> work<00:00:11.040> we'll<00:00:11.820> also<00:00:12.000> look<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.660> bit

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
enzymes work we'll also look in a bit

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.810 
enzymes work we'll also look in a bit
more<00:00:12.960> detail<00:00:13.170> at<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.799> enzymes<00:00:14.190> involved<00:00:14.580> in

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
more detail at the enzymes involved in

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
more detail at the enzymes involved in
the<00:00:14.940> digestive<00:00:15.480> system<00:00:15.980> so<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.400> are<00:00:17.609> enzymes

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
the digestive system so what are enzymes

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.620 
the digestive system so what are enzymes
they<00:00:18.840> are<00:00:18.960> biological<00:00:19.770> catalysts<00:00:20.630> biological

they are biological catalysts biological

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.810 
they are biological catalysts biological
because<00:00:22.080> they're<00:00:22.260> proteins<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.920> like<00:00:23.580> any

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
because they're proteins and like any

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.670 
because they're proteins and like any
proteins<00:00:24.359> are<00:00:24.570> simply<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.050> chain<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.560> amino

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
proteins are simply a chain of amino

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.890 
proteins are simply a chain of amino
acids<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.789> has<00:00:26.910> folded<00:00:27.150> up<00:00:27.480> into<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
by the order of bases in the gene so if

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.690 
by the order of bases in the gene so if
there's<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> mutation<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.320> DNA<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:38.309> enzyme

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
there's a mutation in the DNA the enzyme

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.459 
there's a mutation in the DNA the enzyme
will<00:00:38.910> not<00:00:39.030> be<00:00:39.149> made<00:00:39.329> correctly<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.320> is

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
will not be made correctly and so is

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.610 
will not be made correctly and so is
likely<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> work<00:00:41.960> catalysts<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.440> like

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620

an enzyme works if the temperature goes
