is<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.299> solution<00:01:32.840> okay<00:01:33.079> well<00:01:33.469> we've<00:01:33.619> we<00:01:33.890> have<00:01:34.100> a

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
is a solution okay well we've we have a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.099 
is a solution okay well we've we have a
piece<00:01:34.640> that<00:01:34.670> we<00:01:34.880> show<00:01:35.060> a<00:01:35.090> lot<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.689> shows<00:01:35.869> all

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
piece that we show a lot so it shows all

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.919 
piece that we show a lot so it shows all
of<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.469> steps<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.640> get<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:38.030> custom<00:01:38.509> orthotic

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
of the steps to get the custom orthotic

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.450 
of the steps to get the custom orthotic
put<00:01:39.079> together<00:01:39.259> how<00:01:40.009> long<00:01:40.070> does<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.399> whole

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
put together how long does the whole

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.099 
put together how long does the whole
process<00:01:40.549> take<00:01:40.939> about<00:01:41.509> an<00:01:41.659> hour<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:41.929> a<00:01:41.960> half

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
process take about an hour and a half

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.050 
process take about an hour and a half
okay<00:01:42.320> because<00:01:42.679> it's<00:01:42.920> intense<00:01:43.280> it's<00:01:43.609> not<00:01:43.759> just

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
okay because it's intense it's not just

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.060 
okay because it's intense it's not just
