00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
ball watching I think the moment that

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
ball watching I think the moment that
ball<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.870> played<00:00:49.170> he<00:00:49.320> recognized<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.010> fact

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739

Pedro you know that Tasha actually
wasn't<00:03:50.470> great<00:03:50.859> but<00:03:51.069> looking<00:03:51.430> of<00:03:51.549> course<00:03:51.819> many

many matches would have been played by
then<00:03:54.489> I<00:03:54.959> just<00:03:55.959> think<00:03:56.139> that<00:03:56.170> he<00:03:56.349> feels<00:03:56.500> better

stuff

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.320 

it's<00:04:26.740> almost<00:04:26.890> too<00:04:27.190> easy<00:04:27.220> isn't<00:04:27.760> it<00:04:27.790> at<00:04:28.090> this

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
it's almost too easy isn't it at this

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.970 
it's almost too easy isn't it at this
stage<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:28.870> think<00:04:29.080> we<00:04:29.170> felt<00:04:29.500> that<00:04:29.590> from<00:04:29.800> the

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
stage and I think we felt that from the

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.340 
stage and I think we felt that from the
beginning<00:04:30.100> that<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.790> back<00:04:31.570> three<00:04:31.900> you<00:04:32.080> about

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
beginning that the back three you about

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.320 
beginning that the back three you about
four<00:04:32.860> because<00:04:33.220> I<00:04:33.310> really<00:04:33.670> think<00:04:33.820> they<00:04:33.970> started

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
four because I really think they started

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.570 
four because I really think they started
with<00:04:34.450> four<00:04:34.690> players<00:04:34.960> almost<00:04:35.470> looked<00:04:35.680> up<00:04:35.920> to<00:04:36.430> me

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
with four players almost looked up to me

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.820 
with four players almost looked up to me
that<00:04:36.790> way<00:04:36.940> regardless<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.990> all<00:04:38.170> who's<00:04:38.530> playing

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
that way regardless of all who's playing

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.250 
that way regardless of all who's playing
in<00:04:38.980> the<00:04:39.040> back<00:04:39.720> certainly<00:04:40.720> they<00:04:40.810> haven't<00:04:41.170> been

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
in the back certainly they haven't been

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.870 
in the back certainly they haven't been
