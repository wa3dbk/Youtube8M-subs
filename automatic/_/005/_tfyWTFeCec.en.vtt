like<00:02:24.010> really<00:02:24.220> easy<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.819> don't<00:02:24.970> go<00:02:25.120> too<00:02:25.299> fast

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
like really easy and don't go too fast

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.720 
like really easy and don't go too fast
now<00:02:26.500> here's<00:02:26.680> one<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:26.950> basic<00:02:27.250> stage<00:02:27.459> looks

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
now here's one of the basic stage looks

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.890 
now here's one of the basic stage looks
like

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.000 

now<00:02:32.900> what<00:02:33.079> you<00:02:33.200> do<00:02:33.319> is<00:02:33.349> you<00:02:33.560> just<00:02:33.590> pull<00:02:33.890> the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
now what you do is you just pull the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.360 
now what you do is you just pull the
Wemo<00:02:34.599> and<00:02:35.599> you<00:02:35.750> can't<00:02:35.930> roll<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.290> dog

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
Wemo and you can't roll the dog

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.000 
Wemo and you can't roll the dog
more<00:02:38.940> control<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.360> ball

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
more control the ball

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.839 
more control the ball
basically<00:02:41.849> this<00:02:42.780> game<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.409> my<00:02:43.440> opinion<00:02:44.370> has

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
basically this game in my opinion has

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.979 
basically this game in my opinion has
the<00:02:45.330> greatest<00:02:46.290> view<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.310> Wii<00:02:47.459> Remote<00:02:47.989> it

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.920 
the greatest view of the Wii Remote it
is<00:02:49.260> perfect

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.020 

now<00:02:54.530> depending<00:02:55.250> on<00:02:55.340> your<00:02:55.430> time<00:02:55.670> you'll<00:02:55.909> get

months and I really can't wait
for<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:08.990> because<00:03:09.110> it's<00:03:09.260> going<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:09.440> be<00:03:09.590> great

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
for it because it's going to be great

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.670 
for it because it's going to be great
there's<00:03:10.850> all<00:03:11.090> sorts<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.540> levels<00:03:11.750> from<00:03:12.260> forced

in faith to being in Candyland where

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.960 
in faith to being in Candyland where
you're<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:18.680> know<00:03:18.800> rolling<00:03:19.100> on<00:03:19.340> cakes<00:03:19.700> and

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
you're you know rolling on cakes and

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.410 
you're you know rolling on cakes and
cookies<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.600> wafers<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.230> all<00:03:21.319> sorts<00:03:21.590> of

cookies and wafers and all sorts of

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.729 
cookies and wafers and all sorts of
but<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.810> basically<00:03:23.959> hold<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.410> remote

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
but you basically hold the remote

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.250 
but you basically hold the remote
vertically<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:25.630> once<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:26.750> get<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.080> some<00:03:27.230> of

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
vertically and once you get to some of

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.040 
vertically and once you get to some of
the<00:03:27.380> harder<00:03:27.650> stages<00:03:28.069> you<00:03:28.850> will<00:03:29.000> discover<00:03:29.450> that

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
the harder stages you will discover that

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.690 
the harder stages you will discover that
you're<00:03:30.319> going<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.500> be<00:03:30.650> putting<00:03:30.950> you're<00:03:31.550> going

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
you're going to be putting you're going

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.810 
you're going to be putting you're going
to<00:03:31.760> be<00:03:31.850> holding<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.300> remote<00:03:32.660> in<00:03:33.320> some<00:03:34.190> really

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
to be holding the remote in some really

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.860 
to be holding the remote in some really
odd<00:03:35.030> ways<00:03:35.360> because<00:03:36.350> it<00:03:37.220> uses<00:03:37.870> 360-degree

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
odd ways because it uses 360-degree

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.650 
odd ways because it uses 360-degree
motion<00:03:39.350> so<00:03:40.070> there's<00:03:40.610> gonna<00:03:40.730> be<00:03:40.820> all<00:03:41.090> sorts<00:03:41.120> of

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
motion so there's gonna be all sorts of

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.690 
motion so there's gonna be all sorts of
ways<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:41.959> have<00:03:42.140> to<00:03:42.320> hold<00:03:42.500> it<00:03:42.650> in<00:03:42.890> order<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.280> get

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
ways you have to hold it in order to get

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.790 
ways you have to hold it in order to get
on<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.269> certain<00:03:44.510> parts<00:03:44.930> without<00:03:45.050> falling<00:03:45.680> off

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
on to certain parts without falling off

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.820 
on to certain parts without falling off
or<00:03:46.340> without<00:03:46.760> failing

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
or without failing

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.410 
or without failing
so<00:03:49.130> this<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.340> basically<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.730> game<00:03:49.880> you

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
so this is basically the game you

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.660 
so this is basically the game you
collect<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:51.200> certain<00:03:51.860> number<00:03:52.070> of<00:03:52.220> gems<00:03:52.520> that

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
collect a certain number of gems that

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.580 
collect a certain number of gems that
are<00:03:52.730> priests<00:03:53.060> at<00:03:53.270> first<00:03:53.540> stage<00:03:53.810> once<00:03:54.500> you

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
are priests at first stage once you

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.590 
are priests at first stage once you
collect<00:03:54.890> them<00:03:55.010> all<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.280> goal<00:03:55.550> will<00:03:56.030> open<00:03:56.450> up

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
collect them all the goal will open up

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.809 
collect them all the goal will open up
and<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:57.440> can<00:03:57.620> progress<00:03:57.800> to<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.310> next<00:03:58.430> level

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
and you can progress to the next level

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.530 
and you can progress to the next level
now<00:04:01.819> just<00:04:02.060> be<00:04:02.180> two<00:04:02.780> more<00:04:02.900> stages<00:04:03.140> there<00:04:04.450> so<00:04:05.450> you

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
now just be two more stages there so you

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.910 
now just be two more stages there so you
hold<00:04:05.689> it<00:04:05.749> vertically<00:04:06.109> now<00:04:06.319> if<00:04:06.409> I<00:04:06.499> want<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.739> go

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
hold it vertically now if I want to go

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.220 
hold it vertically now if I want to go
up<00:04:07.609> you<00:04:08.299> have<00:04:08.359> to<00:04:08.480> tilt<00:04:08.719> the<00:04:08.870> front<00:04:09.019> of<00:04:09.170> the

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
up you have to tilt the front of the

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.209 
up you have to tilt the front of the
Wiimote<00:04:09.620> down<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:10.879> forward<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:12.230> he'll<00:04:13.040> roll

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:13.219 
Wiimote down and forward and he'll roll

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.250 
Wiimote down and forward and he'll roll
up<00:04:13.400> you're<00:04:14.030> holding<00:04:14.359> the<00:04:14.450> Wiimote<00:04:14.780> vertical

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
up you're holding the Wiimote vertical

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.529 
up you're holding the Wiimote vertical
you<00:04:15.680> turn<00:04:15.889> it<00:04:16.039> slowly<00:04:16.370> sideways<00:04:17.060> and<00:04:17.359> he'll

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
you turn it slowly sideways and he'll

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.520 
you turn it slowly sideways and he'll
roll<00:04:17.720> down<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.049> hill

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
roll down the hill

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.259 
roll down the hill
and<00:04:19.829> then<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.250> turn<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.579> sideways<00:04:20.790> again

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
and then you turn it sideways again

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.840 
and then you turn it sideways again
those<00:04:22.049> things<00:04:22.230> you<00:04:22.440> turn<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.770> on<00:04:22.920> at<00:04:23.250> 5:00

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
those things you turn it on at 5:00

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.260 
those things you turn it on at 5:00
you<00:04:23.940> don't<00:04:24.090> actually<00:04:24.270> hold<00:04:24.720> it<00:04:24.960> sideways
