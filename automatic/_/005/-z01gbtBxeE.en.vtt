do it on a car primarily what you need
is<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> good<00:00:15.299> length<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.630> rope<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:16.109> strong<00:00:16.410> rope

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
is a good length of rope a strong rope

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.730 
is a good length of rope a strong rope
and<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:16.980> also<00:00:17.100> need<00:00:17.340> two<00:00:17.580> tie-down<00:00:18.449> points<00:00:19.020> I

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
and you also need two tie-down points I

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.380 
and you also need two tie-down points I
have<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> shorter<00:00:20.580> piece<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.880> rope<00:00:21.000> here<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.359> I

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
move over to a longer piece I'm going to

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.250 
move over to a longer piece I'm going to
actually<00:00:25.439> tie<00:00:25.800> down<00:00:26.039> load<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:27.869> ends<00:00:28.140> are

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
actually tie down load the ends are

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.240 
actually tie down load the ends are
pretty<00:00:28.769> much<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:30.560> one<00:00:31.560> end<00:00:31.710> we've<00:00:31.830> got<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.009> loop

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
pretty much the one end we've got a loop

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.920 
pretty much the one end we've got a loop
that's<00:00:32.730> been<00:00:32.969> set<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> other<00:00:33.780> end

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that's been set up and the other end

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.240 
that's been set up and the other end
we've<00:00:34.050> got<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.200> tag<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.710> that's<00:00:34.890> been<00:00:34.950> set<00:00:35.219> up

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
we've got to tag in that's been set up

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.740 
we've got to tag in that's been set up
and<00:00:35.399> there's<00:00:35.550> been<00:00:35.730> no<00:00:35.910> modifications

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
and there's been no modifications

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.510

whatsoever<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.559> okay<00:00:38.129> I'm<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> set

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
whatsoever to that okay I'm going to set

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.889 
whatsoever to that okay I'm going to set
this<00:00:38.640> aside<00:00:38.700> we're<00:00:39.180> going<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.420> look<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
this aside we're going to go look at the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.920 
this aside we're going to go look at the
larger<00:00:40.860> rope<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.219> have<00:00:41.430> over<00:00:41.640> here<00:00:41.930> so

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
larger rope that I have over here so

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.970 
larger rope that I have over here so
right<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> first<00:00:43.410> attachment<00:00:43.829> point<00:00:45.980> what

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
right the first attachment point what

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.400 
right the first attachment point what
I'm<00:00:47.070> going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.460> take<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:48.110> loop<00:00:49.110> end

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
I'm going to do is take that loop end

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.959 
I'm going to do is take that loop end
and<00:00:49.710> I'm<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.190> put<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.550> onto<00:00:50.760> this

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and I'm going to put that onto this

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.459 
and I'm going to put that onto this
u-bolt<00:00:51.420> that's<00:00:51.629> been<00:00:51.750> applied<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
u-bolt that's been applied with the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.900 
u-bolt that's been applied with the
truck<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.520> feed<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.850> through

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
truck it's going to feed that through

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.729 
truck it's going to feed that through
okay<00:00:54.780> take<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.800> tag<00:00:56.039> end<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> rope<00:00:57.739> feed

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
okay take the tag end of the rope feed

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.290 
okay take the tag end of the rope feed
that<00:00:58.890> through<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.280> loop<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.730> take<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that through the loop and take up the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.950 
that through the loop and take up the
slack<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:02.059> come<00:01:03.059> down<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.570> top<00:01:03.780> of

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
slack so that we come down on top of

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.359 
slack so that we come down on top of
that<00:01:04.080> attachment<00:01:04.920> point<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.460> tighten<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.909> up

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.789 

okay<00:01:11.369> that's<00:01:11.610> one<00:01:11.939> side<00:01:12.920> come<00:01:13.920> over<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> load

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.960 

again<00:01:19.799> I'm<00:01:19.890> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> take<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> tag<00:01:20.549> into<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
again I'm going to take the tag into the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.260 
again I'm going to take the tag into the
rope<00:01:22.040> feed<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.189> through<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.909> second

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
rope feed it through the second

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.690 
rope feed it through the second
attachment<00:01:24.750> point<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:26.720> take<00:01:27.720> up<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.140> slack

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.859 

just<00:01:31.700> get<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:31.850> little<00:01:32.030> tension<00:01:32.329> on<00:01:32.600> it<00:01:32.630> right

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
just get a little tension on it right

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.300 
just get a little tension on it right
now<00:01:33.049> okay<00:01:34.009> see<00:01:34.460> up<00:01:35.390> here<00:01:35.450> this<00:01:35.869> is<00:01:36.310> relatively

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
now okay see up here this is relatively

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.010 
now okay see up here this is relatively
loose<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:37.850> it's<00:01:37.969> kind<00:01:38.329> of<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.479> way<00:01:38.600> we<00:01:38.750> want

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
loose and it's kind of the way we want

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.809 
loose and it's kind of the way we want
that<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.380> be<00:01:39.409> what<00:01:40.159> I'm<00:01:40.250> going<00:01:40.369> to<00:01:40.399> do<00:01:40.549> is<00:01:40.700> I'm

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
that to be what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.039 
that to be what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:40.909> to<00:01:40.969> come<00:01:41.119> up<00:01:41.240> here<00:01:41.569> and<00:01:41.780> I'm<00:01:41.869> going<00:01:41.960> to

going to come up here and I'm going to

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.359 
going to come up here and I'm going to
create<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.439> loop<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:42.920> I'm<00:01:42.979> going<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.130> show<00:01:43.310> you

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
create a loop and I'm going to show you

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.590 
create a loop and I'm going to show you
how<00:01:43.579> I'm<00:01:43.700> going<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:43.909> use<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.270> here<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:44.539> a

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
how I'm going to use that here in a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.510 
how I'm going to use that here in a
second<00:01:44.929> but<00:01:44.960> I<00:01:45.049> want<00:01:45.289> this<00:01:45.740> loop<00:01:45.979> kind<00:01:46.219> of<00:01:46.369> up

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
second but I want this loop kind of up

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.969 
second but I want this loop kind of up
high<00:01:46.759> where<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.479> can<00:01:47.719> deal<00:01:48.530> with<00:01:48.560> it<00:01:48.740> more

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
high where I can deal with it more

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.100 
high where I can deal with it more
effectively<00:01:49.579> than<00:01:49.759> say<00:01:49.969> down<00:01:50.209> here<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:51.020> won't

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
effectively than say down here you won't

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.510 
effectively than say down here you won't
work<00:01:51.350> for<00:01:51.590> us<00:01:51.679> when<00:01:51.829> we<00:01:51.920> go<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.069> cinch<00:01:52.340> this

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
work for us when we go to cinch this

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.550 
work for us when we go to cinch this
down<00:01:52.579> and<00:01:52.969> you'll<00:01:53.060> see<00:01:53.119> why<00:01:53.929> that<00:01:54.140> is<00:01:54.350> in<00:01:54.530> just

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
down and you'll see why that is in just

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.559 
down and you'll see why that is in just
a<00:01:54.799> minute<00:01:54.920> so<00:01:55.250> again<00:01:56.149> a<00:01:56.270> little<00:01:56.420> bit<00:01:56.509> of

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
a minute so again a little bit of

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.690 
a minute so again a little bit of
tension<00:01:56.780> I'm<00:01:57.350> going<00:01:57.469> to<00:01:57.590> take<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.979> from<00:01:58.520> the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
tension I'm going to take the from the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.359 
tension I'm going to take the from the
tag<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.329> where's<00:01:59.689> it's<00:02:00.170> loose<00:02:00.560> I'm<00:02:01.159> going<00:02:01.310> to

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
tag and where's it's loose I'm going to

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:11.980 
tag and where's it's loose I'm going to
create<00:02:01.609> a<00:02:01.700> loop<00:02:01.939> okay<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.520> knot

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.210 

regular<00:02:12.990> overhand<00:02:13.320> knot<00:02:13.560> I'm<00:02:13.800> going<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.980> pull

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
regular overhand knot I'm going to pull

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.840 
regular overhand knot I'm going to pull
this<00:02:14.370> tight<00:02:17.090> okay<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.800> again<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.190> tag<00:02:20.400> end<00:02:20.700> is

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
this tight okay so again the tag end is

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.310 
this tight okay so again the tag end is
still<00:02:20.940> through<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.510> attachment<00:02:22.020> point<00:02:22.230> on

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
still through the attachment point on

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.510 
still through the attachment point on
the<00:02:22.440> truck<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.830> I'm<00:02:22.890> going<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.070> get<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.310> very

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
the truck and I'm going to get the very

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.740 
the truck and I'm going to get the very
end<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.940> tag<00:02:24.560> let<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.710> sit<00:02:25.980> for<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.190> minute

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.130 

feed<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> tag<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.290> through<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.620> loop<00:02:33.140> again

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
feed the tag in through the loop again

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.930 
feed the tag in through the loop again
take<00:02:34.410> up<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.680> slack<00:02:37.520> it's<00:02:38.520> got<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.670> little<00:02:38.790> bit

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
take up the slack it's got a little bit

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.250 
take up the slack it's got a little bit
of<00:02:39.030> tension<00:02:39.210> on<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.600> right<00:02:39.750> now<00:02:39.870> but<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.140> can

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
of tension on it right now but you can

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.480 
of tension on it right now but you can
see<00:02:40.530> things<00:02:40.710> are<00:02:40.830> going<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.010> start<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.340> come

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
see things are going to start to come

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.650 
see things are going to start to come
together<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.970> what<00:02:42.060> I'm<00:02:42.150> going<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.330> do<00:02:42.480> is

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
together and what I'm going to do is

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.330 
together and what I'm going to do is
pull<00:02:43.230> down<00:02:43.470> on<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.800> I'm<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.100> give<00:02:44.220> this

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
pull down on this I'm going to give this

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.460 
pull down on this I'm going to give this
two<00:02:44.550> good<00:02:44.820> sharp<00:02:45.120> jabs<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:46.050> get<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:46.320> to

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
two good sharp jabs to get this to

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:54.470 
two good sharp jabs to get this to
tighten<00:02:46.800> up<00:02:51.380> okay<00:02:52.760> it's<00:02:53.760> very<00:02:53.820> very<00:02:54.240> tight

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
right now and I'm just holding on with

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.270 
right now and I'm just holding on with
not<00:02:56.310> much<00:02:56.520> pressure<00:02:56.760> at<00:02:56.970> all<00:02:57.060> on<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.360> tag<00:02:57.600> end

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
not much pressure at all on the tag end

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.370 
not much pressure at all on the tag end
come<00:02:59.280> here<00:02:59.580> I'm<00:02:59.820> going<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.030> pinch<00:03:00.410> right<00:03:01.410> here

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
come here I'm going to pinch right here

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.360 
my right hand is free because I need to
get<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.300> loop<00:03:10.080> created<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.740> here<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.160> that<00:03:11.190> we

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
get the loop created in here so that we

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.770 
get the loop created in here so that we
can<00:03:11.490> tie<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.730> final<00:03:12.180> knot<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.510> will<00:03:12.630> hold

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
can tie the final knot that will hold

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:20.110 
can tie the final knot that will hold
the<00:03:12.930> load<00:03:13.110> down

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.559 

feed<00:03:20.780> it<00:03:20.900> through<00:03:20.930> just<00:03:21.890> like<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.480> now<00:03:23.480> I'm

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
feed it through just like that now I'm

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.890 
feed it through just like that now I'm
going<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.780> pull<00:03:24.110> this<00:03:24.290> loop<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:24.799> up<00:03:25.129> and<00:03:25.900> cinch

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
going to pull this loop and up and cinch

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.030 
going to pull this loop and up and cinch
the<00:03:27.110> knot<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:29.780> load<00:03:29.959> right<00:03:30.200> now<00:03:30.379> is<00:03:30.590> tied<00:03:30.860> down

the<00:03:45.200> whole<00:03:45.349> truck<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:45.769> shaking<00:03:46.159> because

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
the whole truck is shaking because

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.550 
the whole truck is shaking because
there's<00:03:46.610> so<00:03:46.760> much<00:03:46.909> tension<00:03:47.239> on<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:47.659> rope<00:03:48.079> okay

to let go right now just as soon as this

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.830 
to let go right now just as soon as this
feeds<00:04:06.440> through<00:04:06.730> boom<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:08.180> load<00:04:08.390> came<00:04:08.659> loose

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
feeds through boom the load came loose

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.210 
feeds through boom the load came loose
and<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:10.700> gather<00:04:10.940> up<00:04:11.030> your<00:04:11.269> rope<00:04:11.450> and<00:04:12.220> complete

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
and you gather up your rope and complete

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.449 
and you gather up your rope and complete
the<00:04:13.989> moving<00:04:14.989> of<00:04:15.079> your<00:04:15.230> load<00:04:15.440> pull<00:04:16.130> this<00:04:16.250> all

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
the moving of your load pull this all

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.340 
the moving of your load pull this all
out<00:04:16.669> you<00:04:16.940> want<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.150> point<00:04:17.329> out<00:04:17.510> one<00:04:17.720> thing<00:04:17.930> -<00:04:18.199> is

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
out you want to point out one thing - is

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.830 
out you want to point out one thing - is
that<00:04:18.590> for<00:04:19.340> every<00:04:19.400> different<00:04:19.850> sized<00:04:20.180> load<00:04:20.570> this

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
that for every different sized load this

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.510 
that for every different sized load this
knot<00:04:21.079> actually<00:04:21.560> goes<00:04:21.709> in<00:04:21.859> a<00:04:21.919> different<00:04:22.070> place

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
knot actually goes in a different place

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.760 
knot actually goes in a different place
because<00:04:22.550> we<00:04:23.090> custom<00:04:23.780> did<00:04:24.229> this<00:04:24.440> for<00:04:24.680> this

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
because we custom did this for this

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.560 
because we custom did this for this
particular<00:04:24.919> load<00:04:25.430> if<00:04:25.580> it<00:04:25.700> was<00:04:25.820> lower<00:04:26.090> if<00:04:26.450> it

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
particular load if it was lower if it

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.450 
particular load if it was lower if it
was<00:04:26.720> higher<00:04:26.960> this<00:04:27.500> would<00:04:27.650> probably<00:04:27.860> be<00:04:28.280> in<00:04:28.370> the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
was higher this would probably be in the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.310 
was higher this would probably be in the
wrong<00:04:28.610> place<00:04:29.000> and<00:04:29.300> there's<00:04:29.840> only<00:04:29.960> one<00:04:30.110> thing

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
wrong place and there's only one thing

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.320 
wrong place and there's only one thing
for<00:04:30.620> this<00:04:30.889> knot<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.400> do<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.729> that's<00:04:31.820> just<00:04:32.180> get

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
for this knot to do and that's just get

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.730 
for this knot to do and that's just get
tighter<00:04:32.599> and<00:04:32.750> it's<00:04:33.020> just<00:04:33.169> tighter<00:04:33.440> tighter

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
tighter and it's just tighter tighter

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.740 
tighter and it's just tighter tighter
it's<00:04:34.550> really<00:04:34.789> difficult<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.270> get<00:04:35.360> these<00:04:35.510> out

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
it's really difficult to get these out

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.020 
it's really difficult to get these out
later<00:04:35.990> on<00:04:36.110> so<00:04:36.500> as<00:04:36.620> soon<00:04:36.770> as<00:04:36.889> I<00:04:37.070> finish<00:04:37.880> doing

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
later on so as soon as I finish doing

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.700 
later on so as soon as I finish doing
the<00:04:38.210> job<00:04:38.419> that<00:04:38.450> I'm<00:04:38.660> doing<00:04:38.810> I<00:04:39.050> do<00:04:39.110> remove<00:04:39.530> this

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
the job that I'm doing I do remove this

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.240 
the job that I'm doing I do remove this
knot<00:04:39.919> and<00:04:40.360> call<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.510> Rope<00:04:41.690> up<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.190> for<00:04:43.190> the

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
knot and call the Rope up and for the

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.500 
knot and call the Rope up and for the
last<00:04:43.430> demonstration<00:04:43.700> I<00:04:44.090> want<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.330> show<00:04:44.450> you

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
last demonstration I want to show you

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.500 
last demonstration I want to show you
kind<00:04:45.200> of<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.410> easier<00:04:46.340> way<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.550> coil<00:04:47.120> a<00:04:47.210> piece<00:04:47.389> of

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
kind of a easier way to coil a piece of

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.820 
kind of a easier way to coil a piece of
rope<00:04:47.690> and<00:04:47.810> keep<00:04:48.020> it<00:04:48.139> all<00:04:48.200> managed<00:04:48.650> so<00:04:48.770> I'm

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
rope and keep it all managed so I'm

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.170 
rope and keep it all managed so I'm
going<00:04:48.979> to<00:04:49.039> go<00:04:49.130> back<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.610> smaller<00:04:49.910> piece

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
going to go back to the smaller piece

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.800 
going to go back to the smaller piece
that<00:04:50.389> I<00:04:50.419> used<00:04:51.110> in<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.380> beginning<00:04:51.770> I<00:04:52.690> take<00:04:53.690> the

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
that I used in the beginning I take the

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.200 
that I used in the beginning I take the
loop<00:04:53.960> end<00:04:54.229> and<00:04:54.470> just<00:04:54.650> let<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.979> tag<00:04:55.699> in<00:04:55.910> fall

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
loop end and just let the tag in fall

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.439 
loop end and just let the tag in fall
let<00:04:57.080> start<00:04:57.289> to<00:04:57.380> create<00:04:57.710> a<00:04:57.770> series<00:04:58.070> of<00:04:58.099> coils

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
let start to create a series of coils

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:04.419 
let start to create a series of coils
that<00:04:59.449> are<00:04:59.599> about<00:04:59.780> eight<00:05:00.050> or<00:05:00.440> ten<00:05:00.680> inches<00:05:00.710> long

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:04.429 

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:07.339 

just<00:05:05.429> keep<00:05:05.580> bringing<00:05:05.819> those<00:05:06.119> up<00:05:06.179> and<00:05:06.719> right

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
just keep bringing those up and right

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.959 
just keep bringing those up and right
now<00:05:07.559> I've<00:05:07.919> got<00:05:08.249> about<00:05:08.399> two<00:05:09.299> feet<00:05:09.599> left<00:05:10.019> of<00:05:10.969> rope

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:11.969 
now I've got about two feet left of rope

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:13.879 
now I've got about two feet left of rope
that<00:05:11.999> has<00:05:12.329> not<00:05:12.509> been<00:05:12.659> coiled<00:05:12.929> up<00:05:13.199> because<00:05:13.769> what

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
that has not been coiled up because what

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.829 
that has not been coiled up because what
I'm<00:05:13.949> going<00:05:14.069> to<00:05:14.099> do<00:05:14.249> is<00:05:14.429> take<00:05:14.669> this<00:05:14.909> additional

00:05:15.829 --> 00:05:15.839 
I'm going to do is take this additional

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:17.989 
I'm going to do is take this additional
rope<00:05:16.079> and<00:05:16.319> wrap<00:05:16.889> it<00:05:17.069> around<00:05:17.129> and<00:05:17.579> coil<00:05:17.789> it

00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:17.999 
rope and wrap it around and coil it

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:20.419 
rope and wrap it around and coil it
around<00:05:18.179> the<00:05:19.049> coils<00:05:19.529> that<00:05:19.619> I<00:05:19.709> have<00:05:19.889> in<00:05:20.009> my<00:05:20.159> hand

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:20.429 
around the coils that I have in my hand

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:22.249 
around the coils that I have in my hand
but<00:05:20.549> before<00:05:20.849> I<00:05:20.909> do<00:05:20.969> that<00:05:21.119> what<00:05:21.809> I<00:05:21.869> want<00:05:22.110> to<00:05:22.169> do

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
but before I do that what I want to do

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:28.459 
but before I do that what I want to do
is<00:05:22.379> create<00:05:22.709> one<00:05:23.539> small<00:05:24.539> coil<00:05:25.039> like<00:05:26.039> this<00:05:27.469> it's

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
is create one small coil like this it's

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.499 
is create one small coil like this it's
about<00:05:28.769> half<00:05:29.219> the<00:05:29.249> size<00:05:29.489> relative<00:05:30.299> to<00:05:30.329> the

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
about half the size relative to the

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.809 
about half the size relative to the
other<00:05:30.719> coils<00:05:31.349> I'm<00:05:32.099> going<00:05:32.219> to<00:05:32.309> take<00:05:32.429> and<00:05:32.610> twist

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:32.819 
other coils I'm going to take and twist

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:36.469 
other coils I'm going to take and twist
that<00:05:32.939> around<00:05:33.149> in<00:05:33.299> my<00:05:33.389> hand<00:05:34.849> and<00:05:35.849> start<00:05:36.119> to<00:05:36.239> wrap

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
that around in my hand and start to wrap

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.540 
that around in my hand and start to wrap
and<00:05:37.349> what<00:05:37.499> I'm<00:05:37.589> going<00:05:37.709> to<00:05:37.739> do<00:05:37.919> is<00:05:38.099> leave<00:05:38.309> these

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
and what I'm going to do is leave these

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.119 
and what I'm going to do is leave these
this<00:05:39.509> short<00:05:39.839> piece<00:05:40.079> exposed<00:05:40.589> I<00:05:40.739> don't<00:05:40.919> want<00:05:41.069> to
