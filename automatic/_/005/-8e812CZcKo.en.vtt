00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.640 
so you get a good slide down a nice
strong<00:01:59.460> knot<00:02:00.200> they're<00:02:01.200> not<00:02:01.410> gonna<00:02:01.530> be

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
strong knot they're not gonna be

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:10.949 
strong knot they're not gonna be
fighting<00:02:02.070> too<00:02:02.250> hard<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:02.610> these<00:02:02.730> fish

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.240 

now<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.019> main<00:02:12.260> thing<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.680> see<00:02:12.829> people<00:02:13.099> doing

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
now the main thing I see people doing

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.649 
now the main thing I see people doing
wrong<00:02:13.489> out<00:02:13.670> there<00:02:13.879> is<00:02:13.970> they<00:02:14.120> use<00:02:14.269> the<00:02:14.450> wrong

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
wrong out there is they use the wrong

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.589 
wrong out there is they use the wrong
size<00:02:15.310> leader<00:02:16.310> these<00:02:16.730> fish<00:02:17.000> got<00:02:17.209> really<00:02:17.450> good

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
size leader these fish got really good

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.289 
size leader these fish got really good
eyes<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.049> they're<00:02:18.140> gonna<00:02:18.260> see<00:02:18.500> your<00:02:18.709> leader

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
eyes and they're gonna see your leader

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.569 
eyes and they're gonna see your leader
so<00:02:20.299> what<00:02:20.750> I<00:02:20.780> recommend<00:02:20.989> I<00:02:21.590> usually<00:02:22.159> use<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.310> four

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
so what I recommend I usually use a four

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.410 
so what I recommend I usually use a four
pound<00:02:22.819> test

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
pound test

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.880 
pound test
leader<00:02:23.659> which<00:02:23.959> is<00:02:24.079> kind<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.260> weird<00:02:24.409> usually

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
leader which is kind of weird usually

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.530 
leader which is kind of weird usually
you<00:02:24.980> use<00:02:25.099> a<00:02:25.129> stronger<00:02:25.549> leader<00:02:25.760> but<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:26.329> time

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
you use a stronger leader but this time

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.869 
you use a stronger leader but this time
you're<00:02:26.780> going<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:26.930> use<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:27.409> smaller<00:02:28.280> leader<00:02:28.549> I

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
you're going to use a smaller leader I

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.390 
you're going to use a smaller leader I
use<00:02:29.870> four<00:02:30.079> pound<00:02:30.290> test<00:02:30.560> just<00:02:30.859> in<00:02:30.980> case<00:02:31.129> there's

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
use four pound test just in case there's

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.740 
use four pound test just in case there's
snags<00:02:31.640> there<00:02:31.909> anything<00:02:32.150> like<00:02:32.329> that<00:02:32.359> but<00:02:32.659> you

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
snags there anything like that but you

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.960 
snags there anything like that but you
can<00:02:32.930> do<00:02:33.079> a<00:02:33.109> two<00:02:33.349> pound<00:02:33.590> but<00:02:34.489> what<00:02:34.730> you're<00:02:34.879> gonna

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
can do a two pound but what you're gonna

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.899 
can do a two pound but what you're gonna
do<00:02:35.150> is<00:02:35.269> you're<00:02:35.359> gonna<00:02:35.420> tie<00:02:35.720> on<00:02:35.900> your<00:02:36.909> leader

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
do is you're gonna tie on your leader

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:45.369 
do is you're gonna tie on your leader
line<00:02:38.180> here<00:02:41.319> same<00:02:42.319> way<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.720> you're<00:02:44.989> just<00:02:45.200> going

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
line here same way and you're just going

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.680 
line here same way and you're just going
to<00:02:45.409> basically<00:02:45.590> create<00:02:46.069> a<00:02:46.519> two<00:02:47.120> pound<00:02:47.329> test

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
to basically create a two pound test

00:02:47.690 --> 00:03:00.949 
to basically create a two pound test
leader

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.699 

now<00:03:01.470> next<00:03:02.280> you're<00:03:03.000> gonna<00:03:03.290> try<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.349> find<00:03:04.590> your

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
now next you're gonna try to find your

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.569 
now next you're gonna try to find your
hoods<00:03:04.980> now<00:03:05.450> occasionally<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.840> can<00:03:07.019> find

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
hoods now occasionally you can find

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.679 
hoods now occasionally you can find
should<00:03:08.579> all<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.849> know<00:03:08.939> what<00:03:09.120> size<00:03:09.329> they<00:03:09.540> are<00:03:09.569> I

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
should all you know what size they are I

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.929 
should all you know what size they are I
think<00:03:09.840> they're<00:03:10.079> number<00:03:10.319> 12<00:03:10.640> but<00:03:11.640> basically

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
think they're number 12 but basically

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.259 
think they're number 12 but basically
it's<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.299> smallest<00:03:12.659> hook<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.079> could<00:03:13.260> find

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
it's the smallest hook you could find

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.179 
it's the smallest hook you could find
the<00:03:15.269> best<00:03:15.480> thing<00:03:15.689> I<00:03:15.810> can<00:03:15.870> do<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.739> best<00:03:16.920> thing<00:03:17.069> I
