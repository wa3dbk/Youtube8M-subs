00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 few of us write without errors or 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.270
 blots and who helps our notebooks 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.880
 we keep documents clean 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.010
 Of course their eraser is often especially in 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.809
 England is called rubber bands although only 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.740
 part of the erasers actually contains 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.809
 rubber 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.740
 This is due to the fact that the first erasers 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.539
 really made so much rubber 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.480
 mention substance erase infringements 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.840
 left in black lead pencil 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.359
 date back to 1770 and sound 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.489
 as follows very convenient way 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.770
 delete written black lead 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.410
 pencil using elastic or 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.989
 indian rubber modern erasers 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.610
 have different shapes made of 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.829
 many different materials 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.200
 different quality and all kinds 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.480
 combinations but the main type of plastic 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.110
 after all 2 to erase the pen or 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.020
 a pencil 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.840
 plastics intended to be removed 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.129
 lines left black lead or 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.730
 colored pencils 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.410
 must be soft and tiny all 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.710
 to make small pieces of an eraser 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.140
 separated during erasure thanks 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.090
 these properties eraser his erasing 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.549
 the surface is constantly changing and 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.229
 updated as a small plan 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.020
 the eraser fragments has sticky 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.680
 structure they are easily glued to 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.500
 line forming particles of graphite and 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.390
 removed from the working surface of the main 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.000
 but not the only factor determining 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.240
 depth of ink penetration 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.470
 paper fibers is their density 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.079
 respectively erasers made for 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.670
 ink removal paper should 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.180
 mechanically remove dyed fibers 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.909
 paper 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.340
 so the rubber erasers are designed 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.950
 to remove ink they must contain 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.200
 a large number of abrasive additives and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.540
 be hard erase these erasers 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.310
 be careful otherwise you can strongly 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.829
 damage the work surface when 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.030
 rubbing on low quality paper they 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:02:00.120
 can and erase it to the holes of rubber 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.760
 erasers eventually become harder 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.590
 the curing process is accelerated if 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.050
 the product is outdoors 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.270
 or in the sun 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.060
 therefore it is recommended to store rubber 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.430
 packed erasers 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.590
 if the storage condition is respected then 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.110
 erasers retain their qualities in 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.720
 over the years but there has not been 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.330
 without chemistry some erasers contain 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.460
 microcapsules with a special substance they 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.220
 designed to erase ink and 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.840
 marker lines their structure is such that 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.420
 very small solvent containing 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.550
 and pockets inside the eraser burst in 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.230
 erasure process speaking 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.080
 the solvent acts on the line 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.970
 weakening the coloring matter and in the complex 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.250
 erasing my vinyl properties 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.260
 material provides fast clean 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.750
 abrasion of workplace damage 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.370
 surface 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.560
 so any correctly selected 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.200
 the eraser in skilled hands becomes a weapon 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.300
 neatness and cleanliness so let's 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.650
 let's not unfairly forget about this 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.460
 wonderful clerical 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.460
