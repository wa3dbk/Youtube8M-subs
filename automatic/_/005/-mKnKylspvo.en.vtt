00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.660
 Second Epistle of the Apostle Saint Paul to the Thessalonians 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.660
 Chapter 1 2Th 1: 1 Paul, Silvanus and Timothy, to the church 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.689
 of the Thessalonians in God our Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.699
 2Th 1: 2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.619
 2Th 1: 3 We must always give thanks to God for you, brothers, as is worthy, for 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.780
 as your faith grows, and the love of each and every one of you abounds for 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.320
 with the rest; 2Th 1: 4 So much that we ourselves glory 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.949
 of you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.659
 and tribulations that you endure. 2Th 1: 5 This is demonstration of the just judgment 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.920
 of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer. 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.600
 2Th 1: 6 For it is right before God to pay with tribulation those who afflict you, 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 2Th 1: 7 And to you who are troubled, give you rest with us, when it manifests 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.010
 the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power, 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.579
 2Th 1: 8 in flame of fire, to give retribution to those who did not know God, nor obey 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.560
 to the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; 2Th 1: 9 who will suffer the penalty of eternal 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.479
 perdition, excluded from the presence of the Lord and the glory of his power, 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.820
 2Thes 1:10 when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints and be admired in 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.259
 all who believed (because our testimony has been believed among you). 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.289
 2Thes 1:11 Wherefore we also pray always for you, that our God may have you 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.759
 worthy of his calling, and fulfill every purpose of goodness and every work of faith with 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.460
 his power, 2Th 1:12 so that the name of our Lord 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.319
 Jesus Christ be glorified in you, and you in him, by the grace of our 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.649
 God and the Lord Jesus Christ. Episode 2 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.770
 2Th 2: 1 But with respect to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our meeting with 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.869
 he, we pray you, brothers, 2Ts 2: 2 that you do not let yourselves move easily 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.760
 in your way of thinking, do not be disturbed, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.450
 as if it were ours, in the sense that the day of the Lord is near. 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.530
 2Th 2: 3 No one deceives you in any way; because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first, 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.180
 and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.390
 2Th 2: 4 which opposes and rises up against all that is called God or is the object of worship; 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.150
 so much that he sits in the temple of God as God, pretending to be God. 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.060
 2Th 2: 5 Do you not remember that when I was still with you, I told you this? 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.150
 2Th 2: 6 And now you know what is stopping it, so that in due time it will be 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.350
 manifest 2Th 2: 7 Because the mystery is already in action 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.760
 of iniquity; only that there is someone present who stops him, until he himself is removed 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.600
 in the middle. 2Thes 2: 8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.580
 whom the Lord will kill with the spirit of his mouth, and destroy with the brightness 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.870
 of his coming; 2Tw 2: 9 wicked whose advent is by work 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.370
 of Satan, with great power and lying signs and wonders, 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.910
 2Thes 2:10 and with all deceit of iniquity for those who are lost, because they did not receive 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.010
 the love of truth to be saved. 2Th 2:11 For this reason God sends them a power 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.190
 deceitful, so that they believe the lie, 2Th 2:12 so that all may be condemned 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.590
 those who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in injustice. 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.400
 2Th 2:13 But we must always give thanks to God for you brothers 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.820
 beloved by the Lord, that God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation, 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.480
 through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth, 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.400
 2Thes 2:14 to which he called you through our gospel, to reach the glory of our 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.870
 Lord Jesus Christ. 2Th 2:15 So, brothers, be firm, 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.970
 and hold back the doctrine that you have learned, whether by word or by our letter. 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.510
 2Th 2:16 And the same Jesus Christ our Lord, and God our Father, who loved us and us 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.310
 gave eternal consolation and good hope by grace, 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.310
 2Thes 2:17 comfort your hearts, and strengthen you in every good word and work. 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.900
 Chapter 3 2Th 3: 1 For the rest, brothers, pray for 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.199
 us, so that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, just as it was between 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.719
 you, 2Th 3: 2 and so that we are delivered from men 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:31.180
 perverse and evil; because it is not of all the faith. 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.990
 2Th 3: 3 But the Lord is faithful, who will establish and keep you from evil. 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.080
 2Th 3: 4 And we have confidence in you in the Lord, in what you do and will do what 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.990
 that we have sent you 2Th 3: 5 And the Lord guide your hearts 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.419
 to the love of God, and to the patience of Christ. 2Th 3: 6 But we command you, brothers, in the 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.860
 Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you separate yourselves from every brother who walks disorderly, 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.189
 and not according to the teaching you received from us. 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:03.259
 2Th 3: 7 For you yourselves know how you should imitate us; because we 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:08.430
 we did not walk in disorder among you, 2Th 3: 8 nor did we eat anyone's bread for nothing, 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.819
 but we work with eagerness and fatigue day and night, so as not to be burdensome to any of 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.729
 you; 2Thes 3: 9 not because we did not have right, 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.849
 but for giving ourselves an example to imitate us. 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.229
 2Thes 3:10 For also when we were with you, we commanded you this: If any 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.389
 he does not want to work, nor does he eat. 2Th 3:11 For we hear that some among 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.729
 you are disorderly, not working at anything, but meddling in what is foreign. 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:41.240
 2Thes 3:12 We command and exhort ourselves by our Lord Jesus Christ, that working 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.319
 calmly, eat your own bread. 2Thes 3:13 And ye, brethren, be not weary 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.259
 to do well. 2Th 3:14 If anyone does not obey what we say 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:55.870
 by means of this letter, to that one point out, and do not join with him, so that he is ashamed. 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.189
 2Th 3:15 But do not count it as an enemy, but warn him as a brother. 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:07.189
 2Thes 3:16 And may the Lord of peace himself always give you peace in every way. The Lord be with all 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:10.050
 you. 2Thes 3:17 The salutation is from my own hand, 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.710
 of Paul, which is the sign in every letter of mine; so I write. 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.830
 2Thes 3:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
