a<00:00:50.280> game<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:51.450> you<00:00:51.720> need<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.170> start<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.650> see<00:00:52.890> how

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
a game but you need to start to see how

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.790 
a game but you need to start to see how
it<00:00:53.310> operates<00:00:53.790> and<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.960> feels<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
it operates and what it feels like and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.470 
it operates and what it feels like and
that<00:00:56.070> means<00:00:56.220> that<00:00:56.489> these<00:00:56.640> Clarion<00:00:57.180> middle

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that means that these Clarion middle

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.910 
that means that these Clarion middle
school<00:00:57.750> students<00:00:58.170> are<00:00:58.260> getting<00:00:58.380> hands-on

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
school students are getting hands-on

experience with these technologies as

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.929 
experience with these technologies as
well<00:01:03.049> we<00:01:04.049> want<00:01:04.259> to<00:01:04.320> provide<00:01:04.710> young<00:01:05.309> students

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
well we want to provide young students

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.520 
well we want to provide young students
when<00:01:06.240> they're<00:01:06.360> very<00:01:06.750> impressionable<00:01:07.170> the

when they're very impressionable the
opportunity<00:01:08.399> to<00:01:09.149> see<00:01:09.420> tools<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.289> are

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
opportunity to see tools that are

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.370 
opportunity to see tools that are
continuing<00:01:11.399> to<00:01:11.549> develop<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.380> integrate

continuing to develop and integrate

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.200 
continuing to develop and integrate
those<00:01:13.560> into<00:01:13.619> their<00:01:14.100> ways<00:01:14.399> of<00:01:14.670> thinking<00:01:14.939> about

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
those into their ways of thinking about

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.090 
those into their ways of thinking about
solving<00:01:15.630> problems<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:16.499> were<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.859> input

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
solving problems we were in like input

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.949 
solving problems we were in like input
and<00:01:17.429> output<00:01:17.789> in<00:01:17.939> different<00:01:18.299> motors<00:01:18.659> and

00:01:18.949 --> 00:01:18.959 
and output in different motors and

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:20.840 
and output in different motors and
lights<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.439> stuff<00:01:19.709> and<00:01:19.979> how<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.189> power<00:01:20.520> those

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
lights and stuff and how you power those

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.809 
lights and stuff and how you power those
and<00:01:21.209> it's<00:01:21.990> fun<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.469> the<00:01:22.799> students<00:01:23.280> are<00:01:23.429> often

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
and it's fun and the students are often

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:25.849 
and it's fun and the students are often
very<00:01:23.850> quick<00:01:24.450> learners<00:01:24.899> students<00:01:25.469> have<00:01:25.649> been

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
this type of learning they're there

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.230 
this type of learning they're there
already<00:01:31.350> fluid<00:01:31.950> with<00:01:32.100> these<00:01:32.219> technologies<00:01:32.969> I

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
already fluid with these technologies I

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.760 
already fluid with these technologies I
get<00:01:33.689> really<00:01:33.779> excited<00:01:33.929> when<00:01:34.229> they<00:01:34.380> pick<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.649> up

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
get really excited when they pick it up

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.199 
get really excited when they pick it up
really<00:01:35.130> quickly<00:01:35.399> there<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.880> are<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.060> few
