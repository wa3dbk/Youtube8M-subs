00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
next thing that I see in here is it

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.770 
next thing that I see in here is it
looks<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.470> we<00:01:49.710> got<00:01:50.009> some<00:01:50.040> tea<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.750> is

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
looks like we got some tea so this is

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.440 
looks like we got some tea so this is
from<00:01:52.170> red<00:01:52.500> rose<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.310> says<00:01:53.549> premium<00:01:54.119> water

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
from red rose it says premium water

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.130 
from red rose it says premium water
enhancer<00:01:55.380> real<00:01:56.159> tea<00:01:56.490> brewed<00:01:56.939> goodness<00:01:57.810> or

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
color is way too light for me so of

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.050 
color is way too light for me so of
course<00:03:19.280> with<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.370> trial<00:03:20.609> and<00:03:20.700> error<00:03:20.880> of

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
course with the trial and error of

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.819 
course with the trial and error of
foundation<00:03:21.540> i<00:03:21.690> will<00:03:21.840> have<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.200> make<00:03:22.470> up<00:03:22.530> and

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
foundation i will have to make up and

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.319 
foundation i will have to make up and
use<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.069> for<00:03:23.280> something<00:03:23.579> else<00:03:23.700> most<00:03:24.030> likely

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
use this for something else most likely

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.289 
use this for something else most likely
as<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> highlight<00:03:25.049> or<00:03:25.290> maybe<00:03:26.280> even<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.790> concealer

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
as a highlight or maybe even a concealer

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.110 
as a highlight or maybe even a concealer
like<00:03:27.720> yeah<00:03:28.169> so<00:03:28.560> that's<00:03:28.799> obviously<00:03:29.090> way<00:03:30.090> too

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
like yeah so that's obviously way too
