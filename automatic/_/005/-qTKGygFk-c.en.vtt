to<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.879> go<00:00:48.239> ahead<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.480> give<00:00:48.570> them<00:00:48.660> her

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
to just go ahead and give them her

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.119 
to just go ahead and give them her
because<00:00:49.110> she<00:00:49.260> seems<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.590> she's<00:00:49.739> gonna<00:00:49.860> kill

them<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.520> think<00:00:50.700> that's<00:00:50.940> what<00:00:51.059> we're<00:00:51.149> gonna
