00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
to see it but make it I um

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.950 
to see it but make it I um
there<00:00:38.309> was<00:00:38.460> certainly<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.239> two<00:00:39.570> things<00:00:39.719> there

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
there was certainly to two things there

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.889 
there was certainly to two things there
what<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.559> means<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:41.180> clipping<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
what this means is clipping it to the to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.950 
what this means is clipping it to the to
the<00:00:42.989> watch<00:00:43.140> obviously<00:00:44.129> tap<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.520> goes<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.000> but

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the watch obviously tap it goes in but

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.840 
the watch obviously tap it goes in but
there's<00:00:46.140> no<00:00:46.320> way<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:47.239> actually<00:00:48.239> click<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.170> on

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
there's no way to actually click this on

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.080 
there's no way to actually click this on
so<00:00:50.989> yeah<00:00:51.989> that's<00:00:52.620> kind<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.190> useless<00:00:53.370> for

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
so yeah that's kind of useless for

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.389 
so yeah that's kind of useless for
charging<00:00:54.420> now<00:00:54.539> overnight<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.110> at<00:00:55.140> all<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.250> fact

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
obviously that's still quite a bit of

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
obviously that's still quite a bit of
pressure<00:02:17.220> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> watch<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.640> really<00:02:17.820> don't<00:02:18.030> be

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
pressure on the watch I really don't be

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.480 
pressure on the watch I really don't be
doing<00:02:18.270> this<00:02:18.330> for<00:02:18.480> too<00:02:18.570> long<00:02:18.950> that's<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.100> only

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
doing this for too long that's the only

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.650 
doing this for too long that's the only
way<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.640> found<00:02:20.700> getting<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> reliable<00:02:21.420> charge

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
way I found getting a reliable charge

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.660 
way I found getting a reliable charge
overnight<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.160> like<00:02:23.250> more<00:02:23.370> watching<00:02:23.580> when
