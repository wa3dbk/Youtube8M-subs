and then i did a whole bunch more of
little<00:03:04.510> ones<00:03:04.630> on<00:03:04.870> this<00:03:05.050> side<00:03:05.260> just<00:03:05.470> so<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.799> can

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
little ones on this side just so you can

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.400 
little ones on this side just so you can
kind<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.310> get<00:03:06.519> an<00:03:06.549> idea<00:03:06.760> as<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:08.079> can<00:03:08.200> see

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
kind of get an idea as you can see

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.190 
kind of get an idea as you can see
they're<00:03:08.560> all<00:03:08.680> kind<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.160> little<00:03:09.430> bit<00:03:09.549> darker

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200

they're all kind of a little bit darker
different<00:03:11.200> or<00:03:11.470> lighter<00:03:11.769> or<00:03:12.160> differently

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
different or lighter or differently

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.509 
different or lighter or differently
shaped<00:03:12.940> that's<00:03:13.600> okay<00:03:14.019> um<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.799> it's<00:03:15.040> also<00:03:15.190> ok

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
shaped that's okay um and it's also ok

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.250 
shaped that's okay um and it's also ok
if<00:03:15.579> you<00:03:15.730> don't<00:03:15.760> necessarily<00:03:16.000> like<00:03:16.630> those

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
if you don't necessarily like those

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.960 
if you don't necessarily like those
lines<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.980> first<00:03:18.190> time<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.549> draw<00:03:18.760> them

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
lines the first time you draw them

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.300 
lines the first time you draw them
because<00:03:19.690> after<00:03:20.019> you<00:03:20.200> add<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.620> golden<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.190> are

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
because after you add the golden you are

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.539 
because after you add the golden you are
going<00:03:21.549> to<00:03:21.640> probably<00:03:21.880> add<00:03:22.329> another<00:03:23.489> part<00:03:24.489> of

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
going to probably add another part of

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.819 
going to probably add another part of
the<00:03:24.610> line<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.540> make<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.959> a<00:03:26.200> little<00:03:26.530> bit<00:03:26.709> more

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829

dramatic because the gold eyeshadow or

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.990 
dramatic because the gold eyeshadow or
whatever<00:03:29.829> i<00:03:29.920> should<00:03:30.220> i<00:03:30.250> use<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.700> fill<00:03:30.880> it
