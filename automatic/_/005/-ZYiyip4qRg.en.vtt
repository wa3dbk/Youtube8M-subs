00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello friends and how are you and I hope 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.970
 that have started as you start 2015 and 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.700
 this week began to be rumored by the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.920
 frog composer and robin dance that 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.800
 will come out a new kazooie banjo game 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.330
 for the xbox a lot no longer expects anything from 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.420
 the radio company since microsoft 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.480
 he bought it from nintendo but I do not come to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.750
 tell them about casual bathing but about weird 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.660
 it did not come in my opinion it's just a 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.820
 opinion seems a bit fair to me that says 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.950
 walking aguare became a crap 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.489
 since he bought it microsoft or that 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.320
 put as villain or worse company to 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.320
 microsoft if I said it 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.770
 i 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.720
 I do not think microsoft is a villain 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.020
 for wanting to buy ares in any case 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.330
 I blame Nintendo and the founders for 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.520
 sell their shares although to the 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.229
 founders forgave them because they entered 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.600
 a financial crisis and they had to 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.280
 resort to that apart they are also 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.229
 having certain problems with the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.960
 nintendo but putting aside what 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.080
 I just said that it is also important 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.990
 I imagine that many will think that 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.990
 microsoft outside house nintendo a 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.990
 threaten him 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.580
 by 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.580
 Let's see 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.250
 no boy things did not happen like that 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.030
 things happened at a party etc by 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.030
 supposed 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.430
 it does not shine speaking seriously I'm going 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.840
 mention three games of the rave that you 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.840
 they gave for the xbox 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.040
 normal that were ignored by the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.040
 public 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.110
 the first game I'm going to mention 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.800
 it came out for the xbox and it's called serious by 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.800
 the wish 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.460
 or not 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.810
 and I liked from the beginning his music is 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.720
 so sticky his characters are so 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.879
 negative and also cheerful not because 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.769
 they are monsters but I liked that the weird 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.079
 keep its essence since they were 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.360
 on the nintendo with its characters that do not 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.140
 they talked and what they did were grimaces or 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.450
 provocation sounds 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.080
 What I liked the most is that the game is 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:54.130
 in Spanish with subtitles in Spanish as well 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.709
 that I was able to enjoy it enough also what 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.880
 what I liked is that the game had its 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.980
 difficulty was not easy and it cost me a lot 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.900
 in winning it right now I'm actually 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.240
 playing the unemployed again because I 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.510
 is stuck but I will see if what 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.670
 I start again to enjoy it 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.920
 I'm already going up and this channel what I 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.820
 disappointed a little is that very few 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:22.150
 people know this game should already 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.640
 be ashamed to be gamers the truth 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.740
 is that I think I recorded country of woods is 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.560
 one of the best games he has ever done 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.900
 the radio for lan and tam the second game 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.150
 what I would like to mention is with carla and 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.790
 the clock of this was my first game of 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.220
 with wanting youtube I laughed what 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.500
 enjoyment 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.830
 I do not cry because I never won it when 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.500
 of the young woman when she was 14 but in 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.810
 2003 I won it and I'm going to say 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.210
 better a void in the heart that I 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.700
 I felt sad for three days 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.460
 of course I did a comparison of cÃ³nchar 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.890
 of the two with kers last year if what 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.230
 want to see is here in this part you 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.050
 it is there where the comparison is made 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.750
 between the nintendo 64 version and the 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.150
 expo version so they can see their 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.280
 differences because if they have big 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.040
 differences and in the flow that I'm going to 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.400
 mention is here I see is a game that 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:21.280
 he liked the story very much the characters 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.920
 the fights is a game made for me 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.620
 because he sees it as very childish but 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.639
 I like I love the game it was 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:33.289
 known 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:37.370
 it did not have good success as it is although I have 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:39.540
 mentioned two sets of three that were 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.420
 known 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.910
 and I consider myself a lover of 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.500
 video games as well as a lover of 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.930
 good music I'm not going to look 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:54.480
 guilty to know what happened 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.480
 what happened 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.450
 what I want is to enjoy the 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.070
 videogames what I've been doing 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.530
 then be dark to a game of 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.170
 neighborhood so I'm not going to talk more about 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:11.440
 the company will wait to see if it comes out 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.750
 I'll buy it and enjoy it if it's good 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.840
 the game clear in my opinion with that 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.450
 attitude that some have this is how 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.270
 Matt is a video game company 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:24.520
