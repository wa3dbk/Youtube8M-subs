00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
 Don Carlos teaches to make a 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.419
 roundabout game or racket when 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.160
 we have a conditioning for 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:10.150
 turn left or change the 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.100
 sense as seen in the image 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.650
 we will have to use it obligatorily 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.930
 there is a signal or not as you see in the image 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.310
 we indicate to the right we left the 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.789
 via 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.070
 we skirt the gazebo and do the 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.060
 first the pedestrian crossing and then 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.160
 yield to step 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.600
 remember we must cross the whole road and 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.010
 as well the sign of obligation not 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.529
 allows you to change your address or 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.100
 sense from the center of the roadway 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.899
 we must use this racket 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.600
 that would be to make a change of 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.190
 direction to the left without the exam 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.649
 for example it tells us to make a 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.329
 change of direction we will also have to 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.159
 use the racket equally we 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.600
 we left the right indicating how careful 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.250
 with the motorcycle that comes from behind 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.680
 slow down a lot 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.500
 and the same thing we should do the care with 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.060
 the cereal step we will access the weight 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.460
 check how fast the vehicle is 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.809
 white very carefully we will put first 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.589
 we will look at the other and we will cross 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.380
 quickly without stopping and turning in 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.670
 we agreed that we have a yield step 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.979
 from the edge of the passage to the vehicle 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.390
 driving school that you see in the image 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.220
 we will indicate in this case on the left 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.020
 but then we will indicate to the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.880
 right turn to make the CCE to 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.619
 I pass the school vehicle given time 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.290
 but we have to do the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.840
 step that vehicle that goes down we will go out and 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.520
 that would also be a correct way and 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.930
 finally if our at least says the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.580
 examiner that we make a change of 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.440
 meaning then we can do it like 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.200
 way that we have seen or also by the 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.570
 center of the road itself we look 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.370
 the pedestrian that comes to the right 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.030
 we passed because we have not cut it on 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.790
 walking we have brought him step and now 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.590
 very careful we put first we reduce 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.570
 the march we look to one side and another and 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.830
 we rotate the whole steering wheel completely 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.510
 to do it for the center of life 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.490
 that way is also correct you can 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.619
 do it in the two agreed ways that 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.740
 lead vice and much more prepared to 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:03.530
 your am don car point is for the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.530
 road safety here and now
