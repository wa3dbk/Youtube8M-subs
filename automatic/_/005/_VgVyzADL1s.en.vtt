engineer here at Southwest Airlines and
we<00:00:04.529> are<00:00:04.650> doing<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:04.950> ozonated<00:00:05.490> water

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
we are doing the ozonated water

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.210 
we are doing the ozonated water
disinfection<00:00:06.270> process<00:00:06.750> which<00:00:07.680> we<00:00:07.830> do<00:00:07.919> on<00:00:08.069> all

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
disinfection process which we do on all

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.830 
disinfection process which we do on all
of<00:00:08.340> our<00:00:08.370> aircraft<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.970> keep<00:00:09.120> them<00:00:09.269> disinfected

ozonation<00:00:13.230> system<00:00:13.710> actually<00:00:14.420> this<00:00:15.420> unit<00:00:15.750> was

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
ozonation system actually this unit was

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.840 
ozonation system actually this unit was
designed<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.619> wine<00:00:16.800> industry<00:00:17.010> to

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
designed for the wine industry to

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.590 
designed for the wine industry to
disinfect<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.779> oak<00:00:19.529> barrels<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.820> processing

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
disinfect the oak barrels the processing

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.740 
disinfect the oak barrels the processing
the<00:00:22.230> wine<00:00:22.769> bottling<00:00:23.279> equipment<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:24.119> takes<00:00:24.180> air

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
the wine bottling equipment it takes air

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.349 
the wine bottling equipment it takes air
standard<00:00:25.439> ambient<00:00:25.920> air<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.609> compresses<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
standard ambient air it compresses the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.240 
standard ambient air it compresses the
air<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.810> then<00:00:28.320> runs<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.680> through<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.859> filter

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
air and then runs it through a filter

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.150 
air and then runs it through a filter
and<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:30.410> dissects<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.439> oxygen<00:00:31.980> from<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
and it dissects the oxygen from the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.680 
and it dissects the oxygen from the
nitrogen<00:00:32.369> when<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> highly

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
nitrogen when you have a highly

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.319 
nitrogen when you have a highly
concentrated<00:00:33.989> oxygen<00:00:34.500> air<00:00:35.100> mixture<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:36.149> then

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
concentrated oxygen air mixture we then

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.560 
concentrated oxygen air mixture we then
bombard<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.290> electrons<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.700> generate

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
bombard that with electrons to generate

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.569 
bombard that with electrons to generate
ozone<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.800> ozone<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.250> then<00:00:41.399> injected

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
ozone so this ozone is then injected

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.049 
ozone so this ozone is then injected
into<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.960> water<00:00:43.620> flow<00:00:43.920> which<00:00:44.399> then<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.850> can

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
into a water flow which then we can

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.389 
into a water flow which then we can
dissolve<00:00:45.870> into<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> water<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> bring<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
dissolve into the water and bring to the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.270 
dissolve into the water and bring to the
aircraft<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.360> kill<00:00:48.960> any<00:00:49.200> bacteria<00:00:49.410> virus

the<00:00:55.410> unit<00:00:55.649> itself<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.219> then<00:00:56.879> dissolved<00:00:57.300> into

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the unit itself and then dissolved into

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.880 
the unit itself and then dissolved into

this<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> saying<00:01:27.080> will<00:01:28.080> descale<00:01:29.030> any<00:01:30.030> kind

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
this like a saying will descale any kind

of calcium buildup that may occur during
the<00:01:34.560> last<00:01:34.770> or<00:01:35.189> since<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> last<00:01:35.640> time<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the last or since the last time that the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.880 
the last or since the last time that the
aircraft<00:01:36.600> came<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:36.930> maintenance<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.740> use

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
aircraft came in for maintenance the use

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.600 
aircraft came in for maintenance the use
of<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.189> mild<00:01:39.000> acid<00:01:39.420> glycine<00:01:39.750> also<00:01:40.320> kills

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
of this mild acid glycine also kills

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.889 
of this mild acid glycine also kills
microorganisms<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.820> may<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.360> present<00:01:42.810> in

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
microorganisms that may be present in

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.499 
microorganisms that may be present in
the<00:01:43.020> aerators<00:01:43.530> before<00:01:44.280> reinstallation<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the aerators before reinstallation and

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.210 
the aerators before reinstallation and
so<00:01:45.720> right<00:01:45.930> now<00:01:45.960> we're<00:01:46.380> gonna<00:01:46.470> actually<00:01:46.590> allow

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
so right now we're gonna actually allow

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.920 
so right now we're gonna actually allow
this<00:01:47.369> water<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.820> come<00:01:48.000> out<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.450> we're<00:01:48.810> gonna

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
this water to come out and we're gonna

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.080 
this water to come out and we're gonna
put<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> small<00:01:49.890> cup<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.310> test<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.880> so

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
put it to a small cup and test it and so

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.850 
put it to a small cup and test it and so
the<00:01:51.210> ozone<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.780> interacting<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the ozone is interacting with the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.190 
the ozone is interacting with the
activator<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> water<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:55.049> there's

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
activator and the water and if there's
