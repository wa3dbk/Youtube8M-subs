before<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.049> first<00:01:07.229> corner<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
before the the first corner it's a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.090 
before the the first corner it's a
really<00:01:09.030> strange<00:01:09.240> corner<00:01:09.659> because<00:01:09.840> at<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.070> I

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
really strange corner because at the I

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100 
really strange corner because at the I
packed<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> track<00:01:11.880> falls<00:01:12.180> away<00:01:12.390> there's<00:01:12.990> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
packed the track falls away there's a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.980 
packed the track falls away there's a
real<00:01:13.670> drop-off<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:14.970> see<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.720> at<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
real drop-off you can see just at the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.200 
real drop-off you can see just at the
inside<00:01:16.320> curve<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:17.310> really<00:01:17.610> steep<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
inside curve it's really steep just a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.820 
inside curve it's really steep just a
sharp<00:01:18.479> drop<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> racing<00:01:19.259> line<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.680> that

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
sharp drop on the racing line and that

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.830 
sharp drop on the racing line and that
can<00:01:20.040> cause<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.700> lot<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.939> crashes<00:01:21.299> we've<00:01:21.630> seen

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
can cause a lot of crashes we've seen

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.200 
can cause a lot of crashes we've seen
that<00:01:21.930> last<00:01:22.110> year<00:01:22.290> even<00:01:22.350> with<00:01:22.560> Carlos<00:01:22.860> Checa

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
that last year even with Carlos Checa

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.820 
that last year even with Carlos Checa
it's<00:01:24.720> important<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.230> the<00:01:25.350> line<00:01:25.500> correct

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
it's important to get the line correct

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.710 
it's important to get the line correct
because<00:01:25.980> that<00:01:26.100> affects<00:01:26.420> turning<00:01:27.420> through<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
because that affects turning through and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.480 
because that affects turning through and
also<00:01:27.870> turn<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> tree<00:01:28.350> always<00:01:28.920> there's<00:01:29.370> no

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
also turn the tree always there's no

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.070 
also turn the tree always there's no
grip<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.910> exit<00:01:30.120> of<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.300> corner<00:01:30.600> well

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
grip on the exit of this corner well

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.690 
grip on the exit of this corner well
simple<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:31.620> rear<00:01:31.950> traction<00:01:32.190> it's<00:01:32.490> always

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
simple to get rear traction it's always

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.310 
simple to get rear traction it's always
spitting<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.330> that's<00:01:33.840> normal

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
spitting so that's normal

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.440 
spitting so that's normal
everybody<00:01:34.860> got<00:01:34.980> ready<00:01:35.190> here<00:01:36.979> this<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
everybody got ready here this is the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.210 
everybody got ready here this is the
first<00:01:39.450> time<00:01:39.630> I'll<00:01:39.810> she<00:01:40.050> can<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.500> really<00:01:40.950> like

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
first time I'll she can I really like

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.100 
first time I'll she can I really like
this<00:01:41.400> because<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.660> have<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.840> open<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
this because you really have to open the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.560 
this because you really have to open the
gas<00:01:43.260> early<00:01:43.440> to<00:01:43.740> keep<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.070> momentum<00:01:44.970> keep<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
gas early to keep the momentum keep the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.800 
gas early to keep the momentum keep the
speed<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.790> this<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.910> really<00:01:48.119> still<00:01:48.390> steep

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
speed and this is really still steep

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.990 
speed and this is really still steep
downhill<00:01:49.260> all<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.410> way<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.850> bike

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
downhill all the way and the bike

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.490 
downhill all the way and the bike
compresses<00:01:51.540> quite<00:01:51.780> high<00:01:51.960> here<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.350> well

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
compresses quite high here as well

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.850 
compresses quite high here as well
because<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.940> camber<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.390> road<00:01:57.649> this<00:01:58.649> is

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
because the camber of the road this is

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.499 
because the camber of the road this is
probably<00:01:59.250> one<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.670> my<00:01:59.820> favorite<00:02:00.119> corners<00:02:00.420> in

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
probably one of my favorite corners in

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.450 
probably one of my favorite corners in
the<00:02:00.570> track<00:02:00.780> because<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.830> apex<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.399> you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the track because it's to apex that you

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.010 
the track because it's to apex that you
can<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.729> they're<00:02:02.880> hard<00:02:03.090> stop<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> bike<00:02:03.720> and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
can and they're hard stop the bike and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.230 
can and they're hard stop the bike and
gas<00:02:04.590> arrived<00:02:04.860> what<00:02:05.130> was<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> hairpin<00:02:05.790> even

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
gas arrived what was like a hairpin even

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.030 
gas arrived what was like a hairpin even
though<00:02:06.330> it's<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> very<00:02:06.690> long<00:02:06.810> corner<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.740> I

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
though it's a very long corner and I

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.100 
though it's a very long corner and I
will<00:02:08.250> start<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:09.209> deep<00:02:09.450> right<00:02:09.690> back<00:02:09.959> up

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
will start with this deep right back up

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.480 
will start with this deep right back up
the<00:02:10.200> hill<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.380> then<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.709> saw

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
the hill and then you saw

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.870 
the hill and then you saw
you<00:02:11.550> talk<00:02:11.730> back<00:02:11.910> here

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.800 

so<00:02:16.720> Eugene<00:02:17.050> here<00:02:17.350> it's<00:02:18.180> one<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.540> most

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
so Eugene here it's one of the most

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.360 
so Eugene here it's one of the most
interesting<00:02:20.410> part<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.890> track<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.310> you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
interesting part of the track and you

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.510 
interesting part of the track and you
tell<00:02:21.700> us<00:02:21.730> why<00:02:22.090> yeah<00:02:22.900> here's<00:02:23.290> very<00:02:24.040> physical

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
tell us why yeah here's very physical

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.100 
tell us why yeah here's very physical
you<00:02:24.730> can<00:02:24.850> see<00:02:25.030> at<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.270> bottom<00:02:25.600> of<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.930> hill

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
you can see at the bottom of the hill

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.620 
you can see at the bottom of the hill
looks<00:02:26.710> quite<00:02:26.890> far<00:02:27.100> away<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.550> as<00:02:28.270> we<00:02:28.390> head<00:02:28.510> up

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
looks quite far away and as we head up

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.830 
looks quite far away and as we head up
hill<00:02:28.840> that's<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:30.160> lot<00:02:30.580> higher<00:02:30.760> we<00:02:31.390> gain<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:31.600> lot

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
hill that's a lot higher we gain a lot

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.440 
hill that's a lot higher we gain a lot
of<00:02:31.960> elevation<00:02:32.470> this<00:02:33.190> left<00:02:33.850> corner<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.420> can

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
of elevation this left corner you can

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.390 
of elevation this left corner you can
see<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.810> inside<00:02:35.110> kerb<00:02:35.410> is<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:35.980> really<00:02:36.130> high

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
see the inside kerb is it's really high

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.030 
see the inside kerb is it's really high
and<00:02:36.610> we<00:02:37.360> lean<00:02:37.720> over<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.960> lot<00:02:38.170> here<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:38.410> from<00:02:38.860> us

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
and we lean over a lot here so from us

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.730 
and we lean over a lot here so from us
you<00:02:39.550> touch<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.880> elbow<00:02:40.030> on<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.480> curb<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.990> the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
you touch the elbow on the curb and the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.650 
you touch the elbow on the curb and the
change<00:02:42.340> direction<00:02:42.820> here<00:02:43.030> because<00:02:43.330> it's<00:02:43.480> so

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
change direction here because it's so

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.810 
change direction here because it's so
steep<00:02:44.320> it's<00:02:44.620> really<00:02:45.010> really<00:02:45.220> physical<00:02:45.670> all

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
steep it's really really physical all

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.700 
steep it's really really physical all
the<00:02:46.060> bike<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.960> weight<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.260> bike<00:02:47.410> wants<00:02:47.590> to

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
the bike the weight of the bike wants to

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.200 
the bike the weight of the bike wants to
go<00:02:47.830> backwards<00:02:48.280> but<00:02:48.460> you're<00:02:48.580> trying<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.940> change

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
go backwards but you're trying to change

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.090 
go backwards but you're trying to change
direction<00:02:49.630> on<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.320> gas<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.740> that<00:02:50.800> makes<00:02:51.040> it

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
direction on the gas and that makes it

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.490 
direction on the gas and that makes it
really<00:02:51.220> difficult<00:02:51.520> so<00:02:51.940> that's<00:02:52.660> why<00:02:52.840> it's<00:02:53.410> very

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
really difficult so that's why it's very

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.470 
really difficult so that's why it's very
important<00:02:54.070> to<00:02:54.220> change<00:02:54.610> direction<00:02:54.940> fast<00:02:55.270> and

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
important to change direction fast and

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.150 
important to change direction fast and
keep<00:02:55.900> your<00:02:56.020> momentum

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.400 

how<00:03:00.670> pretty<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.480> find<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.840> good<00:03:02.050> set<00:03:02.260> up

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
how pretty is it to find a good set up

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.500 
how pretty is it to find a good set up
in<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:02.710> truck<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.580> is<00:03:03.640> difficult<00:03:04.090> because<00:03:04.240> of

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
in this truck it is difficult because of

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.810 
in this truck it is difficult because of
the<00:03:04.660> downhill<00:03:05.230> uphill<00:03:05.440> nature<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:06.190> know<00:03:06.310> the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
the downhill uphill nature you know the

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.990 
the downhill uphill nature you know the
downhill<00:03:07.270> section<00:03:07.930> it's<00:03:08.260> hard<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.800> get<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.790> good

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
downhill section it's hard to get a good

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.340 
downhill section it's hard to get a good
feeling<00:03:10.210> with<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.840> banking<00:03:11.140> power

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
feeling with the banking power

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.530 
feeling with the banking power
in<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.710> uphill<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.640> really<00:03:12.880> forces<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.360> follow

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
in the uphill it really forces to follow

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.270 
in the uphill it really forces to follow
the<00:03:13.720> bike<00:03:13.870> repair<00:03:14.230> compresses<00:03:14.860> against<00:03:15.100> there

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
the bike repair compresses against there

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.760 
the bike repair compresses against there
also<00:03:15.430> do<00:03:16.270> different<00:03:16.390> track<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.320> normal

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
also do different track to normal

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.500 
also do different track to normal
it's<00:03:20.250> important<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:20.880> good<00:03:21.060> bike<00:03:21.330> in

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
it's important to have a good bike in

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.510 
it's important to have a good bike in
the<00:03:21.600> break-in<00:03:21.900> area<00:03:22.110> because<00:03:22.440> like<00:03:23.340> this

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
the break-in area because like this

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.680 
the break-in area because like this
again<00:03:23.790> it's<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.060> final<00:03:24.240> breaking

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
again it's a final breaking

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.120 
again it's a final breaking
heartbreaking<00:03:25.470> area<00:03:25.710> where<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.010> can

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
heartbreaking area where you can

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.500 
heartbreaking area where you can
overtake<00:03:26.490> and<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.210> be<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.390> difference

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
overtake and I can be the difference

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.890 
overtake and I can be the difference
between<00:03:27.840> first<00:03:28.170> place<00:03:28.320> website<00:03:29.390> so<00:03:30.390> bumpy<00:03:30.780> in

between first place website so bumpy in
some<00:03:31.080> places<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.500> entrance<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.190> chicken

some places the entrance to the chicken

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.000 
some places the entrance to the chicken
is<00:03:32.730> really<00:03:33.150> really<00:03:33.360> bad<00:03:33.540> face<00:03:33.750> on<00:03:33.960> like<00:03:34.830> the
