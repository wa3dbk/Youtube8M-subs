00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.830
 when but you that xi random microphone but 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.590
 you that computer at random but what do you use 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.750
 to record random aduc and curious well 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:19.170
 after this meaningless start I would say 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.369
 start with these two beautiful headphones 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.250
 guys I hope you see 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.119
 first of all I don't fit in with stabia 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.699
 I'm not there I'm not 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.070
 here they are anyway apart from the stupid ones 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.560
 guys, I want to thank you before 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.690
 all uk 40 36 of cp all the network of 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.070
 gigi and hi tech to have supplied 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.730
 these headphones we will go to now 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.730
 see in more detail 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.329
 Well first of all let me see how 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.129
 It presents this box boys 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.930
 here I hope you see well this is the part 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.030
 front is this is the part instead 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.050
 the back guys but I would say almost 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.140
 almost now to go and see 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.300
 really specifically the headphones in 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.020
 the question is the scorpion unicorn i th 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.910
 83 11 are really headphones born for 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.530
 gaming is therefore made their own 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.329
 especially for gaming go 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.159
 analyze it even better guys is that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.100
 we find the kind of boys connector is 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.350
 a very comfortable 3.5 mm stereo then 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.270
 everyone can put in any pc's 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.340
 again they emphasize that they are anyway 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.040
 so gaming headphones are perfect 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.720
 for gaming the microphone rotates at 180 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.640
 grades so we can adjust it as 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.560
 we want and close it open when 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.060
 we want to tell us that it really is 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.610
 soft where there are pavilions 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.780
 earphones the fabric is really soft 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.060
 I really tried it and really 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.009
 soft the only flaw in my opinion instead 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.869
 that does not completely envelop the ear 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.950
 therefore the external insulation is not 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.530
 just the best 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.630
 I'm not bad guys if you do 3 4 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.060
 hours of gaming don't tire you out because 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.560
 the length is light at the same time 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.630
 of the cable boys and almost two meters 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.430
 because it is one meter and 80 centimeters then 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.649
 very comfortable to have enough cable 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.079
 long so we can move around 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.659
 easily the frequency range 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.490
 boys starts from 20 hearts to 20,000 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.590
 hearts so it's not really the best 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.079
 rely on the price they have 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.700
 these headphones are really good for 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.040
 getting closer to the gaming world are 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.049
 perfect something super stray that I don't have 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.490
 said boys who are equipped with 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.070
 flight dependent regulators 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.350
 so we can independently 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.390
 without having to go who knows where to raise the 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.350
 volume lower volume 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.630
 regardless of the suits through 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.130
 this regulator then guys that 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.900
 say if you want to buy these headphones 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.700
 go to description you will find the links 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.340
 to go and buy some are really 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.450
 trust me, hope this short 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.190
 video you enjoyed 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.470

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.480
 I will use it from now on let me do it 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.070
