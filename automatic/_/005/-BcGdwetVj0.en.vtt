00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
spirulina into this one because I'm

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.709

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
going to pop them in depending on the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.270 
going to pop them in depending on the
size<00:03:45.620> of<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.950> leaves<00:03:47.200> maybe<00:03:48.200> one<00:03:48.500> more<00:03:48.890> these

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
size of the leaves maybe one more these

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.440 
size of the leaves maybe one more these
are<00:03:49.400> kind<00:03:49.580> of<00:03:49.610> small<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.150> think<00:03:50.210> this<00:03:50.390> is

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
are kind of small so I think this is

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.660 
are kind of small so I think this is
about<00:03:50.810> seven<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.620> then<00:03:52.160> we're<00:03:52.340> going<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.520> add

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
about seven and then we're going to add

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.790 
about seven and then we're going to add
in<00:03:52.820> some<00:03:52.850> celery<00:03:53.630> which<00:03:53.840> is<00:03:54.020> great<00:03:54.260> for<00:03:54.500> heart

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
in some celery which is great for heart

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.790 
in some celery which is great for heart
health<00:03:56.230> antioxidants<00:03:57.230> that<00:03:57.380> boosts<00:03:57.590> the

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
health antioxidants that boosts the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.930 
health antioxidants that boosts the
immune<00:03:57.860> system<00:03:58.690> celery<00:03:59.690> also<00:03:59.870> has<00:04:00.940> calcium

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
immune system celery also has calcium

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.480 
immune system celery also has calcium
and<00:04:02.270> magnesium<00:04:02.830> really<00:04:03.830> good<00:04:03.980> source<00:04:04.190> of<00:04:04.370> that

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
and magnesium really good source of that

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.590 
and magnesium really good source of that
so<00:04:04.820> I<00:04:04.850> prefer<00:04:05.180> celery<00:04:05.870> over<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.950> glass<00:04:07.310> of<00:04:07.340> milk

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
so I prefer celery over a glass of milk

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.340 
so I prefer celery over a glass of milk
honestly

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
honestly

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.920 
honestly
in<00:04:09.710> fact<00:04:09.890> my<00:04:10.100> body<00:04:10.340> prefers<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:11.060> salary<00:04:11.450> over

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
in fact my body prefers the salary over

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.470 
in fact my body prefers the salary over
a<00:04:12.290> glass<00:04:12.560> of<00:04:12.590> milk<00:04:12.890> so<00:04:13.100> I<00:04:13.160> put<00:04:13.370> in<00:04:13.490> two<00:04:13.850> celery

a glass of milk so I put in two celery
stalks<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:15.260> then<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.800> final<00:04:16.190> ingredient<00:04:16.310> is

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
stalks and then the final ingredient is

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.180 
stalks and then the final ingredient is
going<00:04:17.209> to<00:04:17.299> be<00:04:17.570> 1/2<00:04:17.780> a<00:04:18.140> cup<00:04:18.320> of<00:04:18.380> filtered<00:04:18.830> water
