00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.570
 in our tutorial today we are going to do 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:14.879
 one of the most Christmas decorations 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.550
 singles of the world it's about some 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.800
 balls that we can use to decorate 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.070
 our tree or any corner of the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.070
 home 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.500
 to make these ornaments we are going to 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.869
 need wool or ropes also some 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.690
 carpenter's tail balloons and a 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.390
 plastic or glass container for 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.629
 can put some water and the glue 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.629
 of carpenter 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.769
 first we click on our balloon and 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.870
 then cut wool gives the same 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.870
 dimensions because we can add 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.720
 once we have cut the grenade 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.900
 we submerge in water with a little bit of cola 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.500
 of carpenter and we are placing it 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.500
 around the globe 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.080
 we can go adding wool or rope up 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.619
 create the design that we like too 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.390
 we can go combining several colors one 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.390
 Once we have it, we let it dry 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.569
 to make sure that the wool is left 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.209
 completely hard and does not fall apart 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.910
 our Christmas ornament we are going to get wet 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.430
 the brush in the water with glue and let's 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.430
 go reviewing all our adornment 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.200
 do not 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.920
 it is best to let it dry for 24 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.770
 hours and once it's completely 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.319
 dry we puncture the balloon and we have 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.440
 our Christmas ornament if it has 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.120
