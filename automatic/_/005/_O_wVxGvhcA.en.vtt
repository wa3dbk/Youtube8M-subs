and<00:03:36.880> D<00:03:37.030> flat<00:03:37.060> in<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.510> base<00:03:37.690> okay<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.650> I'm

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
and D flat in the base okay and I'm

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.160 
and D flat in the base okay and I'm
using<00:03:39.010> enharmonic<00:03:39.520> equivalent<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.870> that

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
using enharmonic equivalent and that

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.880 
using enharmonic equivalent and that
means<00:03:41.440> I'm<00:03:41.860> using<00:03:42.990> like<00:03:43.990> if<00:03:44.170> we<00:03:44.440> were<00:03:44.590> in<00:03:44.620> G

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
means I'm using like if we were in G

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.040 
means I'm using like if we were in G
flat<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.430> would<00:03:45.580> really<00:03:45.760> call<00:03:46.030> this<00:03:46.270> you<00:03:46.900> know

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
flat you would really call this you know

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.290 
flat you would really call this you know
C<00:03:47.440> flat<00:03:47.739> instead<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.220> B<00:03:48.489> but<00:03:48.790> again<00:03:49.060> it's<00:03:49.209> the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
C flat instead of B but again it's the

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.640 
C flat instead of B but again it's the
beginners<00:03:49.690> version<00:03:50.110> so<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.319> just<00:03:50.470> want<00:03:50.620> to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
beginners version so you just want to

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.390 
beginners version so you just want to
get<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.920> notes<00:03:51.160> so<00:03:51.819> I'll<00:03:51.940> use<00:03:52.270> B<00:03:52.600> D<00:03:53.530> flat<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.160> G

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
get the notes so I'll use B D flat and G

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:24.150 
get the notes so I'll use B D flat and G
flat<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:55.060> D<00:03:55.510> flat<00:04:22.080> is<00:04:23.080> one<00:04:23.470> of<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.710> chord<00:04:24.010> you

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
flat and D flat is one of the chord you

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.610 
flat and D flat is one of the chord you
can<00:04:24.190> throw<00:04:24.580> in<00:04:24.850> there<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.240> still<00:04:25.450> keep<00:04:25.660> it<00:04:25.810> as

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
can throw in there and still keep it as

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:36.460 
can throw in there and still keep it as
a<00:04:26.770> very<00:04:27.070> simple<00:04:27.310> version<00:04:27.640> watch<00:04:28.090> this

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.930 

watch<00:04:37.470> this<00:04:37.740> right<00:04:38.010> here<00:04:39.950> something<00:04:40.950> has<00:04:41.520> see

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
watch this right here something has see

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.420 
watch this right here something has see
what<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:42.120> just<00:04:42.210> did<00:04:42.480> with<00:04:42.980> two<00:04:44.270> three<00:04:46.430> something

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
what I just did with two three something

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.330 
what I just did with two three something
that's<00:04:48.390> poor<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:49.320> can<00:04:49.500> throw<00:04:49.800> in<00:04:50.130> there

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
that's poor you can throw in there

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.540 
that's poor you can throw in there
that's<00:04:50.640> B<00:04:50.880> flat<00:04:51.210> D<00:04:51.570> flat<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:52.200> G<00:04:52.440> flat<00:04:52.520> B<00:04:53.520> flat

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
that's B flat D flat and G flat B flat

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.310 
that's B flat D flat and G flat B flat
in<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.180> base<00:04:54.360> now<00:04:54.660> that<00:04:54.840> Court<00:04:55.110> is<00:04:55.200> not

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
in the base now that Court is not

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.530 
in the base now that Court is not
necessary<00:04:55.980> to<00:04:56.100> play<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.310> song<00:04:56.670> but<00:04:57.390> it

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
necessary to play the song but it

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.170 
necessary to play the song but it
enhances<00:04:58.140> it<00:04:58.200> and<00:04:58.590> they<00:04:59.070> do<00:04:59.130> play<00:04:59.610> that<00:04:59.790> E<00:04:59.820> flat

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
enhances it and they do play that E flat

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.700 
enhances it and they do play that E flat
in<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.450> bass<00:05:00.630> on<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:00.870> record<00:05:01.110> so<00:05:01.440> that<00:05:01.590> would

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
in the bass on the record so that would

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.360 
in the bass on the record so that would
be<00:05:03.410> right<00:05:04.410> here<00:05:05.360> Sunday<00:05:06.360> that's<00:05:07.140> what<00:05:07.860> happens

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
be right here Sunday that's what happens

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:23.210 
be right here Sunday that's what happens
then<00:05:08.550> again<00:05:08.910> you<00:05:09.030> get<00:05:09.180> that<00:05:09.390> B<00:05:11.630> database<00:05:22.220> okay

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
then again you get that B database okay

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.100 
then again you get that B database okay
that's<00:05:23.580> that<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:24.510> know<00:05:24.600> that's<00:05:24.840> basically

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
that's that you know that's basically

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.190 
that's that you know that's basically
the<00:05:25.500> song<00:05:25.740> right<00:05:26.070> there<00:05:26.340> then<00:05:27.060> they<00:05:27.810> change

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
the song right there then they change

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:36.839 
the song right there then they change
key

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:48.920 

to<00:05:37.849> see<00:05:38.210> me<00:05:38.830> g-d<00:05:39.830> in<00:05:39.889> the<00:05:40.069> beso

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.400 

so<00:05:49.930> they're<00:05:50.140> the<00:05:50.440> B<00:05:50.620> D<00:05:51.190> and<00:05:51.610> G<00:05:51.990> G<00:05:52.990> in<00:05:53.110> the<00:05:53.200> base

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
so they're the B D and G G in the base

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.620 
so they're the B D and G G in the base
so<00:05:53.800> this<00:05:54.160> for<00:05:54.550> CJD<00:05:55.510> in<00:05:55.990> the<00:05:56.080> base<00:05:56.290> need<00:05:57.220> to<00:05:57.630> be

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
so this for CJD in the base need to be

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.740 
so this for CJD in the base need to be
the<00:05:59.140> m<00:05:59.500> GG<00:06:00.220> the<00:06:00.400> base<00:06:00.550> and<00:06:00.910> this<00:06:01.030> key<00:06:01.270> is<00:06:01.300> much

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
the m GG the base and this key is much

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.120 
the m GG the base and this key is much
easier<00:06:02.320> because<00:06:02.490> she<00:06:03.490> only<00:06:03.730> has<00:06:04.060> one

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
easier because she only has one

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.870 
easier because she only has one
accidental<00:06:07.800> so<00:06:08.800> the<00:06:08.980> second<00:06:09.400> key<00:06:09.550> is<00:06:09.580> much

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
accidental so the second key is much

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.510 
accidental so the second key is much
easier<00:06:12.330> Jesus<00:06:13.410> Jesus<00:06:14.440> there's<00:06:14.800> a<00:06:14.890> second<00:06:15.340> for

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
easier Jesus Jesus there's a second for

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:42.240 
easier Jesus Jesus there's a second for
a<00:06:15.820> D<00:06:16.690> and<00:06:34.770> it's<00:06:35.770> the<00:06:35.860> same<00:06:40.530> time<00:06:41.530> D<00:06:41.770> in<00:06:41.920> the<00:06:42.040> base

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
a D and it's the same time D in the base

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:57.810 
a D and it's the same time D in the base
so<00:06:42.850> we<00:06:54.930> see<00:06:55.930> in<00:06:56.080> the<00:06:56.200> base<00:06:56.410> okay<00:06:57.160> now<00:06:57.640> you<00:06:57.700> can

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
so we see in the base okay now you can

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.910 
so we see in the base okay now you can
use<00:06:58.090> that<00:06:58.300> see<00:06:58.630> there<00:06:58.960> or<00:06:59.290> you<00:06:59.380> can<00:06:59.530> use<00:06:59.740> the

00:06:59.910 --> 00:06:59.920 
use that see there or you can use the

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.950 
use that see there or you can use the
high<00:07:00.070> C<00:07:00.370> we<00:07:00.550> use<00:07:00.730> the<00:07:00.910> higher<00:07:01.120> street<00:07:01.540> with<00:07:01.780> it

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
high C we use the higher street with it

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.430 
high C we use the higher street with it
okay<00:07:02.680> and<00:07:03.070> that<00:07:03.940> is<00:07:04.120> C<00:07:04.480> 3<00:07:04.810> there<00:07:05.140> that<00:07:05.320> means

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 
okay and that is C 3 there that means

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.160 
okay and that is C 3 there that means
it's<00:07:05.650> the<00:07:05.770> third<00:07:06.040> C<00:07:06.490> from<00:07:07.240> the<00:07:07.510> bottom<00:07:07.960> of<00:07:08.080> the

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.170 
it's the third C from the bottom of the

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.300 
it's the third C from the bottom of the
keyboard<00:07:08.320> if<00:07:08.710> you<00:07:08.800> have<00:07:08.950> a<00:07:08.980> full-length

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860 
energy being a basal Sun DC but that's

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.300 
energy being a basal Sun DC but that's
something<00:07:24.400> beat<00:07:24.670> DG<00:07:25.360> me<00:07:26.200> again<00:07:27.010> that's<00:07:27.160> the

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
something beat DG me again that's the

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.590 
something beat DG me again that's the
court<00:07:27.550> we<00:07:27.640> kind<00:07:27.820> of<00:07:27.910> had<00:07:28.060> it<00:07:28.090> that's<00:07:28.480> not

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:28.600 
court we kind of had it that's not

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:56.550 
court we kind of had it that's not
necessary<00:07:29.290> but<00:07:29.320> it<00:07:29.470> enhances<00:07:30.280> it<00:07:55.230> back<00:07:56.230> to<00:07:56.470> the

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 
necessary but it enhances it back to the

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.610 
necessary but it enhances it back to the
first<00:07:56.740> floor<00:07:56.950> which<00:07:57.250> is<00:07:57.280> B<00:07:57.580> D<00:07:57.880> G<00:07:58.080> G<00:07:59.080> in<00:07:59.260> the<00:07:59.380> base

00:07:59.610 --> 00:07:59.620 
first floor which is B D G G in the base
