to take a look at the CBO active case
for<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.719> blackberry<00:00:16.080> z10<00:00:17.390> we<00:00:18.390> did<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
for the blackberry z10 we did the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.939 
for the blackberry z10 we did the
surface<00:00:20.130> case<00:00:20.369> review<00:00:20.960> I<00:00:21.960> guess<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> couple

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
surface case review I guess a couple

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.820 
surface case review I guess a couple
weeks<00:00:23.100> ago<00:00:23.570> and<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:25.050> got<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> active<00:00:25.619> in

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
weeks ago and we just got the active in

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.710 
weeks ago and we just got the active in
so<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.670> want<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.910> kind<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.090> take<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.300> look<00:00:27.510> at

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
so we want to kind of take a look at

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.419 
so we want to kind of take a look at
both<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.199> them<00:00:28.320> together<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.890> side<00:00:29.039> by<00:00:29.189> side

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
both of them together and side by side

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.990 
both of them together and side by side
and<00:00:29.609> what<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.789> main<00:00:29.939> differences<00:00:30.539> are<00:00:31.730> all<00:00:32.730> in

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
and what the main differences are all in

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.170 
and what the main differences are all in
all<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:34.079> active<00:00:34.530> case<00:00:34.680> over<00:00:35.489> top<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
all the active case over top of the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.959 
all the active case over top of the
surface<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.870> me<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.620> lot<00:00:37.920> better<00:00:38.100> case<00:00:38.670> for

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
surface to me is a lot better case for

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.790 
surface to me is a lot better case for
the<00:00:39.660> simple<00:00:39.899> fact<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.530> dual

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the simple fact that you have dual

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.729 
the simple fact that you have dual
protection<00:00:41.750> if<00:00:42.750> you've<00:00:42.930> got<00:00:43.110> an<00:00:43.290> inner<00:00:43.440> core

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
protection if you've got an inner core

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.490 
protection if you've got an inner core
silicon<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.360> your<00:00:45.629> outer<00:00:45.840> core<00:00:46.170> harder

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
silicon and your outer core harder

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.250 
silicon and your outer core harder
plastic<00:00:47.430> along<00:00:48.300> with<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.899> also<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
plastic along with that you also have a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.229 
plastic along with that you also have a
built-in<00:00:49.590> kickstand<00:00:50.160> from<00:00:50.340> say<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.670> this

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
built-in kickstand from say do this

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.720 
built-in kickstand from say do this
kickstand<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.750> actually<00:00:52.260> metal<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.860> if<00:00:53.640> you

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
kickstand is actually metal and if you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.150 
kickstand is actually metal and if you
flip<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.739> actually<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
flip it up here you can actually see a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.770 
flip it up here you can actually see a
little<00:00:56.280> magnet<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.570> when<00:00:57.690> you

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
little magnet here so that when you

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.560 
little magnet here so that when you
close<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.410> keeps<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.340> closed<00:00:59.609> from<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.059> not

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
close it it keeps it closed from and not

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.280 
close it it keeps it closed from and not
popping<00:01:01.020> out<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.940> let's<00:01:03.539> take<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> look<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.140> what

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
popping out so let's take a look at what

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.090 
popping out so let's take a look at what
the<00:01:04.409> case<00:01:04.589> looks<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> z10<00:01:06.890> as<00:01:07.890> you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the case looks like on the z10 as you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.899 
the case looks like on the z10 as you
can<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> skin<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.869> Z

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
can see I do have a skin on the Z

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.969 
can see I do have a skin on the Z
currently<00:01:11.909> now<00:01:12.659> most<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.740> are<00:01:13.799> wondering

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
already tried it just to make sure most

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.280 
already tried it just to make sure most
cases<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> little<00:01:24.479> bit<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.720> forgiveness

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
cases have a little bit of forgiveness

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.980 
cases have a little bit of forgiveness
when<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.860> comes<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.479> skins<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.780> nature

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
when it comes to skins of that nature

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
and snug great form-fitting case so we

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.010 
and snug great form-fitting case so we
decided<00:01:56.710> to<00:01:56.770> go<00:01:56.890> with<00:01:57.010> the<00:01:57.130> red<00:01:57.900> because<00:01:58.900> we

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
decided to go with the red because we

the<00:02:11.890> stand<00:02:12.130> itself<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:14.320> does<00:02:14.470> not<00:02:14.620> work<00:02:14.800> that

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
the stand itself it does not work that

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.550 
the stand itself it does not work that
way<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.820> does<00:02:16.030> not<00:02:16.180> work<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.570> other<00:02:16.660> way<00:02:16.870> it

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
way it does not work the other way it

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.770 
way it does not work the other way it
will<00:02:17.740> only<00:02:17.890> work<00:02:18.190> one<00:02:18.370> way<00:02:18.550> we'll<00:02:19.360> just<00:02:19.570> find

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
will only work one way we'll just find

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.780 
will only work one way we'll just find
because<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.740> can<00:02:20.950> actually<00:02:21.070> you<00:02:21.370> know<00:02:21.460> turn

application for instance YouTube you can

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.980 
application for instance YouTube you can
kind<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.760> see<00:02:27.970> how<00:02:28.090> everything<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.600> already

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
kind of see how everything is already

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.490 
kind of see how everything is already

traversed into the correct screen
orientation<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:34.290> basically<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:36.190> case<00:02:36.430> is

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
orientation so basically the case is

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.200 
orientation so basically the case is

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
covering all four corners it has a nice

covering all four corners it has a nice
little<00:02:40.390> lip<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:42.010> I'm<00:02:42.070> gonna<00:02:42.160> get<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.340> camera

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
little lip so I'm gonna get the camera

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.460 
little lip so I'm gonna get the camera
to<00:02:42.730> focus<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:43.450> nice<00:02:44.050> little<00:02:44.290> lip<00:02:44.500> right<00:02:44.710> here

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
to focus a nice little lip right here
