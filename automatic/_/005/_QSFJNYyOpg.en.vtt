to diagnose and fix a p12
8<00:00:21.320> 0<00:00:21.710> or<00:00:21.949> 1280<00:00:22.400> code<00:00:24.999> let's<00:00:25.999> see<00:00:26.119> right<00:00:26.150> here

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
8 0 or 1280 code let's see right here

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.920 
8 0 or 1280 code let's see right here
I've<00:00:26.630> got<00:00:27.759> 1280

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.190 

and<00:00:31.439> what<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.680> is<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.310> the<00:00:32.660> ICP<00:00:33.660> sensor

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
and what that is is it's the ICP sensor

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.120 
and what that is is it's the ICP sensor
out<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.190> range<00:00:35.780> and<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.500> want<00:00:37.650> to<00:00:37.739> show<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.920> what

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
out of range and I want to show you what

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.180 
out of range and I want to show you what
that<00:00:38.160> usually<00:00:38.430> means<00:00:38.760> right<00:00:38.970> now<00:00:40.070> this<00:00:41.070> is

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
that usually means right now this is

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.950 
that usually means right now this is
your<00:00:41.309> ICP<00:00:41.700> sensor<00:00:42.030> right<00:00:42.180> here<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.570> located

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
your ICP sensor right here it's located

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.020 
your ICP sensor right here it's located
on<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> front<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.250> engine<00:00:44.400> on<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> driver

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030

side head right behind the hpop in the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.660 
side head right behind the hpop in the
alternator<00:00:48.199> now<00:00:49.199> your<00:00:49.350> p12<00:00:49.860> 80<00:00:50.070> code<00:00:50.339> means

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
alternator now your p12 80 code means

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.650 
alternator now your p12 80 code means
that<00:00:50.850> there's<00:00:51.000> something<00:00:51.150> wrong<00:00:51.390> with<00:00:51.570> her

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
that there's something wrong with her

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.340 
that there's something wrong with her
sensor<00:00:52.190> it's<00:00:53.190> usually<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.910> sensors<00:00:54.239> bad<00:00:54.449> but

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
sensor it's usually the sensors bad but

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.930 
sensor it's usually the sensors bad but
it<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.500> also<00:00:55.680> mean<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.519> pigtail

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
it can also mean that this this pigtail

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.439 
it can also mean that this this pigtail
is<00:00:57.210> bad<00:00:57.739> but<00:00:58.739> generally<00:00:59.190> it's<00:01:00.030> your<00:01:00.180> sensor

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
is bad but generally it's your sensor

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.899 
is bad but generally it's your sensor
itself<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.079> way<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.230> can<00:01:01.440> check<00:01:01.650> is<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
itself the way you can check is going to

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.539 
itself the way you can check is going to
disconnect<00:01:03.150> the<00:01:03.330> sensor<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.489> how

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
disconnect the sensor you see how

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.780 
disconnect the sensor you see how
there's<00:01:05.729> oil<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.930> sensor<00:01:07.430> that<00:01:08.430> means<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
there's oil on the sensor that means the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.719 
there's oil on the sensor that means the
cents<00:01:09.030> are<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> wiring<00:01:10.190> connector<00:01:11.190> that
