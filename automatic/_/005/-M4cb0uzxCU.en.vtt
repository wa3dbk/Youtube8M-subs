either 11 or hate it so I'm thinking

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.040 
either 11 or hate it so I'm thinking
it's<00:00:34.890> going<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> be<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.579> acquired<00:00:36.329> taste

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
it's going to be a acquired taste

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.780 
it's going to be a acquired taste
probably<00:00:37.950> i<00:00:37.980> might<00:00:38.220> not<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.550> at<00:00:38.760> first

but i think it's one of those things
that<00:00:40.710> if<00:00:41.219> he<00:00:41.370> eat<00:00:41.430> more<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.180> start<00:00:42.630> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
that if he eat more of it you start to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.520 
that if he eat more of it you start to
like<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.410> don't<00:00:43.469> know<00:00:44.000> anyway<00:00:45.380> this<00:00:46.380> is
