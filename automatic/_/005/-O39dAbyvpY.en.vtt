00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.619 

okay<00:00:01.230> ten<00:00:01.650> minutes<00:00:02.100> later<00:00:02.399> it<00:00:02.850> comes<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.600> a

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
okay ten minutes later it comes to a

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.430 
okay ten minutes later it comes to a
boiling<00:00:04.220> so<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.609> will<00:00:05.970> turn<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.420> fire<00:00:06.720> slower

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
boiling so I will turn the fire slower

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.780 
boiling so I will turn the fire slower
and<00:00:09.650> come<00:00:10.650> out<00:00:10.860> slowly<00:00:11.870> don't<00:00:12.870> be<00:00:13.139> afraid<00:00:13.830> it

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
and come out slowly don't be afraid it

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.160 
and come out slowly don't be afraid it
will<00:00:15.179> not<00:00:15.420> explode<00:00:16.369> and<00:00:19.100> the<00:00:20.100> heat<00:00:20.400> roll<00:00:21.170> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
will not explode and the heat roll the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.500 
will not explode and the heat roll the
pressure<00:00:22.560> will<00:00:23.840> make<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.260> meat<00:00:25.920> become<00:00:26.580> much

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
pressure will make the meat become much

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.060 
pressure will make the meat become much
softer<00:00:30.500> put<00:00:31.500> some<00:00:31.800> fire<00:00:32.250> stronger<00:00:33.829> than<00:00:34.829> there

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
softer put some fire stronger than there

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.200 
softer put some fire stronger than there
were<00:00:35.190> more<00:00:35.579> heat<00:00:36.200> accumulating<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:38.700> purpose

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
were more heat accumulating the purpose

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:51.950 
were more heat accumulating the purpose
is<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.649> get<00:00:40.950> some<00:00:41.239> pressure

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.170 

hi<00:00:52.960> Gary

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:14.460 

okay<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.450> pre-fire<00:01:01.260> slower

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:22.120 

it<00:01:15.470> smells<00:01:15.920> ginger

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.780 

so<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.340> too<00:01:23.850> slow<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.980> turn<00:01:25.980> it<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.550> an

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
so it's too slow I turn it to an

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:38.810 
so it's too slow I turn it to an
irritable<00:01:27.450> stronger

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.860 

keep<00:01:39.480> it<00:01:39.690> for<00:01:40.230> a<00:01:40.650> couple<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.280> minutes<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.330> then

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
keep it for a couple of minutes and then

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.649 
keep it for a couple of minutes and then
you<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.229> stop<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.710> fire<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.909> depends<00:01:45.330> on<00:01:45.420> how

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
you can stop the fire it depends on how

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.400 
you can stop the fire it depends on how
much<00:01:45.870> you<00:01:46.110> want<00:01:46.520> how<00:01:47.520> much<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.940> want<00:01:48.420> my<00:01:48.780> meat<00:01:49.050> to

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
much you want how much I want my meat to

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.510 
much you want how much I want my meat to
be<00:01:49.670> softened<00:01:50.670> lots<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.690> suffering<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.160> will

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
be softened lots of suffering so I will

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
be softened lots of suffering so I will
pressure<00:01:56.150> is<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.630> little<00:01:56.810> bit<00:01:57.110> more<00:01:58.180> five<00:01:59.180> more

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
pressure is a little bit more five more

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.110 
pressure is a little bit more five more
minutes<00:02:00.280> see<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.490> later<00:02:02.110> alligator
