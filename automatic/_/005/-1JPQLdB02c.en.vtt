00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
up your own sort of account on the race

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.500 
up your own sort of account on the race
net<00:00:44.399> web<00:00:44.610> site<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:44.969> all<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.210> sort<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.450> thing

of things behold beforehand and then

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.580 
of things behold beforehand and then
what<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.539> actually<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.350> says
