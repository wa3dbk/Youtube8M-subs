00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.260
 hi hello killion i hope you are 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.180
 pretty good and good we are with a 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.700
 new gameplay of a game that already has 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.860
 a little bit of fact that I found it but 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.589
 I'm not really really liked the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.539
 good problem is that it has rather the 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.310
 game is totally free nothing more than 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.930
 if it has a little publicity but 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.400
 well it's not too much although sometimes 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.900
 I believe that the truth has a little bit that 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.870
 I do not play it but good 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.690
 share it with all of you there will already be 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.070
 seen the title then in the title of the 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.710
 video so let's give it here not 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.530
 game and what is it good about more than 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.140
 nothing or that starts immediately for 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.800
 start and what we have to do then 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.440
 es scope for of vests and a 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.510
 helicopter was watching us and then 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.629
 the joke is to go escaping here and 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.600
 we skid stupid patrols do not 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.370
 can catch wow I'm leaving and good 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.479
 since this is about this game though 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.059
 look easy 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.819
 It almost hit me easy to drive 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.429
 it's not so much in the beginning to me 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:03.479
 it got complicated for me and ok 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.430
 stupid 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.560
 that got you 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.460
 and here we can restart it or if it 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.140
 we put on pause here and we go out there 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.310
 many more options in this case is in 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.690
 a fax ok this is what I mean 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.000
 but good if they are not connected to 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.550
 internet this will leave us skip 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 here this video does not interest me and good 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.200
 that was in the downtown parking lot 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 commercial we have another one here that is 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.960
 I think in the suburbs and good here 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.010
 we have a car that is faster than 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.470
 done and here is where we go this patrol 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.470
 and I do not know the truth that I like or that of 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.120
 shock fuck 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.440
 to hang out the truth that is 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.690
 well then when I go I do not know on the way to 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.030
 shit on the way to school or so 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.490
 I start to play it and I tell you it's 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.580
 great to hang out and not only 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.950
 there is all these 12 cars to say the least 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.340
 in some way because there are many more and 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.229
 also many with flame more scenarios 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.270
 and it's more complicated than ccoo to crash 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.730
 let's let's go out so that they 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.230
 show another that is going to be the last one 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.600
 I'm going to show so that you do not see them all 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.940
 this for example is in a cemetery 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.480
 this is on the highway one of those 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.760
 hippies and this is like that in the center 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.130
 as if in the center of the city and 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.130
 we are this mini cart but the great thing 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.640
 of fox because you work what's great is 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.420
 that there are water tanks how is that 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.850
 half if he hit the damn post fraud 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.610
 total and good here they also persecute us 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.230
 war tanks apart from patrols 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.700
 so we must be careful 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.700
 I'll go spinning and like crazy uy 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.120
 that you do not give me or we dodge 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.800
 I'm not the end collided with a pole 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.380
 And if you want to share, why not? 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.000
 I know I like it a lot and if you 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.220
 like it now 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.790
 damn war tank and collided with a 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.410
 I say damn post if you like 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.410
 again or advertising kim 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.780
 and is that by twitter that what 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.970
 downloaded and the likes and do not know which 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.340
 it's my twitter because it's always in the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.310
 description and if they do not have twitter then 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.870
 do shit for second so nothing 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.480
 I hope you liked this game to 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.980
 I really like it, he called me 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.580
 much attention as soon as I saw it apart 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.010
 the style like that very minimalist and not 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.500
 I know it's great I really like this game 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.300
 and I tell you that this is perfect for 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.920
 hang out so I do not expect anything 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.210
 you liked it and we'll see each other in the 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.090
 next video since you will depend 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.440
 that see the other places or you 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.330
 you pass to your partner and I crashed 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:00.590
 with you so nothing until later and between 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.890
 the traffic or idiot just like goodbye 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.890
