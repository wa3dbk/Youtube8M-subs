this<00:01:14.740> guy<00:01:15.010> is<00:01:15.630> articulated<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.920> of<00:01:18.010> all<00:01:18.130> the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
this guy is articulated and of all the

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.920 
this guy is articulated and of all the
figures<00:01:18.550> in<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.790> world<00:01:18.940> he<00:01:19.390> is<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.690> most

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
figures in the world he is the most

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.010 
figures in the world he is the most
articulated<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:22.450> I'm<00:01:22.540> not<00:01:22.660> talking<00:01:22.960> about

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
articulated and I'm not talking about

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.600 
articulated and I'm not talking about
transformer<00:01:23.800> articulation<00:01:24.370> I'm<00:01:24.460> actually

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
transformer articulation I'm actually

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.020 
transformer articulation I'm actually
talking<00:01:24.910> about<00:01:25.240> movement<00:01:27.420> he<00:01:28.420> has<00:01:28.720> I<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:30.430> if

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
talking about movement he has I think if

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.960 
talking about movement he has I think if
the<00:01:31.180> number<00:01:31.660> was<00:01:31.900> about<00:01:32.200> 67<00:01:33.780> 62<00:01:35.220> 63<00:01:36.220> points<00:01:36.670> of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
the number was about 67 62 63 points of

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.660 
the number was about 67 62 63 points of
articulation<00:01:37.120> I<00:01:37.840> could<00:01:38.500> be<00:01:38.680> wrong<00:01:38.920> it

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
articulation I could be wrong it

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.540 
articulation I could be wrong it
probably<00:01:39.729> am<00:01:40.300> but<00:01:40.830> let's<00:01:41.830> just<00:01:41.950> say<00:01:42.130> it's<00:01:42.250> way

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
probably am but let's just say it's way

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.640 
probably am but let's just say it's way
up<00:01:42.760> there

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
up there

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.340 
up there
every<00:01:44.650> digit<00:01:45.220> in<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.670> hand<00:01:46.000> moves<00:01:46.869> every

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
every digit in the hand moves every

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.510 
every digit in the hand moves every
digit<00:01:48.250> every<00:01:48.640> knuckle<00:01:49.090> every<00:01:49.420> finger<00:01:50.520> even

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520

the<00:01:51.910> thumb<00:01:52.979> even<00:01:54.660> almost<00:01:55.660> every<00:01:56.080> conceivable

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
the thumb even almost every conceivable

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.210

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
point of articulation on him moves it

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.920 
point of articulation on him moves it
all<00:02:00.990> right<00:02:02.160> but<00:02:03.570> aside<00:02:04.570> from<00:02:04.630> the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
all right but aside from the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.440 
all right but aside from the
articulation<00:02:05.619> he's<00:02:05.740> actually<00:02:06.040> not<00:02:06.580> he<00:02:07.149> does

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450
