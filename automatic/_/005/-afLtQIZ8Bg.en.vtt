00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 which effect hormones on pimples e 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.560
 at the moment there is call for feelings a butter 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.030
 group to take to work ie the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.200
 hormones that seem to me to have an effect 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.599
 positive are often given for 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.289
 the acne that I feel the hormones on 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.480
 growth of unwanted hair 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.269
 hormones can be great friends 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.800
 of women's beauty of course 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.439
 I'm talking about sex hormones, I'm talking about 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.210
 pills and I speak in particular of one 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.650
 of the two components of the pill 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.300
 if we consider any 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.590
 Human contraceptive the pill patch 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.780
 ring 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.210
 we must consider that they are present 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.190
 two hormones we can consider the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.460
 wife and husband wife e 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.530
 estrogen almost always an estrogen 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.360
 synthetic ethinyl estradiol her husband 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.910
 instead it can be very different in 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.489
 sense that we have different progestogens a 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.559
 depending on the combination of the wife 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.379
 with that such a husband we get gods 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.690
 different biological effects on ours 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.170
 body in particular if we want 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.489
 fight acne to reduce it to zero 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.220
 possibly come back to have a nice one 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.140
 face I had to take husbands who 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.840
 they go to reduce the level of hormones 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.729
 men who are the ones who do 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.830
 produce more sebum then infected by 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.610
 new to the folliculitis ai 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.229
 pimples 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.299
 but also stimulus in the public 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.950
 hair follicle and give us hair in 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.170
 more than we call our own 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.090
 hirsutism when we have one 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.130
 hair proliferation in venues 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.590
 typically non-feminine masculine for 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.750
 example on the chin for example on the lip 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.360
 upper around the areola on the part 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.979
 upper abdomen towards the navel 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.380
 then we must then choose the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.079
 wife and husband combination 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.350
 therefore effectively therapeutic 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.630
 curative of what is a 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.380
 hormone production disorder 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.540
 male 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.360
 I have to take a little step back when 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.770
 acne appears acne appears when the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.200
 our vaio 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.180
 or in association also the adrenal gland 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.600
 they produce a quantity of hormones 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.409
 male higher than the right superior 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.170
 to normality 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.629
 which are the women most at risk of 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.610
 have an excess of male hormones are 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.880
 women who suffer from the so-called 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.280
 syndrome 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.620
 polycystic ovary a syndrome that is 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.440
 characterized by difficulty 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.110
 of the ovary wish from the tendency to 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.240
 produce more follicles and from the fact that 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.860
 in the center of the ovary there are some 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.470
 cells that produce male hormones 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.600
 which are hyper stimulated are cells 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.000
 of her of and therefore the woman has one 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.630
 production of higher male hormones 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 to the average 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.910
 I must however remember that this vaio is not 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 is that it works bad of his works in 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.980
 more irregularly dysfunctional 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.410
 as we say especially in women 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.780
 overweight and then here we introduce a 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.470
 very important concept plus the girl 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.180
 increases weight less sports more goes 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.940
 encountering a disorder that the 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.890
 so-called increase in resistance 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.630
 insulin peripheral ie a 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.120
 metabolic disorder in simple terms 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.590
 it uses sugars worse than this 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.930
 girl has an ovary that will always go 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.640
 worse for which the first advice 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.610
 I always ask my patients are the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.250
 lifestyles an appropriate diet 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.990
 very few sugars better or glucose 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.020
 very few yeasts prefer fruit 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.480
 vegetable fish and meat legume cereals 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.100
 very well but in small quantities then 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.650
 reduce overall caloric intake 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.930
 in a balanced way by following 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.270
 maybe a nutritionist and always 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.310
 daily physical movement also 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.520
 walk fast because this 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.990
 because if we walk fast 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.980
 we optimize peripheral use 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.930
 insulin 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.980
 but we are also going to help the ovary to 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.040
 work better 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.900
 sleep the right number of hours if one 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.720
 girl sleeps less than author or 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.250
 even less than 7 what happens 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.959
 not only is she tired but very tired 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.760
 increases the production of a neuro 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.580
 a substance called lungs 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.910
 ghrelin and ghrelin increases the appetite 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.580
 for fatty and sweet foods and therefore 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.980
 it becomes much more difficult to follow one 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.459
 converso diet those who move 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.770
 physical to a greater capacity of 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.840
 check the pulse for food then 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.190
 we have not only the physical movement that 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.950
 gives us an advantage because it burns calories 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.320
 this is a minimalist reading but in 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.639
 reality doing physical movement and the 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.490
 sleep a number of hours at your own 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.680
 allows us to do better diets than 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.229
 follow more rigorously and then 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.509
 to optimize then maintain a weight 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.249
 adequate body but also a physical one 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:39.499
 overall more feminine more 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.849
 cute and healthier that said let's go 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:41.930
 also helping him go to work 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.699
 better 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.889
 but if then this goes on a 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.840
 To produce too many hormones here comes 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.479
 to help the hormonal contraceptive col 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.349
 right husband that is anti 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.509
 androgens 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.449
 what is the family of anti androgens 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:58.669
 we have an older pill than 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.729
 contains the cyproterone acetate that one 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.620
 very powerful molecule to inhibit a 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.340
 so very powerful husband to block 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.750
 the pimples 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.300
 but also an estrogen level a 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.490
 a little tonic so it's a pill that 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.080
 okay for pretty sturdy girls 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.460
 certainly not for the minute or 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.279
 mingherline because we always have to do 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:20.180
 the cut to size another type of 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:22.189
 pill that contains a useful husband for 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.830
 fight acne and the big family 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:26.689
 this is not the other spire pills 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.819
 substance that actually derives from a 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:31.219
 diuretic helps us to contain a little 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:33.830
 weight but above all to fight acne 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:35.360
 if, however, we suffer from disorders of the 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.279
 eating behavior 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.560
 we have various problems because 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:41.300
 we have intolerances or syndrome 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.339
 irritable colon or we have celiac disease 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.860
 a lactose intolerance 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:47.899
 all situations where the pills don't 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.159
 they are good for nothing even if they have 

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:50.810
 a perfect husband 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.539
 there are still others of course 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.580
 we have to resort to other methods 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.879
 among the other two methods we have left 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.649
 the patch is the ring which suits us best 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:04.219
 to fight acne 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:07.009
 the patch because the husband present in 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:10.279
 patch the year register mines to this 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:12.830
 fantastic action against androgens a 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:15.169
 level of the hair follicle at the level 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.110
 of the sebaceous gland and therefore there 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.370
 lets what a perfect one 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.620
 contraception that bypasses all 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.629
 gastrointestinal problems c.da levels 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.550
 constant in the blood and has the great 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:27.949
 value of combining also an action 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.620
 cosmetic at the level of the follicle 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:32.509
 piliferous and sebaceous gland with 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.810
 a very interesting plus than the others 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:36.150
 husbands don't give us 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.880
 the other progestogens I mean ie 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.950
 maintain normal hydration 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.690
 dermal as shown by 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.040
 professor sator than a dermatologist who 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.169
 has published an extremely article 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.540
 interesting just about dermatologists who 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:49.980
 it is a bit the bible of dermatologists 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.440
 so here we have data 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.300
 scientific that make us understand what 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.520
 that we must first choose the 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.710
 right combination of estrogen col 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.570
 husband going to reduce the effect 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.400
 of androgens produced in excess in the 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.080
 woman's body if the woman does not have 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.730
 food-related disorders o 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.150
 intolerances or other there are 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:11.930
 very effective pills on this if or 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.910
 by his choice because he prefers 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.070
 personally a weekly method e 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.020
 wants patch or because it has problems that 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.330
 against indicate the oral route in this 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.580
 case the patch has a husband inside 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.639
 the have mine register which is a lot 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.320
 effective in combating acne and its 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.560
 unwanted hair keeping a good one 

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.560
 hydration
