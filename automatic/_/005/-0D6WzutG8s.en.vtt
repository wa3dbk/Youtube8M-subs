here

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
here

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.980 
here
if<00:01:21.070> I<00:01:21.280> take<00:01:21.610> just<00:01:21.790> the<00:01:21.910> top<00:01:22.120> four<00:01:22.360> strings<00:01:22.480> you

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
if I take just the top four strings you

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.590 
if I take just the top four strings you
can<00:01:23.140> move<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.410> exact<00:01:23.830> same<00:01:24.160> shape<00:01:24.550> and<00:01:25.060> that

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
can move the exact same shape and that

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.830 
can move the exact same shape and that
now<00:01:25.780> becomes<00:01:26.170> your<00:01:26.560> ear<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:27.040> chord<00:01:27.430> and<00:01:27.840> that

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
now becomes your ear a chord and that

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.990 
now becomes your ear a chord and that
may<00:01:29.020> comes<00:01:29.260> your<00:01:29.440> D<00:01:29.590> chord<00:01:29.620> so<00:01:30.550> instead<00:01:30.940> of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
may comes your D chord so instead of

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.870 
may comes your D chord so instead of
having<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.450> change<00:01:31.810> everything<00:01:35.700> all<00:01:36.700> of<00:01:36.820> a

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
having to change everything all of a

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.190 
having to change everything all of a
sudden<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.240> fretboard<00:01:37.450> is<00:01:37.750> much<00:01:37.990> more

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
sudden the fretboard is much more

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
guitar in standard tuning for you know

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.660 
guitar in standard tuning for you know
twenty<00:02:11.950> thirty<00:02:11.980> years<00:02:12.460> a<00:02:12.610> long<00:02:12.880> time<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:15.490> make

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
twenty thirty years a long time to make

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.580 
twenty thirty years a long time to make
the<00:02:15.880> change<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.480> going<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.870> straight<00:02:17.140> fourths

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
the change to going in straight fourths

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.880 
the change to going in straight fourths
was<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:18.250> bit<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:19.110> bit<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.230> challenge<00:02:20.470> in<00:02:20.800> the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
was a bit of a bit of a challenge in the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.910 
was a bit of a bit of a challenge in the
beginning<00:02:21.010> but<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:22.380> think<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.650> long<00:02:23.860> run

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
beginning but I think in the long run

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.720 
beginning but I think in the long run
it's<00:02:24.220> definitely<00:02:24.880> worth<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:26.640> you'll<00:02:27.640> be

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
it's definitely worth it and you'll be

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.060 
it's definitely worth it and you'll be
able<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.270> still<00:02:28.600> do<00:02:28.840> all<00:02:29.230> kinds<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.800> open

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
able to still do all kinds of open

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.280 
able to still do all kinds of open
string<00:02:30.370> stuff<00:02:30.700> but<00:02:31.420> it'll<00:02:31.600> be<00:02:31.720> different<00:02:31.900> open

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
string stuff but it'll be different open

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.520 
string stuff but it'll be different open
string<00:02:32.530> stuff<00:02:32.830> so<00:02:34.080> anyway<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.110> guess<00:02:35.320> that's

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
string stuff so anyway I guess that's
