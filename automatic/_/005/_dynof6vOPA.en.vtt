00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.710
 have a beautiful body healed free of 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.750
 fat is the desire of most 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.420
 but often this objective does not 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.360
 happens due to lack of discipline 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.379
 a rule is basic to achieving your 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.050
 goals 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.960
 training and diet are fundamental to 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.380
 supplementation is necessary and sleep is 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.380
 precious 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.450
 but in this rule an issue still 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.180
 generates enough doubts supplementation which 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.460
 ideal supplementation for anyone who wants 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.920
 and who wants definition and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.649
 for those who crave hypertrophy 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.399
 questions that will be answered now 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.600
 a thing that went into the 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.550
 fashion in recent times what 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.190
 It happens, everyone wants to take the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.170
 supplement but does not always know or 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.039
 ideal complement to the objective that 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.030
 she wants to reach 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.530
 is how sound is a huge variety of 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.930
 type of supplement and each one suitable 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.549
 for the purpose people still have 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.619
 enough doubt about it 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.010
 different from what people think 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.380
 supplement and already already with the name already 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.580
 says the name he comes to supplement the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.009
 food 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.950
 it serves for what for the gain of 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.110
 lean mass is then the weight gain and 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.990
 do not get fat with many people think 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.310
 supplementation has nothing to do with 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.369
 anabolic and steroids 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.310
 the anabolic and stirring hormones 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.909
 of the person which is no longer a very thing 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.320
 cool 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.630
 so why do we prefer the 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.400
 supplement that supplement is very 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.460
 more healthy, huh? 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.560
 on this basis of food for those who 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.090
 want to lose weight build muscle 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.240
 hypertrophy supplementation is required 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.360
 it is necessary because sometimes the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.860
 People can not just feed themselves. 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.990
 supply all the nutrients time 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.719
 learn from the example of supplementation 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.479
 what was passed in theory the focus now 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.539
 is for those who want to lose weight and 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.969
 Good muscle definition use in fact 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.829
 we slim it we have some 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.209
 some categories and supplements that are 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.230
 important for this phase of 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.969
 weight loss 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.319
 Thermogenics are supplements that 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.150
 accelerates metabolism 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.409
 we have some some term genius 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.599
 who work for this purpose 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:30.060
 Thermogenics like oxy raps is a project 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.849
 female specific it speeds up 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.159
 metabolism and it has a differential 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.769
 which are capsules which have two phases one 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.049
 with a liquid phase and a phase that are 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.079
 these poles that are inside the 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.540
 truth is more and more deliberation 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:50.159
 slow then so it makes a nice butt 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.200
 a job in managing it and during the 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.489
 day as a whole it will release these 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.049
 letters and we keep getting the 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.799
 metabolism during the day 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.540
 all 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:03.569
 in addition to these we have you ex that Olympus 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.069
 It's a really strong supplement it's actually 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.560
 a category that we usually 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.599
 indicate who already has it already 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.930
 use of some type of thermogenic 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.280
 because it really speeds up 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.790
 metabolism has a 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.699
 amount of caffeine 420 milligrams 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.989
 so the super nice supplement for 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:25.379
 who wants to lose weight and 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.750
 muscle definition beyond the category of 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.090
 thermogenic we have a category in 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.459
 we call blockers 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.449
 blockers of fat or 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.340
 carbohydrate 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.829
 they work as they do 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.310
 form a gel in the stomach that 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:43.319
 hinders the absorption of these nutrients 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.599
 in the case of fat and carbohydrate 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.609
 so it makes the person in doing 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.870
 feeding it will have a reduction 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.629
 of 20 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.220
 sometimes up to 30% in fat absorption 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.689
 and carbohydrate so do not lose the 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.489
 muscle mass is important as well. 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.919
 supplement with a protein 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.510
 In this specific case, people indicate the 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:04.680
 low carbohydrate protein 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.810
 isolated and did not even need the 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.939
 side of a protein that has a 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.470
 low carbohydrate content in the case 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:13.379
 We have several options here 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.810
 Your trip has now recently arrived 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.510
 solar is a specific one for the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.139
 women beyond being low carbohydrate 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.150
 It tastes amazing and it has collagen 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.460
 then it is an ex surprises each for the 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.020
 feminine line plus you have now arrived 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.210
 also recently on the market 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.400
 rui salgado is actually a soup of 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.169
 milk a chicken soup with vegetables is 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.360
 It's really cool because she can be 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.289
 making hot then so we do not 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.360
 comes home at night mainly 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.819
 now in winter want to have a meal 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.289
 that has low carbohydrate with this not 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.810
 it's a cold meal it's a meal 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.639
 had such a good option for the 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.789
 people who want to take one with 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.349
 Protein night of who I had is for whom 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.689
 want to lose weight 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.340
 Supplementation is a great ally 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:59.009
 as well as for those people who 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.129
 the definition and when the objective 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.909
 is hypertrophy ie increase of mass 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.979
 muscular 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.139
 supplementation is essential for 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.900
 results are quick and effective 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.389
 So I 've been a professor where the 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.740
 major categories of 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.770
 supplements 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.629
 within this category, people find the 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.279
 i which is actually the basis of 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:22.680
 supplementation for those who are 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:24.839
 work of gaining muscle mass 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.460
 only so there is a doubt 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:28.289
 with regard to the amount of 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.939
 carbohydrate that your team has when 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.560
 is doing a work of gain of 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:33.810
 this concern should be 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.120
 stay in the background because 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.830
 absorb this law with the musician absorb 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.000
 Your he needs an amount of 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.960
 carbohydrate're so then we have to 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.960
 some laws that we recommend 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.529
 and together with him we 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.300
 indicates an 11 in the case here the axn month and 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:54.110
 which is a low-carbohydrate 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.060
 glycemic is sure what it can be 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.310
 mixed with him to do the 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.849
 absorption. 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.960
 besides this cd if this category of 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.439
 proteins 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.909
 we can also highlight the part of 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:10.469
 amino acids are not amino acids are 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.789
 responsible for the construction and 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:14.430
 muscle recovery 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:17.219
 then there comes the question of bc people 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:21.089
 there are some products here are good 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:23.460
 concentrates of 1.5 milligrams sá 

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:25.289
 We have a bc that was released. 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.219
 Recently, BES and other culture 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:30.060
 focused 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:33.419
 he has in 2008 grams per tablet of 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.020
 bcaa besides bc's there we have a 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.479
 category 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.819
 I would supplement that is creatine right is 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.740
 a product that really is a result 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:42.090
 cool because creatine actually 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.900
 causes the muscle to absorb more 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.400
 liquid 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.169
 along with this liquid is absorbing 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.650
 all nutrients also included 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:52.770
 protein and god know the subject 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.479
 besides the creatine is we have the pre 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.289
 training in famous trainers that 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:56.940
 cool 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:59.460
 in fact what one comes in 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:02.520
 and can do the training with more 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.720
 Gas harder then enters this 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.680
 category pre workout 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.210
 besides these supplements is a 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.690
 supplement that was forgotten during 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:15.180
 one time is alumina aluminum one time 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.139
 was basically protein that all 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.199
 world took né 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:20.880
 before the age of 8 and then the staff after 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:22.500
 who entered and eventually left the band 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.840
 can only abominate an egg protein 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.479
 and it has a very good biological value 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.370
 what happens to the food is one is a 

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:31.830
 intermediate absorption protein 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.509
 she is neither slow nor fast then 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.460
 it can be taken at any time 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:37.379
 after being taken at night is a protein 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.270
 since it is a protein of God 

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:41.310
 intermediate solution and it can be 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.409
 morning take also no problem 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.330
 we just do not tell her in the pre-workout 

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:46.590
 post-training because the 

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.669
 category of judges who make a 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.680
 work better 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:51.750
 then to gain muscle mass 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.529
 really there is an infinity of 

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.529
 products 

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:58.259
 We have everyone here in the store and we could 

00:07:55.529 --> 00:08:00.599
 so do 11 a legal statement the 

00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:02.849
 our clients and then you already know 

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:05.310
 way to go to your 

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:08.039
 goal with these tips became more 

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:10.680
 easy then just go to a 

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:12.979
 supplements and discipline in training and 

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.979
 diet
