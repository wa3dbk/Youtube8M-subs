dramatically<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:09.690> say<00:03:09.959> if<00:03:10.079> i<00:03:10.319> wanted<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.010> i

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
dramatically so say if i wanted to i

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.720 
dramatically so say if i wanted to i
could<00:03:12.140> pay<00:03:13.140> say<00:03:13.560> seven<00:03:13.980> dollars<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.400> fifty

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
could pay say seven dollars and fifty

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.849 
could pay say seven dollars and fifty
cents<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.359> what<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.079> will<00:03:16.140> do<00:03:16.410> it'll

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
cents and what this will do it'll

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:22.099 
cents and what this will do it'll
multiply<00:03:17.099> all<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.389> my<00:03:18.510> wins<00:03:18.780> x<00:03:19.200> 4<00:03:19.819> for<00:03:20.900> one<00:03:21.900> hour

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
multiply all of my wins x 4 for one hour

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.009 
multiply all of my wins x 4 for one hour
it<00:03:22.500> looks<00:03:22.709> like<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.669> if<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.480> really<00:03:24.780> want<00:03:24.959> to

was<00:03:53.639> still<00:03:53.819> there<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.419> you<00:03:54.480> see<00:03:54.810> he<00:03:54.959> just<00:03:54.989> got

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
was still there so you see he just got

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.050 
was still there so you see he just got
17<00:03:55.769> because<00:03:56.099> his<00:03:56.400> time<00:03:56.609> it<00:03:56.730> was<00:03:56.849> all<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.000> way

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
17 because his time it was all the way

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.530 
17 because his time it was all the way
down<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.269> seven<00:03:57.870> on<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:59.310> timer<00:03:59.730> for<00:04:00.180> that<00:04:00.980> HTC

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
down to seven on the timer for that HTC

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.559 
down to seven on the timer for that HTC
so<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.810> that's<00:04:03.989> how<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:05.310> get<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.669> they<00:04:06.389> asked

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
so and that's how you get it they asked

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.470 
so and that's how you get it they asked
you<00:04:06.840> six<00:04:07.230> questions<00:04:07.700> so<00:04:08.700> there's<00:04:08.879> six<00:04:09.090> rounds

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
you six questions so there's six rounds

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.409 
you six questions so there's six rounds
and<00:04:12.019> there<00:04:13.019> are<00:04:13.169> six<00:04:13.379> rounds<00:04:13.949> and<00:04:14.120> after<00:04:15.120> the

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
and there are six rounds and after the

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.390 
and there are six rounds and after the
six<00:04:15.660> round<00:04:15.930> you<00:04:16.169> get<00:04:16.349> a<00:04:16.380> seventh-round<00:04:17.070> itches

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
six round you get a seventh-round itches

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.029 
six round you get a seventh-round itches
which<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.940> bonus<00:04:18.359> round<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.590> with<00:04:19.949> this

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
which is a bonus round so with this

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.240 
which is a bonus round so with this
bonus<00:04:20.489> round<00:04:20.729> you<00:04:20.970> actually<00:04:21.299> see<00:04:21.599> how<00:04:22.190> you

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
bonus round you actually see how you

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.140 
bonus round you actually see how you
that's<00:04:23.670> sony<00:04:24.240> ultra<00:04:24.600> there<00:04:25.580> you<00:04:26.580> actually<00:04:26.760> see

that's sony ultra there you actually see

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.070 
that's sony ultra there you actually see
a<00:04:28.100> double<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.310> points<00:04:29.520> so<00:04:30.240> you<00:04:30.600> don't<00:04:30.900> have<00:04:30.960> to

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
a double the points so you don't have to

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.270 
a double the points so you don't have to
worry<00:04:31.200> about<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.470> if<00:04:31.530> your<00:04:31.650> person<00:04:31.950> is<00:04:32.070> under

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
worry about it if your person is under

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.210 
worry about it if your person is under
half<00:04:32.880> but<00:04:33.210> if<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.450> person<00:04:33.750> isn't<00:04:33.960> half<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.680> oh

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
half but if the person isn't half the oh

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.540 
half but if the person isn't half the oh
I<00:04:35.610> don't<00:04:35.730> know<00:04:35.940> that<00:04:36.060> one<00:04:36.180> yeah<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.650> sometimes

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
I don't know that one yeah and sometimes

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.730 
I don't know that one yeah and sometimes
so<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.330> time<00:04:39.510> I<00:04:39.540> got<00:04:39.690> 99<00:04:39.990> instead<00:04:40.320> of<00:04:40.410> 100

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
so that time I got 99 instead of 100

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.100 
so that time I got 99 instead of 100
because<00:04:40.950> i<00:04:40.980> was<00:04:41.220> at<00:04:41.370> nine<00:04:41.850> seconds<00:04:42.540> instead<00:04:42.960> of

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
one of the cool things about it 155 is

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.720 
one of the cool things about it 155 is
the<00:05:22.290> square<00:05:22.500> i<00:05:22.530> got<00:05:22.740> you<00:05:22.890> can<00:05:23.010> get<00:05:23.100> up<00:05:23.160> to<00:05:23.250> 160

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
the square i got you can get up to 160

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.390 
the square i got you can get up to 160
plus<00:05:24.419> 40<00:05:24.930> and<00:05:25.110> then<00:05:25.260> this<00:05:25.560> is<00:05:25.740> a<00:05:25.770> bug<00:05:26.100> it's

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
plus 40 and then this is a bug it's

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.390 
plus 40 and then this is a bug it's
supposed<00:05:26.640> to<00:05:26.669> be<00:05:26.790> 100<00:05:27.300> right<00:05:27.450> there<00:05:28.160> but<00:05:29.160> so

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
supposed to be 100 right there but so

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.550 
supposed to be 100 right there but so
and<00:05:29.580> then<00:05:29.669> times<00:05:30.000> that<00:05:30.600> where<00:05:30.900> is<00:05:31.229> where<00:05:31.440> your

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
and then times that where is where your

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.969 
and then times that where is where your
multiply<00:05:31.830> would<00:05:32.010> come<00:05:32.130> in<00:05:32.280> so<00:05:32.910> 295<00:05:33.810> is<00:05:34.260> the

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
multiply would come in so 295 is the

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.150 
multiply would come in so 295 is the
score<00:05:35.190> i<00:05:35.280> got<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.700> top<00:05:35.940> score<00:05:36.090> you<00:05:36.330> can<00:05:36.570> get<00:05:36.810> is

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
score i got the top score you can get is

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.710 
score i got the top score you can get is
300<00:05:38.160> if<00:05:38.340> that<00:05:38.490> was<00:05:38.640> 160<00:05:39.150> that<00:05:39.479> would<00:05:39.600> equal

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
300 if that was 160 that would equal

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.890 
300 if that was 160 that would equal
three<00:05:40.050> hundred<00:05:40.530> and<00:05:41.150> you<00:05:42.150> can<00:05:42.300> share<00:05:42.540> this

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
three hundred and you can share this

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.840 
three hundred and you can share this
immediately<00:05:43.590> you<00:05:43.860> can<00:05:43.890> check<00:05:44.250> your<00:05:44.370> ranking

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
immediately you can check your ranking

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.390 
immediately you can check your ranking
as<00:05:44.970> you<00:05:45.090> can<00:05:45.210> see<00:05:45.419> how<00:05:46.320> close<00:05:46.800> were<00:05:47.070> you<00:05:47.130> guys

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
as you can see how close were you guys

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.820 
as you can see how close were you guys
in<00:05:47.460> each<00:05:48.090> round<00:05:48.419> and<00:05:49.350> everything<00:05:49.710> like<00:05:49.770> that

in each round and everything like that
you<00:05:50.430> can<00:05:50.580> see<00:05:50.850> the<00:05:51.350> questions<00:05:52.350> that<00:05:52.560> we're

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
you can see the questions that we're

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.100 
you can see the questions that we're
