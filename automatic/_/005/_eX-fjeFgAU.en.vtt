00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.339
 Hello everyone, Serge is burning in this 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:11.570
 month at all golyak empty was not 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:14.510
 In general, the video did not have options to shoot 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.050
 no parcels yet plus 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.410
 there is a big disease gone but just under 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:26.020
 the end of the month the parcel arrived with China 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:32.059
 I do not remember exactly what it is written headphones 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:34.159
 Now we will see it but the headphones are not 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.690
 think it's some kind of computer 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:47.929
 for phone no baba headphones over 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:50.329
 On the headset, I just could not say more 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.969
 that is why because they are very good 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.909
 Packed and then do not understand that just 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:59.839
 yes it's likely all headphones 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:07.180
 can still be such nonsense 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:16.430
 so oh yeah like i said this headset to 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:20.630
 we bite it is not glued tape can be seen 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.840
 but what about 360 and more boxing 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.189
 no any words clear 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:37.149
 written here it is not so tsiferka 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:42.380
 Ok so well here we see the site hp.com 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.980
 focuses does not focus until 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.790
 focuses 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:52.290
 but can the seller keep this store I 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.750
 I do not know shorter looked it that all 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.020
 we set aside very well packed 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:09.200
 did not break anything, we all box 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:11.780
 spent the night in general that the headphones 6 to gab 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.080
 ordering them on the 11th 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.950
 today 30 well, you can count and 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.500
 pretty quick came probably from 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.700
 China can not remember well, here they are 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.080
 proper xbox headset narrowly 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.710
 I do not know, I want to try on the computer 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:42.180
 connect so well here now look here 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:47.490
 connector here is the an-22 and 5 input here but then 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:50.670
 actually all on the computer I 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.660
 I will try if there will be some sound 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.260
 I will definitely do something 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.260
 addition to this video 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:10.230
 are here so that's one ear system the 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:14.390
 healing though i think that from the original 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:19.280
 too will not be anything too different 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:24.739
 Mikrofonchik here too type bends that whether 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:29.910
 Well , somehow it is so everything is clear 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.739
 weird fu then actually here in this and 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.600
 the essence 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.390
 is set to bears repeating 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.560
 over 120 rubles left although 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.470
 original as a set which 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.819
 buy this headset here well rubles 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.420
 700 will cost you 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:50.150
 so don't think that we have a difference here 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.560
 we can see what we have here 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:57.049
 turn on microphone off 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.400
 increase volume down to 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:04.790
 The posting looks certainly tiny 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.489
 A small aktara such a well 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.459
 that's all actually this is all to me 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.549
 has come 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:17.690
 I would like to make a small such relic 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.560
 what should soon come to me namely 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.450
 will come 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:27.110
 good cross special 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:29.990
 screwdriver for here these sura peaks and 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.820
 we will put here an improved cross 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.820
 at least try to do it 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.410
 how would we do modding? 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.720
 nevertheless decided to record the continuation of this 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:50.120
 video in general when connected 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.720
 gamepad of my headset and turning on ivan 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:57.229
 my computer immediately found 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:00.560
 headset and 2 360 for windows flipped over 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.460
 headset to so on we go panel 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.470
 of management 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:11.660
 I am recording exactly the sound that 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:16.039
 coming with this headset microphone here we are 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:19.820
 we can see right here I turned it off 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:22.000
 with our own microphone and here we can 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.700
 see what we choose 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.310
 we can right-click to use 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.180
 headset headphones 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:34.750
 I'll tell you right away the sound at all 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:37.390
 first man and secondly he sometimes is 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.690
 gives crack tick tick tick 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.720
 Well, in general, it is as if listening 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.780
 music you can not change not microphone 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:50.350
 I will not tell you, he is even very good though 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:56.530
 if you look at the properties here is the format 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:06:00.460
 by default it is extremely small but at the same time 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:05.080
 very good so peculiar sound and 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.810
 very comfortable so you can even clean 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.000
 because of the microphone 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.150
 if someone already has this headset and 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.130
 and she wants to use her tito microphone 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:22.000
 well, in principle, not bad 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:25.780
 I will certainly give you a four with a plus yes 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.940
 he really deserves it himself 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:35.160
 sound sound that comes from a mono headset 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.310
 because he is one well sound of course 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.710
 C grade 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:45.340
 This is such a petty C grade almost with 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:49.300
 minus but so i'm a microphone very much 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:53.650
 Liked but for communication water tank glory 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:56.020
 In principle, this will be enough for 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.330
 In this I would like to say goodbye to you and 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:03.340
