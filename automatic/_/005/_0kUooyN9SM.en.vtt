me<00:06:04.920> is<00:06:04.950> killing<00:06:05.400> spree<00:06:05.880> because<00:06:06.210> it<00:06:06.420> basically

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
me is killing spree because it basically

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.010 
me is killing spree because it basically
it's<00:06:07.740> not<00:06:08.100> even<00:06:08.580> the<00:06:09.030> fact<00:06:09.240> that<00:06:09.330> it<00:06:09.480> does<00:06:09.660> so

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
it's not even the fact that it does so

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.810 
it's not even the fact that it does so
high<00:06:10.260> damage<00:06:10.590> and<00:06:11.010> that<00:06:11.100> you<00:06:11.250> are<00:06:11.280> literally

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
high damage and that you are literally

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
and vulnerable when that's happening

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.400 
and vulnerable when that's happening
it's<00:06:14.160> the<00:06:14.340> fact<00:06:14.520> that<00:06:14.640> like<00:06:15.510> say<00:06:15.780> they<00:06:16.200> are

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
it's the fact that like say they are

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.400 
it's the fact that like say they are
killing<00:06:16.680> spraying<00:06:17.130> me<00:06:17.400> and<00:06:17.610> I<00:06:18.120> turn<00:06:18.390> around<00:06:18.420> to
