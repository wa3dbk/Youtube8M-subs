the<00:00:17.449> reason<00:00:17.840> that<00:00:17.869> we're<00:00:18.170> here<00:00:18.500> is<00:00:18.680> because<00:00:19.810> he

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
the reason that we're here is because he

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
Mexico and the reason it was so

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.410 
Mexico and the reason it was so
important<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.660> because<00:00:55.519> in<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:57.120> School<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
important is because in the School of

important is because in the School of
Medicine<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.460> realized<00:00:59.460> we<00:01:00.030> had<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.449> expand

our<00:01:01.050> class<00:01:04.220> I<00:01:05.220> enjoyed<00:01:05.970> visiting<00:01:06.270> with

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
our class I enjoyed visiting with

our class I enjoyed visiting with
Leonard<00:01:07.110> earlier<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.619> said<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.310> think<00:01:08.940> this<00:01:09.180> new

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
Leonard earlier I said I think this new

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.960 
Leonard earlier I said I think this new
anatomy<00:01:10.110> lab<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.369> quite<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> bit

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
anatomy lab is going to be quite a bit

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.740 
anatomy lab is going to be quite a bit
different<00:01:12.479> than<00:01:12.780> where<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.560> went<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:13.950> work<00:01:14.159> in

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
different than where you went to work in

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.200 
different than where you went to work in
1964<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.080> he<00:01:16.710> told<00:01:16.950> me<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.280> was<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> 7-up

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
1964 and he told me it was a 7-up

1964 and he told me it was a 7-up
bottling<00:01:18.380> plant<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.220> think<00:01:20.880> about<00:01:21.149> that<00:01:21.390> just

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
bottling plant and think about that just

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.460 
bottling plant and think about that just
think<00:01:22.259> about<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.970> contribution<00:01:24.470> starting

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
think about that contribution starting

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.710 
think about that contribution starting
that<00:01:25.649> right<00:01:25.979> here<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.490> look<00:01:27.060> what's<00:01:27.300> here<00:01:27.539> is

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that right here and look what's here is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.999 
that right here and look what's here is

you<00:01:53.640> really<00:01:53.849> would<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.390> made<00:01:54.660> if<00:01:55.259> you've

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
you really would have made if you've

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.150 
you really would have made if you've
ever<00:01:55.590> gone<00:01:55.830> into<00:01:55.890> electoral<00:01:56.550> politics<00:01:58.160> you
