00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.130
 hi my dear friends and subscribers 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.559
 Today I decided once again 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.460
 pamper you with Lego series designer 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.279
 marvel my favorite series are generally very 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.850
 love her and immediately without delay in 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.789
 the frame appears here is such a cool 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.939
 naborchik in principle he is not very big 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.740
 but he is awesome I think that for such 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.989
 small set this set is just 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.510
 perfect here logo lego series super 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.100
 heroes marvel 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.230
 here again from 6 to 12 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.600
 article 7600 8 as almost 007 there 008 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.300
 so here is a picture of an iron man and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.579
 the plot of this set develops in that 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.559
 iron man fights with his 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.260
 the enemy will consider the reverse side 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.430
 here are shown apparently the elements that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.199
 can shoot 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.930
 here it is shown that the little man can 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.570
 eject from such a car 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.549
 and it is shown that iron man 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.280
 the mask rises and hides under it 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.030
 face guess who tony of course 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.100
 stark and let's open by the way guys 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.890
 if you also like me like sets 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.920
 about superheroes type iron man 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.490
 or spider man I will advise you 1 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.470
 channel brian 88 there is an overview and 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.020
 left 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.329
 animations and much more 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.909
 the main thing is that there are reviews on 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.070
 superhero kits go in there 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.650
 put likes there comment everything 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.049
 and generally watch this dude he 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.840
 really make cool vidos by the way 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.149
 saying i know i need to click on 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.430
 this valve and then the box opens 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.880
 but in order not to damage the integrity 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.220
 I decided to just cut the boxes 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.070
 a knife of course I'm not very neat 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.280
 it turned out but nevertheless so at sea 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.840
 package 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:07.409
 small package like that 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.270
 what are some pieces of instruction 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.069
 like all 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.500
 Such is the detailed instruction how well 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.240
 always basically fucking gay taken everything by 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.040
 shelves 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.880
 why you ask me I decided to buy 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.250
 this set is basically dear 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.470
 for such a small naborchiki well 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.590
 I think everything is obvious set here 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.709
 really very cool and generally i adore 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.200
 just a series of superheroes generally think 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.940
 that some lego sets are expensive 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.030
 to compare with other sets 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.290
 but I think it's better to have on the shelf 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.340
 any favorite superhero 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.890
 than 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.380
 a simple cop think many 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.080
 i will agree i know fan league me 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.069
 may be disgraceful but I will share it 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.810
 your impression 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.140
 I've never had such a thing 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.819
 no matter how many guns you collect 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.140
 you always find something for yourself 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.060
 new and it can not but rejoice 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.540
 even on such a small machine you can 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.940
 to fit 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.269
 she looks so much cool 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.090
 very cool and detailed here will be 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.269
 sit enemy iron man or iron 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.840
 whatever you want to call him 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.150
 setting she fires and such 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.920
 two rackets here we can see 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.019
 pistol 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.150
 if suddenly this terrorist have to 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.180
 run then he can take with him 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.400
 gun and shoot back here too 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.420
 we can see something like that 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.530
 lasers shooting them I don’t know exactly 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.280
 maybe this 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.980
 laser and maybe you just throw a headlight who 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.130
 I know that's why the hose comes apparently 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.670
 gasoline ignites here 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.670
 and here is such a tongue of flame let's 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.739
 now I will show you how 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:01.079
 shoot rackets so always wanted it 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:04.940
 make aim oh well yes of course them 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.940
 it is necessary to beat straight like this 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.240
 somehow shoot but the box is not 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.250
 knocked down and maybe if I hit by 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.769
 stronger they knocked down that is try 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:20.799
 the main thing is not to lose it is not so 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.510
 that's a pity of course in the set was not 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.750
 spare because these parts usually 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.360
 usually lost of course the league could 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.240
 would put a couple of spare such 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.920
 rackets in a set of something and did not regret a 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.950
 let's now look at ours 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.040
 little people you probably already waited m 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.080
 like me so let's collect them and here 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.720
 she's a minifigure for which and 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.510
 this set is bought more 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.419
 iron man figure just 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.870
 awesome let's open masochka 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:55.210
 the iron man behind her is hiding us 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.669
 tony stark, too, with such a malicious 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.070
 facial expression as you can notice and 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.790
 he also has a second face now 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:07.690
 I will show it to you here 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:11.229
 aggressive what's failing there all is not 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:14.169
 nothing can be so there are print and 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.660
 back and front as well as on the feet 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.720
 very cool 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:22.030
 it's worth it and now i will translate it into 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.729
 martial status that is it like this 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.760
 Looks like such a full ammunition 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.220
 let's say it looks really very cool 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.530
 I really liked her right okay 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.630
 iron man fly away and in frame 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.300
 a second minifigure of this appears 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.330
 recruitment I never found out who I am 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.780
 rummaged about to tell 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.390
 but you never knew who that was 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.570
 when the peasant is bearded also in this 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.790
 peasant there are two faces he has 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.050
 here is such a face here we knew 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.460
 essence of being 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:59.050
 here are the bullet handkerchief railroad. 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.640
 sleeveless such guys write 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.620
 please in the comments what it is 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.450
 for a character I don’t know we don’t 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.300
 it will be really interesting to know who it is 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.640
 Here is such a set 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.070
 parts that were n't useful to us 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.590
 assembly spare 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.840
 This set costs 800 rubles and I think 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.740
 what is it a little expensive I would give it 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.870
 perhaps 600 700 rubles like that 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.790
 I want to rate this set 10 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.640
 points in principle the set is very playable 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.740
 there is a super hero and his enemy 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.660
 you can play so fly 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.910
 you can even shoot each other 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:39.550
 strict play if you haven't grown yet 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:48.180
 from this time I will try to shoot down 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:51.880
 of this scoundrel in ten 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.980
 ready for them killed but for today that's all
