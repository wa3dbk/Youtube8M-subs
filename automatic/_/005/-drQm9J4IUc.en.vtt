00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
ago and I was kind of underwhelmed with

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.270 
ago and I was kind of underwhelmed with
the<00:00:32.119> length<00:00:32.719> of<00:00:32.899> it<00:00:33.079> took<00:00:33.500> me<00:00:33.649> about<00:00:33.829> seven

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
the length of it took me about seven

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.770 
the length of it took me about seven
hours<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.699> complete<00:00:35.090> I've<00:00:35.239> heard<00:00:35.480> anywhere

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
hours to complete I've heard anywhere

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.440

from<00:00:35.899> six<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:36.350> eight<00:00:36.530> hours<00:00:36.680> is<00:00:37.010> kind<00:00:37.220> of<00:00:37.280> the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
from six to eight hours is kind of the

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.490 
from six to eight hours is kind of the
length<00:00:38.450> that<00:00:38.630> people<00:00:38.930> are<00:00:39.020> beating<00:00:39.170> it<00:00:39.380> in

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
length that people are beating it in

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.290 
length that people are beating it in
kind<00:00:39.980> of<00:00:40.100> depends<00:00:40.309> on<00:00:40.340> much<00:00:40.489> difficulty<00:00:40.970> playa

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
kind of depends on much difficulty playa

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.080 
kind of depends on much difficulty playa
I<00:00:41.540> played<00:00:41.750> at<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:41.960> normal<00:00:42.290> difficulty<00:00:42.880> and<00:00:43.880> I

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
I played at the normal difficulty and I

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.190 
I played at the normal difficulty and I
would<00:00:44.210> actually<00:00:44.450> recommend<00:00:44.540> playing<00:00:45.020> at<00:00:45.140> the

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
would actually recommend playing at the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.360 
would actually recommend playing at the
normal<00:00:45.410> difficulty<00:00:45.710> if<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:45.980> play<00:00:46.130> on<00:00:46.280> the

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
normal difficulty if you play on the

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.830 
normal difficulty if you play on the
higher<00:00:46.550> difficulties<00:00:47.180> you<00:00:47.390> have<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:47.690> use<00:00:47.809> a

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
higher difficulties you have to use a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.990 
higher difficulties you have to use a
lot<00:00:48.140> more<00:00:48.170> stealth<00:00:48.680> a<00:00:48.860> lot<00:00:49.010> more<00:00:49.219> of<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.879> bow

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
lot more stealth a lot more of the bow

on the harder difficulty in

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.709 
on the harder difficulty in
single-player<00:01:01.910> you<00:01:02.090> kind<00:01:02.239> of<00:01:02.270> have<00:01:02.449> to<00:01:02.480> take

single-player you kind of have to take

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.139 
single-player you kind of have to take
the<00:01:02.870> stealth<00:01:03.140> row<00:01:03.379> most<00:01:04.280> of<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.670> scenarios

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
the stealth row most of the scenarios

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.019 
the stealth row most of the scenarios
that<00:01:05.329> you<00:01:05.449> get<00:01:05.600> into<00:01:06.070> as<00:01:07.070> far<00:01:07.250> as<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.670> the

00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:08.029 
that you get into as far as the the

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:09.849 
that you get into as far as the the
characters<00:01:08.479> and<00:01:08.509> the<00:01:08.899> development<00:01:09.529> of<00:01:09.709> the

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
characters and the development of the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:11.980 
characters and the development of the
story<00:01:10.189> it<00:01:10.520> was<00:01:11.029> a<00:01:11.090> bit<00:01:11.329> better<00:01:11.509> than<00:01:11.719> I<00:01:11.810> think

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
story it was a bit better than I think

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.019 
story it was a bit better than I think
crisis<00:01:12.409> to<00:01:12.649> where<00:01:12.920> I<00:01:12.950> felt<00:01:13.249> like<00:01:13.429> I<00:01:13.639> didn't

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:14.029 
crisis to where I felt like I didn't

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:15.309 
crisis to where I felt like I didn't
really<00:01:14.119> know<00:01:14.270> what<00:01:14.299> was<00:01:14.509> going<00:01:14.779> on<00:01:14.869> I<00:01:15.079> didn't

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.319 
really know what was going on I didn't

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.199 
really know what was going on I didn't
really<00:01:15.409> care<00:01:15.679> what's<00:01:15.950> going<00:01:16.219> on<00:01:16.399> where<00:01:16.670> there

00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:17.209 
really care what's going on where there

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:18.789 
really care what's going on where there
was<00:01:17.359> some<00:01:17.630> slight<00:01:18.020> character<00:01:18.409> development

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
was some slight character development

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.330 
was some slight character development
and<00:01:19.159> some<00:01:19.909> slightly<00:01:20.689> emotional<00:01:21.109> cut<00:01:22.039> scenes

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
and some slightly emotional cut scenes

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.609 
and some slightly emotional cut scenes
from<00:01:22.670> crysis<00:01:23.209> 3<00:01:23.779> that<00:01:24.200> we<00:01:24.289> didn't<00:01:24.499> see<00:01:24.590> in

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
from crysis 3 that we didn't see in

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.260 
from crysis 3 that we didn't see in
Crysis<00:01:25.039> 2<00:01:25.069> and<00:01:25.579> we<00:01:25.670> didn't<00:01:25.849> really<00:01:25.969> see<00:01:26.060> in

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
Crysis 2 and we didn't really see in

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.149 
Crysis 2 and we didn't really see in
crisis<00:01:26.569> one<00:01:26.749> either<00:01:26.929> so<00:01:27.740> that<00:01:27.859> was<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:28.009> nice

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
crisis one either so that was a nice

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.410 
crisis one either so that was a nice
addition<00:01:28.399> I<00:01:28.639> think<00:01:28.819> they<00:01:28.880> did<00:01:28.999> a<00:01:29.029> really<00:01:29.270> good

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
addition I think they did a really good

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.929 
addition I think they did a really good
job<00:01:29.479> with<00:01:29.719> the<00:01:30.259> facial<00:01:30.590> animations<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:31.880> the

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
job with the facial animations and the

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.370 
job with the facial animations and the
graphics<00:01:32.119> as<00:01:32.419> a<00:01:32.450> whole<00:01:32.719> but<00:01:32.990> especially<00:01:33.109> the

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
graphics as a whole but especially the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.899 
graphics as a whole but especially the
facial<00:01:33.649> animations<00:01:34.099> and<00:01:34.279> suddenly<00:01:34.520> cutscenes

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
facial animations and suddenly cutscenes

this<00:01:53.209> series<00:01:53.419> it<00:01:53.599> was<00:01:53.779> an<00:01:53.899> open<00:01:54.169> world<00:01:54.349> you<00:01:54.679> had

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
this series it was an open world you had

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.589 
this series it was an open world you had
basically<00:01:55.669> an<00:01:55.819> objective<00:01:56.209> that<00:01:56.299> you<00:01:56.389> had<00:01:56.479> to

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599 
basically an objective that you had to

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.059 
basically an objective that you had to
get<00:01:56.719> to<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.049> you<00:01:57.109> could<00:01:57.259> take<00:01:57.439> any<00:01:57.709> direction

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
get to and you could take any direction

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.279 
get to and you could take any direction
any<00:01:58.489> path<00:01:58.729> that<00:01:59.359> would<00:01:59.599> lead<00:01:59.659> you<00:01:59.989> to<00:02:00.020> that

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
any path that would lead you to that

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.440 
any path that would lead you to that
area<00:02:00.529> and<00:02:00.859> that's<00:02:01.279> my<00:02:01.459> preferred<00:02:01.669> I<00:02:02.119> think

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
area and that's my preferred I think

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.569 
area and that's my preferred I think
style<00:02:03.259> of<00:02:03.499> game<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:03.799> like<00:02:04.039> the<00:02:04.159> open<00:02:04.429> world

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
style of game I like the open world

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.339 
style of game I like the open world
games<00:02:04.939> little<00:02:05.209> more<00:02:05.359> than<00:02:05.569> the<00:02:05.599> linear<00:02:05.989> games

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
games little more than the linear games

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:08.290 
games little more than the linear games
where<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:07.159> kind<00:02:07.369> of<00:02:07.489> have<00:02:07.939> these<00:02:08.060> set

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
where you kind of have these set

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.120 
where you kind of have these set
cutscenes<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.020> are<00:02:09.380> triggered<00:02:09.800> by<00:02:09.979> you

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
cutscenes that are triggered by you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.270 
cutscenes that are triggered by you
walking<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:10.759> this<00:02:10.940> area<00:02:11.300> in<00:02:12.200> crysis<00:02:12.829> 3<00:02:13.040> i<00:02:13.099> think

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
walking in this area in crysis 3 i think

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.890 
walking in this area in crysis 3 i think
is<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.370> mix<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.790> book<00:02:13.939> of<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.420> two<00:02:14.659> which<00:02:14.840> is

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
is a mix of the book of the two which is

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.730 
is a mix of the book of the two which is
a<00:02:15.049> at<00:02:15.530> least<00:02:15.769> better<00:02:16.040> than<00:02:16.159> crisis

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
a at least better than crisis

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.810 
a at least better than crisis
you<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.640> still<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.360> limited<00:02:18.990> range<00:02:19.320> of

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
you so you still have a limited range of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.380 
you so you still have a limited range of
exploration<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.910> know<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.090> game's<00:02:21.240> not

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
exploration you know the game's not

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.880 
exploration you know the game's not
completely<00:02:21.780> open<00:02:22.080> world<00:02:22.290> there's<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.710> lot<00:02:22.860> of

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
than crysis 2 i would have wished that

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.780 
than crysis 2 i would have wished that
the<00:02:55.050> gun<00:02:55.200> packed<00:02:55.500> they've<00:02:55.800> gone<00:02:56.070> back<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.520> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
the gun packed they've gone back to the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.660 
the gun packed they've gone back to the
original<00:02:57.180> crisis<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:58.500> given<00:02:58.920> us<00:02:59.040> more<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.550> an

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
original crisis and given us more of an

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.000 
original crisis and given us more of an
open<00:02:59.880> world<00:03:00.210> experience<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.350> think

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
open world experience that I think

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.760 
open world experience that I think
everybody<00:03:02.400> else<00:03:02.490> really<00:03:02.880> enjoyed<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.240> lot<00:03:03.480> more

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
everybody else really enjoyed a lot more

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.410 
everybody else really enjoyed a lot more

without giving away any spoilers just in

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:44.629 
without giving away any spoilers just in
case<00:05:43.469> there's<00:05:43.680> somebody<00:05:43.919> watching<00:05:44.039> it<00:05:44.310> hasn't

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
case there's somebody watching it hasn't

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.179

plated<00:05:44.939> or<00:05:45.120> and<00:05:45.270> plans<00:05:45.689> on<00:05:45.899> playing<00:05:46.050> it<00:05:46.349> but<00:05:46.979> i

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:47.189 
plated or and plans on playing it but i

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:48.529 
plated or and plans on playing it but i
think<00:05:47.430> i<00:05:47.460> was<00:05:47.580> a<00:05:47.610> little<00:05:47.789> bit<00:05:47.939> underwhelmed

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
think i was a little bit underwhelmed

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:49.939 
think i was a little bit underwhelmed
with<00:05:48.599> the<00:05:48.870> ending<00:05:49.110> was<00:05:49.259> kind<00:05:49.439> of<00:05:49.469> your<00:05:49.620> generic

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949 
with the ending was kind of your generic

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.850 
with the ending was kind of your generic

cliché saved the world type of ending

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.230 
cliché saved the world type of ending
and<00:05:53.990> the<00:05:54.990> very<00:05:55.229> ending<00:05:55.620> like<00:05:55.979> the<00:05:56.129> very<00:05:56.819> last

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
and the very ending like the very last

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.749 
and the very ending like the very last
cutscene<00:05:57.870> of<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.139> game<00:05:58.319> was<00:05:58.529> out<00:05:58.830> of<00:05:58.889> place<00:05:59.310> it

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
cutscene of the game was out of place it

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.309 
cutscene of the game was out of place it
felt<00:06:00.210> weird<00:06:00.529> not<00:06:01.529> only<00:06:02.159> was<00:06:02.339> it<00:06:02.370> like<00:06:02.729> how<00:06:03.689> does

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 
felt weird not only was it like how does

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:07.700 
felt weird not only was it like how does
that<00:06:04.439> work<00:06:04.680> but<00:06:05.370> also<00:06:05.580> it<00:06:06.210> the<00:06:06.449> CGI<00:06:06.990> or<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.680> the

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
way they rendered it and looked like the

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:10.939 
way they rendered it and looked like the
graphics<00:06:09.689> look<00:06:09.960> different<00:06:10.409> which<00:06:10.529> is<00:06:10.560> kind<00:06:10.919> of

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
graphics look different which is kind of

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.579

weird<00:06:11.099> so<00:06:11.399> yeah<00:06:12.330> the<00:06:12.539> ending<00:06:13.050> was<00:06:13.229> kind<00:06:13.560> of

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:13.589 
weird so yeah the ending was kind of

weird<00:06:13.919> is<00:06:14.370> all<00:06:14.580> I<00:06:14.610> can<00:06:14.759> say<00:06:15.060> it<00:06:15.210> was<00:06:15.330> kind<00:06:15.509> of

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:15.569 
weird is all I can say it was kind of

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:17.600 
weird is all I can say it was kind of
cliche<00:06:16.050> at<00:06:16.169> the<00:06:16.229> same<00:06:16.379> time<00:06:16.529> now<00:06:17.219> if<00:06:17.339> you<00:06:17.430> look

the reviews for this game most people
are<00:06:24.330> giving<00:06:24.449> it<00:06:24.629> anywhere<00:06:25.080> between<00:06:25.969> seventy

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969 
are giving it anywhere between seventy

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:29.450 
are giving it anywhere between seventy
and<00:06:27.000> eighty<00:06:27.479> five<00:06:27.810> with<00:06:28.289> the<00:06:28.620> average<00:06:28.949> i<00:06:29.250> think

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
and eighty five with the average i think

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.389 
and eighty five with the average i think
is<00:06:29.550> somewhere<00:06:29.819> between<00:06:30.199> 79<00:06:31.199> and<00:06:31.500> 82<00:06:31.800> depending

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:32.399 
is somewhere between 79 and 82 depending

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:33.620 
is somewhere between 79 and 82 depending
on<00:06:32.490> which<00:06:32.610> platform<00:06:33.089> you're<00:06:33.209> looking

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
on which platform you're looking

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.530 
on which platform you're looking
and<00:06:33.930> I<00:06:34.440> think<00:06:34.500> that's<00:06:34.770> a<00:06:34.920> fairly<00:06:35.130> good<00:06:35.540> rating

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
and I think that's a fairly good rating

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.260 
and I think that's a fairly good rating
for<00:06:37.500> the<00:06:37.800> the<00:06:38.340> single-player<00:06:38.730> campaign<00:06:39.240> I

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
for the the single-player campaign I

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.460 
for the the single-player campaign I
probably<00:06:39.810> give<00:06:39.930> the<00:06:40.050> single-player

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
probably give the single-player

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.790 
probably give the single-player
somewhere<00:06:40.920> between<00:06:41.070> a<00:06:41.220> 75<00:06:41.760> and<00:06:41.970> an<00:06:42.060> 80<00:06:42.440> out<00:06:43.440> of

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
somewhere between a 75 and an 80 out of

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.920 
somewhere between a 75 and an 80 out of
100<00:06:44.070> but<00:06:44.820> i<00:06:44.850> think<00:06:45.090> the<00:06:45.180> multiplayer<00:06:45.690> is

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
100 but i think the multiplayer is

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.410 
100 but i think the multiplayer is
really<00:06:46.230> where<00:06:46.410> this<00:06:46.560> game<00:06:46.920> is<00:06:47.220> strong<00:06:47.670> and<00:06:47.970> in

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420 
really where this game is strong and in

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.450 
really where this game is strong and in
my<00:06:49.050> multiplayer<00:06:49.560> review<00:06:50.010> which<00:06:50.190> i'll<00:06:50.310> put<00:06:50.430> a

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
my multiplayer review which i'll put a

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.650 
my multiplayer review which i'll put a
link<00:06:50.520> in<00:06:50.730> the<00:06:50.850> description<00:06:51.330> if<00:06:51.450> you<00:06:51.540> guys

haven't<00:06:51.840> seen<00:06:51.930> that<00:06:52.080> i<00:06:52.470> think<00:06:53.070> this<00:06:53.340> game

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
haven't seen that i think this game

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.640 
haven't seen that i think this game
really<00:06:53.910> leaps<00:06:54.420> ahead<00:06:54.600> of<00:06:55.050> some<00:06:55.380> of<00:06:55.440> the<00:06:55.530> other

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
really leaps ahead of some of the other

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.590 
really leaps ahead of some of the other
first-person<00:06:56.010> shooters<00:06:56.430> out<00:06:56.550> there<00:06:56.610> and

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
first-person shooters out there and

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.390 
first-person shooters out there and
makes<00:06:57.810> this<00:06:58.050> title<00:06:58.440> a<00:06:58.560> much<00:06:58.890> stronger

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
makes this title a much stronger

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.340 
makes this title a much stronger
purchase<00:06:59.940> then<00:07:00.150> if<00:07:00.330> it<00:07:00.480> was<00:07:00.570> just<00:07:00.600> a<00:07:00.930> similar

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.350 
purchase then if it was just a similar

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.040 
purchase then if it was just a similar
experience<00:07:01.800> but<00:07:02.100> yeah<00:07:02.640> overall<00:07:03.180> the<00:07:03.450> the<00:07:03.870> game

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
experience but yeah overall the the game

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.570 
experience but yeah overall the the game
maybe<00:07:04.260> isn't<00:07:04.500> worth<00:07:04.710> buying<00:07:04.950> just<00:07:05.370> for<00:07:05.490> the

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
maybe isn't worth buying just for the

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.370 
maybe isn't worth buying just for the
single<00:07:05.820> player<00:07:05.910> but<00:07:06.570> said<00:07:06.810> the<00:07:06.960> multiplayer

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
single player but said the multiplayer

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.500
