a super clean diet
this<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.810> excellent<00:02:19.200> because<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.710> get<00:02:19.830> in

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
this is excellent because you get in

this is excellent because you get in
like<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.280> said<00:02:20.580> no<00:02:21.000> grams<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.600> carbs<00:02:21.990> it's

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
like I said no grams of carbs it's

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.630 
like I said no grams of carbs it's
almost<00:02:22.560> pure<00:02:22.890> protein

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
almost pure protein

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.340 
almost pure protein
and<00:02:23.850> pretty<00:02:24.150> much<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.390> small<00:02:24.660> small<00:02:24.870> fast

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
and pretty much the small small fast

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.080 
and pretty much the small small fast
you'll<00:02:25.560> get<00:02:25.740> from<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.040> whey<00:02:26.160> protein<00:02:26.580> isolate

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
you'll get from a whey protein isolate

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.720 
you'll get from a whey protein isolate
so<00:02:27.660> anyone<00:02:28.200> can<00:02:28.410> use<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.740> pole<00:02:29.010> there<00:02:29.220> now

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
so anyone can use this pole there now

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.010 
so anyone can use this pole there now
you<00:02:29.820> may<00:02:29.910> look<00:02:30.090> at<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.300> price<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.540> thinking

you may look at the price and thinking
ah<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.470> little<00:02:31.650> bit<00:02:31.770> higher<00:02:31.950> than<00:02:32.220> what

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
ah this is a little bit higher than what

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.670 
ah this is a little bit higher than what
I'll<00:02:32.490> spend<00:02:32.880> on<00:02:33.090> my<00:02:33.240> normal<00:02:33.570> protein<00:02:33.960> chances

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
I'll spend on my normal protein chances

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.350 
I'll spend on my normal protein chances
are<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:35.100> because<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.640> protein<00:02:36.150> you're

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
are is because the protein you're
