 fantasy and fulfills koblet one of a kind 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.170

 The gates 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.590
 I say no to racism intolerance 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.239
 is not self-evident 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:46.610
 Tolerance must be lived 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:48.760
 Practices or contra our coat of arms stands 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.200
 for a cosmopolitan club 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.200
 we say no to racism 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.450
 dynamo tv is presented by 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.450
 Feldschlösschen 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.530
 I am satisfied, I think very well 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.270
 played and even good against the ball 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.160
 Respected a plan and if we can 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.130
 make a driver before 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.060
 We have a very good game I have 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.259
 always said when we are 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.960
 for that another fought that is 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.890
 easy on 13 games without a goal 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.170
 great so from striker to we there 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.329
 everyone works and is working for us 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.189
 very satisfied that is a heavy one 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.619
 the game will be known from the first minute 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.319
 We play at home 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.049
 full house derby in cottbus the 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.420
 are abroad have brought nothing 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.649
 did not win and we with the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.209
 David stood with his back to the wall 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.209
 the red lantern adopted overnight 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:07.579
 have now given up again and 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:10.519
 I just believe that we are just that 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:14.360
 intense in the last two weeks 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.989
 the games have worked for us too 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.319
 decide 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.340
 I think that was seen in the 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:27.829
 Fans with us how important that was 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:29.829
 feels very good and I know that 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:38.650
 I know what I say it was easy 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:41.200
 it was really obvious that work was going on 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.000
 I am very, very happy 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.299
 i know this is a lot of time instead of music 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.799
 made and not made there but me 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:54.109
 I knew I had to go for everything 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.549
 but had to be hard and hard 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.220
 you that is clear I am very very 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:04.160
 happy and three points too that she 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.520
 a lot of people have gone find that 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.270
 was important 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.800
 serbia has that he maintained at that 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:19.090
 even more important, they are three points 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:23.140
 Almost we have the gate so used to it 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.840
 and it was almost no better 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.410
 that you win single and the goal 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.090
 makes that makes that even more beautiful 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.400
 nonsense says you can so as by side 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.170
 push yes that's a topic I think 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.940
 that for him in particular but for 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.370
 us all as well as a relief 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:45.220
 that with the victory it will be 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:48.820
 of course the usual 12 games I am 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:55.570
 better now this benefiz and for 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:58.750
 After that I need trust that is 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:03.880
 not in the gate among the most important we 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:11.280
 play better susanne everything and that 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:11.280
 is not that hard for new players 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:22.070
 with this team and I finds 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.870
 Sad 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.810
 jürgen klopp also believes a lot yesterday 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.980
 said to run anyway a 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.570
 start shot only yesterday again 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.010
 It also started in Rostock 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.380
 some incidents of it 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.060
 I think that our fans are here today 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.950
 did not let provoke and that 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.050
 That's good and I think that for us 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.940
 also must apply so to continue 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.920
 as it made the fans a 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.750
 other thing about what they did 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.820
 in the phase just after the halftime wo 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.260
 we had a bit of a problem that was 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.360
 sensational tells me so far one thing 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.610
 relegationsspiels osnabrück recalls where 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.630
 really you have noticed the audience 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.610
 that was now a bit shaky 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:01.700
 and then by your side then past 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:05.090
 came the normal normal 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:09.560
 a few plays that but a gau 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.139
 with a bad cabin and a lot 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.580
 spoken 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:18.650
 that was important and we stayed 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.169
 with our stations that was that 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.280
 that was good what they do to me 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.470
 not really matter 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.020
 we are not important at all 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.509
 important are our fans and what the 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.770
 people have made there like the scream 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:36.139
 that was almost it again 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.699
 normal so annoying one was underneath that 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.919
 is so much fun and I'm glad that 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.669
 I 'll finally be there again 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.669
 was so right
