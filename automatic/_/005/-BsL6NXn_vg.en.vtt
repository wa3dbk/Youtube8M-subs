00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.199
 in the light 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.470
 physical readiness vitali 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.639
 hooks that their 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.989
 40 years 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.129
 it was hard to breathe 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.129
 don't even understand how to hit the enemy break 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.960
 but more relaxed was chatting with 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.960
 trader 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.550
 a hard forehand ceiling 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.789
 yes yes however 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.290
 in general of course 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.620
 Vitaly hooks 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.120
 good for sure 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.590
 stop the torment of the Polish boxer 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 in the police 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.170
 waste reception 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.510
 funded situation 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.010
 yes the speed of thought 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.510
 soon 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.870
 reactions and the speed of making the right 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.870
 making 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.460
 Vitaliy Klichko 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.659
 works much faster than all his 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.659
 rivals 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.070
 it is also one-sided 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.480
 beatings 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.040
 I just noticed just clothed 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.800
 sight 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.740
 Tomash Adamek who watched 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.740
 trip to the side 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.310
 In July, everything is there 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.070
 in my opinion it would be 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.110
 from the side 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.409
 but the referee has already stopped this fight 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.479
 nothing is capable 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.479
 to take 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.189
 to this everything went 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.279
 if there can be no objection I 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.159
 I guess, that 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.749
 what to expect also 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.319
 earring 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.319
 in strength of will 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.859
 it would be great 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.859
 such an outcome 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.989
 it was 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.609
 it was probably the hardest of his tests 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.769
 of life 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.769
 at least a boxing career 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.109
 but we remember that 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:02.059
 in battle against shannon briggs 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.369
 about the same, everything happened the same 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:09.539
 less shannon briggs came 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:11.329
 before the final gong 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.419
 however, he had to be hospitalized in 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:14.030
 its in
