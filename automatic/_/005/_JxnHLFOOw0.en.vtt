00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
series has really become well-received

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.730 
series has really become well-received
you<00:01:44.880> know<00:01:45.000> across<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.930> gamer<00:01:46.110> demographic

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
you know across the gamer demographic

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.380 
you know across the gamer demographic
but<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:47.970> wanted<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.240> give

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
but here we really wanted to give

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.580 
but here we really wanted to give
something<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.780> gamers<00:01:49.110> had<00:01:49.229> been<00:01:49.380> heavily

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
something that gamers had been heavily

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.109 
something that gamers had been heavily
asking<00:01:50.009> us<00:01:50.100> about<00:01:50.159> which<00:01:50.460> was<00:01:50.640> q<00:01:50.880> HD

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
asking us about which was q HD

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.899 
asking us about which was q HD
resolution<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:52.110> ultra-low<00:01:52.619> response<00:01:53.040> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
resolution that ultra-low response and

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.910 
resolution that ultra-low response and
how<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> achieve<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.869> actually<00:01:55.350> required<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
how to achieve that actually required a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.620 
how to achieve that actually required a
huge<00:01:56.280> amount<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.549> investment<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:57.180> panel

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
huge amount of investment this panel

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.749 
huge amount of investment this panel
didn't<00:01:58.200> exist<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:59.219> actually<00:01:59.549> had<00:01:59.640> two

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
didn't exist we actually had two

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.490 
didn't exist we actually had two
specially<00:02:00.210> develop<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.750> source<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.170> panel

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
specially develop and source the panel

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.670 
specially develop and source the panel
for<00:02:02.159> these<00:02:02.340> specifications<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.680> actually

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
for these specifications and actually

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.100 
for these specifications and actually
was<00:02:04.829> slightly<00:02:05.159> delayed<00:02:05.399> because<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.990> know

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
was slightly delayed because you know

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.440 
was slightly delayed because you know
about<00:02:07.619> 50<00:02:08.160> 60<00:02:08.310> %<00:02:08.789> into<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> course<00:02:09.330> of

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
about 50 60 % into the course of

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.449 
about 50 60 % into the course of
development<00:02:09.810> Nvidia<00:02:10.349> told<00:02:10.590> us<00:02:10.679> g-sync<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
development Nvidia told us g-sync and

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.490 
development Nvidia told us g-sync and
all<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.450> sudden<00:02:12.660> we<00:02:12.720> said<00:02:12.900> hey<00:02:13.050> that's<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
all of a sudden we said hey that's the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.820 
all of a sudden we said hey that's the
only<00:02:13.680> good

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
only good

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.920 
only good
make<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.760> much<00:02:14.940> sweeter<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:15.840> it

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
make this that much sweeter but it

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.810 
make this that much sweeter but it
required<00:02:16.260> even<00:02:16.410> more<00:02:16.710> time<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.070> optimize<00:02:17.250> and

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
required even more time to optimize and

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.220 
required even more time to optimize and
design<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.360> work<00:02:18.480> with<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> panel<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.110> get

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
design and work with the panel to get

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.600 
design and work with the panel to get
logistically<00:02:19.770> everything<00:02:20.220> working<00:02:20.460> right

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
logistically everything working right

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.120 
logistically everything working right
and<00:02:21.540> we<00:02:22.110> still<00:02:22.320> also<00:02:22.440> wanted<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.800> ensure<00:02:23.100> that

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
and we still also wanted to ensure that

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.620 
and we still also wanted to ensure that
we<00:02:23.280> had<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.490> great<00:02:23.670> experience<00:02:23.790> regardless<00:02:24.420> if

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
we had a great experience regardless if

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.630 
we had a great experience regardless if
you<00:02:24.720> were<00:02:24.810> an<00:02:24.900> AMD<00:02:25.140> user<00:02:25.380> or<00:02:25.620> an<00:02:25.710> Nvidia<00:02:26.040> g-sync

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
you were an AMD user or an Nvidia g-sync

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.330 
you were an AMD user or an Nvidia g-sync
I<00:02:27.060> think<00:02:27.270> is<00:02:27.450> an<00:02:27.660> absolute<00:02:28.080> game<00:02:28.260> changer<00:02:28.340> if

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
I think is an absolute game changer if

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.920 
I think is an absolute game changer if
you're<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.610> first-person<00:02:30.090> shooter<00:02:30.300> guy<00:02:30.690> and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
you're a first-person shooter guy and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.540 
you're a first-person shooter guy and
you're<00:02:31.350> looking<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.770> absolute<00:02:31.920> best<00:02:32.370> in

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
you're looking for the absolute best in

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.550 
you're looking for the absolute best in
terms<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.850> response<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:34.050> an<00:02:34.260> overall

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
terms of response and an overall

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.990 
terms of response and an overall
fluidity<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.160> gameplay<00:02:35.430> but<00:02:35.700> at<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.880> same

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
fluidity in gameplay but at the same

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.610 
fluidity in gameplay but at the same
time<00:02:36.240> for<00:02:36.540> taking<00:02:36.810> advantage<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.350> latest

the ultimate gaming monitor now you guys

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.430 
the ultimate gaming monitor now you guys
can't<00:02:58.110> really<00:02:58.230> see<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:59.490> monitor<00:02:59.910> here<00:03:00.090> is

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
can't really see it this monitor here is

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.810 
can't really see it this monitor here is
centering<00:03:01.440> really<00:03:01.950> really<00:03:02.160> bad<00:03:02.340> I'm<00:03:02.520> sure<00:03:02.700> the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
centering really really bad I'm sure the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.920 
centering really really bad I'm sure the
camera<00:03:03.060> can't<00:03:03.240> pick<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.420> up<00:03:03.570> but<00:03:03.720> this<00:03:03.870> is

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
camera can't pick it up but this is

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.630 
camera can't pick it up but this is
smooth<00:03:04.680> as<00:03:04.860> glass<00:03:04.890> right<00:03:05.220> here<00:03:05.340> now<00:03:05.430> what's

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
smooth as glass right here now what's

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.830 
smooth as glass right here now what's
powering<00:03:06.030> these<00:03:06.120> monitors<00:03:06.450> right<00:03:06.570> now<00:03:06.720> this

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
powering these monitors right now this

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.330 
powering these monitors right now this
resolution<00:03:07.110> they're<00:03:07.800> actually<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.130> same

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
resolution they're actually the same

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.949 
resolution they're actually the same
exact<00:03:08.670> systems<00:03:09.209> here<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:09.570> we've<00:03:09.720> got<00:03:09.750> of

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
exact systems here so we've got of

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840

the the frame rate differential that is

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.810 
the the frame rate differential that is

that's<00:03:38.730> IPS<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:40.050> that<00:03:40.620> was<00:03:40.709> another<00:03:40.890> question

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
that's IPS and that was another question

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.280 
that's IPS and that was another question
I<00:03:41.280> asked<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.580> that<00:03:41.610> IPS<00:03:42.060> what<00:03:42.720> was<00:03:42.900> asked<00:03:43.230> of

I asked is that IPS what was asked of

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.199 
I asked is that IPS what was asked of
and<00:03:43.739> it's<00:03:43.860> it's<00:03:44.100> not<00:03:44.310> IPS<00:03:44.670> because<00:03:44.850> once<00:03:45.000> again

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
and it's it's not IPS because once again

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.550 
and it's it's not IPS because once again
like<00:03:45.330> I<00:03:45.420> said<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.690> be<00:03:45.780> able<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:45.959> meet<00:03:46.200> all<00:03:46.380> the

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
truly prefer a TN panel over IPS at

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.750 
truly prefer a TN panel over IPS at
least<00:04:04.410> from<00:04:04.500> my<00:04:04.620> experience<00:04:04.650> IPS<00:04:05.489> if<00:04:05.640> you're

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
least from my experience IPS if you're

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.330 
least from my experience IPS if you're
doing<00:04:05.880> video<00:04:06.390> production<00:04:06.570> photography<00:04:07.350> you

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
doing video production photography you

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.800 
doing video production photography you
want<00:04:08.580> that<00:04:08.760> cut<00:04:09.000> that<00:04:09.150> accurate<00:04:09.630> color

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
want that cut that accurate color

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.210 
want that cut that accurate color
correction<00:04:10.230> but<00:04:10.380> a<00:04:10.410> lot<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.590> people<00:04:10.769> gamers

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
correction but a lot of people gamers

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.030 
correction but a lot of people gamers
want<00:04:11.519> their<00:04:11.700> their<00:04:12.090> colors<00:04:12.390> to<00:04:12.570> pop<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:13.080> TN

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040

panels<00:04:14.370> seem<00:04:14.519> to<00:04:14.610> be<00:04:14.700> really<00:04:14.850> widely<00:04:15.150> accepted

so<00:04:16.019> yeah<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.769> think<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:17.220> think<00:04:17.489> that's<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.729> other

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
so yeah I think I think that's the other

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.969 
so yeah I think I think that's the other
thing<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.030> know<00:04:18.180> I'm<00:04:18.630> definitely<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.410> prosumer

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
thing you know I'm definitely a prosumer

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.070 
thing you know I'm definitely a prosumer
you<00:04:20.250> know<00:04:20.340> I've<00:04:20.459> got<00:04:20.609> IPS<00:04:21.000> I've<00:04:21.150> got<00:04:21.299> TN<00:04:21.570> both

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
you know I've got IPS I've got TN both

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.990 
you know I've got IPS I've got TN both
of<00:04:22.289> them<00:04:22.410> but<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.160> know<00:04:23.250> we<00:04:23.400> did<00:04:23.550> spend<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:23.850> lot

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
of them but you know we did spend a lot

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.850 
of them but you know we did spend a lot
of<00:04:24.120> work<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.390> actually<00:04:24.810> have<00:04:24.930> this<00:04:25.050> be<00:04:25.229> a<00:04:25.260> very

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.320 
of work to actually have this be a very
very<00:04:26.130> good<00:04:26.280> quality<00:04:26.490> performing

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
very good quality performing

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.899 
very good quality performing
it's<00:04:27.870> comparable<00:04:28.289> to<00:04:28.379> an<00:04:28.560> IPS<00:04:29.220> based<00:04:29.460> display

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:29.909 
it's comparable to an IPS based display

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:31.399 
it's comparable to an IPS based display
in<00:04:30.030> terms<00:04:30.060> of<00:04:30.360> its<00:04:30.479> color<00:04:30.659> reproduction<00:04:31.259> it's

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
in terms of its color reproduction it's

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.230 
in terms of its color reproduction it's
addressing<00:04:31.889> its<00:04:32.039> tonality<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:33.060> definitely

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
addressing its tonality and I definitely

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.969 
addressing its tonality and I definitely
feel<00:04:33.569> that<00:04:33.629> anybody<00:04:34.050> that's<00:04:34.319> been<00:04:34.590> really

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
feel that anybody that's been really

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
satisfied with our VG series of panels

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.230 
satisfied with our VG series of panels
is<00:04:37.080> gonna<00:04:37.590> be<00:04:37.740> even<00:04:37.919> more<00:04:38.520> impressed<00:04:38.879> by<00:04:39.030> what

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
is gonna be even more impressed by what

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.610 
is gonna be even more impressed by what
the<00:04:39.360> quality<00:04:39.690> that<00:04:39.720> we<00:04:39.870> have<00:04:39.900> with<00:04:40.169> this<00:04:40.289> panel

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
the quality that we have with this panel

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.830 
the quality that we have with this panel
so<00:04:40.650> I<00:04:41.009> definitely<00:04:41.550> think<00:04:42.060> that<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.720> know

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
so I definitely think that you know

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.990 
so I definitely think that you know
don't<00:04:43.169> be<00:04:43.379> worried<00:04:43.770> that<00:04:43.979> it's<00:04:44.310> not<00:04:44.490> an<00:04:44.610> IPS

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
don't be worried that it's not an IPS

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.490 
don't be worried that it's not an IPS
you<00:04:45.240> know<00:04:45.389> if<00:04:45.599> you're<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:45.780> hundred<00:04:46.020> percent<00:04:46.139> an

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
you know if you're a hundred percent an

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.589 
you know if you're a hundred percent an
absolute<00:04:46.949> diehard<00:04:47.580> guy<00:04:47.729> in<00:04:48.000> terms<00:04:48.389> of<00:04:48.539> the

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
absolute diehard guy in terms of the

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.570 
absolute diehard guy in terms of the
absolute<00:04:49.020> best<00:04:49.289> color<00:04:49.560> reproduction<00:04:50.159> the

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
absolute best color reproduction the

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.219 
absolute best color reproduction the
best<00:04:50.789> plaque<00:04:51.030> levels<00:04:51.360> then<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:51.810> course<00:04:51.990> we

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
best plaque levels then of course we

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.899 
best plaque levels then of course we
still<00:04:52.440> have<00:04:52.560> great<00:04:52.740> IPS<00:04:53.190> base<00:04:53.370> panels<00:04:53.729> and

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
still have great IPS base panels and

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.700 
still have great IPS base panels and
we've<00:04:54.270> got<00:04:54.419> evenly<00:04:54.720> got<00:04:54.840> other<00:04:55.080> panels<00:04:55.590> that

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
we've got evenly got other panels that

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.920 
we've got evenly got other panels that
aren't<00:04:55.949> IPS<00:04:56.340> based<00:04:56.580> like<00:04:56.819> the<00:04:57.180> 4k<00:04:57.539> panel<00:04:57.840> that

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
aren't IPS based like the 4k panel that

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.020 
aren't IPS based like the 4k panel that
we<00:04:57.990> were<00:04:58.080> talking<00:04:58.259> about<00:04:58.319> earlier<00:04:58.520> that<00:04:59.520> you

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
we were talking about earlier that you

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.520 
we were talking about earlier that you
always<00:05:00.240> want<00:05:00.479> to<00:05:00.509> keep<00:05:00.629> in<00:05:00.780> mind<00:05:00.930> that<00:05:01.080> the

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
always want to keep in mind that the

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.020 
always want to keep in mind that the
panel<00:05:01.889> is<00:05:02.039> only<00:05:02.190> one<00:05:02.460> part<00:05:02.699> of<00:05:02.759> the<00:05:02.819> process

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
panel is only one part of the process

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.119 
panel is only one part of the process
there's<00:05:03.599> things<00:05:03.870> like<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.530> electronics

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 
there's things like the electronics

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:06.920 
there's things like the electronics
package<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.789> firmware<00:05:06.000> tuning<00:05:06.419> that<00:05:06.750> all

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
package the firmware tuning that all

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.990 
package the firmware tuning that all
affect<00:05:07.229> image<00:05:07.469> quality<00:05:07.620> as<00:05:07.860> well<00:05:08.009> so<00:05:08.340> panel

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
affect image quality as well so panel

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.149 
affect image quality as well so panel
gets<00:05:09.389> you<00:05:09.599> a<00:05:09.629> certain<00:05:10.020> percentage<00:05:10.440> there<00:05:10.740> but

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
gets you a certain percentage there but

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.200 
gets you a certain percentage there but
there's<00:05:11.310> always<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.580> bit<00:05:11.789> more<00:05:12.000> to<00:05:12.180> the

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
there's always a bit more to the

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.209 
there's always a bit more to the
layering<00:05:12.449> process<00:05:12.690> so<00:05:13.080> don't<00:05:13.289> always<00:05:13.409> just<00:05:13.710> go

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:14.219 
layering process so don't always just go

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:15.800 
layering process so don't always just go
by<00:05:14.400> that<00:05:14.550> baseline<00:05:14.909> specification<00:05:15.599> there's<00:05:15.750> a

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
by that baseline specification there's a

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.659 
by that baseline specification there's a
lot<00:05:15.960> more<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.289> the<00:05:16.379> process<00:05:16.710> right<00:05:17.069> it<00:05:17.400> is<00:05:17.639> a

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
lot more to the process right it is a

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.309 
lot more to the process right it is a
whole<00:05:18.090> there's<00:05:18.659> a<00:05:18.719> whole<00:05:18.900> world<00:05:19.110> when<00:05:19.229> it

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 
whole there's a whole world when it

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.480 
whole there's a whole world when it
comes<00:05:19.349> to<00:05:19.560> monitors<00:05:19.919> and<00:05:20.069> it's<00:05:20.190> more<00:05:20.370> than

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
comes to monitors and it's more than

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.709 
comes to monitors and it's more than
just<00:05:20.669> what<00:05:20.789> you<00:05:20.819> see<00:05:20.940> on<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.270> spec<00:05:21.509> sheet

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
just what you see on the spec sheet

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.570 
just what you see on the spec sheet
because<00:05:21.870> you<00:05:22.349> can<00:05:22.500> have<00:05:22.590> identical<00:05:23.250> monitors

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
because you can have identical monitors

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.770 
because you can have identical monitors
from<00:05:23.639> two<00:05:23.849> different<00:05:24.120> brands<00:05:24.300> with<00:05:24.449> identical

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
from two different brands with identical

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.439 
from two different brands with identical
specs<00:05:25.080> that<00:05:25.199> look<00:05:25.409> completely<00:05:25.800> different

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
specs that look completely different

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.939 
specs that look completely different
source<00:05:27.449> panel<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:28.139> you<00:05:28.379> can<00:05:28.530> have<00:05:28.650> different

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
source panel and you can have different

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.920 
source panel and you can have different
pictures<00:05:29.069> and<00:05:29.310> different<00:05:29.759> response<00:05:30.150> due<00:05:30.780> to
