00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
and all those other maps you can

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.130 
and all those other maps you can
actually<00:01:02.969> do<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.239> except<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> most

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
actually do that except it's the most

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.630 
actually do that except it's the most
expensive<00:01:04.379> perk<00:01:04.799> coming<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.220> at<00:01:05.339> four

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640

expensive perk coming in at four
thousand<00:01:06.270> points<00:01:06.750> which<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> lot<00:01:08.180> it's<00:01:09.180> H<00:01:09.830> so

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
thousand points which is a lot it's H so

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.219 
thousand points which is a lot it's H so
