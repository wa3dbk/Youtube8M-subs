sensors on the below they are coming
here<00:00:17.420> this<00:00:18.380> enables<00:00:18.980> us<00:00:19.100> to<00:00:19.160> switch<00:00:19.460> between

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
here this enables us to switch between

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.870 
here this enables us to switch between

you<00:01:15.090> want<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> find<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.690> phone<00:01:15.930> where<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.229> is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
you want to find your phone where it is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.780 
you want to find your phone where it is
in<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.850> neighborhood

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.240 

and<00:01:21.850> we<00:01:22.240> have<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.540> other<00:01:22.720> apps<00:01:22.900> on<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.170> device

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
and we have the other apps on the device

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.690 
and we have the other apps on the device
one<00:01:24.250> of<00:01:24.370> them<00:01:24.490> is<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.700> weather<00:01:24.880> app

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
one of them is the weather app

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.190 
one of them is the weather app
you<00:01:27.149> can<00:01:27.270> configure<00:01:27.570> some<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> weather

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you can configure some of the weather

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.990 
you can configure some of the weather
settings<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> phone<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.219> once<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.820> set

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
settings on the phone and once you set

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.399 
settings on the phone and once you set
them<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.450> get<00:01:30.630> synchronized<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.289> this

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
them up they get synchronized and this

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.210 
them up they get synchronized and this
keeps<00:01:31.590> refreshing<00:01:31.920> video

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
keeps refreshing video

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.000 
keeps refreshing video
and<00:01:33.820> similarly<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.360> stocks<00:01:34.630> at

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.210 

so<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.520> stocks<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.390> stops<00:01:40.220> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
so the stocks have that just stops the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.160 
so the stocks have that just stops the
way<00:01:41.340> I've<00:01:41.460> set<00:01:41.640> up<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.850> my<00:01:41.970> devices<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.810> could

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
way I've set up on my devices I could

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.340 
way I've set up on my devices I could
run<00:01:43.380> multiple<00:01:43.740> apps<00:01:44.390> by<00:01:45.390> selecting<00:01:46.020> favorite

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
run multiple apps by selecting favorite

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.010 
run multiple apps by selecting favorite
I<00:01:46.440> was<00:01:46.650> it<00:01:47.150> and<00:01:48.150> have<00:01:48.390> them<00:01:48.540> running<00:01:48.750> all<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
I was it and have them running all the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.460 
I was it and have them running all the
time<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.830> way<00:01:49.980> i<00:01:50.010> could<00:01:50.750> have<00:01:51.750> those<00:01:52.020> apps

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
time so that way i could have those apps

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.550 
time so that way i could have those apps
readily<00:01:53.070> available<00:01:53.340> quick<00:01:53.820> access<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.560> what

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
readily available quick access and what

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.780 
readily available quick access and what
i'm<00:01:55.710> using<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.190> mostly<00:01:57.030> working<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.510> my

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
to go into my communications app and

to go into my communications app and
send<00:03:22.610> it<00:03:22.760> text<00:03:22.970> message<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.390> myself

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.750 

so<00:03:33.440> that<00:03:33.620> message<00:03:33.920> is<00:03:34.040> sent<00:03:34.280> back<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.490> me

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
so that message is sent back to me

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.980 
so that message is sent back to me
itself<00:03:35.180> right<00:03:35.360> so<00:03:35.540> we've<00:03:35.630> been<00:03:35.660> through<00:03:35.810> the

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990
