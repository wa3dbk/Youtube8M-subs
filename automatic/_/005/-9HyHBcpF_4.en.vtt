00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.650
 bloody and warlike is also the 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.269
 verification that ubisoft montreal 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.699

 parkour who have made great to altair is 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.550

 offers us the evolution of the ampil engine 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.760
 next is greater than the total of islands 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.620
 seen in black flag and that's not all 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.330
 in this game it has already been promised that no 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.760
 there will be no kind of trap when it comes to 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.400
 represent dimensions the buildings 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.080
 monuments and other constructions 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.880
 they will maintain a real proportion in addition to 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.530
 an artistic style that seems almost 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.869
 taken from the best paintings that 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.119
 they portrayed that difficult time all 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.840
 this must have taken its time but how much 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.840
 exactly 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.930
 the director's 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.000
 riots and murders in the street 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.040
 with up to a thousand passersby wandering 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.920
 each endowed with his own conduct 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.840
 this is what you will see arno dorian our 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.240
 new protagonist in a delivery that 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.640
 puts us in the midst of the French Revolution and 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.800
 is completely nexgen not only in what 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.690
 graphic but also in the playable it 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.550
 add new features in navigation with the 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.390
 possibility of descending based on a 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.820
 greater control 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.070
 stealth is improved until sam appears 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.200
 fisher in motion and the fight is 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.200
 enriches thanks to a new blade 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.849
 now we can enter buildings without 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.170
 that there is a time to load the whole 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.970
 of activities shows us 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.860
 directly in game so that we do not 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.810
 worry about nothing and if we prefer 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.970
 we can find missions with only 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.770
 appreciate how a crowd crowds 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.930
 suddenly at a point until we can 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.989
 save them in a list and leave them for 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.790
 then more dynamic so is an assassin's 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.430
 believe that he focuses his proposal on another 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.170
 aspect the online cooperative we know 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.040
 which is for four people but as 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.040
 we access him 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.190
 be that as it may each player always 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.200
 you will see how to ar not so that the plot will never 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.970
 lose your sense of fact it seems that 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.069
 the main missions may not 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.110
 be done in the company ubisoft has devised 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.849
 a series of specific tasks with your 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.280
 own story for us to enjoy 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.620
 together with friends this opens an endless 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.799
 playable opportunities making unity 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.110
 a really ambitious title that yes we 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.360
 we are without competitive multiplayer to 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.069
 less at the moment so much revolution had to 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.069
 have your particular scapegoat 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.630
 the video game will try to find the 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.030
 1080p and 60 frames per second in a 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.010
 entirely new generation design and 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.660
 the improvement of parkour technique together 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.910
 to the unprecedented level of collaboration that 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.160
 empowers the cooperative game opens all 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.830
 a window of innovative murders in 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.050
 a time the late 18th century that 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.000
 promises to thrill us like few the 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.100
 France's future is at stake and 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.320
 community we can save it one more time 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.410
 of the Templars liberté égalité 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.300
