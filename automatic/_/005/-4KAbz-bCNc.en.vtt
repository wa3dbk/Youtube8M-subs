00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello to the video on the topic 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.349
 analysis of disposals 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.839
 We'll first ask you a question 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.209
 pedigrees are and why this line 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.879
 After that, learn how to get one 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.199
 family tree created 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.400
 then we go to the analysis of 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.679
 trunk trees 1 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.420
 you will be able to 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:25.779
 distinguish whether a rather departure 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:31.240
 dominant or pacifist and autosomal autosomal 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.730
 or the same time it is with a family tree 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.930
 Relationships can be found 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.280
 show 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.590
 furthermore you go to the presentation of the 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.010
 occurrences of a specific feature in 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.929
 a family 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.660
 This can be done especially for the analysis 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.339
 of inheritance of a certain feature 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.699
 for example, from a newly discovered 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.870
 use disease 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.809
 that is why pedigrees are in the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.949
 genetic counseling important to 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.989
 Example for calculating the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.760
 Probability that the offspring 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.769
 from a hereditary disease in one 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.769
 family is often affected 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.850
 when creating a family tree 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.500
 used the same international symbols 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.300
 the sex is symbolized in the 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.910
 a circle for female and in 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.680
 Squares of males take that 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.780
 you can memorize very easily if you 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.090
 then you realize that the women are more 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.510
 have female curves and men 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.070
 rather edgy are built 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.510
 the presence of the missing one 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.720
 feature is as follows 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.210
 symbolizes the empty circles and 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.670
 squares indicate that the 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.350
 person that certain features are not enough 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.340
 shapes out the complete movie and 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.820
