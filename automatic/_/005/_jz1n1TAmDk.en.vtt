00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
suppressing internal reflections so you

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.399 
suppressing internal reflections so you
really<00:02:49.340> get<00:02:49.519> great<00:02:50.329> contrast<00:02:50.959> and<00:02:51.170> great

warm air and cold binoculars in winter

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.470 
warm air and cold binoculars in winter
let's<00:03:42.260> say<00:03:42.409> there<00:03:43.159> is<00:03:43.190> no<00:03:43.459> internal<00:03:44.150> fogging

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
let's say there is no internal fogging

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.460 
let's say there is no internal fogging
due<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.139> this<00:03:45.290> it's<00:03:45.829> a<00:03:46.040> really<00:03:46.579> great<00:03:46.669> feature

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
due to this it's a really great feature

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.379 
due to this it's a really great feature
since<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.799> binoculars<00:03:49.220> are<00:03:49.430> filled<00:03:49.669> with<00:03:49.760> dry

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
since the binoculars are filled with dry

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.180 
since the binoculars are filled with dry
nitrogen<00:03:50.810> there<00:03:51.109> is<00:03:51.199> also<00:03:51.379> no<00:03:51.650> internal

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
nitrogen there is also no internal

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.210 
nitrogen there is also no internal
fogging<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.239> they<00:03:53.389> are<00:03:53.449> also<00:03:53.599> waterproof

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
fogging and they are also waterproof

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.020 
fogging and they are also waterproof
they<00:03:55.220> have<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.430> magnesium<00:03:56.419> housing<00:03:57.079> and<00:03:58.030> that

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
they have a magnesium housing and that

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.629 
they have a magnesium housing and that
means<00:03:59.239> that<00:03:59.359> they're<00:03:59.540> really<00:03:59.720> reliable<00:04:00.639> what

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
means that they're really reliable what

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.210 
means that they're really reliable what
is<00:04:01.760> really<00:04:02.030> special<00:04:02.449> is<00:04:02.569> also<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.220> focusing

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
is really special is also the focusing

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.030 
is really special is also the focusing
system<00:04:04.609> which<00:04:04.940> is<00:04:05.090> made<00:04:05.209> out<00:04:05.269> of<00:04:05.449> titanium<00:04:06.040> so

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
system which is made out of titanium so

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.300 
system which is made out of titanium so
it<00:04:07.819> works<00:04:08.180> nicely<00:04:08.629> at<00:04:09.049> all<00:04:09.290> temperatures<00:04:09.739> and

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
it works nicely at all temperatures and

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.180 
it works nicely at all temperatures and
in<00:04:11.180> all<00:04:11.359> conditions<00:04:11.629> you<00:04:12.049> can<00:04:12.229> imagine<00:04:12.409> it

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
in all conditions you can imagine it

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.969 
in all conditions you can imagine it
always<00:04:13.400> works<00:04:13.909> perfectly<00:04:14.629> the<00:04:14.979> focusing

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:15.979 
always works perfectly the focusing

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.649 
always works perfectly the focusing
mechanism<00:04:16.070> is<00:04:16.579> one<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.209> best<00:04:17.419> in<00:04:17.570> the

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:17.659 
mechanism is one of the best in the

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:20.349 
mechanism is one of the best in the
market<00:04:17.810> it's<00:04:18.680> really<00:04:18.919> great<00:04:19.099> and<00:04:19.400> everything

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
market it's really great and everything

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.849 
market it's really great and everything
probably<00:04:20.720> starts<00:04:21.019> with<00:04:21.169> a<00:04:21.199> great<00:04:21.409> material

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
probably starts with a great material

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:28.480 
probably starts with a great material

similar<00:05:23.750> demo<00:05:24.290> model<00:05:24.530> which<00:05:25.370> was<00:05:25.550> which<00:05:25.940> was

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
similar demo model which was which was

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.620 
similar demo model which was which was
submerged<00:05:26.900> into<00:05:27.520> cold<00:05:28.520> water<00:05:28.790> and<00:05:29.030> later<00:05:29.330> eyes

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
submerged into cold water and later eyes

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.980 
submerged into cold water and later eyes
and<00:05:30.020> then<00:05:30.860> when<00:05:31.250> we<00:05:31.370> tested<00:05:31.760> the<00:05:32.150> focusing<00:05:32.840> it

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
and then when we tested the focusing it

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.630

still worked the same even at minus 20

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.130 
still worked the same even at minus 20
so<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:38.240> build<00:05:38.450> quality<00:05:38.690> is<00:05:38.930> really
