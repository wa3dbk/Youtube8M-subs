00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
the launch issues and then still decided

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.150 
the launch issues and then still decided
to<00:04:20.359> buy<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:20.539> game<00:04:20.840> although<00:04:21.349> personally<00:04:21.769> I'd

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
to buy the game although personally I'd

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.499 
to buy the game although personally I'd
still<00:04:22.520> know<00:04:22.639> a<00:04:22.669> few<00:04:22.940> people<00:04:23.150> who<00:04:23.210> have<00:04:23.330> done

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:23.509 
still know a few people who have done

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.409 
still know a few people who have done
that<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:24.370> no<00:04:25.370> I'd<00:04:25.669> say<00:04:25.849> you<00:04:25.910> probably<00:04:26.150> won't

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
that so no I'd say you probably won't

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.520 
that so no I'd say you probably won't
find<00:04:26.509> out<00:04:26.780> what<00:04:26.990> those<00:04:27.110> numbers<00:04:27.320> are

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
find out what those numbers are

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.990 
find out what those numbers are
specifically<00:04:28.039> but<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:28.430> would<00:04:28.550> definitely<00:04:28.580> be

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
specifically but it would definitely be

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.159 
specifically but it would definitely be
interesting<00:04:29.570> and<00:04:29.630> get<00:04:29.750> something<00:04:30.020> think
