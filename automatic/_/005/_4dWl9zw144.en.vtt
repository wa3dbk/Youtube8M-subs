00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.809
 hello that as I always hope you 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.130
 find the best I'm gilÃ¡n 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.839
 in charge of visiting everyone and in this 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.490
 occasion we are going to review an excellent 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.109
 called song I like you 'how has 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.580
 seen at the beginning of the video to play 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.900
 the intro and also to play 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.670
 absolutely the whole song 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.960
 we're just going to use three 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.610
 chords 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.520
 a minor yes got in this position 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.100
 in the highest I got in this position and 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.780
 one level I did not get it in this 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.120
 position this song has a rhythm of 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.210
 reggae that is quite classic and that 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.230
 it supports enough in the figures I was getting 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.220
 obviously we will review how to play the 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.020
 rhythm and also all the tips and 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.790
 recommendations so you can play from 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.110
 the best possible way this song and 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.970
 also so you can sing and play 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.340
 very good to begin let's review 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.530
 the movements in a smaller yes we are going to 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.930
 make two percussive radios one towards 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.880
 down and another up this what 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.860
 we only make our hand 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.210
 on the strings in such a way that we 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.640
 listen to none in order that 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.130
 just listen to some percussions like that 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.900
 what are we going to do below and then 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.790
 let's tighten it enough so that 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.770
 sound and let's do a radio asia 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.690
 specifically for this song the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.000
 radio down does not have to be to 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.080
 from the sixth string 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.750
 preferably I recommend that you 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.399
 do from the fourth agreement this 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.530
 because in the original recording of 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.380
 the song the sound that is achieved is a 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.240
 sharper sound which is not achieved with 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.740
 the thickest strings of the guitar 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.510
 although as I always tell you that already 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.000
 it will depend 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.060
 just so it's down percussive radio 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.820
 up percussive radio downwards a 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.250
 full radio and then another radio 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.340
 percussive upwards so everything 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.230
 it should sound like that and ready that same 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.270
 we will repeat it several 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.010
 times according to the chord and we have all 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.090
 our song in particular we're going to 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:02.980
 repeat twice in a lower two 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.940
 times in a major and four times in 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.940
 a minor 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.940
 when you finish the last time in a and 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:20.100
 smaller you start the whole circle again 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:21.840
 in 92 24 and practically up to here already 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.819
 you can play absolutely all the 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.470
 song about the chords now 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.150
 comes the interesting part we're going to 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.739
 review how we can sing and 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.630
 touch this first of all in what 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.370
 I recommend that you master the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.200
 best possible way the progression that 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.400
 we review at the beginning this in order 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.620
 that your hands do this 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.390
 movement mechanically so that if 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.400
 do not have to be thinking so much about 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.140
 how are you going to do this once said this 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.269
 you have to review the song in its two 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.709
 main parts the part of the verse that 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.700
 it's the part where they always say 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:55.390
 I like this I like the other one I like 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.340
 I like traveling so much I like you ' 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.050
 and the second part which is the part of 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.740
 the choirs where he always says that 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.740
 I'm going to do 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.900
 this in order that you realize 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.880
 that the whole song is composed 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.610
 basically for the verse that always 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.500
 he says I like this I like that and the 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.500
 chorus that also spends it saying that 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.690
 I'm going to make him sing that basically if 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.670
 you master the first verse and the chorus and 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.410
 you have with that to play absolutely 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.940
 the whole song starting with how 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.160
 sing the verses you have to have in 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.390
 I like the account because the 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.880
 word I like is the one that is going 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.070
 guide to be able to sing since I 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.360
 like in the month let's do the first 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.820
 video down which is a radio 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.310
 percussive was going to be I like those 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.220
 airplanes and then the next one I like 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.050
 it's my bus expense so basically 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.200
 I'm saying we're going to make the 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:54.330
 two movements of the xi and the major in 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.330
 the whole sentence I like planes 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.480
 and in the minor we will do the same 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.310
 only that he remembers that there are four 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.830
 movements via channel I like you ' happened 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.130
 exactly the same by phrase and you see 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.280
 a movement I like to travel I like 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.380
 this and ready like that is this 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.790
 phrase let's do two movements yo 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.680
 I recommend that you practice with the 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.780
 letter for you to locate with him 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.490
 like because I like it is the part 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.710
 that will not vary everything else and 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.240
 because I like that I like it so 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.920
 like it, I like it is the part 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.360
 invariable verses to review the 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.280
 choir we can apply the same as 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.210
 we did in the verse we are going to locate 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.210
 in the words 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.810
 the detail with the choir and that is going to 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.760
 to help a lot is that it's never going to 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.440
 change will always be exactly what 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.450
 same and to apply ourselves to sing there is 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.760
 be observers and take into account that 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.910
 we started singing what I'm going to 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.710
 do in the first strum that sounds not 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.880
 in the first percussive radio put 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.050
 Attention 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.720
 I will do as you can realize 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.330
 I started singing in that which and also 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.970
 in the first audio down I'm going to 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.139
 do and change in the older I do 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.860
 in the being of the word to do 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.629
 what I am going to do 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.090
 obviously it does not sound like anything because it's 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:21.189
 a percussive radio and here I will sing 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:25.189
 in the part that says I do not know 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:29.300
 I do not know in the first percussive plane 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:31.159
 that I start I do not know and he knows is 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.199
 the second percussive meeting there goes 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:37.610
 slowly that I do not know for and ready 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.039
 if you noticed, I already made my two 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.020
 movements in a minor and my two 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.849
 movements in a major and in this 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.500
 occasion what we do in the youngest is 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.150
 simpler because we 're going to do 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.069
 practically the same as what we did here 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.990
 above only that you remember that they are 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:55.729
 four times at a normal level so 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:57.979
 I would be going to be me do not stop here from 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.900
 same way that what I'm going to do 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.710
 start singing it in the first I think 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.710
 that sounds down 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.330
 and the being is the beginning of the following 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:10.069
 two movements that I'm going to do there 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.379
 I finished my first two and likewise 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:14.090
 as we did in the major no longer does 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:16.330
 to start singing near the first 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.830
 from top to bottom 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.080
 do not stop 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.300
 both he already starts here and the strain 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:29.620
 it's also a steal so everything together and 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:29.620
 slowly I should not know 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:43.069
 once you master the verse and remembered 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:45.169
 you could play absolutely all the 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.849
 song maybe the only detail in the 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.650
 that nothing is touched is a part of the 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:51.590
 song in which he says I like the 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:54.020
 cinnamon I like you ' that part is not 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:57.110
 touch nothing and again start I like the 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.729
 fire I like you ' after so much 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.979
 review I'm really waiting for you here this
