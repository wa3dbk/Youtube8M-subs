00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
money is actually split so so you got

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.880 
money is actually split so so you got
four<00:01:02.280> people<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.300> decide<00:01:03.570> who<00:01:03.870> does<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
four people you can decide who does the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.160 
four people you can decide who does the
most<00:01:04.920> i<00:01:05.339> guess<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.790> who's<00:01:06.150> done<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> most<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
most i guess or who's done the most you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.859 
most i guess or who's done the most you
can<00:01:07.200> split<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.710> between<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.580> for<00:01:08.820> people<00:01:09.180> but

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
can split it between that for people but

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.510 
can split it between that for people but
be<00:01:10.020> very<00:01:10.200> very<00:01:10.290> careful<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> person<00:01:11.490> can

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
be very very careful that the person can

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.120
