00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.290
 cheers 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.830
 yummy homemade ice t do you want 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.110
 Also what I'm wondering how to do it 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:28.689
 for the preparation of two liters 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:36.430
 eistee I recommend a cup 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:40.100
 spoon a funnel and some sugar 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.070
 then we dedicate ourselves to the bag 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.510
 preparation so here I have ever 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:51.110
 drapes the level guitar into the sugar 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.760
 and five bags t comes for two liters 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.920
 always very good 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.699
 First you should even in the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.729
 fill the box office 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.970
 depending on gusto a two spoonful 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:05.150
 or more target water I have already hot 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.479
 By the way, you fill that up now 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.150
 One is the key to years we are full 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.740
 need a bit of space then must 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.570
 First of all you have to open the sugar 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.340
 been the mix until the sugar 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.500
 is completely dissolved in the hot 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.990
 water and then you take depending on 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.200
 which taste you would like to have 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.090
 the tea bags also two liters 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.549
 I recommend five of such tea bags 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.420
 I combine blackberry raspberry here 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.420
 and johannes berry cherry currant 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:54.350
 Instance beer so that must now one 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.350
 In the meantime the tea has now 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.890
 as you can see here 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.369
 very nice bread but before we go to the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.319
 to find tea 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.390
 of course you can bottle it first 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.160
 which is freshly rinsed 2 liters 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.410
 aptitude and we leave now 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.410
 first some cold water in 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.870
 that's what we have for the first time 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.489
 a certain stability ensured 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:30.349
 then we pack in the funnel and 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:33.810
 then it is necessary to tilt it carefully 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.609
 so we get done next 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.920
 the spoon into the game we before 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:41.310
 ever used and we 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.629
 of course, squeeze the tea bags again 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.389
 house every delicious tasty 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.409
 Drop in the bottle 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:53.040
 catapult 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.510
 and then the perpetrators covered that 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.400
 Of course , you fill up the rest again 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:04.859
 Then screw on with cold water 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:08.159
 and bottle dry 2-liter delicious 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.489
 have done so that's it 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.480
 again with the theme do it yourself 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.579

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.909
 help one or the other or at least 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.780
 give some food for thought to something new 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.859
