00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
to race on different wheels so when you

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.430 
to race on different wheels so when you
make<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.840> change

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
make that change

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.440 
make that change
nice<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.740> have<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.010> adjuster<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.700> tell<00:02:18.330> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
nice to have the adjuster to tell the
