three times because I did film this
video<00:03:06.459> I<00:03:06.640> think<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:06.910> total<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.209> three<00:03:07.420> times

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
end of the world because we're just

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.180 
end of the world because we're just
gonna<00:03:55.209> cover<00:03:55.420> a<00:03:55.540> lot<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.840> that<00:03:55.959> up<00:03:56.140> with<00:03:56.709> fake

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
gonna cover a lot of that up with fake

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.430 
gonna cover a lot of that up with fake
blood<00:03:57.489> anyway<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.209> I<00:03:58.299> am<00:03:58.480> kind<00:03:58.840> of<00:03:58.930> messy<00:03:59.230> and

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
end up getting it everywhere

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.090 
end up getting it everywhere
so<00:04:01.060> flash<00:04:01.989> palette<00:04:02.380> is<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.530> very<00:04:02.799> expensive

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
up my eyebrow really well I didn't mean

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.070

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
because it is a dark color so it'll

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:40.920 
because it is a dark color so it'll
blend<00:04:30.820> in<00:04:31.060> well<00:04:33.000> no<00:04:34.000> matter<00:04:34.210> what<00:04:34.450> happens<00:04:39.930> so

using that to set the base paint it's

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.620 
using that to set the base paint it's
not<00:04:47.650> super<00:04:48.220> necessary<00:04:48.760> because<00:04:49.060> you<00:04:49.150> will<00:04:49.360> set

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
not super necessary because you will set

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.210 
not super necessary because you will set
it<00:04:49.750> a<00:04:49.840> lot<00:04:50.020> when<00:04:50.169> you<00:04:50.260> add<00:04:50.410> your<00:04:50.590> skills<00:04:50.889> that<00:04:51.190> I

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.170 
we're using is just blood scab this will
dry<00:06:25.060> so<00:06:25.480> it<00:06:25.630> won't<00:06:25.870> be<00:06:26.080> so<00:06:26.880> sticky<00:06:27.880> and<00:06:27.910> messy

this much blood but if it was ripped off

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.270 
this much blood but if it was ripped off
you<00:06:49.420> probably<00:06:49.720> would<00:06:49.900> be<00:06:50.050> having<00:06:50.410> a<00:06:50.650> lot<00:06:51.160> of

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280
