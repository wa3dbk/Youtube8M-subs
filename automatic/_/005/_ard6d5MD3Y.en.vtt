he wouldn't acknowledge that this was a

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.560 
he wouldn't acknowledge that this was a
widespread<00:02:37.380> problem<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.610> after<00:02:38.850> he<00:02:38.940> got<00:02:39.060> me<00:02:39.270> to

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
widespread problem so after he got me to

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.020 
widespread problem so after he got me to
turn<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.590> off<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.890> on<00:02:40.920> again<00:02:40.980> he<00:02:41.700> got<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:42.000> a

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
turn it off and on again he got to a

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.520 
turn it off and on again he got to a
point<00:02:42.240> where<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.540> was<00:02:42.660> like<00:02:42.810> can<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:43.230> ask<00:02:43.350> what

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
point where I was like can I ask what

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.690 
point where I was like can I ask what
you're<00:02:43.680> expecting<00:02:44.190> out<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.490> laptop

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
you're expecting out of this laptop

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.250 
you're expecting out of this laptop
obviously<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.510> Retina<00:02:45.810> display<00:02:46.050> has<00:02:46.230> a

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
obviously the Retina display has a

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.990 
obviously the Retina display has a
higher<00:02:46.530> resolution<00:02:46.800> so<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.460> can't<00:02:47.640> expect

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
higher resolution so you can't expect

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.760 
higher resolution so you can't expect
that<00:02:48.180> out<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.420> your<00:02:48.690> monitor<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.380> explained

inch TV it wouldn't look good anyway so

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.950 
inch TV it wouldn't look good anyway so
he<00:05:01.890> didn't<00:05:02.190> accept<00:05:02.460> there<00:05:02.700> was<00:05:02.790> a<00:05:02.820> problem<00:05:03.060> it

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
he didn't accept there was a problem it

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.680 
he didn't accept there was a problem it
worked<00:05:04.200> for<00:05:04.410> him<00:05:04.650> therefore<00:05:05.340> it<00:05:05.490> was<00:05:05.640> fine<00:05:05.940> but

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
worked for him therefore it was fine but

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
worked for him therefore it was fine but
his<00:05:07.400> conclusion<00:05:08.400> was<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:09.360> works<00:05:10.080> with<00:05:10.320> Apple's

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
his conclusion was it works with Apple's

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.350 
his conclusion was it works with Apple's
display<00:05:11.130> and<00:05:11.400> we<00:05:11.880> can't<00:05:12.120> guarantee

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.660 
compatibility with third-party products
so<00:05:15.660> I<00:05:15.720> had<00:05:15.870> no<00:05:15.990> argument<00:05:16.470> after<00:05:16.590> that<00:05:16.920> when

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
so I had no argument after that when

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.040 
so I had no argument after that when
you're<00:05:17.790> spending<00:05:17.940> this<00:05:18.270> much<00:05:18.450> on<00:05:18.600> a<00:05:18.630> computer

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
you're spending this much on a computer

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.420 
you're spending this much on a computer
you<00:05:19.140> want<00:05:19.200> better<00:05:19.440> service<00:05:19.890> than<00:05:20.010> that<00:05:20.190> but<00:05:20.400> I

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
you want better service than that but I

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.610 
you want better service than that but I
couldn't<00:05:20.790> do<00:05:20.910> anything<00:05:21.090> about<00:05:21.270> it<00:05:21.450> so<00:05:22.320> I<00:05:22.350> had

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
couldn't do anything about it so I had

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.020 
couldn't do anything about it so I had
to<00:05:22.710> fall<00:05:22.890> and<00:05:23.040> fall<00:05:23.160> again<00:05:23.250> to<00:05:23.580> arrange<00:05:23.850> for

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
to fall and fall again to arrange for

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.910 
to fall and fall again to arrange for
them<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.330> replace<00:05:24.630> this<00:05:24.870> one<00:05:25.110> he<00:05:25.500> couldn't<00:05:25.800> do

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
them to replace this one he couldn't do

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.440 
them to replace this one he couldn't do
it<00:05:26.010> in<00:05:26.100> the<00:05:26.220> store<00:05:26.460> so<00:05:27.000> that<00:05:27.150> was<00:05:27.270> another

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
it in the store so that was another

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.910 
it in the store so that was another
phone<00:05:27.690> call<00:05:27.720> to<00:05:28.020> Apple<00:05:28.320> so<00:05:28.680> they're<00:05:28.800> gonna

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
phone call to Apple so they're gonna

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.410 
phone call to Apple so they're gonna
come<00:05:29.160> and<00:05:29.250> take<00:05:29.400> this<00:05:29.520> one<00:05:29.700> away<00:05:29.790> then<00:05:30.120> give<00:05:30.300> me

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
come and take this one away then give me

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.760 
come and take this one away then give me
a<00:05:30.450> new<00:05:30.630> one<00:05:30.660> I<00:05:30.840> think<00:05:31.110> I'll<00:05:31.260> go<00:05:31.380> few<00:05:31.650> days

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
a new one I think I'll go few days

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.260 
a new one I think I'll go few days
without<00:05:32.100> a<00:05:32.130> MacBook<00:05:32.610> all<00:05:32.760> together

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
without a MacBook all together

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.840 
without a MacBook all together
I'm<00:05:33.390> hoping<00:05:34.050> this<00:05:34.650> problem<00:05:35.100> won't<00:05:35.190> exist<00:05:35.640> on

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
I'm hoping this problem won't exist on

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.670 
I'm hoping this problem won't exist on
than<00:05:36.000> you<00:05:36.120> want<00:05:36.360> but<00:05:36.870> judging<00:05:37.320> by<00:05:37.500> the

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
than you want but judging by the

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.250 
than you want but judging by the
internet<00:05:38.280> it<00:05:38.550> seems<00:05:38.910> to<00:05:39.060> be<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.390> pretty

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
internet it seems to be a pretty

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.260 
internet it seems to be a pretty
widespread<00:05:40.590> problem<00:05:41.310> so<00:05:41.790> I'm<00:05:41.880> not<00:05:41.970> get<00:05:42.180> my

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
widespread problem so I'm not get my

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.390 
widespread problem so I'm not get my
hopes<00:05:42.480> up<00:05:42.690> but<00:05:43.020> I've<00:05:43.320> heard<00:05:43.500> that<00:05:43.740> it<00:05:44.100> will

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
hopes up but I've heard that it will

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.790 
hopes up but I've heard that it will
work<00:05:44.640> with<00:05:44.910> a<00:05:45.120> mini<00:05:45.510> DisplayPort<00:05:45.990> to<00:05:46.440> DVI

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
adapter the genius in the Apple store

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.490 
adapter the genius in the Apple store
told<00:05:50.160> me<00:05:50.550> that<00:05:50.730> using<00:05:51.690> an<00:05:51.810> adapter<00:05:52.230> will<00:05:52.350> make

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
told me that using an adapter will make

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.310 
told me that using an adapter will make
no<00:05:52.710> difference<00:05:52.890> and<00:05:53.510> there<00:05:54.510> is<00:05:54.630> no<00:05:54.780> way<00:05:54.960> Apple

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
no difference and there is no way Apple

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.100 
no difference and there is no way Apple
would<00:05:55.530> provide<00:05:56.040> that<00:05:56.430> for<00:05:56.970> me<00:05:57.120> so<00:05:57.420> I'll<00:05:57.960> have

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
would provide that for me so I'll have

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.260 
would provide that for me so I'll have
to<00:05:58.230> pay<00:05:58.380> for<00:05:58.410> myself<00:05:59.010> and<00:05:59.310> there<00:05:59.790> were<00:05:59.850> over<00:05:59.910> 20

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
to pay for myself and there were over 20

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.480 
to pay for myself and there were over 20
pounds<00:06:00.450> for<00:06:00.810> an<00:06:00.900> adapter<00:06:01.380> and<00:06:01.560> then<00:06:01.980> finally

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
pounds for an adapter and then finally

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.230 
pounds for an adapter and then finally
the<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.360> genius<00:06:04.260> told<00:06:04.740> me<00:06:04.950> that<00:06:05.130> if<00:06:05.850> it

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
the the genius told me that if it

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.780 
the the genius told me that if it
doesn't<00:06:06.450> work<00:06:06.750> with<00:06:07.080> the<00:06:08.070> monitors<00:06:08.520> that<00:06:08.550> I

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
doesn't work with the monitors that I

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.390 
doesn't work with the monitors that I
have<00:06:09.090> then<00:06:09.510> maybe<00:06:10.230> the<00:06:10.470> MacBook<00:06:10.830> Pro<00:06:11.040> isn't

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
have then maybe the MacBook Pro isn't

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.400 
have then maybe the MacBook Pro isn't
for<00:06:11.580> me<00:06:11.700> and<00:06:11.910> I<00:06:12.300> should<00:06:12.330> return<00:06:12.780> it<00:06:12.840> and<00:06:13.110> buy<00:06:13.380> a

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
for me and I should return it and buy a

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.080 
for me and I should return it and buy a
different<00:06:13.710> mark<00:06:14.160> so<00:06:14.550> I<00:06:14.610> was<00:06:14.730> annoyed<00:06:14.970> with

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
different mark so I was annoyed with

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.900 
different mark so I was annoyed with
that<00:06:15.240> outcome<00:06:16.170> I<00:06:16.350> got<00:06:17.250> absolutely<00:06:17.400> nowhere

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
that outcome I got absolutely nowhere

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.390 
that outcome I got absolutely nowhere
but<00:06:18.510> clearly<00:06:18.750> there<00:06:18.960> is<00:06:19.080> a<00:06:19.110> fault<00:06:19.440> with<00:06:19.710> the

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
but clearly there is a fault with the

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.030 
but clearly there is a fault with the
new<00:06:20.610> MacBooks<00:06:21.320> I'm<00:06:22.320> surprised

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
new MacBooks I'm surprised

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.850 
new MacBooks I'm surprised
Apple<00:06:23.400> haven't<00:06:24.050> done<00:06:25.050> something<00:06:25.380> about<00:06:25.680> it

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
Apple haven't done something about it

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.590 
Apple haven't done something about it
I'm<00:06:26.100> surprised<00:06:26.490> they<00:06:26.640> released<00:06:26.970> them<00:06:27.270> without

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
I'm surprised they released them without

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.720 
I'm surprised they released them without
finding<00:06:27.960> this<00:06:28.230> fault<00:06:28.530> because<00:06:29.100> plenty<00:06:29.640> of

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
finding this fault because plenty of

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.180 
finding this fault because plenty of
people<00:06:30.090> have<00:06:30.870> found<00:06:31.050> it<00:06:31.260> instead<00:06:31.620> and<00:06:31.950> if

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
people have found it instead and if

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.040 
people have found it instead and if
they'll<00:06:32.400> if<00:06:32.940> they<00:06:33.090> keep<00:06:33.270> selling<00:06:33.660> off<00:06:33.840> these

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
they'll if they keep selling off these

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.900 
they'll if they keep selling off these
it's<00:06:34.650> going<00:06:34.890> to<00:06:35.040> be<00:06:35.130> a<00:06:35.160> big<00:06:35.310> problem<00:06:35.640> for<00:06:35.700> them

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
it's going to be a big problem for them

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.970 
it's going to be a big problem for them
if<00:06:36.210> I<00:06:36.450> can't<00:06:36.660> use<00:06:36.810> an<00:06:37.110> external<00:06:37.590> monitor<00:06:37.710> with

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
if I can't use an external monitor with

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.940 
if I can't use an external monitor with
a<00:06:38.040> MacBook<00:06:38.220> then

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
a MacBook then

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.820 
a MacBook then
I<00:06:38.980> don't<00:06:39.970> think<00:06:40.090> I<00:06:40.360> want<00:06:40.570> it<00:06:40.750> at<00:06:41.020> all<00:06:41.320> and<00:06:41.620> if

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
I don't think I want it at all and if

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.200

this video have said that they have to
say<00:07:55.000> problem<00:07:55.450> so<00:07:56.050> hopefully<00:07:56.230> Apple<00:07:56.590> will<00:07:56.680> fix

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:56.920 
say problem so hopefully Apple will fix

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.800 
say problem so hopefully Apple will fix
this<00:07:57.070> soon<00:07:57.400> but<00:07:57.730> it's<00:07:57.940> not<00:07:58.210> looking<00:07:58.690> very

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:58.810 
this soon but it's not looking very

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.660 
this soon but it's not looking very
likely<00:07:59.080> anymore<00:07:59.680> I<00:07:59.830> also<00:08:00.070> got<00:08:00.310> the<00:08:00.430> problem

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:00.670 
likely anymore I also got the problem

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.030 
likely anymore I also got the problem
with<00:08:00.850> the<00:08:01.120> broken<00:08:01.360> Yukie<00:08:01.840> solved

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:04.040 
with the broken Yukie solved

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.670 
with the broken Yukie solved
so<00:08:04.670> that<00:08:05.180> didn't<00:08:05.510> prove<00:08:05.690> anything<00:08:05.990> you<00:08:06.260> wasted

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:06.680 
so that didn't prove anything you wasted

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:12.160 
so that didn't prove anything you wasted
this<00:08:06.800> time<00:08:07.790> bringing<00:08:08.240> that<00:08:08.420> up<00:08:11.170> the
