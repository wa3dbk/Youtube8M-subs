00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.530
 important moisture from the Pacific 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.149

 to moderate for the eyes of the north and 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.020
 that there is also the potential of 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.730
 and some snowfall in mountainous areas of

 progresses in the next few hours due to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.370
 all this great set of events 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.380
 atmospheric conditions while the 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.390
 minus temperatures and temperatures that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.980
 can reach up to 28 degrees in

 hermosillo 23 in tijuana 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.060
 one morning because we did not in fact

 temperatures of 27 in peace 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.940
 Of course, the atmosphere is very 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.490
 cold 13 maximum and minus three minus 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.080
 six degrees the temperature at minimum and 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.020
 there we will wait for some precipitation 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.820
 light for the northeast and part of the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.009
 center of the mexican republic also 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.410
 the environment is very cold or you like the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.540
 minimum temperatures in blue - two 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.150

 with very good intention of maximum in 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.540
 Zacatecas but we are still waiting for a 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.700
 cloudy environment and with some 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.710
 precipitation we will also expect that 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.960
 in the center west of the republic 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.090

 very dispersed for the port of acapulco 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.600
 we can expect temperatures that can 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.610
 reach 32 degrees maximum 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.100
 clear sky most of the day

 they go from moderate to occasionally strong 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.320
 with an environment also dominated by 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.540
 cold air mass that generated in front 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.280
 number 24 and that also in these two 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.040
 points and their regions will remain 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.940
 ordered by this one 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.349
