been added into Minecraft 1.5 which

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.160 
been added into Minecraft 1.5 which
reroutes<00:00:16.350> signals<00:00:17.510> hoppers<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.720> been<00:00:18.869> added

reroutes signals hoppers have been added
into<00:00:19.410> them<00:00:19.500> 1.5<00:00:20.130> how<00:00:20.460> hoppers<00:00:20.850> work<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.240> if

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
into them 1.5 how hoppers work is if

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.660 
into them 1.5 how hoppers work is if
they<00:00:21.810> suck<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.439> items<00:00:22.920> from<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.189> top<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.580> then

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
they suck in items from the top and then

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.340 
they suck in items from the top and then
can<00:00:23.850> place<00:00:24.029> them<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.449> any<00:00:24.600> item<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.170> hold

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
stuff it always drops item so as you can

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.940 
stuff it always drops item so as you can
see<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.750> here<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.140> arrows<00:00:46.500> which<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:46.920> a

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
see in here I have arrows which with a

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.979 
see in here I have arrows which with a
dispenser<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.760> shoot<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.600> time<00:00:48.870> it

dispenser we shoot it but this time it
drops<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.440> same<00:00:49.739> goes<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:49.980> splash<00:00:50.550> potions

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
drops the same goes for splash potions

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.229 
drops the same goes for splash potions
and<00:00:51.649> eggs<00:00:52.649> snowballs<00:00:53.370> any<00:00:53.579> item<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.000> would

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
instead one item we've always been

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.520 
instead one item we've always been
waiting<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.309> minecart<00:00:59.850> with<00:01:00.030> TNT<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.690> 1.5

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
waiting for is minecart with TNT in 1.5

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.590 
waiting for is minecart with TNT in 1.5
this<00:01:01.800> has<00:01:02.010> been<00:01:02.219> added<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.760> simply<00:01:03.239> made<00:01:03.420> with

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
this has been added it simply made with

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840 
this has been added it simply made with
TNT<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.140> minecart<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.830> addition<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.729> this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
TNT and minecart in addition to this

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.330 
TNT and minecart in addition to this
they<00:01:06.299> added<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.869> activator<00:01:07.470> rail<00:01:07.799> which

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
they added the activator rail which

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.300 
they added the activator rail which
activates<00:01:09.350> minecart<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.470> TNT<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.189> were

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
activates minecart with TNT so if I were

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.219 
activates minecart with TNT so if I were
to<00:01:11.430> slide<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.820> once<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.689> hits<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.990> rail

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
to slide this once it hits that rail

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.390 
to slide this once it hits that rail
it'll<00:01:13.530> activate<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.340> start<00:01:14.670> ticking<00:01:15.360> tada

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
it'll activate it and start ticking tada

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.289 
it'll activate it and start ticking tada
easily<00:01:17.400> done<00:01:19.220> one<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.369> my<00:01:20.520> favorite<00:01:21.030> items

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
easily done one of my favorite items

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.420 
easily done one of my favorite items
that<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.630> been<00:01:21.720> added<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.290> 21.5<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
that have been added in 21.5 is the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.910 
that have been added in 21.5 is the
daylight<00:01:23.880> sensor<00:01:24.390> when<00:01:24.869> sunlight<00:01:25.170> touches<00:01:25.770> it

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
daylight sensor when sunlight touches it

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.890 
daylight sensor when sunlight touches it
it<00:01:26.070> will<00:01:26.310> actually<00:01:26.700> activate<00:01:27.030> redstone<00:01:27.750> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it will actually activate redstone and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.230 
it will actually activate redstone and
you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.590> inverse<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:29.520> easily<00:01:29.700> so

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
you can inverse it just as easily so

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.120 
you can inverse it just as easily so
when<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.750> turns<00:01:31.020> night<00:01:31.259> it'll<00:01:31.619> actually<00:01:31.770> light

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
when it turns night it'll actually light

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.050 
when it turns night it'll actually light
up<00:01:32.280> everything<00:01:32.579> fun<00:01:33.479> as<00:01:33.720> all<00:01:34.229> living<00:01:34.619> crap

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
up everything fun as all living crap

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.640 
up everything fun as all living crap
trap<00:01:36.060> chests<00:01:36.600> are<00:01:36.750> something<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.470> should

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
trap chests are something you should

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.200 
trap chests are something you should
probably<00:01:37.829> look<00:01:38.070> out<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.610> Vettes

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
probably look out for in Vettes

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.539 
probably look out for in Vettes
upcoming<00:01:39.780> maps<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.500> see<00:01:40.799> them<00:01:40.979> with<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
upcoming maps you can see them with a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.730 
upcoming maps you can see them with a
red<00:01:41.820> ring<00:01:42.180> around<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.750> what<00:01:43.020> tramp<00:01:43.290> chests<00:01:43.619> do

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
red ring around it what tramp chests do

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.620 
red ring around it what tramp chests do
is<00:01:43.860> when<00:01:44.040> opened<00:01:44.430> it'll<00:01:44.610> actually<00:01:44.790> activate<00:01:45.479> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
is when opened it'll actually activate a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.870 
is when opened it'll actually activate a
redstone<00:01:46.020> signal<00:01:46.189> since<00:01:47.189> these<00:01:47.460> are<00:01:47.670> not

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
redstone signal since these are not

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.399 
redstone signal since these are not
normal<00:01:48.149> chests<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.869> actually<00:01:49.020> place

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
normal chests you can actually place

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.859 
normal chests you can actually place
them<00:01:49.619> next<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.070> normal<00:01:50.399> chess<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.909> use<00:01:51.600> them

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
them next to normal chess and use them

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.230 
them next to normal chess and use them
just<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.439> normal<00:01:52.710> chess<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.310> set<00:01:53.790> for<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
just like normal chess a set for the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.389 
just like normal chess a set for the
fact<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.439> now<00:01:55.649> take<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:56.159> less<00:01:56.369> space

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
fact that you can now take up less space

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.929 
fact that you can now take up less space
in<00:01:56.909> your<00:01:57.000> storage<00:01:57.360> rooms<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:58.340> 1.5<00:01:59.340> every

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
in your storage rooms in 1.5 every

in your storage rooms in 1.5 every
redstone<00:02:00.479> item<00:02:00.869> now<00:02:01.049> has<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> certain<00:02:01.950> redstone

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
redstone item now has a certain redstone

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.670 
redstone item now has a certain redstone
signal<00:02:02.700> they<00:02:03.030> give<00:02:03.240> off<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.229> addition<00:02:04.469> to

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
signal they give off so in addition to

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.260 
signal they give off so in addition to
this<00:02:04.920> they<00:02:05.159> added<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.579> weighted<00:02:05.939> pressure

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
this they added the weighted pressure

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.779 
this they added the weighted pressure
plates<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.740> gold<00:02:08.009> one<00:02:08.099> which<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
plates this is the gold one which is the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.279 
plates this is the gold one which is the
light<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.509> iron<00:02:09.690> one<00:02:09.959> which<00:02:10.140> is

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
light and this is the iron one which is

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.170 
light and this is the iron one which is
heavy<00:02:10.470> as<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:11.129> see<00:02:11.310> me<00:02:11.550> stepping<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.030> it

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
heavy as you can see me stepping on it

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.100 
heavy as you can see me stepping on it
will<00:02:12.300> not<00:02:12.510> activate

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
will not activate

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.140 
will not activate
because<00:02:13.440> it's<00:02:13.590> meant<00:02:13.770> for<00:02:13.860> items<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.880> light

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
because it's meant for items the light

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.350 
because it's meant for items the light
one<00:02:15.420> eye<00:02:15.660> needs<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.680> little<00:02:17.130> bit<00:02:17.370> less<00:02:17.610> items<00:02:18.090> to

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
one eye needs a little bit less items to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.690 
one eye needs a little bit less items to
activate<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.900> full<00:02:19.410> redstone<00:02:20.070> signal<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.610> as

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
activate a full redstone signal so as

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.980 
activate a full redstone signal so as
you<00:02:20.820> can<00:02:20.910> see<00:02:20.970> I'm<00:02:21.180> throwing<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
you can see I'm throwing it and the

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.320 
you can see I'm throwing it and the
redstone<00:02:22.380> signal<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.980> slowly<00:02:23.520> getting<00:02:23.910> bigger

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
redstone signal is slowly getting bigger

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.170 
redstone signal is slowly getting bigger
but<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.110> heavy<00:02:25.410> one<00:02:25.710> takes<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.220> bunch<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.030> if<00:02:27.090> I

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
but the heavy one takes a bunch so if I

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.790 
but the heavy one takes a bunch so if I
were<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.420> stay<00:02:27.570> here<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.900> throw<00:02:28.140> them<00:02:28.320> it's

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
were to stay here and throw them it's

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.250 
were to stay here and throw them it's
still<00:02:28.980> at<00:02:29.130> one<00:02:29.400> signal<00:02:31.220> still<00:02:32.220> at<00:02:32.400> one<00:02:32.580> signal

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
still at one signal still at one signal

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.360 
still at one signal still at one signal
still<00:02:34.260> at<00:02:34.470> one<00:02:34.710> signal<00:02:35.250> up<00:02:36.030> two<00:02:36.420> signals<00:02:37.370> and

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
still at one signal up two signals and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.699 
still at one signal up two signals and
maybe<00:02:39.180> we'll<00:02:39.360> finally<00:02:39.600> cope<00:02:39.930> okay<00:02:40.410> we<00:02:40.560> need

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
maybe we'll finally cope okay we need

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.500 
maybe we'll finally cope okay we need
another<00:02:40.980> stack<00:02:43.250> three<00:02:44.250> signals<00:02:44.790> coming<00:02:45.180> right

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
another stack three signals coming right

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.020 
another stack three signals coming right
up<00:02:47.180> as<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:49.650> can<00:02:49.800> see<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.130> took<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.430> lot<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.820> items

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
up as you can see it took a lot of items

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.790 
up as you can see it took a lot of items
just<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.390> activate<00:02:51.690> three<00:02:52.110> signals<00:02:52.620> of

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
just to activate three signals of

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.120 
just to activate three signals of
redstone<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.750> if<00:02:55.020> you<00:02:55.260> need<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.500> use<00:02:55.890> this

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
redstone and so if you need to use this

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.310 
redstone and so if you need to use this
for<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> mob<00:02:56.820> spawner<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.420> would<00:02:57.900> recommend

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
for a mob spawner I would recommend

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.260 
for a mob spawner I would recommend
using<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.650> heavy<00:02:58.770> one<00:02:59.070> if<00:02:59.220> it's<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.580> really

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
using the heavy one if it's a really

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.640 
using the heavy one if it's a really
large<00:03:00.450> mob<00:03:00.780> spawner<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.320> have<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.470> lot<00:03:01.620> of

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
large mob spawner and you have a lot of

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.710 
large mob spawner and you have a lot of
items<00:03:01.980> but<00:03:02.310> if<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.610> little<00:03:02.730> one<00:03:02.970> use<00:03:03.480> the

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
items but if it's a little one use the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.920 
items but if it's a little one use the
leg<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:05.160> moment<00:03:05.700> we've<00:03:05.880> always<00:03:06.270> been<00:03:06.690> waiting

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
leg the moment we've always been waiting

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.800 
leg the moment we've always been waiting
for<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.920> block<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.489> redstone<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.420> block<00:03:09.660> of

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
for the block of redstone the block of

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.900 
for the block of redstone the block of
redstone<00:03:09.959> is<00:03:10.290> added<00:03:10.590> into<00:03:10.709> 1.5<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.670> what<00:03:11.820> the

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
redstone is added into 1.5 and what the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.940 
redstone is added into 1.5 and what the
block<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.239> redstone<00:03:12.390> does<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.440> activates

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
block of redstone does is it activates

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.160 
block of redstone does is it activates
any<00:03:14.100> signal<00:03:14.520> around<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.120> it's<00:03:15.420> also<00:03:15.630> crafted

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
any signal around it it's also crafted

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.110 
any signal around it it's also crafted
with<00:03:16.350> nine<00:03:16.709> redstone<00:03:17.370> pretty<00:03:17.700> simple<00:03:18.000> huh

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
with nine redstone pretty simple huh

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.509 
with nine redstone pretty simple huh
what's<00:03:19.080> great<00:03:19.440> about<00:03:19.470> this<00:03:19.799> though<00:03:20.040> its<00:03:20.220> it

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
what's great about this though its it

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.060 
what's great about this though its it
can<00:03:20.549> actually<00:03:21.060> be<00:03:21.180> moved<00:03:21.660> by<00:03:22.049> Pistons<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:22.950> as

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
can actually be moved by Pistons so as

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.729 
can actually be moved by Pistons so as
you<00:03:23.250> can<00:03:23.430> see<00:03:23.640> it<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:24.000> moved<00:03:24.239> by<00:03:24.330> Pistons<00:03:24.930> also

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
you can see it is moved by Pistons also

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.130 
you can see it is moved by Pistons also
again<00:03:26.310> like<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.640> said<00:03:26.700> anywhere<00:03:27.420> around<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.989> it

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
again like I said anywhere around it it

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.380 
again like I said anywhere around it it
will<00:03:28.350> activate<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:29.070> redstone<00:03:29.430> signal<00:03:29.580> so<00:03:30.239> it's

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
will activate a redstone signal so it's

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.539 
will activate a redstone signal so it's
like<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.570> redstone<00:03:30.900> torch<00:03:31.130> except<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.370> can

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
like a redstone torch except it can

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.120 
like a redstone torch except it can
actually<00:03:32.970> be<00:03:33.120> moved<00:03:33.299> by<00:03:33.600> Pistons<00:03:34.019> there<00:03:34.890> is

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
actually be moved by Pistons there is

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.070 
actually be moved by Pistons there is
now<00:03:35.370> an<00:03:35.580> easier<00:03:35.940> way<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.150> get<00:03:36.450> nether<00:03:36.690> nether

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
now an easier way to get nether nether

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.170 
now an easier way to get nether nether
brick<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:38.070> can<00:03:38.220> do<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.430> by<00:03:38.700> smelting

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
brick you can do this by smelting

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.120 
brick you can do this by smelting
netherrack<00:03:39.630> which<00:03:40.080> gives<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.500> these<00:03:40.709> nether

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
netherrack which gives you these nether

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.160 
netherrack which gives you these nether
bricks<00:03:41.640> once<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.209> get<00:03:42.360> four<00:03:42.630> of<00:03:42.660> them<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.019> can

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
bricks once you get four of them you can

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.720 
bricks once you get four of them you can
come<00:03:43.320> on<00:03:43.470> over<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:43.980> crafting<00:03:44.340> table<00:03:44.670> and

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
come on over to the crafting table and

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.210 
come on over to the crafting table and
you<00:03:44.850> can<00:03:45.000> craft<00:03:45.239> one<00:03:45.780> another<00:03:46.110> brick<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:46.890> four

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
you can craft one another brick so four

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.330 
you can craft one another brick so four
netherrack<00:03:47.670> is<00:03:47.850> equal<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.269> one<00:03:48.480> nether<00:03:48.780> brick

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
netherrack is equal to one nether brick

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.170 
netherrack is equal to one nether brick
speaking<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.610> nether<00:03:50.790> there<00:03:51.030> are

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
speaking of the nether there are

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.210 
speaking of the nether there are
actually<00:03:51.630> ores<00:03:51.870> in<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.290> nether<00:03:52.500> now<00:03:52.769> this<00:03:53.040> is

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
actually ores in the nether now this is

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.699 
actually ores in the nether now this is
the<00:03:53.370> nether<00:03:53.730> quartz<00:03:54.180> when<00:03:54.720> mind<00:03:55.049> you<00:03:55.320> will<00:03:55.500> get

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
the nether quartz when mind you will get

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.680 
the nether quartz when mind you will get
an<00:03:55.860> item<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.400> looks<00:03:56.640> like<00:03:56.940> this<00:03:57.299> it<00:03:57.570> is

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
jump boost I do believe and seconds is

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.090 
jump boost I do believe and seconds is
how<00:04:40.930> long<00:04:41.140> the<00:04:41.350> last<00:04:41.530> so<00:04:41.710> I'm<00:04:41.770> gonna<00:04:41.920> give<00:04:42.070> it

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
how long the last so I'm gonna give it

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.820 
how long the last so I'm gonna give it
to<00:04:42.190> me<00:04:42.340> for<00:04:42.580> 30<00:04:43.300> seconds<00:04:43.870> and<00:04:43.960> amplifier<00:04:44.650> is

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
to me for 30 seconds and amplifier is

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.430 
to me for 30 seconds and amplifier is
what<00:04:45.120> what<00:04:46.120> tier<00:04:46.480> of<00:04:46.750> it<00:04:46.930> it's<00:04:47.080> gonna<00:04:47.200> be<00:04:47.290> so

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
what what tier of it it's gonna be so

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.140 
what what tier of it it's gonna be so
I'm<00:04:47.500> gonna<00:04:47.620> give<00:04:47.770> me<00:04:47.860> jump<00:04:48.070> who's<00:04:48.220> three<00:04:48.520> if<00:04:48.970> I

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
I'm gonna give me jump who's three if I

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.870 
I'm gonna give me jump who's three if I
look<00:04:49.360> I<00:04:49.510> have<00:04:49.720> okay<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.440> have<00:04:50.710> jump<00:04:51.010> boost<00:04:51.310> for

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
look I have okay I have jump boost for

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.340 
look I have okay I have jump boost for
apparently<00:04:52.630> okay<00:04:53.110> jump<00:04:53.380> boosts<00:04:53.560> for<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:54.220> tada

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
apparently okay jump boosts for and tada

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.930 
apparently okay jump boosts for and tada
yay<00:04:56.380> so<00:04:56.710> that<00:04:56.890> can<00:04:57.070> be<00:04:57.190> used<00:04:57.340> with<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.670> command

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
yay so that can be used with the command

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.550 
yay so that can be used with the command
blocks<00:04:58.180> so<00:04:58.390> instead<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.840> four<00:04:59.050> map<00:04:59.200> makers

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
blocks so instead of four map makers

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.320 
blocks so instead of four map makers
having<00:04:59.860> to<00:04:59.950> use<00:05:00.130> splash<00:05:00.520> potions<00:05:01.090> all<00:05:01.210> the

having to use splash potions all the
time<00:05:01.510> they<00:05:01.720> can<00:05:01.870> actually<00:05:02.050> now<00:05:02.380> use<00:05:02.650> a<00:05:02.680> command

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
time they can actually now use a command

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.040 
time they can actually now use a command
for<00:05:03.550> it

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
for it
