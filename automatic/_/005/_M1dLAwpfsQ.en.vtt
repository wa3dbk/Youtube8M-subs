00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the bag so essentially this is a motion

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.090 
the bag so essentially this is a motion
control<00:00:39.090> unit<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.649> use<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.980> with

what<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.610> stuff<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.030> doing<00:00:45.300> these<00:00:45.539> two

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
what this stuff is doing these two

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.959 
what this stuff is doing these two
controls<00:00:47.180> it's<00:00:48.180> all<00:00:48.420> designed<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.170> it's

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
controls it's all designed so it's

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.910 
controls it's all designed so it's
emulating<00:00:50.969> keyboard<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.480> mouse<00:00:51.739> so<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.860> not

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
emulating keyboard and mouse so it's not

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.029 
emulating keyboard and mouse so it's not
a<00:00:53.100> joystick<00:00:53.610> device<00:00:53.940> when<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.510> plug<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:55.039> it's

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
a joystick device when you plug in it's

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.220 
a joystick device when you plug in it's
got<00:00:56.340> its<00:00:56.520> own<00:00:56.610> motion<00:00:57.090> control<00:00:57.629> stuff<00:00:57.840> through

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
got its own motion control stuff through

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.849 
got its own motion control stuff through
its<00:00:58.350> drivers<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.100> whatnot<00:00:59.809> but<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:01.320> essence

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
its drivers and whatnot but in essence

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.100 
its drivers and whatnot but in essence
this<00:01:02.190> will<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.579> able<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.910> control<00:01:03.449> stuff<00:01:03.750> just

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
this will be able to control stuff just

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.320 
this will be able to control stuff just
like<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.439> normally<00:01:04.589> would<00:01:04.909> with<00:01:05.909> keyboard

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
like you normally would with keyboard

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.820 
like you normally would with keyboard
and<00:01:06.420> mouse<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.229> say<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> buttons

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
and mouse and you can say in the buttons

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.679 
and mouse and you can say in the buttons
which<00:01:08.400> everything<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.060> want<00:01:09.799> okay<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.689> one

these buttons on the back that's got a

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.680 
these buttons on the back that's got a
nice<00:04:39.490> little<00:04:39.729> switch<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.270> they're<00:04:40.390> supposed

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
nice little switch and they're supposed

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.800 
nice little switch and they're supposed
to<00:04:40.780> be<00:04:40.900> analog<00:04:41.320> I<00:04:41.620> think<00:04:42.130> I<00:04:42.570> can't<00:04:43.570> quite

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
to be analog I think I can't quite

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:51.000 
to be analog I think I can't quite
remember<00:04:48.330> Bai<00:04:49.330> can<00:04:49.720> see<00:04:49.870> this<00:04:50.020> working<00:04:50.320> in

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
remember Bai can see this working in

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.400 
remember Bai can see this working in
like<00:04:51.340> FPS<00:04:51.550> games<00:04:52.150> believe<00:04:52.690> it<00:04:52.840> or<00:04:52.870> not<00:04:55.410> of

on the razor products is kind of Steph
done<00:06:10.659> if<00:06:10.780> you<00:06:10.870> notice<00:06:11.169> the<00:06:11.289> difference<00:06:11.800> there

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
done if you notice the difference there

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.390 
done if you notice the difference there
but<00:06:12.360> it<00:06:13.360> feels<00:06:13.389> very<00:06:13.900> very<00:06:14.770> hard<00:06:15.069> that

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
but it feels very very hard that

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.680 
but it feels very very hard that
obviously<00:06:15.669> means<00:06:15.789> it's<00:06:15.970> very<00:06:16.210> packed<00:06:16.449> and

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
obviously means it's very packed and

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.960 
obviously means it's very packed and
there<00:06:16.810> but<00:06:16.930> fair<00:06:17.139> enough<00:06:17.460> that<00:06:18.460> may<00:06:18.610> not<00:06:18.639> mean

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
there but fair enough that may not mean

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.670 
there but fair enough that may not mean
anything<00:06:19.030> and<00:06:20.550> we'll<00:06:21.550> just<00:06:21.729> move<00:06:22.440> okay<00:06:23.440> and

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
anything and we'll just move okay and

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.189 
anything and we'll just move okay and
got<00:06:24.250> the<00:06:24.340> main<00:06:24.520> unit<00:06:25.139> for<00:06:27.720> this<00:06:28.720> is<00:06:28.930> the

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
got the main unit for this is the

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:32.939 
got the main unit for this is the
magnetic<00:06:29.860> piece<00:06:31.380> essentially<00:06:32.380> this<00:06:32.590> has<00:06:32.770> got

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
magnetic piece essentially this has got

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.159 
magnetic piece essentially this has got
like<00:06:33.069> a<00:06:33.099> cross<00:06:33.520> that<00:06:33.819> goes<00:06:34.449> green<00:06:34.810> and<00:06:35.050> what

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
like a cross that goes green and what

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.770 
like a cross that goes green and what
now<00:06:35.460> so<00:06:36.460> nothing<00:06:37.030> much<00:06:37.180> to<00:06:37.330> see<00:06:37.509> there<00:06:37.630> of

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
now so nothing much to see there of

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.360 
now so nothing much to see there of
course<00:06:37.960> but<00:06:39.360> that's<00:06:40.360> part<00:06:41.080> of<00:06:41.139> the<00:06:41.470> the<00:06:42.159> main

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
course but that's part of the the main

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:49.770 
course but that's part of the the main
package<00:06:42.880> okay<00:06:46.650> so<00:06:47.650> you<00:06:48.220> use<00:06:48.520> it<00:06:48.669> like<00:06:48.789> that<00:06:49.060> but

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
package okay so you use it like that but

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.830 
package okay so you use it like that but
you<00:06:49.900> can<00:06:50.050> take<00:06:50.229> it<00:06:50.409> across<00:06:51.150> as<00:06:52.150> long<00:06:52.360> as<00:06:52.479> it's<00:06:52.630> n

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 
you can take it across as long as it's n

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.749 
you can take it across as long as it's n
line<00:06:53.139> that's<00:06:53.680> what<00:06:53.919> matters<00:06:54.280> when<00:06:54.460> you<00:06:54.550> use<00:06:54.729> it

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 
line that's what matters when you use it

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:59.459 
line that's what matters when you use it
I<00:06:56.909> can<00:06:57.909> see<00:06:58.150> this<00:06:58.300> kind<00:06:58.509> of<00:06:58.659> working<00:06:59.050> and<00:06:59.199> stuff

00:06:59.459 --> 00:06:59.469 
I can see this kind of working and stuff

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:01.260 
I can see this kind of working and stuff
but<00:06:59.800> it<00:07:00.069> is<00:07:00.219> going<00:07:00.340> to<00:07:00.430> be<00:07:00.460> very<00:07:00.819> very

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270 
but it is going to be very very

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:07.290 
but it is going to be very very
interesting<00:07:02.020> to<00:07:02.169> use<00:07:04.500> yeah<00:07:05.500> so<00:07:06.000> maybe<00:07:07.000> check

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:07.300 
interesting to use yeah so maybe check

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.379 
interesting to use yeah so maybe check
these<00:07:07.449> out<00:07:07.599> soon<00:07:07.960> try<00:07:08.409> out<00:07:08.469> some<00:07:08.740> games<00:07:09.009> and

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:09.389 
these out soon try out some games and

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:12.779 
these out soon try out some games and
hopefully<00:07:10.389> put<00:07:10.509> something<00:07:10.870> up<00:07:10.960> soon<00:07:11.110> so<00:07:11.789> see

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:12.789 
hopefully put something up soon so see
