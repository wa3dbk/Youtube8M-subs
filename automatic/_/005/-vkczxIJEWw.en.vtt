00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
pretty key when you're picking out a

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.730 
pretty key when you're picking out a

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150

here<00:00:57.510> I've<00:00:57.660> got<00:00:58.350> him<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.560> a<00:00:58.590> glove<00:00:58.860> chemistry

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
here I've got him on a glove chemistry

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.920 
here I've got him on a glove chemistry
style<00:00:59.610> I<00:00:59.730> find<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.240> best<00:01:00.420> rounded<00:01:00.810> one

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
style I find it's the best rounded one

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.850 
style I find it's the best rounded one
it's<00:01:01.080> just<00:01:01.110> have<00:01:01.290> a<00:01:01.350> look<00:01:01.440> at<00:01:01.560> the<00:01:01.650> others

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
it's just have a look at the others

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.189 
it's just have a look at the others
though<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.070> can<00:01:02.310> use<00:01:02.520> wall<00:01:02.850> shield<00:01:03.810> or<00:01:03.960> cat

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
though you can use wall shield or cat

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.990 
though you can use wall shield or cat
but<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> fine<00:01:04.830> glove<00:01:05.100> gives<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> best<00:01:05.550> rounded

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
but a fine glove gives the best rounded

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.390 
but a fine glove gives the best rounded
stat<00:01:06.540> boost<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.930> gives<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.290> dive<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.070> handling

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
stat boost it gives you dive in handling

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.010 
stat boost it gives you dive in handling
and<00:01:08.610> positioning<00:01:09.150> now<00:01:09.300> that's<00:01:09.570> key<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:09.810> my

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
and positioning now that's key for my

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.150 
and positioning now that's key for my
key<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.320> that's<00:01:10.440> just<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> way<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> play<00:01:11.100> you

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
key but that's just the way I play you

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.920 
key but that's just the way I play you
can<00:01:11.460> use<00:01:11.610> any<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.910> others<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.300> I<00:01:12.450> tend<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
can use any of the others but I tend to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.380 
can use any of the others but I tend to
use<00:01:12.990> glove<00:01:13.550> moving<00:01:14.550> on<00:01:14.610> two<00:01:14.729> centre-backs<00:01:15.090> I'd

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
use glove moving on two centre-backs I'd

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.550

to be put in a anco card on them to the
get<00:01:25.740> pace<00:01:25.920> boost<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> ones<00:01:27.300> i've<00:01:27.540> used

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
get pace boost but the ones i've used

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.560 
get pace boost but the ones i've used
have<00:01:27.930> got<00:01:28.080> over<00:01:28.380> 75<00:01:28.830> pace<00:01:29.130> or<00:01:29.369> 75<00:01:29.970> pace<00:01:30.210> dead<00:01:30.450> on

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
some right backs i tend to use an anchor

some right backs i tend to use an anchor
card<00:01:37.920> i've<00:01:38.100> seen<00:01:38.280> people<00:01:38.400> using<00:01:38.820> shadow<00:01:39.090> which

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
card i've seen people using shadow which

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.580 
card i've seen people using shadow which
is<00:01:39.479> absolutely<00:01:39.660> fine<00:01:40.020> because<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.350> gives<00:01:40.440> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
is absolutely fine because it gives a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.620 
is absolutely fine because it gives a
pace<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:41.130> defend<00:01:41.430> him<00:01:41.550> boost<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:42.390> they<00:01:42.450> tend

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
pace and defend him boost but they tend

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.620 
pace and defend him boost but they tend
to<00:01:42.690> go<00:01:42.890> way<00:01:43.890> too<00:01:43.950> far<00:01:44.130> forward<00:01:44.640> far<00:01:45.270> too<00:01:45.420> often

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
to go way too far forward far too often

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.410 
to go way too far forward far too often
so<00:01:46.320> i<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.590> use<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.220> anchor<00:01:47.940> card<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.240> those

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
central defensive mid on this one so

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:52.790

this<00:02:21.680> is<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.860> team<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.160> comp<00:02:22.310> against<00:02:22.610> it's

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
this is the team of comp against it's

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.510 
this is the team of comp against it's
fairly<00:02:23.120> pasty<00:02:23.750> but<00:02:23.870> not<00:02:24.020> too<00:02:24.200> bad<00:02:24.410> plan<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.070> 442

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
fairly pasty but not too bad plan of 442

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.220 
fairly pasty but not too bad plan of 442
but<00:02:25.910> he's<00:02:26.000> got<00:02:26.120> two<00:02:26.300> central<00:02:26.690> defensive<00:02:27.050> mid

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
but he's got two central defensive mid

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.660 
but he's got two central defensive mid
so<00:02:27.350> he's<00:02:27.470> going<00:02:27.710> for<00:02:27.770> a<00:02:27.830> defensive<00:02:28.250> option<00:02:28.550> as

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
so he's going for a defensive option as

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.160 
so he's going for a defensive option as
well<00:02:28.700> as<00:02:28.940> us<00:02:29.090> we'll<00:02:29.600> see<00:02:29.750> how<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:29.960> one<00:02:30.140> plays

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760

goals<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.240> such<00:02:32.420> but<00:02:32.750> we'll<00:02:32.990> see<00:02:33.140> how<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.260> goes

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
goals and such but we'll see how it goes

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.500 
goals and such but we'll see how it goes
the<00:02:36.350> key<00:02:36.500> thing<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.710> do<00:02:36.920> is<00:02:37.250> not<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:38.060> panic<00:02:38.210> I

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
the key thing to do is not to panic I

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.910 
the key thing to do is not to panic I
know<00:02:38.630> he's<00:02:38.750> played<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.960> three<00:02:39.200> ball<00:02:39.410> here<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:39.860> I

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
know he's played a three ball here and I

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.080 
know he's played a three ball here and I
did<00:02:40.070> panic<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.370> little<00:02:40.400> bit<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.700> want<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:40.940> keep

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
did panic a little bit I want to keep

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.760 
did panic a little bit I want to keep
her<00:02:41.240> out<00:02:41.360> then<00:02:41.840> my<00:02:41.930> defender<00:02:42.320> started<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.650> come

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
her out then my defender started to come

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.100 
her out then my defender started to come
out<00:02:42.860> as<00:02:43.010> well<00:02:43.130> but<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.780> think<00:02:44.780> we've<00:02:44.900> got<00:02:45.020> to

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.210 
out as well but I think we've got to
trust<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.410> players<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.680> little<00:02:45.890> bit<00:02:45.980> more<00:02:46.130> in

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
trust the players a little bit more in

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.920 
trust the players a little bit more in
