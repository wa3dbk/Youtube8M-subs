don't<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:48.640> think<00:00:48.760> you're<00:00:48.910> falling<00:00:49.270> a<00:00:49.300> little

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
don't you think you're falling a little

don't you think you're falling a little
too<00:00:49.660> close<00:00:49.960> not<00:00:50.650> really<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:52.390> that<00:00:52.600> silver

golfer not a force of you why don't you

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.530 
golfer not a force of you why don't you
leave<00:00:57.190> a<00:00:57.220> little<00:00:57.520> more<00:00:57.670> space<00:00:57.970> between<00:00:58.180> you

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.490 

now<00:01:01.879> that's<00:01:02.090> better<00:01:02.329> you<00:01:02.989> always<00:01:03.260> want<00:01:03.440> to

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
now that's better you always want to

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.380 
now that's better you always want to
leave<00:01:03.649> about<00:01:03.920> three<00:01:03.980> second<00:01:04.760> space<00:01:04.970> cushion

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
leave about three second space cushion

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.969 
leave about three second space cushion
between<00:01:05.479> you<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.080> car<00:01:06.290> in<00:01:06.470> front<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:06.830> you

between you and the car in front of you

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.420 
between you and the car in front of you
okay<00:01:07.790> but<00:01:08.540> this<00:01:08.720> looks<00:01:08.900> like<00:01:09.110> more<00:01:09.320> like<00:01:09.430> 250

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
okay but this looks like more like 250

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.520 
okay but this looks like more like 250
feet<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:10.909> why<00:01:11.090> not<00:01:11.240> just<00:01:11.450> call<00:01:11.600> it<00:01:11.659> back<00:01:11.930> why

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
feet so why not just call it back why

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.859 
feet so why not just call it back why
call<00:01:12.799> it<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:12.979> three-second<00:01:13.640> well<00:01:14.479> you<00:01:14.690> are

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
call it a three-second well you are

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.550 
call it a three-second well you are
correct<00:01:15.200> we<00:01:15.470> are<00:01:15.619> falling<00:01:15.950> about<00:01:16.450> 250<00:01:17.450> feet

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
correct we are falling about 250 feet

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.109 
correct we are falling about 250 feet
but<00:01:18.560> it's<00:01:18.800> not<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.070> distance<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:19.850> feet<00:01:20.090> that

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
but it's not the distance and feet that

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.270 
but it's not the distance and feet that
matters<00:01:20.720> is<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.110> distance<00:01:21.470> in<00:01:21.649> reaction-time

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
matters is the distance in reaction-time

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.340 
matters is the distance in reaction-time
and<00:01:22.820> that<00:01:22.940> varies<00:01:23.390> on<00:01:23.420> how<00:01:23.690> fast<00:01:24.020> we're<00:01:24.320> going

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
and that varies on how fast we're going

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.490 
and that varies on how fast we're going
for<00:01:24.950> example<00:01:25.340> if<00:01:26.119> you're<00:01:26.330> going<00:01:26.479> 60<00:01:27.110> miles<00:01:27.290> per

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
for example if you're going 60 miles per

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.680 
for example if you're going 60 miles per
hour<00:01:27.590> which<00:01:27.830> we<00:01:28.040> are<00:01:28.159> which<00:01:29.060> is<00:01:29.090> five<00:01:29.450> miles

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
hour which we are which is five miles

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
increases your reaction time decreases

let's say you're going 120 miles proud I

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.520 
let's say you're going 120 miles proud I
know<00:01:51.590> if<00:01:52.580> you<00:01:52.850> see<00:01:53.119> something<00:01:53.420> 300<00:01:53.869> feet<00:01:54.409> ahead

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
know if you see something 300 feet ahead

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.520 
know if you see something 300 feet ahead
of<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:55.039> you<00:01:55.759> had<00:01:56.030> less<00:01:56.330> than<00:01:56.360> two<00:01:56.810> seconds<00:01:57.409> to

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
of you you had less than two seconds to

react to it

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.120 
react to it
which<00:01:58.930> means<00:01:59.200> you<00:01:59.350> would<00:01:59.470> probably<00:01:59.920> hit<00:02:00.070> it

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
which means you would probably hit it

before I even reach that problem well I

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.060 
before I even reach that problem well I
was<00:02:19.720> going<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.959> say<00:02:20.140> you'd<00:02:20.290> have<00:02:20.410> about<00:02:20.530> 40

varies on how fast you're going but the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.670 
varies on how fast you're going but the
actual<00:02:29.470> time<00:02:29.830> stays<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.850> same<00:02:31.120> three<00:02:31.870> seconds

as<00:03:55.770> a<00:03:55.830> new<00:03:56.400> driver<00:03:56.580> you<00:03:57.000> have<00:03:57.240> to<00:03:57.420> be<00:03:57.540> able<00:03:57.660> to

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
as a new driver you have to be able to

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.080 
as a new driver you have to be able to
judge<00:03:58.050> two<00:03:58.380> things<00:03:58.680> reaction<00:03:59.640> time<00:03:59.850> and

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
judge two things reaction time and

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.660 
judge two things reaction time and
distance<00:04:00.780> as<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.500> said<00:04:01.740> before<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.220> faster

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
distance as you said before the faster

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.700 
distance as you said before the faster
you<00:04:02.760> go<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:02.970> less<00:04:03.270> reaction<00:04:04.050> time<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:04.440> have

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
you go the less reaction time you have

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.740 
you go the less reaction time you have
and<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.490> doesn't<00:04:05.820> just<00:04:05.850> mean<00:04:06.120> reacting<00:04:06.690> to

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
and that doesn't just mean reacting to

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.020 
and that doesn't just mean reacting to
things<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:07.080> potholes<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:08.010> other<00:04:08.400> drivers

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
things like potholes and other drivers

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.720 
things like potholes and other drivers
it<00:04:09.960> also<00:04:10.140> means<00:04:10.350> something<00:04:10.860> as<00:04:10.950> simple<00:04:11.160> as<00:04:11.370> an

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
it also means something as simple as an

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.460 
it also means something as simple as an
intersection<00:04:12.360> like<00:04:12.510> this<00:04:12.690> one<00:04:12.930> see<00:04:13.320> that
