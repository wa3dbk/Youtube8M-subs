Richthofen<00:02:26.890> plans<00:02:27.220> because<00:02:27.430> he<00:02:27.640> tells<00:02:27.910> them

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
Richthofen plans because he tells them

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.240 
Richthofen plans because he tells them
to<00:02:28.329> accept<00:02:29.019> their<00:02:29.140> feet<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.620> begin<00:02:29.920> anew

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
to accept their feet and begin anew

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.160

after<00:02:30.940> he<00:02:31.060> dies<00:02:31.269> and<00:02:31.510> i<00:02:31.569> believe<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:31.930> on<00:02:32.049> about

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
after he dies and i believe is on about

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.830 
after he dies and i believe is on about

the<00:02:34.870> plans<00:02:35.290> of<00:02:35.440> Richthofen<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.099> be<00:02:36.220> screwed<00:02:36.610> up

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
the plans of Richthofen to be screwed up

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.699 
the plans of Richthofen to be screwed up
so<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.060> seems<00:02:37.329> that<00:02:37.810> their<00:02:37.989> memory<00:02:38.349> is<00:02:38.440> wiped

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
so it seems that their memory is wiped

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.890 
so it seems that their memory is wiped
then<00:02:39.099> they<00:02:39.220> are<00:02:39.310> sent<00:02:39.549> back<00:02:39.760> but<00:02:40.150> Samuel<00:02:40.690> still

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
then they are sent back but Samuel still

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.050 
then they are sent back but Samuel still
has<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.019> fragment<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.650> his<00:02:41.920> memory<00:02:42.280> left<00:02:42.459> hence

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
has a fragment of his memory left hence

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.479 
has a fragment of his memory left hence
he<00:02:43.360> says<00:02:43.569> have<00:02:43.900> we<00:02:44.079> been<00:02:44.230> here<00:02:44.290> before<00:02:44.650> if<00:02:45.340> you

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
he says have we been here before if you

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:46.860 
he says have we been here before if you
want<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.760> read<00:02:45.910> this<00:02:46.030> for<00:02:46.150> yourself<00:02:46.329> I<00:02:46.599> believe

this is going to all affect how our next

this is going to all affect how our next
map<00:03:14.859> is<00:03:15.010> gonna<00:03:15.130> play<00:03:15.370> out<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.730> know<00:03:15.850> all<00:03:16.000> their

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
map is gonna play out you know all their

memories still gonna be white are they
still<00:03:18.400> going<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.670> be<00:03:18.730> wondering<00:03:19.090> where<00:03:19.329> they

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
still going to be wondering where they

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.940 
still going to be wondering where they
are<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:20.170> again<00:03:20.500> it's<00:03:20.650> going<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.829> be<00:03:20.920> very

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
are and again it's going to be very

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.470 
are and again it's going to be very
interesting<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.850> see<00:03:22.000> what's<00:03:22.180> going<00:03:22.329> to<00:03:22.389> be

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
interesting to see what's going to be

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.000 
interesting to see what's going to be
happening<00:03:22.510> on<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.019> next<00:03:23.290> map<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.590> ripped<00:03:23.859> off

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
happening on the next map is ripped off

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.080 
happening on the next map is ripped off
and<00:03:24.130> still<00:03:24.370> going<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.579> be<00:03:24.639> screwing<00:03:24.910> around

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
and still going to be screwing around

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.030 
and still going to be screwing around
with<00:03:25.359> their<00:03:25.540> minds<00:03:25.959> now<00:03:26.380> talking<00:03:26.680> about<00:03:26.829> the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
with their minds now talking about the

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.500 
with their minds now talking about the
next<00:03:27.280> map<00:03:27.430> I'm<00:03:27.549> gonna<00:03:27.700> predict<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.209> will<00:03:28.329> be

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
next map I'm gonna predict it will be

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.830 
next map I'm gonna predict it will be
out<00:03:28.829> late<00:03:29.829> April<00:03:30.609> early<00:03:30.790> made<00:03:31.359> that<00:03:31.569> time

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
out late April early made that time

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.660 
out late April early made that time
because<00:03:31.959> that's<00:03:32.290> when<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.650> map<00:03:33.250> packs<00:03:33.489> for

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
because that's when the map packs for

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.280 
because that's when the map packs for
all<00:03:33.790> of<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.060> cards<00:03:34.359> usually<00:03:34.840> come<00:03:34.989> out<00:03:35.109> around

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
all of the cards usually come out around

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.629 
all of the cards usually come out around
that<00:03:35.620> time<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:36.010> don't<00:03:36.130> quote<00:03:36.310> me<00:03:36.489> on<00:03:36.519> that

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
that time so don't quote me on that

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.129 
that time so don't quote me on that
again<00:03:36.940> but<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.180> think<00:03:37.389> that's<00:03:37.569> a<00:03:37.660> very<00:03:37.810> accurate

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
again but I think that's a very accurate
