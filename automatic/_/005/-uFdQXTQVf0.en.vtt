00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:11.130
 was once a different story 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.429
 the story of three little pigs that were 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.890
 exiled from their time and space and 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.890
 moved to a very curious village 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:33.149
 the reason why they were the sides 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.920
 they were not easy thought he argued that 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.680
 they questioned everything around 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.629
 until one day they called the form of 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.280
 government of their countries and suddenly 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.590
 take a foot in the butt of their rulers 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.079
 of the state does not sympathize with thinkers 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.039
 so bold that they could take the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.680
 power 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.420
 the first bit was hobbies that are 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.520
 building their little house of ideas and 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.559
 failures in their questions about the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.870
 government imagined how it would be one of 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.379
 ports without the laws that the organization 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.060
 civil society 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.830
 suppose they were ferocious aggressors 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.799
 warred for their desires and 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.979
 needs only descended attacked 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.570
 and the key did not thrive then 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.520
 few should give up their 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.189
 rights to a king who should also 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.140
 give up your personal wants all 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.259
 in favor of collectivity 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.240
 the second bit was called locke and 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.549
 build your little house of ideas and 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.119
 wood in its questions and 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.799
 imaginations about the state of nature 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.750
 believed that civil society only 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.750
 existed from the idea of ​​ownership 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.899
 the government of that society should be 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.899
 by the union of peoples ' ideas 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.150
 choosing some to govern through 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.150
 of your thoughts 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:31.240
 the third used to build his little 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.430
 ideas and bricks questioned the 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.010
 social inequality through their 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.460
 and the nature of the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.460
 public 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.360
 for him the pigs were stuck 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.940
 impressed with the new scared 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.160
 worried more about surviving than about 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.280
 conflicts did not have ambitions of 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:05.050
 glory reputation neither power nor concepts 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:07.890
 good or bad to the ideal society for 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.510
 they were free and equal people 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.230
 wanting the good of the community and 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.959
 learning this through education 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.959
 But society saw 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.030
 a day of a breath so strong but so 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.090
 strong that the little house of ten goals 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.500
 Finally, civil society remains 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.959
 independent of ideas 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.390
 she builds and destroys whatever she wants because 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.890
 it is concrete and self-sufficient and above 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.890
 of everything composed by all
