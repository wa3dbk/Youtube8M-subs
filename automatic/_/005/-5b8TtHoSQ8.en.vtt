00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:15.640
 we generate 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.360

 they are easy they are simple 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:22.199
 and it's not so much 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.689
 to get in 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.219
 Ali has another person 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.509

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:39.369
 in your case 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:40.190
 when 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.239

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.529
 I act 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:46.979
 let's go back 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.979
 We have here 2 daniel link 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.700
 soon we wait 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.929
 because finally 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:55.449
 have this 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:57.409
 your skin in total and without 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.809
 this does not serve jenson forecasts does not serve us 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:05.760
 ic intopress the slow session from scratch because the man from whom they will be offered 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:06.599
 by 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.760
 we stretch 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.760
 this region dollars not 9na and who will play with 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.120
 remember to be alert for when 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.149
 that they are going to get their son 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.359
 so it was 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.849
 and this 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.519
 in which other staff 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.349
 for playing in suite 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.879
 Galindo people will be 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.149
 when you play them with a person 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.369
 the other does not just have to put in the useful post year 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.260
 restless sancho 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.210
 for these facts 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.569
 putting into play 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.089
 I believe that 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:46.199
 in total it's all 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.199
 only goes in season and cinnamon and with another person 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:52.899
 yes non stop loss internal circulation of the damaged state 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.900
 If I do not enter, I recommend this that a friend taught me 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:58.500
 only for 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.679
 Luis Aviles 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:01.119
 but lord this 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:02.419

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:03.879
 ozaki and start 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.189
 control Panel 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.189
 we leave or not this occasion uu 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.439
 I know it sounds like something 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.779
 for bolt or very cloudy 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:18.139
 then in two 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.139
 I do not want to have activated only when they do not enter 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:25.029
 we can not put off 

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:27.080
 that is in case of not entering 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.970
 but eye 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.770
 when we have disabled 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.150
 we can only 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.349
 play in our criteria 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:39.270
 we can not enter both items from other people I know it sounds a bit confusing 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.270
 but little could do the same 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:44.860
