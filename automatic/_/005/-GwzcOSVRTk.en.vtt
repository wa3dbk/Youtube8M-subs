00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.039 
the challenge especially the vector if
you<00:01:35.640> get<00:01:35.970> point-blank<00:01:36.329> range<00:01:36.600> with<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
you get point-blank range with the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.359 
you get point-blank range with the
vector<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.530> will<00:01:37.680> drop<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.009> juggernaut

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
vector it will drop the juggernaut

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.249 
vector it will drop the juggernaut
before<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.090> unload<00:01:39.329> an<00:01:39.450> entire<00:01:39.720> clip<00:01:40.020> so

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
before you can unload an entire clip so

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.560 
before you can unload an entire clip so
that<00:01:40.439> kind<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.680> sucks<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:42.030> if<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.270> missed<00:01:42.450> my

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
that kind of sucks so if you missed my

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.120 
that kind of sucks so if you missed my
surgical<00:01:42.960> video<00:01:43.200> you'll<00:01:43.710> want<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.920> use<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
surgical video you'll want to use the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
surgical video you'll want to use the
same<00:01:44.340> strategy<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:45.240> throw<00:01:45.570> your<00:01:45.720> juggernaut

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
same strategy you throw your juggernaut

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.020 
same strategy you throw your juggernaut
recon<00:01:46.470> down<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.130> hope<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.490> your<00:01:47.610> teammates

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
recon down and hope that your teammates

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.120 
recon down and hope that your teammates
won't<00:01:48.360> take<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:48.990> before<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> enemy<00:01:49.560> does<00:01:49.710> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
won't take it before the enemy does I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.280 
won't take it before the enemy does I
know<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.210> always<00:01:51.390> possible<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:52.110> try

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
know this is not always possible so try

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.600 
know this is not always possible so try
to<00:01:52.320> announce<00:01:52.619> over<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.979> microphone<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.549> you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
to announce over the microphone that you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.160 
to announce over the microphone that you
want<00:01:53.820> your<00:01:54.000> enemies<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.600> take<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.079> not

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
want your enemies to take it and not

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.749 
want your enemies to take it and not
your<00:01:55.350> teammates<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.159> there's<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.399> slightly

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
your teammates so there's a slightly

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.999 
your teammates so there's a slightly
different<00:01:57.180> technique<00:01:57.360> used<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.860> after

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
different technique used here so after

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.679 
different technique used here so after
you<00:01:59.219> throw<00:01:59.340> your<00:01:59.460> juggernaut<00:01:59.820> recon<00:02:00.149> down<00:02:00.390> and

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
you throw your juggernaut recon down and

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.780 
you throw your juggernaut recon down and
the<00:02:00.960> enemy<00:02:01.200> does<00:02:01.439> take<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.860> you'll<00:02:02.520> want<00:02:02.729> to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the enemy does take it you'll want to

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.850 
the enemy does take it you'll want to
try<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.030> get<00:02:03.210> as<00:02:03.329> close<00:02:03.360> as<00:02:03.960> possible<00:02:04.079> now<00:02:04.829> with

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
try to get as close as possible now with

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.830 
try to get as close as possible now with
the<00:02:05.130> assault<00:02:05.340> rifle<00:02:05.460> patch<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.390> wasn't<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
the assault rifle patch this wasn't the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.270 
the assault rifle patch this wasn't the
case<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.259> could<00:02:07.380> stand<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.799> good<00:02:07.950> distance

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
case you could stand a good distance

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.859 
case you could stand a good distance
away<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.670> still<00:02:08.879> unload<00:02:09.179> your<00:02:09.330> entire<00:02:09.569> clip

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
away and still unload your entire clip

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.390 
away and still unload your entire clip
without<00:02:10.170> having<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.679> worry<00:02:10.830> about<00:02:10.860> accuracy

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
without having to worry about accuracy

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.330 
without having to worry about accuracy
but<00:02:12.090> apparently<00:02:12.540> with<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.690> SMG

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
but apparently with the SMG

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.920 
but apparently with the SMG
and<00:02:13.519> I<00:02:13.640> figured<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.120> was<00:02:14.269> the<00:02:14.390> problem<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:14.810> my

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
and I figured that was the problem in my

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.930 
and I figured that was the problem in my
earlier<00:02:15.290> clips<00:02:15.590> accuracy<00:02:16.400> may<00:02:16.580> be<00:02:16.640> an<00:02:16.790> issue

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
earlier clips accuracy may be an issue

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.550 
earlier clips accuracy may be an issue
so<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.390> recommend<00:02:17.900> getting<00:02:17.989> right<00:02:18.260> up<00:02:18.379> in<00:02:18.500> his

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
so I recommend getting right up in his

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.259 
so I recommend getting right up in his
face<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:19.069> then<00:02:19.190> loading<00:02:19.550> your<00:02:19.640> entire<00:02:19.940> clip

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
face and then loading your entire clip

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.479 
face and then loading your entire clip
so<00:02:20.750> once<00:02:20.930> again<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.379> strategy<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.250> attain

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
so once again the strategy is to attain

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.640 
so once again the strategy is to attain
them<00:02:22.640> juggernaut<00:02:23.000> recon<00:02:23.360> throw<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:23.989> down<00:02:24.200> let

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
them juggernaut recon throw it down let

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.530 
them juggernaut recon throw it down let
your<00:02:24.739> enemies<00:02:25.099> take<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.489> try<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.120> flank<00:02:26.390> around

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
your enemies take it try to flank around

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.660 
your enemies take it try to flank around
the<00:02:26.840> juggernaut<00:02:27.230> stun<00:02:27.769> them<00:02:27.890> once<00:02:28.099> or<00:02:28.400> twice

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
the juggernaut stun them once or twice

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.580 
the juggernaut stun them once or twice
if<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.150> have<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.599> concussion<00:02:30.049> grenades<00:02:30.319> left

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
if you have to concussion grenades left

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.320 
if you have to concussion grenades left
and<00:02:31.069> then<00:02:31.190> get<00:02:31.370> right<00:02:31.580> up<00:02:31.760> beside<00:02:31.910> them<00:02:32.209> and

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
and then get right up beside them and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.789 
and then get right up beside them and
unload<00:02:32.599> your<00:02:32.629> entire<00:02:32.989> clip<00:02:33.260> right<00:02:33.440> into<00:02:33.680> his

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
unload your entire clip right into his

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.800 
unload your entire clip right into his
back<00:02:34.160> I'm<00:02:34.549> not<00:02:34.760> gonna<00:02:34.910> lie<00:02:35.150> this<00:02:35.180> probably

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
back I'm not gonna lie this probably

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.570 
back I'm not gonna lie this probably
took<00:02:36.049> me<00:02:36.110> at<00:02:36.410> least<00:02:36.650> eight<00:02:36.920> hours<00:02:37.099> of<00:02:37.280> game

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
took me at least eight hours of game

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.910 
took me at least eight hours of game
time<00:02:37.849> to<00:02:38.030> obtain<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.690> it's<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.319> lot<00:02:39.560> harder<00:02:39.799> than

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
time to obtain so it's a lot harder than

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.920 
time to obtain so it's a lot harder than
the<00:02:40.129> surgical<00:02:40.459> patch<00:02:40.730> if<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.510> have<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.690> full

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
the surgical patch if you have a full

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.539 
the surgical patch if you have a full
party<00:02:42.200> it'll<00:02:42.319> make<00:02:42.470> things<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.799> lot<00:02:42.920> easier<00:02:43.310> but

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
party it'll make things a lot easier but

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.100 
party it'll make things a lot easier but
I<00:02:43.760> just<00:02:44.120> couldn't<00:02:44.390> get<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.569> full<00:02:44.780> party

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
I just couldn't get a full party

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.539 
I just couldn't get a full party
together<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:45.799> I<00:02:45.829> had<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.040> work<00:02:46.190> with<00:02:46.220> what<00:02:46.519> I

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
together so I had to work with what I

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.640 
together so I had to work with what I
had<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.329> possible<00:02:47.870> let<00:02:47.900> me<00:02:48.170> assure<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.410> as

little patience you'll get this patch -

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.770 
little patience you'll get this patch -
there<00:02:52.819> have<00:02:52.910> been<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.090> lot<00:02:53.209> of<00:02:53.239> requests<00:02:53.630> for

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
there have been a lot of requests for

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.780 
there have been a lot of requests for
the<00:02:53.900> dictator<00:02:54.319> as<00:02:54.560> well<00:02:54.769> as<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.010> 20/20<00:02:55.549> pets

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
the dictator as well as the 20/20 pets

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.370 
the dictator as well as the 20/20 pets
which<00:02:56.209> just<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:56.750> happened<00:02:57.079> to<00:02:57.110> be<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.349> last

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
which just so happened to be the last
