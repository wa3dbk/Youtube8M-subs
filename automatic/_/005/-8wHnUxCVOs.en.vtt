00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.332
 Course: How to create a website 

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.466
 Unit 3 - Organizing pages 

00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.066
 Lesson 3.2 - Changing page order 

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:11.632
 In this lesson we will teach you how to change the order of the menu pages. 

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:14.599
 See: our site is like this. 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.700
 Let's put the last page we created, 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.266
 "Promotions" next to "Products" 

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:24.499
 and leave the "Contact Us" page last. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.266
 We will close this tab and enter the system in "Pages" 

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:32.832
 Ready! Let's change the order of the menu. 

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:36.733
 See that this list here is the order we see in the menu. 

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.666
 Click on this area of ​​the page you want to change 

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.099
 and holding the clicked mouse 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.266
 drag to where you want to place the page. 

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.999
 Let's put it under "Products". 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.433
 Ready. 

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:54.299
 To see how it looks, click "Preview". 

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:59.199
 See: "Promotions" page has moved 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.166
 and was next to "Products". 

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.132
 You could also place the promotions page 

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.799
 inside the product page. 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.166
 Creating a subpage. 

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.499
 Let's see how this is done. 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.800
 Let's leave this area and return to SitePX by closing this tab. 

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:22.199
 Click on the "Promotion" page 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.666
 and drag into the products page. 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.933
 Notice that an arrow 

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:31.466
 indicating that it will be a subpage. 

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:39.766
 Let's see how it was on the site by clicking on view. 

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.866
 See: the "Promotions" page does not appear in the menu 

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:45.999
 But if you hover over "products" it appears 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.133
 the "promotions" subpage 

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.899
 You can make as many subpages as you want 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.000
 on each page of the menu. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.600
 Everything very simple
