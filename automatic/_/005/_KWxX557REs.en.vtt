00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.699

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.769
 good then since we are melting we start again 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.000

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.800
 because otherwise well me neither 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.550
 I do not believe it and with the soundtrack 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.410
 phenomenal that I prepared you the 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.430
 friends not only will that compensate for the 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.570
 misplaces of recent days but in 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.400
 the more the lyrics to go out 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.960
 unimaginable sadr has much better as his 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.490
 friends is a great song sure 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.560
 pablo the marabouts rebuild and the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.850
 two paintings we are lucky we say he 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.860
 there I can for us cost a lot 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.560
 pawn forests peace plus my 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:32.050
 little by little remixer are fine 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.090
 I'm sorry to have to you yes he 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.200
 have to tell them I regret 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.119
 to have to tell you that after a long 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.670
 discussion with that with you with my 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.229
 road with marotti it is no longer 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.970
 possible to include your song in the 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.740
 show not antonio but sega of a 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.820
 antonio pablo you told us that it 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.990
 was worth a try that we 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.610
 would have time and that's true of 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.410
 left I was wrong antonio is right 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.700
 we do not have enough time for that 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.899
 choreography is quite developed 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.979
 and since these young people have 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.560
 words I do not see why he does not 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.149
 would not present it gregorio the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.170
 choreography is quite the point 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.119
 it's true but again they 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.380
 try to stop with his powerful 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.610
 to showcase your work by 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.750
 relation to the work of others 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.330
 it's not good in a moment by 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.489
 antonio it's not at all what I 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.780
 want what I want is to give a vote 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.910
 of trust to each of them they 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.380
 worked very hard to do it there 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.420
 we only have the words to good 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.010
 know and we still have time 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.340
 we trust this is not the spirit 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.810
 of this web studio to surpass itself and not 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.250
 to cross your arms no wait 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.660
 wait it does not happen like it does 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.820
 could not claim to climb directly 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.799
 on stage and improvised rising 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.120
 those who all know the 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.440
 choreography and they have everything for 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.579
 repeat the shock 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.200
 it's true or it's not true what I 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.610
 say yes if everything was there the children have 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.600
 the talent needed to be able to 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.070
 do I do not see why he does not 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.239
 could not present that I have a lot of 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.820
 trust in them they can do it 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.720
 no problem 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.500
 that's what I do not believe in the killer 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.420
 what do you think 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.490
 in fact they convinced me yes me 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.190
 also I am not sure 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.800
 excuse me exploded gourmet antonio you 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.000
 know his students as well run they 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.350
 have made enormous efforts they have 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.850
 worked really hard to get there I 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.650
 believe it deserves to be able to express itself 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.070
 we will not regret it I know 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.070
 what I am saying 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:18.250
 well I give you my vote of 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:18.250
 trust we still have nothing
