00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:20.930

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.500

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.510

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.460

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:33.020
 disgusting but respectable trait 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.950
 they don't want to get into the attic 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.960
 but we want it is another and we 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.080
 just need to know what is over 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.050
 I still know him today 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.720
 we still have time to climb there and so now 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.030
 we need to get to the attic and 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.200
 nobody saw us as evil grandfather 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.490

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.180

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.190
 I hope otherwise grandpa will ruin our whole 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.190
 plan 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:25.860
 grandpa cut b without show edge to 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.930

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.349

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.169
 everyone is called and threatened yes so and for some reason 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:44.370
 on and in the presence of ancestors should be called 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:46.620
 her memory even has and I don't know her 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:51.330
 Th it's better to think that we still 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:55.819
 We are sitting in the attic of a lot of the right to appear 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:06:01.979
 and how we need to get on the roof 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:04.639
 preferably do not boil down 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.639
 masters 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:15.520

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:23.630

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.590
