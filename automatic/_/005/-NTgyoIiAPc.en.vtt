got this from shop go for 498 I believe

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.170 
got this from shop go for 498 I believe
it<00:00:17.699> was<00:00:18.560> so<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.890> little<00:00:20.609> under<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.939> dollar

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
it was so just a little under a dollar

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.880 
it was so just a little under a dollar
more<00:00:21.539> than<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.750> regular<00:00:22.109> booster<00:00:22.410> packs<00:00:22.619> cost

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
more than the regular booster packs cost

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.220 
more than the regular booster packs cost
