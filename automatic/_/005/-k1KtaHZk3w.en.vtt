translation of this show I've ever seen
it<00:04:10.120> really<00:04:10.389> feels<00:04:10.629> like<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.930> publishers<00:04:11.470> put

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
it really feels like the publishers put

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.080 
it really feels like the publishers put
the<00:04:11.799> least<00:04:12.010> amount<00:04:12.250> of<00:04:12.340> effort<00:04:12.519> into<00:04:12.970> making

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
the least amount of effort into making

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.909 
the least amount of effort into making
the<00:04:13.479> game<00:04:13.659> as<00:04:13.840> possible<00:04:14.049> there<00:04:14.769> is<00:04:14.799> a

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
the game as possible there is a

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.800 
the game as possible there is a
two-player<00:04:15.370> mode<00:04:15.459> that<00:04:16.120> was<00:04:16.239> only<00:04:16.510> slightly

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
two-player mode that was only slightly

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.810 
two-player mode that was only slightly
more<00:04:17.289> fun<00:04:17.530> than<00:04:17.620> a<00:04:17.709> single-player<00:04:18.159> game<00:04:18.250> only

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
more fun than a single-player game only

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.069 
more fun than a single-player game only
because<00:04:19.180> they<00:04:19.299> randomly<00:04:19.659> give<00:04:19.930> you<00:04:20.049> a

I<00:04:33.970> saw<00:04:34.150> about<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.419> gameplay<00:04:34.870> was<00:04:35.169> that<00:04:35.380> it<00:04:35.500> was

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
I saw about the gameplay was that it was

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.990 
I saw about the gameplay was that it was
very<00:04:35.800> quick<00:04:36.190> and<00:04:36.490> you'll<00:04:36.699> beat<00:04:36.880> the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
very quick and you'll beat the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.339 
very quick and you'll beat the
single-player<00:04:37.389> game<00:04:37.690> in<00:04:37.840> about<00:04:38.050> two<00:04:38.320> hours
