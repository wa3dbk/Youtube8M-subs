00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the housing can be removed so in my case

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.330 
the housing can be removed so in my case
there<00:01:01.140> was<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> significant<00:01:01.980> amount<00:01:02.160> of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
motor I'll give the blower motor a few

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.850 
motor I'll give the blower motor a few
twists<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.860> already<00:01:26.189> feel<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.640> freeing<00:01:27.240> up

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
twists I can already feel it freeing up

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
twists I can already feel it freeing up
I'll<00:01:28.860> follow<00:01:29.430> up<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:30.030> some<00:01:30.180> Lube<00:01:30.450> I've<00:01:30.689> got

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
