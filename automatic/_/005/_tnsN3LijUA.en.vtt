regardless Rock mnemonics just awkwardly

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.710 
regardless Rock mnemonics just awkwardly
showed<00:00:02.580> my<00:00:02.760> LED<00:00:03.149> lights

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
showed my LED lights

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.539 
showed my LED lights
so<00:00:04.319> if<00:00:04.380> love<00:00:04.560> you<00:00:04.770> don't<00:00:05.040> know<00:00:05.160> how<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.400> throw

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
so if love you don't know how to throw

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.039 
so if love you don't know how to throw
this<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:06.120> be<00:00:06.240> fair<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.450> was<00:00:06.629> one<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.899> you

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
this and to be fair I was one of you

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.680 
this and to be fair I was one of you
that's<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.770> rude<00:00:07.980> albeit<00:00:08.400> no<00:00:09.240> idea<00:00:09.510> better

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
that's a rude albeit no idea better

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.150 
that's a rude albeit no idea better
choice<00:00:10.019> others<00:00:10.290> didn't<00:00:10.530> know<00:00:10.590> any<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:10.980> at

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
choice others didn't know any of this at

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.700 
choice others didn't know any of this at
school<00:00:11.370> or<00:00:11.429> anything<00:00:11.750> so<00:00:12.750> basically<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.620> have

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
school or anything so basically you have

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.950 
school or anything so basically you have
your<00:00:13.740> LEDs<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.700> these<00:00:14.849> are<00:00:15.030> three<00:00:15.269> watt<00:00:15.480> LEDs

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
your LEDs so these are three watt LEDs

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.510 
your LEDs so these are three watt LEDs
there's<00:00:16.350> three<00:00:16.590> blue<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.890> three<00:00:17.070> white<00:00:17.279> there

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
there's three blue and three white there

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.750 
there's three blue and three white there
now<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.570> totals<00:00:19.320> up<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.500> 18<00:00:19.980> watts<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.400> total

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
now that totals up to 18 watts of total

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.179 
now that totals up to 18 watts of total
power<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.689> need<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.960> LED<00:00:22.289> driver<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:23.039> will

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
power so I need the LED driver that will

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.880 
power so I need the LED driver that will
power<00:00:23.730> at<00:00:24.000> least<00:00:24.210> 18<00:00:24.660> was<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.529> anything

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
power at least 18 was this anything

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.660 
power at least 18 was this anything
driver<00:00:26.130> here<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.880> 20<00:00:27.330> watt<00:00:27.359> LED<00:00:28.170> driver

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
driver here is a 20 watt LED driver

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.160 
driver here is a 20 watt LED driver
that's<00:00:29.670> what<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.939> means<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.840> will<00:00:30.900> power

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
that's what that means is it will power

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.500 
that's what that means is it will power
up<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.529> 20<00:00:31.859> was<00:00:32.070> say<00:00:32.669> even<00:00:32.820> if<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.940> put<00:00:33.090> 25

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
up to 20 was say even if you put 25

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.450 
up to 20 was say even if you put 25
Watts<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.469> will<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.190> lower

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
Watts here it will just one of a lower

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.760 
Watts here it will just one of a lower
power<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.420> don't<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.320> want<00:00:37.620> them<00:00:37.710> at

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
power so don't on that you want them at

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.530 
power so don't on that you want them at
their<00:00:37.890> full<00:00:38.070> capacity<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:39.270> here

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
their full capacity and just here

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.569 
their full capacity and just here
there's<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.290> blue<00:00:40.440> team<00:00:40.620> potentiometer<00:00:41.340> which

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
there's a blue team potentiometer which

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.369 
there's a blue team potentiometer which
basically<00:00:41.879> means<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.750> adjust<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
basically means that I can adjust the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.150 
basically means that I can adjust the
apps<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.739> go<00:00:44.010> through<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.719> so<00:00:45.770> for<00:00:46.770> example

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
apps that go through here so for example

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.680 
apps that go through here so for example
I<00:00:47.280> don't<00:00:47.340> want<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.059> highlight<00:00:48.480> one

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
I don't want it going to highlight one

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.540 
I don't want it going to highlight one
amp<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.860> will<00:00:49.980> end<00:00:50.039> up<00:00:50.190> burning<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
amp because it will end up burning the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.569 
amp because it will end up burning the
LEDs<00:00:50.910> out<00:00:51.090> too<00:00:51.300> quickly<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.320> want<00:00:52.980> what<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.520> I

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
LEDs out too quickly I want what do I

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.220 
LEDs out too quickly I want what do I
have<00:00:53.699> Matt<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.239> roughly<00:00:54.690> around<00:00:54.899> a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
have Matt I have a roughly around a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.439 
have Matt I have a roughly around a
seven<00:00:55.559> hundred<00:00:55.969> seven<00:00:56.969> hundred<00:00:57.000> milliamps

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
seven hundred seven hundred milliamps

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.060 
seven hundred seven hundred milliamps
0.7<00:00:58.320> amps<00:00:58.559> okay<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.789> what<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.840> do<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.859> wire

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
0.7 amps okay so what you do just wire

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.050 
0.7 amps okay so what you do just wire
up<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.640> LED<00:01:03.149> drive<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> power<00:01:04.110> supply

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
up the LED drive up to a power supply

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.359 
up the LED drive up to a power supply
boom<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.930> clock<00:01:07.200> just<00:01:07.710> quickly<00:01:07.979> had<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.189> solder

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
boom so clock just quickly had to solder

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.679 
boom so clock just quickly had to solder
an<00:01:08.580> attachment<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.210> that's<00:01:09.299> why<00:01:09.510> I'm<00:01:09.600> in

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
an attachment on so that's why I'm in

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.500 
an attachment on so that's why I'm in
the<00:01:09.720> kitchen<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.400> then<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.939> here<00:01:12.150> also<00:01:12.330> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the kitchen and then in here also you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.450 
the kitchen and then in here also you
have<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.930> plus<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.439> minus<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.860> positive<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
have the plus and minus the positive and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.270 
have the plus and minus the positive and
negative<00:01:14.900> which<00:01:15.900> goes<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.409> your<00:01:16.439> eighty<00:01:16.710> days

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
negative which goes to your eighty days

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.770 
negative which goes to your eighty days
so<00:01:17.490> these<00:01:17.580> coming<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.030> what<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.270> also<00:01:18.390> did<00:01:18.720> was

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
so these coming on what I also did was

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.800 
so these coming on what I also did was
why<00:01:19.770> when<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.070> switch<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:21.240> good<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.540> makes<00:01:21.689> it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
why when I switch just good it makes it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.380 
why when I switch just good it makes it
easier<00:01:22.280> more<00:01:23.280> than<00:01:23.369> having<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.640> plug<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.180> go

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
easier more than having to plug and go

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.749 
easier more than having to plug and go
down<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> sockets<00:01:25.229> switch<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.189> plug<00:01:26.400> take

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
down to the sockets switch to plug take

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.670 
down to the sockets switch to plug take
plug<00:01:27.000> out<00:01:27.210> makes<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.750> head<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> lot<00:01:28.200> easier

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
plug out makes it head of a lot easier

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.060 
plug out makes it head of a lot easier
why<00:01:29.610> comes<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.590> negative

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
why comes in and this is the negative

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.789 
why comes in and this is the negative
side<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.930> negative<00:01:34.170> side<00:01:34.350> goes<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
side here so the negative side goes to

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.480 
side here so the negative side goes to
that<00:01:35.040> one<00:01:35.150> around<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.720> there<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.439> there<00:01:37.710> back

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
that one around to there to there back

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.210 
that one around to there to there back
to<00:01:38.640> there<00:01:38.880> around<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.780> there<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:41.070> this

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
to there around and there and then this

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.410 
to there around and there and then this
one<00:01:41.400> goes<00:01:41.579> back<00:01:42.409> into<00:01:43.409> here<00:01:43.759> back<00:01:44.759> sorry<00:01:45.119> back

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
one goes back into here back sorry back

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.850 
one goes back into here back sorry back
into<00:01:45.780> there<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.159> what<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.340> use<00:01:47.670> was<00:01:48.119> some

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
into there and then what I use was some

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.149 
into there and then what I use was some
special<00:01:50.299> adhesive<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.720> would<00:01:52.100> try<00:01:53.100> and

next day dad did soldering

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.630 
next day dad did soldering
tinder<00:02:11.610> what's<00:02:11.819> in<00:02:12.060> each

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
tinder what's in each

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.309 
tinder what's in each
first<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:14.230> then<00:02:14.350> solder<00:02:14.710> it<00:02:14.800> on<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:17.050> each

first and then solder it on to each

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.520 
first and then solder it on to each
point<00:02:18.130> contact<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.930> you're<00:02:20.110> all<00:02:20.170> done

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
point contact and you're all done

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.949 
point contact and you're all done
so<00:02:20.650> I'll<00:02:20.860> show<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.069> now<00:02:21.280> I've<00:02:21.640> got<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.240> switch

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
so I'll show you now I've got the switch

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:23.880 
so I'll show you now I've got the switch
plugged<00:02:23.380> on<00:02:23.530> here

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
plugged on here

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.809 
plugged on here
and<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.819> driver<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.750> if<00:02:25.990> I<00:02:26.140> click<00:02:26.770> this<00:02:27.250> switch

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
and the driver so if I click this switch

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.699 
and the driver so if I click this switch
here<00:02:28.060> you'll<00:02:28.660> see<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.900> LEDs<00:02:29.170> come<00:02:29.380> already

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
here you'll see that LEDs come already

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.240 
here you'll see that LEDs come already
and<00:02:30.420> there<00:02:31.420> we<00:02:31.510> go<00:02:31.660> let<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.560> camera<00:02:32.830> Justin

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
and there we go let the camera Justin

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.460 
and there we go let the camera Justin
you<00:02:33.340> should<00:02:33.490> be<00:02:33.550> able<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.730> get<00:02:34.230> three<00:02:35.230> wires

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
you should be able to get three wires

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.710 
you should be able to get three wires
and<00:02:35.650> three<00:02:35.860> blues<00:02:36.180> I'm<00:02:37.180> not<00:02:37.330> sure<00:02:37.420> how<00:02:37.510> brought

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
and three blues I'm not sure how brought

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.910 
and three blues I'm not sure how brought
they<00:02:37.840> look<00:02:37.990> on<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.140> camera<00:02:38.380> where<00:02:38.770> they're

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
they look on the camera where they're

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.280 
they look on the camera where they're
blind<00:02:39.489> in<00:02:39.610> real<00:02:40.030> life<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:40.510> they<00:02:40.900> actually

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
blind in real life and they actually

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.140 
blind in real life and they actually
light<00:02:41.440> up<00:02:41.470> my<00:02:41.709> tank<00:02:41.920> pretty<00:02:42.580> good<00:02:42.850> for<00:02:43.090> the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
light up my tank pretty good for the

light up my tank pretty good for the
fluid<00:02:43.390> for<00:02:43.480> which<00:02:43.739> if<00:02:44.739> anything<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.130> could<00:02:45.160> do

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
fluid for which if anything I could do

it<00:02:45.520> a<00:02:45.550> few<00:02:45.670> more<00:02:45.820> laps<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:46.120> might<00:02:46.270> even<00:02:46.450> buy<00:02:46.630> a

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
it a few more laps I might even buy a
