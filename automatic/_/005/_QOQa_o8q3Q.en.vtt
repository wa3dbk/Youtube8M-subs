00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.780
 hello everyone guys from the face that we 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.430
 we find here today with a new super 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.440
 the questions are exciting and there 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.619
 we find with this video you can 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.740
 follow us together with you and with you 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.669
 others but feel I have to put some 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.230
 confusion 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.970
 then you practically succeeded 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.349
 this girl perfectly weather 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.260
 you know what i thought i wouldn't let them talk 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:38.240
 of their players then this is 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.790
 the only thing probably useful xv 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.510
 used or 21 guys ok it's okay if you care 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.340
 a fuck like it was guys all right 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.320
 to write a comment to the cafÃ© he does 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.880
 the cajun is not so good because it does 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.690
 what a very damn exact thing 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.070
 this that if the tailer first said 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.230
 because the first switch that fatah 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.940
 they have weapons but every kill but what 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.310
 the better to explain to us what it's like 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.320
 every person who kills lights e 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.330
 turn off the light no 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.250
 every person who kills to turn off lights 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.590
 the console is not then every person who 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.780
 kills and changes underpants 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.850
 and what makes switches to weapons in what sense 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.299
 has change but but the hand and cam 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.999
 right hand the sense would be the first 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.409
 which shows how impossible it would be 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:23.659
 then they play everything for me then 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.429
 the gameplay is really technical 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.020
 however I know what there is to comment on 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.390
 we turned up pretty much the same places 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.659
 trying not to expose yourself too much 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.999
 ok and every kill clearly must 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.210
 change now I go decision that is 

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:39.649
 changing weapon that harman another weapon 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.509
 he did assist moon like better 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.030
 I believe the nature of a player 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.189
 but now it is that moves to find the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.479
 new way 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.789
 exact because that is the proxy then 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.829
 renegade has proposed a type of qandil 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.459
 then the first ken made with underpants 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.740
 ahead 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.990
 then you guys have to stop on webcam 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.869
 or in short, on television, female pant 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.689
 live tv or even no live stream 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.490
 live with his underwear on his head supports 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.079
 andrea daga we load it as it is 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.819
 so that you do it in time that the 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.190
 hat on your head you never have 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.350
 Cost is not wrong those who place 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.220
 eat the coast then we want the first 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.170
 camst rai with the playstation turned off no 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.080
 no no i also propose the first came 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.020
 strike with the playstation 1 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.250
 this difficult then me really 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.730
 I would have proposed something really 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.410
 vulgar here is unrepeatable in trying to 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.400
 new enter too many details 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.190
 yes ok I would have proposed but a like 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.460
 strike ken camst ride but with strike 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.560
 or a practically while you are 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.600
 playing the exact console will be one 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.490
 girl a girl who works for you 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.380
 even a guy to hold the support 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:54.140
 in what sense of support and you are 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:59.420
 inside him on the support podium all 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:02.570
 the conference the flute because the 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.209
 bullshit kiss for we'll call it h la 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.680
 first with strike 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.450
 right now instead we find a 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.490
 moment on the player his channel a in 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.110
 description and I recommend graphic 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.080
 more and if the point our memories 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.390
 while otherwise the owner 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.970
 of the club is requested to advise us for the 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.850
 gameplay of the clip of ours 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.650
 compiled also by caglioni is requested of 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.510
 present it to us promptly 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.760
 darken taylor oar with we will move 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.100
 shield of come out of this plus with 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.110
 descent that denies but sometimes takes 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:41.000
 like the soldier vocabulary with you 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.550
 it would be every day between the new day 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.269
 what a fucking word that kubica that 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.769
 favors rai 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.330
 the work the main question is miss that 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.040
 I made myself but if there are three 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.050
 players in front like fuck does change 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.400
 weapon races that I do n't know if you're the latter 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.989
 changed the first was secondary in 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.370
 I still understand but if you find yourself three 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.050
 front players with bad luck 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.880
 seeing the average quality of the players 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.130
 between true stoned players watch 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:09.769
 that you don't foresee the stuff is stupid but 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:11.690
 wanting to say ok enough alibi but why 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.489
 we stayed a moment call him 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.959
 see that it goes on goes back 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.359
 go ahead or back this technique e 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.049
 I would call it the marmot technique 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.090
 because the den is growing and we hope 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.160
 that sen 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.620
 of the marmora to rotate of the maison of 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.630
 brno say someone tells you kids 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.880
 instance but turning the ass means 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.500
 that there is a piece of no means that there is 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.050
 the marmot I was entering and leaving 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.750
 from the den of the piece of paper is enough 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.680
 you are the next we say to the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.500
 total population 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.240
 the camst rai but in fact he is the 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.910
 left and is called hicks news but in 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.540
 reality is a marmot that is playing 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.979
 in the evaluation the friend is not that knows me 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.900
 which was better if leaving you we do 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.030
 talk this time now want you but 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.889
 sorry but the kehm now sla why not 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.190
 the flame because you want pre katsav walk 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.360
 mm2 maybe you are then called 12 and not 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.650
 added you have been so good from 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.360
 will undress in the title no but for that 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.520
 strange thing we will see this one day 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.990
 Uploaded videos will know what it's called 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.530
 then I tell you right away why we are 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.300
 because nobody is like he is not there 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.280
 no one lucky in his native cars 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.560
 step of him bitchy girl I have 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.240
 made me pretty like me once 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.820
 remember time ago a short while ago 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.520
 get out a top 5 bases and automatically 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.530
 I all said thanks to the flickering 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.100
 you don't run asylum that put you 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:35.169
 exact flicker but repeated am i am 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.669
 they told me this top 5 bouncer bagatti 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.800
 or because I go to see it seems to 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.720
 vomited and seemed to limit seemed 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.180
 that had youtube problems and you have 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.789
 problems, however, after I removed it we will have 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.590
 lio so I guess to say what it means 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.720
 that you made so many sluts of yours 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.460
 life and why not say on youtube in the 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.919
 done so well in your life too 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.030
 present then I do not write the titles for i 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.700
 we always give hello 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.470
 excuse me and minsheng kraft minimal that it 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.099
 wrote tempo no no no enroll it 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.180
 later but I wrote at the end of each 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.039
 tomb 4 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.630
 if you notice there is a small peculiarity 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.000
 that those who arrived at this point there 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.740
 will be placed because 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.630
 have resisted this double kemp between 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:17.040
 we don't know if a double practically 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:19.020
 on the end of battlefield of the other 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.320
 we say to break down writing sand 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:26.490
 event nativity but corrective but 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.420
 who cares so much indeed there is 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.740
 few noticed 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:33.180
 no one so we want to understand at least 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.100
 now we know what a comment will be 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.370
 now we have what will be a comment 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.860
 surely you have written sajad as the 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:44.100
 brings 50 people a little bit back 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.800
 as exact exact marmots 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.600
 girl video but as you remember 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.600
 switch to the player's channel is the 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.450
 our channel pushes firmly for a 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.010
 fuck our facebook base has 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:00.110
 need you then describe them to you 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.110
 good bye to all and to the next video
