00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
you can see that is the whole length of

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.110 
you can see that is the whole length of
the<00:00:58.680> ruler<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.310> does<00:00:59.640> give<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.940> an<00:01:00.030> idea

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
of how big at this figure is but let's

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.390 
of how big at this figure is but let's
take<00:01:03.180> him<00:01:03.420> out<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.630> the<00:01:03.870> packaging<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.739> take<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
take him out of the packaging and take a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.499 
take him out of the packaging and take a
closer<00:01:05.759> look<00:01:06.830> so<00:01:07.830> here<00:01:08.130> he<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.700> let's<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
closer look so here he is let's have a

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.910 
closer look so here he is let's have a
look<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:10.049> him<00:01:10.409> he's<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:11.100> meaty<00:01:12.110> large<00:01:13.110> version

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
look at him he's one meaty large version

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.569 
look at him he's one meaty large version
of<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.549> Hulk<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.929> a<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.409> very<00:01:16.890> big<00:01:17.130> bottle

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
of the Hulk it is a very very big bottle

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.669 
of the Hulk it is a very very big bottle
one<00:01:17.789> major<00:01:18.210> letdown<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.170> figure<00:01:19.499> is

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
one major letdown with this figure is

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.700 
one major letdown with this figure is
because<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.249> is<00:01:20.429> so<00:01:20.700> big<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.719> very<00:01:22.229> hollow

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
because it is so big it is very hollow

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.349 
because it is so big it is very hollow
inside<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:26.359> lightweight

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
inside so it is just a lightweight

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.200 
inside so it is just a lightweight
version<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:29.069> was<00:01:29.249> full<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.579> plastic<00:01:29.850> it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
version if this was full of plastic it

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.149 
version if this was full of plastic it
would<00:01:30.359> be<00:01:30.509> very<00:01:30.749> weighty<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.499> because<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.039> is

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
would be very weighty but because it is

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.330 
would be very weighty but because it is
not<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:32.999> very<00:01:33.600> light<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.289> hand<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
not it is very light in the hand on the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.599 
not it is very light in the hand on the
legs<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.689> torso<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.469> arms<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.460> well

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
legs and the torso and the arms as well

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:41.779 
legs and the torso and the arms as well
are<00:01:38.880> all<00:01:39.210> hollow<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.229> head<00:01:40.439> feels<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.369> better

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
are all hollow the head feels a better

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.919 
are all hollow the head feels a better
quality<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:44.130> hands<00:01:44.399> seem<00:01:44.999> thicker<00:01:45.630> as

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
quality and the hands seem thicker as

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.190 
quality and the hands seem thicker as
well<00:01:46.170> both<00:01:46.439> let's<00:01:46.740> measure<00:01:47.179> this<00:01:48.179> figure<00:01:48.929> it

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
well both let's measure this figure it

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.779 
well both let's measure this figure it
is<00:01:49.939> huge<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.600> exactly<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:53.009> length<00:01:53.219> of<00:01:53.490> my

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
is huge it is exactly the length of my

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.469 
is huge it is exactly the length of my
ruler<00:01:54.329> which<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.689> 30<00:01:55.549> centimeters<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:57.420> height

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
ruler which is 30 centimeters in height

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.889 
ruler which is 30 centimeters in height
now<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.319> move<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.740> legs<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.249> this<00:01:59.429> figure

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
now you can move the legs on this figure

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.319 
now you can move the legs on this figure
forwards<00:02:00.899> not<00:02:01.109> so<00:02:01.380> much<00:02:01.560> backwards<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.399> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
forwards not so much backwards and you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.080 
forwards not so much backwards and you
can<00:02:03.569> also<00:02:03.810> move<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.649> arms<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.310> well<00:02:05.490> each<00:02:05.729> arm

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
can also move the arms as well each arm

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.169 
can also move the arms as well each arm
will<00:02:06.420> move<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:07.469> have<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.679> twisting<00:02:08.429> hand<00:02:08.789> on

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
will move and we have a twisting hand on

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.050 
will move and we have a twisting hand on
both<00:02:10.140> arms<00:02:10.530> one<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.490> clenched

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
both arms one is in the clenched

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.290 
both arms one is in the clenched
position<00:02:12.569> one<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> semi<00:02:14.430> grasping

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
position one is in the semi grasping

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.900 
position one is in the semi grasping
position<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.860> head<00:02:17.130> will<00:02:17.310> move<00:02:17.520> as<00:02:17.760> well

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
position and the head will move as well

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.570 
position and the head will move as well
you<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.240> rock<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.540> back<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.379> forward<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:20.430> we

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
you can rock it back and forward and we

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.760 
you can rock it back and forward and we
have<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> slide<00:02:21.450> with<00:02:21.689> of<00:02:21.870> movement<00:02:22.290> left<00:02:23.069> under
