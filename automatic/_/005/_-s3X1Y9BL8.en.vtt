00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.200 

a<00:05:41.320> chainsaw<00:05:42.100> there<00:05:42.550> would<00:05:42.700> have<00:05:42.790> made<00:05:43.000> all<00:05:43.180> the

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
a chainsaw there would have made all the

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.450 
a chainsaw there would have made all the
difference<00:05:43.420> also<00:05:43.810> they<00:05:44.350> need<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:44.830> thing<00:05:45.130> that

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
difference also they need the thing that

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.030 
difference also they need the thing that
shoots<00:05:45.730> out<00:05:45.970> behind<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.540> light<00:05:46.720> cycle<00:05:47.230> in<00:05:47.410> Tron

shoots out behind a light cycle in Tron
so<00:05:48.220> that<00:05:48.340> you<00:05:48.430> can<00:05:48.550> smash<00:05:48.880> people<00:05:49.240> that<00:05:49.390> run

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510
