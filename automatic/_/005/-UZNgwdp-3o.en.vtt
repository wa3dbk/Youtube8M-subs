00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.120
 hello all good I'm accompanied is 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.510
 super easy and super simple for 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.370
 curl the hair with sponges that are 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.689
 very easy to get, I hope that you 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:22.130
 like we started with wet hair 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:25.490
 there it is freshly washed 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.869
 we comb it very very well so that it does not 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.869
 there is no type of entanglement 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.940
 I'm going to use a fixative gel but very 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.360
 very soft to leave hair objects a 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.360
 little wet 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.690
 and not apply it as a little 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.940
 I'm going to use sponges that in this 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.969
 occasion one that found in wing coins 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.890
 that are super cheap and we are doing 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.680
 sections I for this I split my hair 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.710
 in and I'm taking it from below to 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.710
 above 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.220
 I will not take the perfect sections 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.430
 since I do not want a result 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:18.970
 perfect as the appointment and we open it by 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.970
 the center so you can see how it's done 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.350
 it is caught and gets the tip of the hair 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.410
 the center of the chosen one and we're going to give it 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.120
 back we can help so much bone entangle 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.120
 both inward and outward 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.850
 so it looks more natural and nothing 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.970
 it's just that going up going up 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.960
 going up and when we get to the end 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:48.920
 when we think convenient we close 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.920
 and we continue 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.140
 and 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.189
 and 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.549
 ah 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.299
 we take the last lock of hair and this 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.510
 I always recommend doing it back 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.430
 so that when he does when he leaves 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.730
 the curl does not bother us so much towards 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.959
 face but on the contrary back to me 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.330
 I always like to do this but 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.890
 you can do it however you want 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.100
 I would be on the side already finished so 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.070
 I will continue with the next 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.940
 Well, here are all of them already 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.360
 said a porcelain doll and 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.360
 wait 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.409
 when it has dried everything very well 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.239
 it has to be super dry it can not 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.290
 not even a little bit of humidity because 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:42.170
 if we do not load all the shadows 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.370
 we started to open the loop you have to have 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.980
 be very careful because the sponges 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.049
 they absorb water and moisture so 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.650
 ensures very very well that everything is 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.650
 dry 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.040
 when I opened the feeling that 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.950
 They are wet since I put a gel 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.470
 that seems to be wet but in 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.810
 reality it was all very dry now what 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.400
 you are going to see 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.420
 you have to be very careful with the 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.319
 tangles because it's easy to get tangled up in 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.319
 the hair curler 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.980
 beatus the hair down so that the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.410
 day explains better 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.880
 and so to their environments when we get 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.880
 the soft waves 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.820
 very easy hairstyle that if you want you can 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.450
 leave today or the night before 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.450
 and nothing more 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.379
 and I hope you liked it 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.020
 give debit up if so share 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:57.900
 this video have sold out and we do not see in 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.900
 a next half a big kiss and see you later
