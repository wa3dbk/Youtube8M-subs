00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
ways to play some of these chords we're

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.219 
ways to play some of these chords we're
gonna<00:01:47.700> work<00:01:47.970> out<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.150> first<00:01:48.479> position<00:01:48.930> or<00:01:49.020> get

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
gonna work out a first position or get

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.190 
gonna work out a first position or get
out<00:01:49.410> of<00:01:49.650> first<00:01:49.890> position<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> basic<00:01:51.630> way<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
out of first position so a basic way and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.510 
out of first position so a basic way and
then<00:01:52.289> a<00:01:52.320> little<00:01:52.530> bit<00:01:52.649> more<00:01:52.830> advanced<00:01:53.190> to<00:01:53.399> make

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
then a little bit more advanced to make

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.130 
then a little bit more advanced to make
these<00:01:53.670> chords<00:01:54.090> sound<00:01:54.330> a<00:01:54.420> little<00:01:54.509> more<00:01:54.750> Western

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
these chords sound a little more Western

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.950 
these chords sound a little more Western
Swing<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.770> sound<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.789> little<00:01:56.880> more<00:01:57.119> lush<00:01:57.450> to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
Swing and sound a little more lush to

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.990 
Swing and sound a little more lush to
the<00:01:58.080> ear<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> little<00:01:58.470> thicker<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.789> think

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the ear a little thicker and I think

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.669 
the ear a little thicker and I think
that's<00:02:00.179> really<00:02:00.420> awesome<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.929> like<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.320> kind<00:02:01.649> of

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
that's really awesome I like to kind of

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.650 
that's really awesome I like to kind of
spice<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.190> up<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.399> little<00:02:02.429> bit<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.450> we're<00:02:03.569> gonna

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
spice it up a little bit so we're gonna

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.240 
spice it up a little bit so we're gonna
go<00:02:03.840> over<00:02:03.929> all<00:02:04.050> those<00:02:04.410> things<00:02:04.740> spice<00:02:05.039> up<00:02:05.220> your

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
go over all those things spice up your

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.430 
go over all those things spice up your
rhythm<00:02:05.700> playing<00:02:05.940> and<00:02:06.300> your<00:02:06.420> chords<00:02:06.960> maybe<00:02:07.140> add

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
rhythm playing and your chords maybe add

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.440 
rhythm playing and your chords maybe add
to<00:02:07.619> your<00:02:07.740> chord<00:02:08.039> vocabulary<00:02:08.850> which<00:02:09.149> would<00:02:09.360> be

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
to your chord vocabulary which would be
