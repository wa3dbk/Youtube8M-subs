a<00:01:40.530> simple<00:01:41.399> trick<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.789> understand<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
a simple trick is to understand the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.569 
a simple trick is to understand the
range<00:01:42.600> differences<00:01:43.140> between<00:01:43.289> units<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.979> kite

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
range differences between units and kite

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.370 
range differences between units and kite
away<00:01:44.729> from<00:01:45.090> enemy<00:01:45.390> units<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:45.869> exploit<00:01:46.229> your

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
away from enemy units to exploit your

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.410 
away from enemy units to exploit your
range<00:01:46.619> advantage<00:01:46.819> you<00:01:47.819> can<00:01:47.969> do<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.240> by

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
range advantage you can do this by

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.389 
range advantage you can do this by
checking<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.899> ranges<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.350> units<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.829> trying

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
checking the ranges on units and trying

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.590 
checking the ranges on units and trying
to<00:01:50.490> keep<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> enemy<00:01:50.999> units<00:01:51.270> out<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.509> their

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
to keep the enemy units out of their

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.330 
to keep the enemy units out of their
firing<00:01:52.020> range

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.590 

we<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.759> without<00:01:56.909> kiting<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
we can see that without kiting the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.100 
we can see that without kiting the
results<00:01:57.990> would<00:01:58.049> be<00:01:58.200> much<00:01:58.380> different<00:01:59.960> we<00:02:00.960> can

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
results would be much different we can

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.840 
results would be much different we can
break<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.530> army<00:02:01.770> participation<00:02:02.520> down<00:02:02.670> on

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
break the army participation down on

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.969 
break the army participation down on
even<00:02:03.149> more<00:02:03.180> simple<00:02:03.750> statement<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.439> is

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
even more simple statement and that is

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.649 
even more simple statement and that is
to<00:02:05.220> make<00:02:05.340> sure<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.549> every<00:02:05.909> unit<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.360> doing

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
to make sure that every unit is doing

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.930 
to make sure that every unit is doing
their<00:02:06.780> job<00:02:06.810> during<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> battery<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:08.009> lot<00:02:08.849> of

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
their job during the battery a lot of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.580 
their job during the battery a lot of
this<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.209> be<00:02:09.330> managed<00:02:09.630> by<00:02:09.750> positioning<00:02:10.259> units

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
this can be managed by positioning units

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.050 
this can be managed by positioning units
and<00:02:10.739> order<00:02:10.979> based<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.340> their<00:02:11.459> firing<00:02:11.700> range

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
and order based on their firing range

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.970 
and order based on their firing range
for<00:02:12.810> example<00:02:12.900> if<00:02:13.380> I<00:02:13.470> have<00:02:13.590> zealots<00:02:13.920> and

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
for example if I have zealots and

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.740 
for example if I have zealots and
stalkers<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.910> zealots<00:02:15.209> always<00:02:15.450> need<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.690> be

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
stalkers the zealots always need to be

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.000 
stalkers the zealots always need to be
in<00:02:15.840> front<00:02:16.019> because<00:02:16.290> they<00:02:16.590> are<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.830> melee

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
in front because they are the melee

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.800 
in front because they are the melee
units<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:17.910> they're<00:02:18.150> stuck<00:02:18.330> behind<00:02:18.510> other

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
units if they're stuck behind other

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.330 
units if they're stuck behind other
units<00:02:19.170> then<00:02:19.410> they're<00:02:19.590> useless<00:02:19.800> throughout<00:02:20.310> a

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
units then they're useless throughout a

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.120 
units then they're useless throughout a
lot<00:02:20.519> of<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.670> fight<00:02:21.440> caster<00:02:22.440> units<00:02:22.709> will<00:02:22.830> also

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
lot of the fight caster units will also

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.250 
lot of the fight caster units will also
need<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.340> be<00:02:23.430> participating<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.269> casters<00:02:25.140> are

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
need to be participating and casters are

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.900 
need to be participating and casters are
often<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.709> powerful<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.190> they<00:02:26.400> can<00:02:26.430> outright

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
often so powerful that they can outright

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.380 
often so powerful that they can outright
win<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.120> battle<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:29.489> best<00:02:29.730> way<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.000> manage

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
win a battle the best way to manage

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.729 
win a battle the best way to manage
casters<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.049> to<00:02:31.170> put<00:02:31.319> them<00:02:31.470> on<00:02:31.590> their<00:02:31.709> own

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
casters is to put them on their own

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.860 
casters is to put them on their own
hotkey<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.430> control<00:02:33.120> them<00:02:33.269> individually

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
hotkey and control them individually

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.509 
hotkey and control them individually
from<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.140> others<00:02:34.349> so<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.160> we<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.370> both

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
from the others so that we can both

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.339 
from the others so that we can both
easily<00:02:35.760> access<00:02:36.330> them<00:02:36.510> for<00:02:36.660> their<00:02:36.750> spells<00:02:37.049> and

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
easily access them for their spells and

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.080 
easily access them for their spells and
move<00:02:37.980> them<00:02:38.160> out<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.310> harm's<00:02:38.640> way<00:02:38.730> at<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.060> right

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
move them out of harm's way at the right

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.860 
move them out of harm's way at the right
times<00:02:40.970> another<00:02:41.970> big<00:02:42.180> component<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.630> army

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
times another big component of army

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.210 
times another big component of army
control<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.260> making<00:02:43.560> sure<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.799> your<00:02:43.920> units

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
control is making sure that your units

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.949 
control is making sure that your units
are<00:02:44.280> staying<00:02:44.549> alive<00:02:44.790> as<00:02:44.970> long<00:02:45.000> as<00:02:45.180> possible<00:02:45.360> a

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
are staying alive as long as possible a

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.410 
are staying alive as long as possible a
unit<00:02:46.829> that<00:02:46.860> has<00:02:47.099> one<00:02:47.400> health<00:02:47.670> does<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.090> exact

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
unit that has one health does the exact

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.940 
unit that has one health does the exact
same<00:02:48.599> amount<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.959> damage<00:02:49.290> as<00:02:49.470> one<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.829> has

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
same amount of damage as one that has

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.110 
same amount of damage as one that has
1,000<00:02:50.700> health

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
1,000 health

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.970 
1,000 health
so<00:02:51.660> keeping<00:02:51.959> units<00:02:52.290> alive<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.739> very

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
so keeping units alive is a very

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.500 
so keeping units alive is a very
important<00:02:53.430> component<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:53.910> winning<00:02:54.180> micro

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
important component of winning micro

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.839 
important component of winning micro
intensive<00:02:54.989> battles<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:56.160> most<00:02:56.370> simple<00:02:56.700> way<00:02:56.819> to

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
intensive battles the most simple way to

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.520 
intensive battles the most simple way to
keep<00:02:57.090> units<00:02:57.450> alive<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.900> move<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.410> wounded

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
keep units alive is to move the wounded

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.470 
keep units alive is to move the wounded
units<00:02:59.010> back<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.400> force<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.880> enemy<00:03:00.000> units<00:03:00.239> to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
units back to force the enemy units to

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.229 
units back to force the enemy units to
pick<00:03:00.600> another<00:03:00.720> target<00:03:01.670> secondly<00:03:02.670> avoiding

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
pick another target secondly avoiding

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.330 
pick another target secondly avoiding
area<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.900> effect<00:03:04.200> damage<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.650> very<00:03:04.680> important

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
area of effect damage is very important

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.160 
area of effect damage is very important
especially<00:03:06.030> with<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.450> lot<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.690> low<00:03:06.930> health

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
especially with a lot of low health

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.410 
especially with a lot of low health
units<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:08.310> same<00:03:08.519> can<00:03:08.670> be<00:03:08.700> said<00:03:08.819> for<00:03:09.000> units

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
units the same can be said for units

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
most important parts of their army are

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.569 
most important parts of their army are
and<00:03:22.049> do<00:03:22.530> your<00:03:22.680> best<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.950> eliminate<00:03:23.400> them

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
before they deal too much damage a good

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.559 
before they deal too much damage a good
example<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.489> knowing<00:03:26.760> when<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.150> dive<00:03:27.359> on

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
example is knowing when you can dive on

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.210 
example is knowing when you can dive on
units<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.049> accept<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.410> favorable<00:03:28.829> trade<00:03:29.069> to

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
units and accept the favorable trade to

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.890 
units and accept the favorable trade to
better<00:03:29.400> benefit<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.940> rest<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.299> battle<00:03:30.480> in

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
better benefit the rest of the battle in

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.949 
better benefit the rest of the battle in
this<00:03:31.859> Protoss<00:03:32.220> army<00:03:32.609> a<00:03:32.790> huge<00:03:33.420> majority<00:03:33.870> the

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
this Protoss army a huge majority the

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.170 
this Protoss army a huge majority the
damage<00:03:34.260> output<00:03:34.410> is<00:03:34.680> in<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.859> Colossus<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:36.030> if<00:03:36.090> I

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
damage output is in the Colossus so if I

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.729 
damage output is in the Colossus so if I
dive<00:03:36.450> on<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.810> then<00:03:36.930> we<00:03:37.019> could<00:03:37.109> see<00:03:37.319> how<00:03:37.380> easy<00:03:37.410> it

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
dive on it then we could see how easy it

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.319 
dive on it then we could see how easy it
is<00:03:37.829> to<00:03:37.980> kill<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.310> rest<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.670> army<00:03:41.180> if<00:03:42.180> I

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
is to kill the rest of the army if I

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.630 
is to kill the rest of the army if I
don't<00:03:42.540> do<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:43.049> lose<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.620> battle
