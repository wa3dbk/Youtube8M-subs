crop planning has to fit with the cattle
in<00:00:26.439> a<00:00:26.500> price<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.970> has<00:00:28.179> to<00:00:28.390> fit<00:00:28.570> for<00:00:28.840> the<00:00:28.900> hunting

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
in a price it has to fit for the hunting

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.230 
in a price it has to fit for the hunting
enterprise<00:00:29.890> because<00:00:30.310> we<00:00:30.460> have<00:00:30.670> to<00:00:30.820> have<00:00:31.000> the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
enterprise because we have to have the

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.090

birds as well we have to have habitat

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.040 
birds as well we have to have habitat
for<00:00:33.370> them<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.790> it<00:00:37.089> really<00:00:37.420> is<00:00:37.540> the<00:00:37.690> cattle

family that he had to be able to allow
other<00:01:36.220> successors<00:01:37.220> come<00:01:38.030> back<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.509> help<00:01:38.750> that

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
other successors come back and help that
