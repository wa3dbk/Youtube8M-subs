00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.090
 maybe it's just a dream like that 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:17.550
 you had never driven it in your entire 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.550
 life not because all the paintings are 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:29.610
 but how is it there if I do not 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.270
 I even know him very well that 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.270
 information 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.520
 take a shower would do me good 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.160
 they want 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
 she 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.920
 and really 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:56.199
 15 years later 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.199
 this is an affected country 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.620
 you do not understand me 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.620
 I met her once in the past because 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.030
 I do not know but maybe with a little 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.369
 I can show you magic 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.630
 but let's see I think I have out there 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.630
 I already remembered how he sees the wait 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.290
 What's up 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
 here 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.290
 yes it is true and really good I hope that 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.510
 do not do it again please if not 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.580
 we will have many problems in good bye 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.960
 goodbye 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:55.460
 because it came out of nowhere pushing us to the 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:59.180
 mine if I show you your past 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.520
 he does not want to know what would happen if he does not want 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.520
 know but I want I do not want to know 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.320
 online 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.170
 all the rooms look like the truth 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.920
 so much both so much high 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.080
 It is important 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.860
 What is it 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.909
 because you do not want me to talk 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.480
 that's why nobody will not sneak into the 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.210
 library to see how to find my 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.070
 past 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.370
 but not that you can not do that 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.990
 you have to discover it for yourself bobo 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.819
 do not say bobo, I already told you 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:13.310
 shut 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.310
 in order to companies we go 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.990
 if you accompany me, title the laptop 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.210
 It's done very well 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.210
 but you can not tell anyone 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.690
 so 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.900
 what happens 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:49.620
 and I know very well we just have to 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.620
 find out how to get in there 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.060
 plus
