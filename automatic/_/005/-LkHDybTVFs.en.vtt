00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello everyone in this video I will explain that 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.859
 is 251 of days the 251 is a resource 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.080
 very used in jazz which consists of 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.509
 play second grade and fifth grade 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.210
 regarding a chord before falling into 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.539
 that agreed main or first grade of 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.550
 there comes the name of 251 simply 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.980
 it's about putting chords in step to 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.010
 generate tension and resolve in that agreed 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.410
 main to release tension this 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.210
 explained thus is a bit confusing 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.430
 but with examples sure that what 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.440
 we understand suppose we are in 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.870
 tonality of C major and we want to play 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.940
 a major sun chord so to play 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.000
 an older sun we can touch before a 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.920
 chord of which his second a chord of 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.760
 king that would be his fifth and fall 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.789
 finally in the sun that would be the tonic 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.620
 25 1 second fifth and tonic the same thing 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.600
 we can use for any chord 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.390
 for example to play a minor 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.359
 we can play before a me that would be his 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.949
 second one what would be his fifth and fall 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.660
 finally in the re 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.000
 the tonic or first 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.160
 but as you put intermediate chords 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.800
 or step chords as major chords 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.760
 as minor chords or as diminished 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.040
 or how I touch them because it's something very 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.960
 simple first you have to differentiate 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.930
 between the chord we want 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.420
 arrive is greater or lesser in the case of 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.610
 that is greater the second degree will be the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.610
 second grade minor and the fifth grade 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.340
 will be greater with seventh if we want 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.560
 expose better is to say that the first 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.780
 intermediate step chord will be a chord 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.830
 minor and the second intermediate chord or 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.850
 of step to be a major chord with seventh 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.460
 let's give an example to make it look 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.920
 much clearer in the case of before if 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.740
 we want to get to a major sun chord 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.880
 we can play before the second and the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.460
 fifth grade the second and the fifth 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.520
 degree that of sun would be the second degree 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.800
 one side and the fifth grade a re as already 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.770
 we said before 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.890
 as the sun is a major chord as the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.720
 the chord would be lower and the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.450
 fifth grade would be the major re chord 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.320
 with seventh and finally we would fall into the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.320
 greater sun 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.629
 it is true that the major re does not belong to 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.269
 the hue of C major but despite 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.519
 we will continue playing this as a re 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.230
 greater good as we have already seen the 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.870
 case of major chords now 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.700
 we pass to the minor chords the only 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.500
 difference with respect to the group of 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.290
 major chords is that the chords 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.019
 minors the second degree is going to be semi 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.450
 diminished instead of being smaller but already 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.459
 is everything else is equal the fifth 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.549
 degree is still a major chord with 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.579
 seventh then it would be like that the second 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.670
 degree chords semi diminished fifth 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.010
 degree major chord with seventh and 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.540
 finally we would fall into the minor chord 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.310
 in question 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.010
 let's give an example to make it look 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.819
 much clearer in the case of before that 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.790
 It was the one of D minor because the second degree 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.099
 it would be a 1000 and the fifth a plane 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.799
 the second degree that is my would be a semi 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:17.879
 diminished of me and the fifth degree would be 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:21.480
 a major chord with seventh of the one 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.879
 seventh and finally the minor re my 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.150
 the seventh largest has diminished and 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.150
 less 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.470
 and now some examples of the 251 with the 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.489
 guitar 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.489
 I have 25 of the oldest ones, I do 25 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.170
 dominant minor and I resolve the use 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.520
 25 of minors for Iran 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.950
 for Iranian the same have decreased 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.950
 from his dominant cell phone I resolve 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.350
 well so far this class is 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.090
 explanation of 251 in jazz if you 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.100
 there is any question any doubt 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.530
 please write me in the comments 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.220
 and I will respond delightedly and it is already 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.220
 until next time
