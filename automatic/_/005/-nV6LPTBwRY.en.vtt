00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:02.590 
guys back a couple more updates on the

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.549 
guys back a couple more updates on the
98<00:00:03.550> GT<00:00:04.140> we've<00:00:05.140> got<00:00:05.350> the<00:00:06.750> basically<00:00:07.750> we're

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 
98 GT we've got the basically we're

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.120 
98 GT we've got the basically we're
going<00:00:08.740> from<00:00:08.889> a<00:00:09.040> 98<00:00:09.460> 2:04<00:00:10.000> style<00:00:10.990> motor<00:00:11.769> and

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.130 
going from a 98 2:04 style motor and

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.150 
going from a 98 2:04 style motor and
what's<00:00:12.340> going<00:00:12.490> to<00:00:12.550> have<00:00:12.639> to<00:00:12.759> happen<00:00:12.910> here<00:00:14.160> is

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
what's going to have to happen here is

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.029 
what's going to have to happen here is
that<00:00:15.219> these<00:00:15.670> coils<00:00:16.480> are<00:00:17.440> gonna<00:00:17.619> have<00:00:17.770> to<00:00:17.920> be

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
that these coils are gonna have to be

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.599 
that these coils are gonna have to be
mounted<00:00:18.460> on<00:00:19.090> to<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:19.779> new<00:00:20.380> motor<00:00:20.619> because<00:00:20.980> this

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:21.609 
mounted on to the new motor because this

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.000 
mounted on to the new motor because this
is<00:00:21.760> a<00:00:21.789> four<00:00:22.090> coil<00:00:22.420> pack<00:00:22.710> basically<00:00:23.710> a<00:00:23.740> coil

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
is a four coil pack basically a coil

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.500 
is a four coil pack basically a coil
pack<00:00:24.220> four<00:00:24.850> pole<00:00:25.060> four<00:00:25.600> coils<00:00:25.869> run<00:00:27.300> how<00:00:28.300> can<00:00:28.449> I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
pack four pole four coils run how can I

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.839 
pack four pole four coils run how can I
say<00:00:28.660> this<00:00:28.779> it's<00:00:28.990> basically<00:00:29.640> kind<00:00:30.640> of<00:00:30.670> like<00:00:30.789> a

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
say this it's basically kind of like a

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.680 
say this it's basically kind of like a
distributor<00:00:31.449> almost<00:00:32.410> to<00:00:33.010> the<00:00:33.450> one<00:00:34.450> coil

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
distributor almost to the one coil

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.590 
distributor almost to the one coil
4-cylinder<00:00:35.700> technology<00:00:36.700> I'm<00:00:37.210> not<00:00:37.360> quite

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
4-cylinder technology I'm not quite

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.500 
4-cylinder technology I'm not quite
there<00:00:37.780> yet<00:00:37.840> but<00:00:38.500> anyways<00:00:38.829> the<00:00:39.760> newer<00:00:40.149> style

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
there yet but anyways the newer style

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.900 
there yet but anyways the newer style
has<00:00:40.840> a<00:00:40.870> coil<00:00:41.379> pack<00:00:41.710> that<00:00:42.280> sits<00:00:42.550> right<00:00:42.610> on<00:00:42.760> top

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
has a coil pack that sits right on top

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.690 
has a coil pack that sits right on top
of<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.450> plug<00:00:44.230> and<00:00:44.739> you<00:00:44.980> do<00:00:45.100> not<00:00:45.219> need<00:00:45.430> wires

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
of the plug and you do not need wires

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.139 
of the plug and you do not need wires
this<00:00:46.390> particular<00:00:47.170> system<00:00:47.350> has<00:00:47.620> wires<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.309> two

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
this particular system has wires and two

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.810 
this particular system has wires and two
coil<00:00:49.420> packs<00:00:49.690> so<00:00:49.930> we're<00:00:50.230> going<00:00:50.350> to<00:00:50.410> do<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:51.579> can't

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
coil packs so we're going to do we can't

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.930 
coil packs so we're going to do we can't
run<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.840> new<00:00:53.079> style<00:00:53.320> system<00:00:53.770> unless<00:00:54.250> we

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
run the new style system unless we

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.439 
run the new style system unless we
change<00:00:55.239> out<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.969> incomplete<00:00:57.969> engine<00:00:58.300> harness

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
change out the incomplete engine harness

00:00:58.449 --> 00:00:59.970 
change out the incomplete engine harness
the<00:00:59.260> complete

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
the complete

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.959 
the complete

- wiring harness and the computer and

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.789 
- wiring harness and the computer and
then<00:01:04.180> have<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.420> key<00:01:04.720> reprogrammed<00:01:05.409> to<00:01:05.500> that<00:01:05.680> new

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
then have a key reprogrammed to that new

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.500 
then have a key reprogrammed to that new
computer<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.340> it's<00:01:06.610> just<00:01:06.790> it's<00:01:07.090> it's<00:01:07.420> a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
computer and it's just it's it's a

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.070 
computer and it's just it's it's a
costly<00:01:07.840> procedure<00:01:08.260> in<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:10.360> man<00:01:10.540> here<00:01:10.750> doesn't

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.590 
costly procedure in my man here doesn't
have<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:13.240> time<00:01:13.510> to<00:01:14.439> be<00:01:14.560> awful<00:01:14.860> work<00:01:15.010> and<00:01:15.600> you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
have the time to be awful work and you

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.600 
have the time to be awful work and you
know<00:01:16.689> being<00:01:16.869> without<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.140> car<00:01:17.409> and<00:01:17.439> it<00:01:18.310> doesn't

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
know being without a car and it doesn't

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.880 
know being without a car and it doesn't
have<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:20.500> know<00:01:20.590> being<00:01:20.799> around

out for him to me for me to change all

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.940 
out for him to me for me to change all
that<00:01:24.280> but<00:01:24.759> it<00:01:24.850> is<00:01:24.970> doable<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:25.630> can<00:01:25.810> do<00:01:26.020> it<00:01:26.170> so

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
that but it is doable you can do it so

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.469 
that but it is doable you can do it so
what<00:01:27.100> we're<00:01:27.220> going<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.369> do<00:01:27.490> on<00:01:27.610> this<00:01:27.759> motor<00:01:27.970> is

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
what we're going to do on this motor is

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.700 
what we're going to do on this motor is
we're<00:01:28.630> going<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.810> take<00:01:28.930> these<00:01:29.110> and<00:01:29.350> swap<00:01:29.500> and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
we're going to take these and swap and

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.410 
we're going to take these and swap and
put<00:01:29.799> them<00:01:29.920> on<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.100> other<00:01:30.250> motor<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.790> I'm<00:01:31.210> not

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
put them on the other motor and I'm not

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.990 
put them on the other motor and I'm not
sure<00:01:31.570> at<00:01:31.689> this<00:01:31.750> point<00:01:31.930> I<00:01:32.460> might<00:01:33.460> actually<00:01:33.729> have

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
sure at this point I might actually have

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.280 
sure at this point I might actually have
to<00:01:34.030> take<00:01:34.329> the<00:01:34.390> whole<00:01:35.170> timing<00:01:35.729> cover<00:01:36.840> off<00:01:37.840> and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
to take the whole timing cover off and

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.010 
to take the whole timing cover off and
use<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:38.740> depending<00:01:39.579> on<00:01:39.670> if<00:01:40.210> I<00:01:40.450> have<00:01:40.600> mounting

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
use that depending on if I have mounting

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.460 
use that depending on if I have mounting
points<00:01:41.350> for<00:01:41.409> these<00:01:41.850> these<00:01:42.850> brackets<00:01:43.210> here<00:01:43.600> on

the<00:01:44.710> new<00:01:44.860> motor<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.939> he<00:01:46.869> had<00:01:47.770> mentioned<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.159> me

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
the new motor and he had mentioned to me

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.249 
the new motor and he had mentioned to me
that<00:01:48.340> he<00:01:49.329> was<00:01:49.450> driving<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.780> car<00:01:49.869> for<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.200> while

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
that he was driving the car for a while

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.649 
that he was driving the car for a while
with<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.799> with<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.460> motor<00:01:51.640> ball<00:01:51.909> not<00:01:52.149> this

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
with the with the motor ball not this

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.929 
with the with the motor ball not this
severely<00:01:53.110> but<00:01:53.470> he<00:01:54.009> was<00:01:54.159> you<00:01:54.399> know<00:01:54.460> started<00:01:54.820> off

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
severely but he was you know started off

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.639 
severely but he was you know started off
as<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.119> small<00:01:55.299> noise<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:56.020> there<00:01:56.140> was<00:01:56.170> ticking

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
as a small noise and there was ticking

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.649 
as a small noise and there was ticking
and<00:01:56.770> then<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:57.670> know<00:01:57.759> now<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:58.329> became<00:01:58.630> a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
and then you know now it became a

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.819 
and then you know now it became a
full-on<00:01:59.590> issue<00:01:59.829> but<00:02:00.579> he<00:02:01.570> told<00:02:01.780> me<00:02:01.869> that<00:02:01.930> he<00:02:02.229> you

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
full-on issue but he told me that he you

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.889

not have a heater because what I see
