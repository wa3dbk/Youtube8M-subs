 firefighters people know what you have to 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.210
 to do is you have to call one for 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.220

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.720

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:05.939

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.939

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.739
 I understand that this is quite 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.799
 complicated but it seems to me that it is not 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.319
 to get bitter in this way I wanted to 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:20.140

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.840
