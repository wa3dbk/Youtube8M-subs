00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
ops but I'm thinking it's the Wii so how

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.020 
ops but I'm thinking it's the Wii so how
many<00:02:41.530> people<00:02:41.650> are<00:02:41.890> gonna<00:02:41.980> have<00:02:42.100> headphones<00:02:42.610> or

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
many people are gonna have headphones or

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.330 
many people are gonna have headphones or
surround<00:02:43.480> sound<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.870> know<00:02:44.020> it's<00:02:44.320> kind<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.680> my

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
surround sound you know it's kind of my

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.090 
surround sound you know it's kind of my
logic<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.270> needed<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.320> third<00:02:47.350> perk<00:02:47.770> because

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
logic so I needed a third perk because

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.880 
logic so I needed a third perk because
the<00:02:48.400> tactical<00:02:48.880> mask<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:50.380> wii's<00:02:50.530> kind<00:02:50.800> of

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
the tactical mask the wii's kind of

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.520 
the tactical mask the wii's kind of
different<00:02:51.160> there's<00:02:51.310> like<00:02:51.460> not<00:02:51.760> as<00:02:51.940> much

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
different there's like not as much

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.050 
different there's like not as much
grenade<00:02:53.530> throwing<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.280> flashing<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.940> it's

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
grenade throwing and flashing and it's

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.640 
grenade throwing and flashing and it's
like<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.180> slower<00:02:55.510> pace<00:02:55.780> game<00:02:56.020> because<00:02:56.350> it's<00:02:56.500> so

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
like a slower pace game because it's so

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.800 
like a slower pace game because it's so
hard<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.160> control<00:02:57.760> your<00:02:57.940> character<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.450> mean

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
hard to control your character I mean

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.949 
hard to control your character I mean
it's<00:02:59.020> a<00:02:59.280> it's<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.520> wii<00:03:01.030> controller<00:03:01.510> me<00:03:01.780> it's

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
it's a it's the wii controller me it's

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.930 
it's a it's the wii controller me it's
not<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.140> it's<00:03:02.440> not<00:03:02.740> a<00:03:02.830> precision<00:03:03.280> advice<00:03:03.640> unless

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
not a it's not a precision advice unless

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.980 
not a it's not a precision advice unless
you're<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.560> on<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:06.420> master<00:03:07.420> swordsman<00:03:07.630> or

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
you're and on a master swordsman or

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.840 
you're and on a master swordsman or
something<00:03:08.260> or<00:03:08.380> used<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.709> remote<00:03:09.400> control<00:03:09.700> that

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
something or used to remote control that

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.790 
something or used to remote control that
damn<00:03:10.030> thing<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:13.090> my<00:03:13.270> thinking<00:03:13.480> is<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.810> try<00:03:14.620> using

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
damn thing so my thinking is a try using

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.760 
damn thing so my thinking is a try using
something<00:03:15.100> besides<00:03:15.550> ninja<00:03:16.090> because<00:03:16.770> most

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
something besides ninja because most

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.690 
something besides ninja because most
people<00:03:18.010> aren't<00:03:18.130> gonna<00:03:18.250> be<00:03:18.340> all<00:03:18.430> here<00:03:18.610> you
