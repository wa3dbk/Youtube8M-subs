00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 this result is you came 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.799
 especially in this second round a 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.240
 sequence to recovery points 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.580
 lost in the first phase of the championship 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.460
 Brazilian and for us since it is not a 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.440
 opponent who needed victory 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.690
 especially in front of the supporter 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.880
 leave the cited comfort zone 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.220
 including by the technician himself you generate 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.500
 a doubly difficult opponent of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.830
 face the jec robertinho old cast 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.800
 and we contribute here already can be 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.680
 we also made a lot of mistakes then 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.940
 to facilitate the further development of 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.940
 im working 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.680
 but it's a team with problems like that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.110
 problem has your boys have their 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.640
 qualities and we respect 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.980
 shadow of doubt edit 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.899
 Congratulations today for the victory and my 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.510
 athletes for the dedication and posture of 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.370
 always try to play, always try to go to 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.190
 front achieved result does not stop 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.680
 even within a projection that is made 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.449
 in the championship and this sequence 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.000
 Bahia has been coming since you arrived 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.000
 you can say that it is the result of today 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.540
 and it was not so unexpected if one could have 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.060
 in the account and didi of the general 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.100
 Clear league that I can play here. 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.290
 I lost here is not demerit to anyone 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.580
 unlike right not we fall in foot 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.689
 err because if not enough 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.040
 had made the two goals in the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.759
 first time maybe I would have been 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.100
 other 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.140
 So we missed too much there and they got paid. 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.930
 a little because we did more 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.340
 so enough we could not get 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.890
 the second ball in the first half 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.450
 one pass we had two goals chances 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.969
 what was to have done and did not do 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.899
 err in their goals she has science 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.090
 of this 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.850
 but also the awareness that we do not 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.859
 We can leave it and think it was everything. 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.689
 Alright, it's all gone now. 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.399
 we are aware of our conditions and 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.350
 let's run after this branch 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.700
 as we are always saying that we 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.709
 we are the first to take our focus 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.990
 It's what we're going to do, let's get it. 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:01.310
 was the importance of Gabriel's return 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.929
 in today's game is a move 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.509
 arranged like the one where the cold is very 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.160
 big and needed a lot of explosion 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.709
 muscular logic it leaves a little bit 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.090
 because he's been a long time standing still but it's 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.410
 good that already in the next game will already enter 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.410
 normal this is very interesting too
