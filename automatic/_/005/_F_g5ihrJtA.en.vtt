00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.319
 he has an opportunity for us to 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.830
 area of â€‹â€‹health which is to be able to experience 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.009
 Well used bet that is the art to heaven 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.440
 open and in reality the art to heaven 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.350
 open what happens to us every day 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.570
 whenever we meet someone is 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.150
 When we meet someone it 's like 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.599
 says some thinkers we find 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.730
 a work of art because all of us in the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.660
 production of our existence 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.800
 we produce work of art the existence 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.040
 of the work of art 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.230
 and it's as thought-provoking as any 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.899
 great painting, huh? 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.059
 and here I had people have this 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.539
 opportunity to recognize these 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.360
 languages because you will live with 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.149
 a production of a work had around 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.070
 of a sculptor in the open she 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.050
 talking to you and talking to you 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.930
 with her she summons you to vote for her 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.920
 body your sensitive body in front of your 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.900
 thought 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.299
 so the work of art can 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.729
 summon noticeably 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.549
 And then you think about it and when you 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.680
 arrive beforehand to see the picture 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.979
 You do not see the painting, do you? 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.720
 You do not leave the tv board, that's what I 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.920
 I think it's a fundamental issue in 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.780
 health area 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.990
 when we are in the practice of 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.390
 care and we can not see the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.350
 someone who is watching us makes the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.810
 same thing 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.800
 we arrive at the thought before the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.900
 people come with the body thought 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.510
 before we do not come with a body 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.170
 in the encounter of the other which is a 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.810
 work of art to expose yourself to that 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.320
 and then we do not explore this meeting 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.480
 in what he has of artistic wealth that 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.550
 the existence of each one who does not 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.190
 get it done in health 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.840
 he always owes himself in the practice of 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.030
 be careful because he thinks he's 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.680
 taking care of another who does not know or 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.760
 Who is this other huh? 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.860
 So I think this is the big one. 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.880
 learning this experience 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.880
 we're having here it 's old
