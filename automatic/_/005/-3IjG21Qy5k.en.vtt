curiosity<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.560> course<00:00:19.710> asks<00:00:20.130> me<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.430> take<00:00:21.150> my

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
curiosity of course asks me to take my

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.170 
curiosity of course asks me to take my
heart<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.720> take<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> look<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:22.920> um<00:00:23.180> this

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
heart and take a look at it so um this

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.700 
heart and take a look at it so um this
is<00:00:24.330> basically<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.689> process<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.470> reverse

will become the leads that attach to the
circuit<00:00:42.510> board<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:44.040> if<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.280> look

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
circuit board and then if you look

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.470 
circuit board and then if you look
closely<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:44.879> see<00:00:45.059> there's<00:00:45.210> two<00:00:45.239> pieces

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
closely you can see there's two pieces

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.940 
closely you can see there's two pieces
of<00:00:45.600> silicon<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.020> larger<00:00:46.350> one<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:46.530> then<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
of silicon a larger one here then a

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.279 
of silicon a larger one here then a
smaller<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:47.340> off<00:00:47.579> there<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.059> guess<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.200> my

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
smaller one off there I guess I was my

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.810 
smaller one off there I guess I was my
first<00:00:49.500> surprise<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.190> guess<00:00:50.489> there's<00:00:50.700> two

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
first surprise I guess there's two

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.779 
first surprise I guess there's two
pieces<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.180> silicon<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:52.309> meet<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> creepage

pretty broad range of controllers so

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.170 
pretty broad range of controllers so
that<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.590> kind<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.829> interesting<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.490> mystery

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
that was kind of interesting so mystery

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.460 
that was kind of interesting so mystery

solved<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.340> mystery<00:01:53.670> entirely<00:01:53.970> because<00:01:54.540> I

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
solved the mystery entirely because I

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.810 
solved the mystery entirely because I
had<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> part<00:01:55.920> number<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> FET<00:01:56.549> here's

parts in their product line but then

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.570

little<00:02:37.700> dies<00:02:37.940> here<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:38.740> that<00:02:39.740> was<00:02:39.830> really

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
little dies here so that was really

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.780 
little dies here so that was really
interesting<00:02:40.130> up<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:41.990> tools<00:02:42.230> used<00:02:42.500> to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
interesting up so the tools used to

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.250 
interesting up so the tools used to
reverse<00:02:43.790> engineer<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.270> see<00:02:44.570> they're<00:02:45.080> fairly

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
reverse engineer I see they're fairly

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.630 
reverse engineer I see they're fairly
straight<00:02:45.500> forward<00:02:45.530> obviously<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.310> hot-air<00:02:46.610> gun

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
straight forward obviously a hot-air gun

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.390 
straight forward obviously a hot-air gun
just<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.150> remove<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.690> components<00:02:48.370> then<00:02:49.370> you

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
just to remove the components then you

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.120 
just to remove the components then you
need<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.390> get<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.630> epoxy<00:02:51.170> off<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.500> components

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
need to get the epoxy off the components

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.220 
need to get the epoxy off the components
and<00:02:52.430> two<00:02:53.060> popular<00:02:53.450> techniques<00:02:53.870> one<00:02:54.200> is

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
and two popular techniques one is

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.860 
and two popular techniques one is
basically<00:02:54.740> a<00:02:54.830> hot<00:02:55.010> acid<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.600> other<00:02:56.720> ones

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
basically a hot acid and the other ones

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.480 
basically a hot acid and the other ones
laser<00:02:57.080> ablation<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.920> won't<00:02:58.100> show<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.430> this

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
laser ablation I won't show that in this

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.480 
laser ablation I won't show that in this
video<00:02:58.670> obviously<00:02:59.620> wet<00:03:00.620> lab<00:03:00.770> chemistry<00:03:01.160> stuff

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
video obviously wet lab chemistry stuff

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.600 
video obviously wet lab chemistry stuff
is<00:03:02.209> a<00:03:02.300> little<00:03:02.959> bit<00:03:03.050> dangerous<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:03.500> but<00:03:04.310> as<00:03:04.490> much

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
is a little bit dangerous so but as much

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.330 
is a little bit dangerous so but as much
finished<00:03:05.680> surprisingly<00:03:06.680> actually<00:03:07.160> you<00:03:07.220> can

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
finished surprisingly actually you can

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.640 
finished surprisingly actually you can
see<00:03:07.490> I've<00:03:07.580> used<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.970> more<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.870> microscope

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
see I've used the more of a microscope

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.850 
see I've used the more of a microscope
suitable<00:03:10.130> for<00:03:10.400> PCB<00:03:10.970> inspection<00:03:11.510> but<00:03:11.740> it<00:03:12.740> did

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
suitable for PCB inspection but it did

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.440 
suitable for PCB inspection but it did
actually<00:03:13.040> an<00:03:13.220> okay<00:03:13.280> job<00:03:13.490> for<00:03:13.910> this<00:03:14.000> particular

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
actually an okay job for this particular

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.310 
actually an okay job for this particular
video<00:03:15.040> it's<00:03:16.040> just<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.730> hundred<00:03:17.030> excope<00:03:17.510> and

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
video it's just a hundred excope and

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.550 
video it's just a hundred excope and
then<00:03:18.650> we<00:03:19.010> want<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.220> take<00:03:19.340> videos<00:03:20.140> of<00:03:21.140> course<00:03:21.410> a

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
then we want to take videos of course a

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.250 
then we want to take videos of course a
USB<00:03:21.950> camera<00:03:22.400> no<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.150> can<00:03:23.390> just<00:03:23.420> tell<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:24.230> that

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
USB camera no I can just tell you that

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.960 
USB camera no I can just tell you that
this<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.620> two<00:03:24.739> megapixel<00:03:24.920> camera<00:03:25.580> and<00:03:25.640> it's

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
this is a two megapixel camera and it's

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.060 
this is a two megapixel camera and it's
dreadful

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
dreadful

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.780 
dreadful
it's<00:03:28.070> got<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.250> horrible<00:03:28.550> noise

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
it's got a horrible noise

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.330 
it's got a horrible noise
characteristics<00:03:29.600> so<00:03:29.840> if<00:03:30.530> you're<00:03:30.800> looking<00:03:31.280> for

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
characteristics so if you're looking for

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.860 
characteristics so if you're looking for
a<00:03:31.400> microscope<00:03:31.850> USB<00:03:33.519> camera<00:03:34.519> head<00:03:34.700> yeah<00:03:35.540> spend

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
a microscope USB camera head yeah spend

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.080 
a microscope USB camera head yeah spend
more<00:03:35.989> than<00:03:36.170> forty<00:03:36.410> dollars<00:03:36.910> but<00:03:37.910> this

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
more than forty dollars but this

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.610 
more than forty dollars but this
inspection<00:03:38.450> microscope<00:03:38.930> did<00:03:39.140> surprising

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
inspection microscope did surprising

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.170 
inspection microscope did surprising
well<00:03:39.739> even<00:03:40.400> though<00:03:40.459> we<00:03:40.489> really<00:03:40.970> need<00:03:41.090> a

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
well even though we really need a

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.759 
well even though we really need a
metallurgical<00:03:41.750> microscope<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:42.440> restart

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
metallurgical microscope to restart

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.520 
metallurgical microscope to restart
seeing<00:03:43.070> down<00:03:43.220> into<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.549> layers<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.360> was<00:03:45.260> in

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
seeing down into the layers so it was in

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.050 
seeing down into the layers so it was in
the<00:03:45.620> really<00:03:45.830> short<00:03:45.950> video<00:03:46.280> just<00:03:46.519> wanted<00:03:46.820> to

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
the really short video just wanted to
