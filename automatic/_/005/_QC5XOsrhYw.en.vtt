00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
so I have the DualShock 3 plugged in I

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.120 
so I have the DualShock 3 plugged in I
have<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.630> iPad<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.500> I'm<00:01:43.619> using<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.040> this

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
video plugged in and now we're going to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.270 
video plugged in and now we're going to
go<00:01:45.720> over<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.990> our<00:01:46.110> computer<00:01:46.590> which<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> Mac

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
go over to our computer which is a Mac

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.190 
go over to our computer which is a Mac
but<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.820> also<00:01:47.970> works<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.360> PCs<00:01:48.750> there'll<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.079> a

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
but it also works on PCs there'll be a

want<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.509> run<00:01:51.689> 6<00:01:52.020> pair<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.130> it

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
want to run 6 pair and you can see it

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.789 
want to run 6 pair and you can see it
detected<00:01:54.240> my<00:01:54.329> iPad<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.899> detected<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.439> sixaxis

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
detected my iPad it detected the sixaxis

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.530 
detected my iPad it detected the sixaxis
controller<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.850> click<00:01:57.060> pair<00:01:57.299> and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.120 
surface of the DualShock 3 controller
that<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.230> now<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.650> could<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.010> start

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
that is and now you could just start

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.070 
that is and now you could just start
playing<00:02:23.370> literally<00:02:24.090> like<00:02:24.270> for<00:02:24.570> real<00:02:24.750> it's

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
playing literally like for real it's

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.140 
playing literally like for real it's
that<00:02:25.350> simple<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.370> buttons<00:02:26.670> are<00:02:26.760> already

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
that simple and the buttons are already

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.180 
that simple and the buttons are already
mapped<00:02:27.420> or<00:02:27.660> already<00:02:27.780> configured<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.070> you

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
mapped or already configured and so you

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.190 
mapped or already configured and so you
can<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.370> use<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.880> d-pad<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.480> go<00:02:30.660> over<00:02:31.020> and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
can just use the d-pad to go over and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.230 
can just use the d-pad to go over and
select<00:02:31.380> stuff<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.700> course<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.030> can<00:02:33.150> use

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
select stuff and of course you can use

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.780 
select stuff and of course you can use
the<00:02:33.360> X<00:02:33.540> button<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.140> submit<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.890> which<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:35.640> like

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
the X button to submit and which is like

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.060 
the X button to submit and which is like
a<00:02:35.820> tap<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.360> screen<00:02:36.480> almost<00:02:36.870> for<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:37.890> area

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
a tap on the screen almost for that area

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.440 
a tap on the screen almost for that area
but<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.400> course<00:02:38.610> these<00:02:38.760> games<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.240> been

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
but of course these games have been

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.480 
but of course these games have been
designed<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.320> work<00:02:40.650> with<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.980> controller<00:02:41.370> so

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
designed to work with the controller so

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.820 
designed to work with the controller so
it's<00:02:41.760> not<00:02:41.850> like<00:02:42.060> you're<00:02:42.209> mapping<00:02:42.510> them<00:02:42.930> in

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
it's not like you're mapping them in

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.860 
it's not like you're mapping them in
certain<00:02:44.160> areas<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:44.850> where<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.480> gets<00:02:45.600> tricky

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
certain areas and where it gets tricky

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.440 
certain areas and where it gets tricky
and<00:02:46.230> stuff<00:02:46.410> like<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:47.550> was<00:02:47.880> good<00:02:48.180> but

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
and stuff like that that was good but

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.479 
and stuff like that that was good but
this<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.750> even<00:02:49.020> better<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.500> actually<00:02:50.310> is

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
this is even better this actually is

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.760 
this is even better this actually is
like<00:02:50.670> native<00:02:51.180> controller<00:02:51.720> support<00:02:52.230> right<00:02:52.620> on

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
like native controller support right on

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.860 
like native controller support right on
iOS<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.520> like<00:02:53.730> having<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.120> gaming<00:02:54.450> console

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
iOS it is like having a gaming console

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.520 
iOS it is like having a gaming console
with<00:02:55.380> iOS<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.100> now<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:57.060> can<00:02:57.270> use<00:02:57.300> your<00:02:58.170> ps3

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
with iOS and now you can use your ps3

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.110 
with iOS and now you can use your ps3
controller<00:02:58.770> that<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.370> probably<00:02:59.610> already<00:02:59.820> own

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
controller that you probably already own

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.540 
controller that you probably already own
and<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.959> works<00:03:01.200> gloriously<00:03:01.950> let<00:03:02.250> me<00:03:02.340> show<00:03:02.489> you

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
and it works gloriously let me show you

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.370
