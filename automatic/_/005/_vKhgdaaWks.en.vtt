00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
from yesterday's wig review I have not

underneath<00:03:46.070> this<00:03:46.820> is<00:03:47.090> just<00:03:47.390> how<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:49.370> is

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
underneath this is just how it is

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.280 
underneath this is just how it is
alright<00:03:50.930> so<00:03:51.290> I<00:03:51.940> think<00:03:52.940> that<00:03:53.480> this<00:03:53.840> look<00:03:54.110> would

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
alright so I think that this look would

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.620 
alright so I think that this look would
look<00:03:54.470> better<00:03:54.739> with<00:03:54.860> a<00:03:55.370> pink<00:03:55.850> lip<00:03:56.209> I<00:03:56.390> don't<00:03:56.420> know

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
look better with a pink lip I don't know

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.380 
look better with a pink lip I don't know
what<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:56.930> is<00:03:57.080> about<00:03:57.230> blonde<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:58.160> pink<00:03:58.820> lips<00:03:59.120> or

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
what it is about blonde and pink lips or

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.150 
what it is about blonde and pink lips or
like<00:03:59.570> a<00:03:59.600> very<00:04:00.019> very<00:04:00.440> red

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
like a very very red

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.000 
like a very very red
I<00:04:01.220> think<00:04:01.880> that<00:04:02.000> that<00:04:02.150> would<00:04:02.300> look<00:04:02.450> so<00:04:03.290> dope<00:04:03.680> um

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
I think that that would look so dope um

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.460 
I think that that would look so dope um
