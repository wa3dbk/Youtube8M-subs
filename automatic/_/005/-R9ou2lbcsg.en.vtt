00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
of those people and I think I've got

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.320 
of those people and I think I've got
some<00:00:47.930> solid<00:00:48.650> reasons<00:00:49.160> as<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.400> why<00:00:49.550> I<00:00:49.760> believe

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
some solid reasons as to why I believe

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.750 
some solid reasons as to why I believe
that<00:00:50.960> this<00:00:51.110> DLC<00:00:51.650> is<00:00:51.860> one<00:00:52.250> of<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.490> worst

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
that this DLC is one of the worst

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.510 
that this DLC is one of the worst
produced<00:00:53.330> in<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.930> lifecycle<00:00:54.350> valve<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.130> for

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
produced in the lifecycle valve you for

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.700 
produced in the lifecycle valve you for
so<00:00:56.150> anyways<00:00:56.480> let's<00:00:56.810> go<00:00:56.960> ahead<00:00:57.020> and<00:00:57.470> dive

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
so anyways let's go ahead and dive

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.710 
so anyways let's go ahead and dive
straight<00:00:57.890> into<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.670> first<00:00:58.940> reason<00:00:59.450> and<00:00:59.600> that

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
straight into the first reason and that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.380 
straight into the first reason and that
is<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.350> there<00:01:00.530> are<00:01:00.650> no<00:01:00.890> new<00:01:01.160> weapons<00:01:01.640> in<00:01:01.910> this

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
to get back at my original topic why I

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.420 
to get back at my original topic why I
don't<00:03:44.359> really<00:03:44.570> like<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:44.959> DLC<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:45.680> another

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
don't really like this DLC and another

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.050 
don't really like this DLC and another
reason<00:03:46.670> is<00:03:47.150> because<00:03:47.420> Rush<00:03:48.380> is<00:03:48.850> horrible<00:03:49.850> I

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
reason is because Rush is horrible I

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.180 
reason is because Rush is horrible I
mean<00:03:50.540> playing<00:03:51.049> rush<00:03:51.290> on<00:03:51.470> these<00:03:51.620> maps<00:03:51.859> it's

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
mean playing rush on these maps it's

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.270 
mean playing rush on these maps it's
really<00:03:53.060> really<00:03:53.600> bad<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:54.170> maps<00:03:54.380> are<00:03:54.650> way<00:03:55.220> too

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
really really bad the maps are way too

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.170 
really really bad the maps are way too
big<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.030> there's<00:03:56.840> barely<00:03:57.109> any<00:03:57.590> cover<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:58.609> you

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
big and there's barely any cover and you

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.300 
big and there's barely any cover and you
know<00:03:59.299> it's<00:03:59.480> unbalanced<00:04:00.170> for<00:04:00.769> example<00:04:01.190> the

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
know it's unbalanced for example the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.750 
know it's unbalanced for example the
first<00:04:01.489> base<00:04:01.819> on<00:04:02.120> hangar<00:04:02.540> 21<00:04:02.930> it's<00:04:03.760> practically

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
first base on hangar 21 it's practically

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.330 
first base on hangar 21 it's practically
impossible<00:04:05.000> for<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.019> attackers<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:06.859> push<00:04:07.040> op

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
impossible for the attackers to push op

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.090 
impossible for the attackers to push op
and<00:04:07.639> for<00:04:08.060> me<00:04:08.180> as<00:04:08.420> person<00:04:08.900> that<00:04:09.079> some<00:04:09.410> usually

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
and for me as person that some usually

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.009 
and for me as person that some usually
place<00:04:10.370> rush<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.090> think<00:04:11.329> that<00:04:11.480> rush<00:04:11.720> is<00:04:11.870> one

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
place rush and I think that rush is one

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.259 
place rush and I think that rush is one
of<00:04:12.139> the<00:04:12.200> most<00:04:12.350> fun<00:04:12.620> game<00:04:12.950> modes<00:04:13.220> in<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:14.090> BAL

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
of the most fun game modes in the BAL

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.120 
of the most fun game modes in the BAL
view<00:04:14.510> game<00:04:14.750> this<00:04:15.350> is<00:04:15.590> very<00:04:15.859> very

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
view game this is very very

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.370 
view game this is very very
disappointing<00:04:16.940> for<00:04:16.970> me<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.479> mean<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:17.989> was<00:04:18.169> kind

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
disappointing for me I mean I was kind

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.039 
disappointing for me I mean I was kind
of<00:04:18.470> expecting<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:19.250> because<00:04:19.729> Rush<00:04:20.389> wasn't<00:04:20.959> the

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
of expecting it because Rush wasn't the

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.860 
of expecting it because Rush wasn't the
best<00:04:21.289> in<00:04:21.650> battlefields<00:04:22.460> but<00:04:22.820> in<00:04:23.000> this<00:04:23.120> DLC<00:04:23.360> I

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
best in battlefields but in this DLC I

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.409 
best in battlefields but in this DLC I
think<00:04:24.289> it's<00:04:24.470> even<00:04:24.680> worse<00:04:25.070> than<00:04:25.430> than<00:04:26.150> in<00:04:26.300> the

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
think it's even worse than than in the

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.600 
think it's even worse than than in the
vanilla<00:04:26.720> maps<00:04:27.080> so<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:27.740> know<00:04:27.919> that<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.190> maps<00:04:28.430> are

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
vanilla maps so I know that the maps are

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.029 
vanilla maps so I know that the maps are
very<00:04:28.639> big<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:29.419> I'm<00:04:29.870> obviously<00:04:30.110> for<00:04:30.680> conquest

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
very big and I'm obviously for conquest

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.010 
very big and I'm obviously for conquest
that<00:04:31.610> is<00:04:31.729> gonna<00:04:31.910> be<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.150> good<00:04:32.479> thing<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.900> mean

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
that is gonna be a good thing I mean

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.719 
that is gonna be a good thing I mean
people<00:04:33.350> that<00:04:33.410> are<00:04:33.530> really<00:04:33.740> into<00:04:34.070> conquest<00:04:34.490> I

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
people that are really into conquest I

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.540 
people that are really into conquest I
think<00:04:35.180> that<00:04:35.389> time<00:04:35.660> this<00:04:35.900> DLC<00:04:36.380> for<00:04:36.530> them<00:04:36.800> might

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
think that time this DLC for them might

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.180 
think that time this DLC for them might
be<00:04:37.700> very<00:04:38.000> very<00:04:38.120> right<00:04:38.780> but<00:04:39.110> for<00:04:39.229> me<00:04:39.409> as<00:04:39.650> person

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
be very very right but for me as person

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.830 
be very very right but for me as person
that<00:04:40.340> doesn't<00:04:40.610> really<00:04:40.909> play<00:04:41.060> much<00:04:41.150> conquest

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
that doesn't really play much conquest

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.290 
that doesn't really play much conquest
and<00:04:42.110> mainly<00:04:42.380> focus<00:04:42.740> on<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.010> infantry<00:04:43.430> plays

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
and mainly focus on the infantry plays

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.809 
and mainly focus on the infantry plays
this<00:04:44.419> was<00:04:44.750> kind<00:04:45.169> of<00:04:45.259> a<00:04:45.349> letdown<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.830> me<00:04:46.400> now

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
this was kind of a letdown to me now

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.430 
this was kind of a letdown to me now
these<00:04:47.000> big<00:04:47.240> maps<00:04:47.509> them<00:04:47.750> bring<00:04:47.960> me<00:04:47.990> back<00:04:48.259> to

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
these big maps them bring me back to

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.320 
these big maps them bring me back to
another<00:04:48.680> point<00:04:49.069> which<00:04:49.520> is<00:04:49.699> that<00:04:49.849> there's<00:04:50.030> no

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
another point which is that there's no

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.210 
another point which is that there's no
LEvolution<00:04:50.870> or<00:04:51.229> there's<00:04:51.590> barely<00:04:51.889> any

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
LEvolution or there's barely any

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.430 
LEvolution or there's barely any
LEvolution<00:04:52.639> I<00:04:52.909> mean<00:04:53.090> there's<00:04:53.300> um<00:04:53.690> one<00:04:54.139> where

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
LEvolution I mean there's um one where

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.439 
LEvolution I mean there's um one where
the<00:04:54.710> roof<00:04:54.889> crashes<00:04:55.430> but<00:04:55.970> there<00:04:56.120> aren't<00:04:56.270> any

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
the roof crashes but there aren't any

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.020 
the roof crashes but there aren't any
major<00:04:56.810> or<00:04:57.259> game-changing<00:04:58.159> LEvolution<00:04:58.550> things

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
major or game-changing LEvolution things

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.200 
major or game-changing LEvolution things
that<00:04:59.449> really<00:04:59.720> alter<00:05:00.379> the<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:01.430> flow<00:05:01.759> of<00:05:01.789> the

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
that really alter the the flow of the

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.230 
that really alter the the flow of the
map<00:05:02.479> because<00:05:03.379> I<00:05:03.560> could<00:05:04.129> really<00:05:04.340> see<00:05:04.729> some

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
map because I could really see some

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.360 
map because I could really see some
great<00:05:05.509> potential<00:05:05.900> year<00:05:06.409> I<00:05:06.440> mean<00:05:06.710> most<00:05:06.919> most<00:05:07.220> of

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
great potential year I mean most most of

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.850 
great potential year I mean most most of
the<00:05:07.430> maps<00:05:07.639> are<00:05:07.879> snow<00:05:08.270> maps<00:05:08.539> so<00:05:09.050> how<00:05:09.470> cool<00:05:09.710> would

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
the maps are snow maps so how cool would

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.129 
the maps are snow maps so how cool would
it<00:05:09.919> be<00:05:10.039> if<00:05:10.430> I'm<00:05:11.030> if<00:05:11.210> there<00:05:11.419> was<00:05:11.599> just<00:05:11.629> this

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
it be if I'm if there was just this

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.950 
it be if I'm if there was just this
giant<00:05:12.590> avalanche<00:05:13.310> crushing<00:05:14.300> down<00:05:14.449> on<00:05:14.690> the<00:05:14.780> map

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
giant avalanche crushing down on the map

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.439 
giant avalanche crushing down on the map
and<00:05:15.259> covering<00:05:15.889> then<00:05:16.129> the<00:05:16.490> whole<00:05:16.699> map<00:05:16.879> in<00:05:17.030> snow

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
and covering then the whole map in snow

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.689 
and covering then the whole map in snow
so<00:05:17.930> before<00:05:18.259> it<00:05:18.349> will<00:05:18.500> be<00:05:18.620> just<00:05:18.830> just<00:05:19.280> grounds

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
so before it will be just just grounds

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.610 
so before it will be just just grounds
and<00:05:19.849> rocks<00:05:20.090> and<00:05:20.360> after<00:05:20.810> that<00:05:20.930> Vilanch<00:05:21.289> it<00:05:21.500> will

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
and rocks and after that Vilanch it will

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.369 
and rocks and after that Vilanch it will
turn<00:05:21.979> into<00:05:22.219> a<00:05:22.580> snow<00:05:23.030> map<00:05:23.330> I<00:05:23.599> mean<00:05:23.960> I<00:05:23.990> see<00:05:24.229> so

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:24.379 
turn into a snow map I mean I see so

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:27.040 
turn into a snow map I mean I see so
much<00:05:24.530> potential<00:05:24.919> here<00:05:25.159> and<00:05:25.580> and<00:05:26.120> did<00:05:26.599> not<00:05:26.810> see

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
much potential here and and did not see
