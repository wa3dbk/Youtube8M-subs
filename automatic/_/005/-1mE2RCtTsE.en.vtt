hi<00:00:04.950> my<00:00:05.250> name<00:00:05.460> is<00:00:05.490> Julia<00:00:05.970> I'm<00:00:06.509> going<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.779> show

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
hi my name is Julia I'm going to show

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.339 
hi my name is Julia I'm going to show
you<00:00:06.990> division<00:00:07.649> as<00:00:08.069> repeated<00:00:08.880> subtraction

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:09.349 
you division as repeated subtraction

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.999 
you division as repeated subtraction
using<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.559> number<00:00:10.860> line<00:00:12.019> so<00:00:13.019> let's<00:00:13.440> say<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:13.740> have

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
using a number line so let's say we have

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.410 
using a number line so let's say we have
a<00:00:14.040> division<00:00:14.519> problem<00:00:14.759> like<00:00:15.420> 6<00:00:15.839> divided<00:00:16.560> by<00:00:16.590> 2<00:00:17.420> 6

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
a division problem like 6 divided by 2 6

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.760 
a division problem like 6 divided by 2 6
divided<00:00:19.050> by<00:00:19.080> 2

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
divided by 2

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.910 
divided by 2
we're<00:00:20.430> gonna<00:00:20.550> use<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> number<00:00:21.420> line<00:00:24.920> let's

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
we're gonna use a number line let's

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:34.990 
we're gonna use a number line let's
start<00:00:26.160> zero<00:00:26.580> here<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.359> then<00:00:27.689> 1<00:00:28.429> 2<00:00:29.599> 3<00:00:30.769> 4<00:00:33.079> 5<00:00:34.079> &amp;<00:00:34.770> 6

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
start zero here and then 1 2 3 4 5 &amp; 6

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.590 
start zero here and then 1 2 3 4 5 &amp; 6
line<00:00:36.000> number<00:00:36.360> these<00:00:36.540> 1<00:00:36.960> 2<00:00:36.989> 3<00:00:37.739> 4<00:00:38.460> 5<00:00:39.680> 6<00:00:41.270> so<00:00:42.270> if

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
line number these 1 2 3 4 5 6 so if

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.229 
line number these 1 2 3 4 5 6 so if
we're<00:00:42.809> gonna<00:00:42.930> divide<00:00:43.379> 6<00:00:44.040> by<00:00:44.190> 2<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> number

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
we're gonna divide 6 by 2 on the number

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.750 
we're gonna divide 6 by 2 on the number
line<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:46.020> start<00:00:46.950> at<00:00:47.160> 6<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.629> just

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
line we start at 6 and we just

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.250 
line we start at 6 and we just
repeatedly<00:00:50.760> subtract<00:00:51.420> 2<00:00:52.100> until<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.280> reach<00:00:53.670> 0

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
repeatedly subtract 2 until we reach 0

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.529 
repeatedly subtract 2 until we reach 0
if<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> remainder<00:00:57.000> than<00:00:59.300> we<00:01:00.300> would

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
if we have a remainder than we would

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.700 
if we have a remainder than we would
stop<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:00.989> short<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.859> zero<00:01:02.520> before<00:01:02.850> we

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
stop just short of zero before we

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.370 
stop just short of zero before we
completed<00:01:04.710> our<00:01:04.949> final<00:01:05.430> two<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.600> picked<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
completed our final two but I picked a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.859 
completed our final two but I picked a
nice<00:01:07.560> number<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.420> want<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.750> any

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
nice number so we want to have any

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.190 
nice number so we want to have any
remainders<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.729> we're<00:01:11.939> gonna<00:01:12.030> subtract<00:01:12.840> 2

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
remainders so we're gonna subtract 2

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.940 
remainders so we're gonna subtract 2
there's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.950> minus<00:01:14.400> 2<00:01:14.869> we're<00:01:15.869> gonna<00:01:15.930> subtract<00:01:16.619> 2

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
there's a minus 2 we're gonna subtract 2

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.390 
there's a minus 2 we're gonna subtract 2
again<00:01:17.310> there's<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.030> minus<00:01:18.509> 2<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:19.830> subtract

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
again there's a minus 2 and we subtract

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.570 
again there's a minus 2 and we subtract
2<00:01:21.500> again<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.830> hit<00:01:23.070> zero<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:24.740> we<00:01:25.740> subtracted

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
2 again and we hit zero so we subtracted

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.210 
2 again and we hit zero so we subtracted
2<00:01:26.960> three<00:01:27.960> times<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:30.119> 6<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.770> take<00:01:31.979> away<00:01:32.130> 2

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
2 three times so 6 and you take away 2

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.200 
2 three times so 6 and you take away 2
three<00:01:32.820> times<00:01:32.990> is<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.619> same<00:01:34.920> as<00:01:35.159> 6<00:01:35.579> divided<00:01:36.180> by

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
three times is the same as 6 divided by

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.260 
three times is the same as 6 divided by
2<00:01:36.329> giving<00:01:37.140> us<00:01:37.530> 3<00:01:38.220> because<00:01:38.729> think<00:01:38.970> about<00:01:39.090> it

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
2 giving us 3 because think about it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.350 
2 giving us 3 because think about it
division<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:40.229> asking<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.890> how<00:01:41.790> many<00:01:41.850> times

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
division is asking you how many times

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.410 
division is asking you how many times
does<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.899> number<00:01:43.140> fit<00:01:43.619> into<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.130> one<00:01:44.420> we'll

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
does this number fit into that one we'll

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.690 
does this number fit into that one we'll
do<00:01:45.570> another<00:01:45.840> example<00:01:46.079> let's<00:01:46.710> say<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:47.009> did<00:01:47.280> 6

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
do another example let's say we did 6

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.940 
do another example let's say we did 6
divided<00:01:48.240> by<00:01:48.270> 3<00:01:49.220> 6<00:01:50.220> divided<00:01:50.790> by<00:01:50.820> 3<00:01:51.649> will<00:01:52.649> start

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
divided by 3 6 divided by 3 will start

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.940 
divided by 3 6 divided by 3 will start
at<00:01:53.100> 6<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.790> time<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.270> subtract<00:01:54.840> 3<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.649> see

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
at 6 and this time we subtract 3 and see

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.789 
at 6 and this time we subtract 3 and see
how<00:01:56.070> many<00:01:56.219> times<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.729> fits<00:01:56.969> into<00:01:57.180> 6<00:01:57.649> there<00:01:58.649> you

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
how many times it fits into 6 there you

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.859 
how many times it fits into 6 there you
go

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
go

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.810 
go
-3<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
-3 and

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.480 
-3 and
-<00:02:03.720> three<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:07.020> they're<00:02:07.290> dividing<00:02:07.860> by<00:02:08.009> three<00:02:08.369> is

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
- three and they're dividing by three is

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.660 
- three and they're dividing by three is
the<00:02:08.670> same<00:02:08.880> as<00:02:09.090> subtracting<00:02:09.240> three<00:02:10.229> twice<00:02:10.860> so

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the same as subtracting three twice so

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.050 
the same as subtracting three twice so
six<00:02:12.000> divided<00:02:12.570> by<00:02:12.750> three<00:02:13.260> equals<00:02:13.790> two<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:17.459> this

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
six divided by three equals two and this

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.220 
six divided by three equals two and this
is<00:02:18.300> how<00:02:18.540> division<00:02:19.380> can<00:02:20.010> be<00:02:20.040> thought<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.490> as

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
is how division can be thought of as

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.620 
is how division can be thought of as
repeated<00:02:22.230> subtraction<00:02:23.270> thank<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.420> for

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
repeated subtraction thank you for

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.080 
repeated subtraction thank you for
watching
