00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
architect because you have an open

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.630 
architect because you have an open
platform<00:00:54.360> where<00:00:54.780> anyone<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.800> approve

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
platform where anyone can just approve

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.279 
platform where anyone can just approve
the<00:00:56.730> model<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.690> visualize<00:00:58.050> it

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the model and then you can visualize it

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.250 
the model and then you can visualize it
so<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> outside<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:00.260> development

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
so this is the outside of a development

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.049 
so this is the outside of a development
exactly<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.010> then<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.399> zoom<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.760> right

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
exactly and then you can zoom in right

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.369 
exactly and then you can zoom in right
until<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.510> are<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> ground<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.170> they're

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
until you are in the ground and they're

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.440 
until you are in the ground and they're
Yorker<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.890> deck<00:01:05.100> yeah<00:01:05.460> you're<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> middle

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
Yorker on deck yeah you're in the middle

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.210 
Yorker on deck yeah you're in the middle
so<00:01:07.140> there<00:01:07.290> we<00:01:07.470> are<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.590> little<00:01:07.740> bit<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
so there we are a little bit of the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.190 
so there we are a little bit of the
crossing<00:01:08.549> between<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.210> augmented<00:01:09.810> reality

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
crossing between the augmented reality

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.050 
crossing between the augmented reality
and<00:01:10.380> rotary<00:01:10.710> exactly<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.760> we're<00:01:11.970> just

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and rotary exactly and we're just

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.280 
and rotary exactly and we're just
standing<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> room<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.170> we

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
standing here in the room all because we

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.399 
standing here in the room all because we
zoomed<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.189> 3d<00:01:15.119> rendered<00:01:15.479> model<00:01:15.930> at<00:01:16.170> some

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
zoomed in on a 3d rendered model at some

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.469 
zoomed in on a 3d rendered model at some
point<00:01:16.619> we're<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.830> excited<00:01:17.250> exactly<00:01:17.909> yeah<00:01:18.270> and

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
point we're in excited exactly yeah and

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.770 
point we're in excited exactly yeah and
then<00:01:19.430> sometimes<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.670> may<00:01:21.000> want<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.240> buy<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> new

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
then sometimes you may want to buy a new

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.420 
then sometimes you may want to buy a new
pair<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:21.990> shoes<00:01:22.080> or<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> nut<00:01:22.650> vehicle<00:01:23.070> show<00:01:23.310> me

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
pair of shoes or a nut vehicle show me

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.980 
pair of shoes or a nut vehicle show me
the<00:01:23.520> car<00:01:23.729> before<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.150> show<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.540> other<00:01:24.780> thing

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the car before you show the other thing

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.719 
the car before you show the other thing
here<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.799> card<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.460> card

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
here so this is the card just a card

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.999 
here so this is the card just a card
looks<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.330> art<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.380> say<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.920> an

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
looks like art but as I say that is an

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.640 
looks like art but as I say that is an
image<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:30.000> program<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.810> recognize<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
image that the program can recognize and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.130 
image that the program can recognize and
once<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.670> place<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.880> card<00:01:33.210> within<00:01:33.509> view<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
once you place the card within view the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.630 
once you place the card within view the
camera<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:36.090> shoe<00:01:36.600> appears<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.009> drop<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
camera the shoe appears and you drop the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.789 
camera the shoe appears and you drop the
card<00:01:38.850> really<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> place<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.500> placeholder

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
simulation and this is great even for

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.300 
simulation and this is great even for
not<00:03:39.660> just<00:03:39.840> enterprise<00:03:40.290> sales<00:03:40.560> reps<00:03:40.829> but<00:03:40.980> even

just where augmented reality is really
taking<00:04:13.400> things<00:04:13.730> we<00:04:14.510> like<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:14.960> think<00:04:15.200> of

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
taking things we like to think of

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.870 
taking things we like to think of
wearables<00:04:15.860> as<00:04:16.040> being<00:04:16.280> one<00:04:16.520> of<00:04:16.580> the<00:04:16.700> big

leading<00:04:17.360> applications<00:04:17.930> for<00:04:18.110> AR<00:04:18.770> but<00:04:19.100> really

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
leading applications for AR but really

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.580 
leading applications for AR but really
