 If you say the person who is giving a result so-called success person 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.890
 Say whether they put out the results by moving their own doing what the people like is called

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:06.080
 Marketing isn't so sweet, and the plans I thought about myself have almost failed 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:13.130
 Though

 Thanks to something, we have about 100 million yen in sales for the year so far 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:22.260
 In terms of projects that are involved it becomes about two billion yen 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:26.550
 The result of that much has come to be able to give a result 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.990

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:13.120
 Every day 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:18.800

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:24.830
 You can create a state in which you are achieving results 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:30.430
 So not only me but the so-called successes around you 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:38.680

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:43.629
 I can say that I'm engaged and I can say that completely positive person or anything 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:50.450
 There is no one more person, so I am an ordinary person in the hall already 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:51.030
