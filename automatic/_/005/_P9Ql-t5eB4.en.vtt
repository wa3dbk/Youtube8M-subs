00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
find out that it's all fake so she

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.009 
find out that it's all fake so she
declines<00:03:57.510> their<00:03:57.690> offer

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019

however the rainbow one won't get lost

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.970 
however the rainbow one won't get lost
so<00:04:00.750> daring<00:04:01.080> acts<00:04:01.260> as<00:04:01.470> if<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.709> help<00:04:01.890> is

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
so daring acts as if the help is

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.500 
so daring acts as if the help is
actually<00:04:02.130> appreciated<00:04:02.880> even<00:04:03.120> though<00:04:03.330> she's

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
actually appreciated even though she's

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.110 
actually appreciated even though she's
never<00:04:03.720> in<00:04:03.870> any<00:04:03.989> real<00:04:04.110> danger<00:04:04.320> in<00:04:05.310> an<00:04:05.760> attempt

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
never in any real danger in an attempt

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.570 
never in any real danger in an attempt
to<00:04:06.180> satisfy<00:04:06.570> her<00:04:06.989> fangirl<00:04:07.500> daring<00:04:08.160> finishes

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
to satisfy her fangirl daring finishes

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.070 
to satisfy her fangirl daring finishes
the<00:04:08.760> story<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.120> puts<00:04:09.269> Rainbow<00:04:09.540> Dash<00:04:09.750> in<00:04:09.930> it

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
the story and puts Rainbow Dash in it

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.690 
the story and puts Rainbow Dash in it
hoping<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.530> rainbow<00:04:10.799> mane<00:04:10.980> Pony<00:04:11.250> won't<00:04:11.549> show

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
hoping the rainbow mane Pony won't show

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.570 
hoping the rainbow mane Pony won't show
up<00:04:11.760> again

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
up again

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.310 
up again
so<00:04:14.180> that's<00:04:14.360> the<00:04:14.540> theory<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:14.840> would<00:04:15.080> explain

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
so that's the theory that would explain

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.380 
so that's the theory that would explain
some<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.830> quote-unquote<00:04:16.519> problems<00:04:17.120> with

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
some of the quote-unquote problems with

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.390 
some of the quote-unquote problems with
daring<00:04:17.690> don't<00:04:17.900> personally<00:04:18.890> I'm<00:04:19.010> perfectly

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
daring don't personally I'm perfectly

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.830 
daring don't personally I'm perfectly

fine just enjoying the episode and

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.360

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
the guys that are actually good at it

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.840 
the guys that are actually good at it
but<00:04:24.650> this<00:04:24.830> is<00:04:24.950> just<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.250> theory<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:25.670> would

but this is just a theory that would
