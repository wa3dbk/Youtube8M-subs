stripes<00:00:30.320> because<00:00:30.710> I<00:00:31.039> thought<00:00:31.250> that<00:00:31.789> looks

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
stripes because I thought that looks

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.889 
stripes because I thought that looks
cool<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:34.010> it<00:00:34.190> does<00:00:34.399> so<00:00:34.670> ivory<00:00:35.270> made<00:00:35.480> him<00:00:35.660> and

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
cool and it does so ivory made him and

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
he looks way more kick ass now because I

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.240

had more time to work on him it's weird
to<00:00:43.550> me<00:00:43.700> that<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:44.360> char<00:00:44.690> are<00:00:45.050> that<00:00:45.320> kind<00:00:45.590> of

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
to me that the char are that kind of

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.250 
to me that the char are that kind of
race<00:00:45.890> that<00:00:46.160> people<00:00:46.550> either<00:00:46.730> hate<00:00:46.910> or<00:00:47.450> they

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
race that people either hate or they

race that people either hate or they
love<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:49.430> at<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:50.149> same<00:00:50.300> time<00:00:50.360> there<00:00:51.079> are

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
love and at the same time there are

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.340 
love and at the same time there are
barely<00:00:51.559> any<00:00:51.739> charring<00:00:52.460> game<00:00:52.670> right<00:00:52.879> now<00:00:53.170> if<00:00:54.170> I

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
barely any charring game right now if I

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.049 
barely any charring game right now if I
could<00:00:54.559> pick<00:00:54.739> one<00:00:54.800> race<00:00:55.280> that<00:00:55.430> I<00:00:55.520> see<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:55.910> least

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
could pick one race that I see the least

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.360 
could pick one race that I see the least
off<00:00:56.329> it<00:00:56.570> would<00:00:56.690> definitely<00:00:56.809> be<00:00:57.079> char<00:00:57.410> which<00:00:58.219> is

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
off it would definitely be char which is

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.010 
off it would definitely be char which is
kind<00:00:58.579> of<00:00:58.640> strange<00:00:58.790> cuz<00:00:59.180> they're<00:00:59.360> huge<00:00:59.660> so<00:00:59.960> you

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
kind of strange cuz they're huge so you

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.470 
kind of strange cuz they're huge so you
think<00:01:00.140> you'd<00:01:00.469> see<00:01:00.620> more<00:01:00.829> of<00:01:01.010> them<00:01:01.280> but<00:01:02.059> no<00:01:02.270> you

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
think you'd see more of them but no you
