00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.860 
scenarios I think it the lights worked
against<00:00:51.650> the<00:00:51.740> 450s<00:00:52.400> as<00:00:52.610> we<00:00:52.760> saw<00:00:52.970> tonight<00:00:53.150> Jake

the urgency and I got to get short and I
think<00:01:33.889> at<00:01:33.979> that<00:01:34.039> point<00:01:34.159> in<00:01:34.639> my<00:01:34.819> opinion<00:01:35.179> he

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
think at that point in my opinion he

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.149 
think at that point in my opinion he
could<00:01:35.960> have<00:01:36.049> maybe<00:01:36.200> taken<00:01:36.679> a<00:01:36.740> breath<00:01:36.950> and

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
could have maybe taken a breath and

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.559 
could have maybe taken a breath and
waited<00:01:37.639> a<00:01:37.729> little<00:01:37.850> bit<00:01:38.090> because<00:01:38.179> there<00:01:38.450> was

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
waited a little bit because there was

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.020 
waited a little bit because there was
still<00:01:38.749> a<00:01:38.810> lot<00:01:39.049> of<00:01:39.079> timing<00:01:39.619> race<00:01:39.829> to<00:01:40.579> go<00:01:40.789> around

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
still a lot of timing race to go around

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.389 
still a lot of timing race to go around
and<00:01:41.359> make<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:41.630> pass<00:01:42.530> on<00:01:42.710> Andrew<00:01:43.039> short<00:01:43.249> where

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
and make a pass on Andrew short where

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.340 
and make a pass on Andrew short where
they<00:01:43.490> didn't<00:01:43.759> come<00:01:43.939> together<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.509> but<00:01:45.049> you

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
they didn't come together and but you
