00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
so like let's say I was level 33 and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.420 
so like let's say I was level 33 and
soared<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.300> like<00:01:35.570> halfway<00:01:35.810> through<00:01:36.130> well<00:01:37.130> if

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
soared and like halfway through well if

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.430 
soared and like halfway through well if
I<00:01:37.550> submit<00:01:37.850> taking<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.480> jail<00:01:38.780> then<00:01:39.230> that's

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
I submit taking to jail then that's

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.290 
I submit taking to jail then that's
going<00:01:39.620> to<00:01:39.680> go<00:01:39.860> from<00:01:40.220> halfway<00:01:40.460> through<00:01:40.880> back<00:01:41.150> to

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
going to go from halfway through back to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.330 
going to go from halfway through back to
the<00:01:41.390> beginning<00:01:41.750> so<00:01:41.930> I<00:01:42.200> still<00:01:42.650> have<00:01:42.740> 33<00:01:43.190> and

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
the beginning so I still have 33 and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.820 
the beginning so I still have 33 and
one-handed<00:01:43.850> but<00:01:44.090> I'm<00:01:44.330> not<00:01:44.570> going<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.840> have<00:01:44.990> 33

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.350 
one-handed but I'm not going to have 33
and<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:45.950> half<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:46.400> makes<00:01:46.610> sense<00:01:46.790> and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
and a half that makes sense and

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.120 
and a half that makes sense and
obviously<00:01:47.840> if<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.110> say<00:01:48.290> I'd<00:01:48.380> rather<00:01:48.500> die<00:01:48.770> go<00:01:49.070> to

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
obviously if I say I'd rather die go to

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.000
