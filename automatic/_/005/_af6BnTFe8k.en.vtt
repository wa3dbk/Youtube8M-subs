00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
obvious because the Bible is like the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.560

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.890 

like<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.580> first<00:02:24.850> time<00:02:25.000> somebody<00:02:25.360> sneezed

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
like the first time somebody sneezed

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:38.960 
like the first time somebody sneezed
they<00:02:26.590> must<00:02:26.830> just<00:02:26.920> be<00:02:34.350> like<00:02:35.350> million<00:02:35.650> times

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.590 

particles<00:02:39.970> in<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.120> air<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.840> they<00:02:41.970> Agnes<00:02:42.970> I

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.970 

thought<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.780> best<00:02:46.990> way<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.260> get<00:02:47.500> rid<00:02:47.710> of<00:02:47.740> that

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
thought the best way to get rid of that

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.130 
thought the best way to get rid of that
is<00:02:48.220> for<00:02:48.430> your<00:02:48.550> body<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:49.090> just<00:02:49.240> violently

is for your body to just violently

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.520 
is for your body to just violently

objective when you least expect it

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.930 
objective when you least expect it
