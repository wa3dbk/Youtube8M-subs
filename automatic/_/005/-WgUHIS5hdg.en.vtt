00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello friends now i offer you 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.200
 look at my kettle and see 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.389
 how much he glitters inside someone 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.090
 would think that this is a new kettle but on 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.660
 there really is not about two teapots 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.600
 years we systematically remove scum from 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.390
 kettle although we have very hard water and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.550
 still literally half an hour ago 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.279
 the kettle looked inside like this 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.260
 we have so terrible water 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.230
 tough that's such a scum 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.770
 formed in just one month and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.840
 Now I will show you cheap 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.629
 environmentally friendly simple and high 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.079
 effective way to remove scale from 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.570
 Kettle to start to get water if 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.719
 scum accumulated a lot then you first need 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.180
 clean the bottom and in that case not 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.030
 it is enough to get plenty of water 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.390
 will be 300 milliliters in my case 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.270
 scale is not deposited very much but she 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.570
 gathered around the kettle and I type 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.430
 kettle to the maximum well, and now in the case 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.979
 fighter with scum will enter 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.920
 in order to clear so many 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.640
 I need only one scum 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.380
 carry gram bag of citric acid 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.890
 pour it in the kettle and immediately 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.140
 reaction begins even in cold water 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.500
 citrus begins 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.590
 calcareous acids like 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.310
 you see the kettle fork is not included in 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.829
 outlet 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.470
 the reaction can be greatly accelerated and 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.170
 strengthen by the fact that we boil 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.329
 this solution 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.000
 I have now turned on the kettle 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.430
 into the electrical network and started 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.159
 enhanced reaction kettle still 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.680
 just starting to boil and how are you 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.500
 see efficiency increases 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.280
 already the bottom begins to shine and 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.860
 the walls break off whole flakes if 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.710
 scale accumulated more than my case 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.710
 then one bag of 10 thunderous will 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.810
 not enough as well if nakid not 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.420
 retired the first time then 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.170
 kettle can be left for a while 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.560
 to continue the dissolution reaction and 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.950
 boil 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.810
 again after some time in the end 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.510
 can be achieved here such 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.480
 results in this way 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.230
 scum from the kettle we already use not 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.110
 the first year this method does not harm the teapot 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.160
 environmentally friendly highly efficient and 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.319
 inexpensive 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.319
 Thank you for your attention goodbye
