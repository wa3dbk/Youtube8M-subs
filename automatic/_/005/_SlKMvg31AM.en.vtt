00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.319 
to pull it off the thing but has
beautiful<00:02:04.590> toning<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.340> see<00:02:05.549> it

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
beautiful toning as you can see it

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.199 
beautiful toning as you can see it
turned<00:02:06.570> out<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.649> not<00:02:07.680> silver<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.060> can

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
turned out it is not silver but if I can

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.859 
turned out it is not silver but if I can
get<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.450> off<00:02:09.599> without<00:02:10.020> damaging

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869

coin<00:02:11.049> is<00:02:11.260> an<00:02:11.530> unbelievably<00:02:12.220> beautifully

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760

coin is an unbelievably beautifully
toned<00:02:13.000> coin<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:13.780> that's<00:02:14.530> probably<00:02:14.769> worth<00:02:15.099> a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
toned coin so that's probably worth a

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.899 
toned coin so that's probably worth a
couple<00:02:15.220> nice<00:02:15.790> bucks<00:02:16.830> over<00:02:17.830> here<00:02:18.159> we've<00:02:18.730> got<00:02:18.879> a

marked here but I was pretty confident

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.800

that<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.099> was<00:02:24.280> silver<00:02:24.519> because<00:02:25.390> as<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:25.720> can

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810
