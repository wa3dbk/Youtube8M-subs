 be uploading a review of this 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.690
 product that of this product 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.280
 good as they are, I hope 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.080
 are the best I am angelic and the 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.210
 today we are going to make a bed for 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.660
 our pets are going to see what is 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.250
 Super cute is as tender as I told you 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.560
 social networks mainly in 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.059
 facebook and on instagram I told you that 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.860
 we were going to start with the Hawaiian ones for 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.870
 pets what we are going to occupy is a 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.090
 you can get it in the center or 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.640
 in the market where things of 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.660
 vegetable and things like that 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.250
 you will only be asking the Lord to the 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.660
 miss and so the one that a gift you 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.940
 they want to sell it and they will know that the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.440
 you are going to find super fast I hope that 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.260
 like it a lot and then let's see the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.199
 video for this we're going to need a 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.089
 grate of the old clothes or of 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.830
 preference is the older one because if 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.159
 we can not yet give it to someone who 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.960
 I need it 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.960
 varnish paint 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:16.590
 hammer brush and how I am a little 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.590
 special also get a league 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.520
 The first thing we are going to do is remove 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.820
 two tacitas of our rich with the help 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.979
 of hammer in this way 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.450
 the truth that it is super easy to remove it 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.220
 nothing else you have to have a bit of 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.250
 Be careful not to break it 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.930
 at least if we must keep a 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.880
 little board because we're going to go back to 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.890
 occupy 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.899
 what we are going to do with the second 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.820
 small board is to go down to the 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.439
 less because unimax is very tiny 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.420
 then his legs would not reach him 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.310
 to climb to your bed but if your puppy 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.289
 It is a little bigger as it would 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.700
 well that I let her seal it you would have to 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.219
 remove 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.530
 then we remove it very carefully and 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.110
 we put it back a little lower 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.329
 where was the next thing I did 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.219
 it was to sand the grid but you can jump from 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.009
 this step always when your grate then 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.319
 be very well and do not have those little ones 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.910
 bits of wood what happens is that 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.970
 could your dog and all your kitten 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.130
 splinter and we do not want what 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.319
 next thing we're going to do is varnish 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.620
 Our grid is to use super simple as 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.420
 if we painted it, take your time put the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.030
 capita that are necessary and you will see 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.440
 what is going to be super divine we are going to 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.540
 paint also the inside 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.209
 except the middle one because in a 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.480
 moment more we will try it once 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.480
 we 're going to let it dry and now 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.910
 if we prepare the inside part for 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.099
 this time I had two cushion quoted if 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.799
 they are pretty old enough 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.890
 washed out then I decided to put the 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.989
 clothes and if you do not have something like this not 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.790
 you worry only you are folding the 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.790
 clothes and put it inside the grate 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.900
 and I also found this dress 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.410
 I'm going to show you how I am going to 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.410
 use 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.069
 let's go putting the cloth the clothes what 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.689
 that is what they want to call in 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.689
 of the grate in an orderly manner 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.180
 finally put the dress on the 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.490
 cushions so it does not look like this 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.620
 that the things there thrown nothing else in the 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.300
 grate and look a little bit more like 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.430
 fact 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.760
 here you do not sew anything or stick anything is 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.380
 best of all I suppose and the only thing 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.900
 we are going to do is put fabric through 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.090
 bottom part when it gets dirty 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.910
 just remove it you wash it and what 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.010
 you put the final detail back 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.010
 wonderful detail is to add the 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.570
 name of your pet this I loved 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.550
 had the black paint principle but 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.440
 with the varnish it was very dark then 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.840
 I opted for the red paint in addition to 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.760
 also combines as with the inside and 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.910
 so I put a fingerprint in the case of 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.910
 plus 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.850
 seriously you have to try 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.160
 because surely your pet is going 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.560
 to thank too much my max is like 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.240
 this bed is mine and it does not loose at all 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.500
 I take this moment to send 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.120
 greetings to those as they were 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.770
 asking for a while and also 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.020
 those who have sent me photos of 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.210
 things that have made the greetings are for 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.199
 for Andrea Chávez who made the letter of the 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.060
 February 14 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.860
 for isabel mora who made the candle of 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.120
 cupcakes for a final project and you 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.160

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.330
 nails that I made with my divine friend 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.310

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.479
 palanquetas that we did there by 16 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.860

 delicious and you can eat them in 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.060
 any time to me the truth that I 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.740
 they loved to start was that he completed 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.650
 his disguise of dead with some bruises 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.830
