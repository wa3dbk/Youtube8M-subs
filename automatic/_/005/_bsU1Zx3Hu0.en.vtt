to<00:01:45.210> choose<00:01:45.420> from<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:45.869> you'd<00:01:46.320> think<00:01:46.560> once

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
to choose from but you'd think once

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.550

many<00:03:27.810> but<00:03:28.109> nonetheless<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.950> Lucas<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.400> the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
many but nonetheless that Lucas is the

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.339 
many but nonetheless that Lucas is the
right<00:03:29.760> wing<00:03:29.940> any<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.450> last<00:03:30.690> Brazilian<00:03:31.169> in

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349

right wing any is the last Brazilian in
this<00:03:31.829> side<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:33.090> been<00:03:33.239> absolutely

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
this side it's been absolutely

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.750 
this side it's been absolutely
tremendous<00:03:33.810> for<00:03:34.230> PSG<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.829> season<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.549> I

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
really as is actually frightening to

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.120 
really as is actually frightening to
think<00:04:18.720> about<00:04:19.049> some<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.410> players<00:04:19.620> in<00:04:19.949> this

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
think about some of the players in this

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.890 
think about some of the players in this
team<00:04:20.430> just<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.060> depth<00:04:21.329> that<00:04:21.449> they<00:04:21.630> really

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
team just the depth that they really

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.750 
team just the depth that they really
have<00:04:22.079> I<00:04:22.109> mean<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:22.860> Argentina<00:04:23.370> want<00:04:23.580> they're

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
have I mean that Argentina want they're

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.250 
have I mean that Argentina want they're
not<00:04:23.969> taking<00:04:24.330> Tevez<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:24.930> they've<00:04:25.050> taken

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
not taking Tevez and they've taken

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.290 
not taking Tevez and they've taken
franco<00:04:25.710> de<00:04:25.830> santo<00:04:26.159> instead<00:04:26.520> but

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
franco de santo instead but

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.520 
franco de santo instead but
you<00:04:27.389> have<00:04:27.509> to<00:04:27.629> remember<00:04:27.750> they're<00:04:28.080> still<00:04:28.349> going

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
you have to remember they're still going

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.279 
you have to remember they're still going
to<00:04:28.620> have<00:04:28.800> messy<00:04:29.610> Aguero<00:04:30.360> as<00:04:30.659> their<00:04:30.810> main<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.259> I

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
to have messy Aguero as their main to I

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.740 
to have messy Aguero as their main to I
think<00:04:31.740> palacios<00:04:32.430> going<00:04:32.909> there's<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.419> lot<00:04:33.479> of

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
think palacios going there's a lot of

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.749 
think palacios going there's a lot of
talent<00:04:34.319> in<00:04:34.409> that<00:04:34.470> Argentinian<00:04:35.340> frontline

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
talent in that Argentinian frontline

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.309 
talent in that Argentinian frontline
