00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
people have decided to interpret this as

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.340 
people have decided to interpret this as
a<00:00:39.090> hint<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> next<00:00:40.469> device<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.670> three

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
a hint for the next device and the three

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.180 
a hint for the next device and the three
interpretation<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.500> number<00:00:43.829> one

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
interpretation is that number one

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.979 
interpretation is that number one
because<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.969> looks<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.360> drop<00:00:45.719> water

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
because it looks like a drop water

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.340 
because it looks like a drop water
droplet<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.860> next<00:00:47.250> galaxy<00:00:47.789> might<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.719> what

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
droplet the next galaxy might be what

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.189 
droplet the next galaxy might be what
approved<00:00:49.829> now<00:00:50.730> I'm<00:00:51.000> slightly<00:00:51.570> skeptical

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
approved now I'm slightly skeptical

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.889 
approved now I'm slightly skeptical
about<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.280> possibility<00:00:53.579> but<00:00:54.210> sure<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.719> is

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
about this possibility but sure it is

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.970 
about this possibility but sure it is
still<00:00:55.199> possible<00:00:57.050> number<00:00:58.050> two<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.739> this

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
still possible number two is that this

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.970 
still possible number two is that this
brush<00:00:59.460> metal-look<00:01:00.180> might<00:01:01.079> actually<00:01:01.289> hint

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
brush metal-look might actually hint

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.880 
brush metal-look might actually hint
that<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.940> next<00:01:03.270> Galaxy<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:04.140> made<00:01:04.379> out<00:01:04.589> of
