00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.290
 this time I bring this topic that 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.869

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:31.279
 this theme is installed by means of winter 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:35.210
 board and it's called icon that the truth is 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.460
 very interesting this topic I liked a lot 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.980
 because it changes most of the 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.790
 icons 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:47.200

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.470

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.530
 change but it does not change the interface of 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.280
 of the application for example here no no 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.810
 change them leaves us the same interface and 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.369
 to me that's something that I liked because it 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.509
 It looks nice on the outside but 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.160
 inside it leaves it aesthetically and 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.479
 that is not ugly that the truth to me 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.479
