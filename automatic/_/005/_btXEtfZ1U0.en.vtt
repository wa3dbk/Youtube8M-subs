display adapter a vga so it's pretty

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.960 
display adapter a vga so it's pretty
simple<00:01:51.500> also<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.710> glossy<00:01:52.950> screen<00:01:53.369> helps<00:01:53.759> with

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
simple also the glossy screen helps with

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.999 
simple also the glossy screen helps with
the<00:01:54.000> contrast<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.079> blacks<00:01:55.350> look<00:01:55.590> deeper

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the contrast and the blacks look deeper

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.980 
the contrast and the blacks look deeper
and<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.729> helped<00:01:57.180> things<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.810> look

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
and it just helped things just look

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.859 
and it just helped things just look
better<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.649> also<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.700> fast<00:01:59.969> refresh<00:02:00.360> rate<00:02:00.600> so

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
better and also the fast refresh rate so

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.920 
better and also the fast refresh rate so
when<00:02:01.020> you're<00:02:01.110> watching<00:02:01.229> TV<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:02.189> will<00:02:02.399> not<00:02:02.579> like

when you're watching TV it will not like
do<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> blue<00:02:04.170> there<00:02:04.469> won't<00:02:04.530> be<00:02:04.649> any<00:02:04.829> ghosting

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
do a blue there won't be any ghosting

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.670 
do a blue there won't be any ghosting
effect<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.869> somewhat<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.530> higher

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
effect and it's somewhat of a higher

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.070 
effect and it's somewhat of a higher
resolution<00:02:07.950> not<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.209> greatest<00:02:09.479> resolution

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
resolution not the greatest resolution

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.690 
resolution not the greatest resolution

just<00:02:34.019> wobbles<00:02:34.620> all<00:02:34.829> around<00:02:35.129> so<00:02:35.340> personally<00:02:35.790> I

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
just wobbles all around so personally I

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.520 
just wobbles all around so personally I
normally<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:37.019> detach<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.190> stand<00:02:38.459> like<00:02:38.640> this

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
normally just detach the stand like this

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.890 
normally just detach the stand like this
and<00:02:40.530> use<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.709> like<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.159> because<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.150> way<00:02:42.360> it

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
and use it like this because this way it

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.660 
and use it like this because this way it
doesn't<00:02:42.959> like<00:02:43.379> wobble<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> lot<00:02:44.459> better

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
is that the detachable leg personally I

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.550 
is that the detachable leg personally I
would<00:02:51.359> have<00:02:51.450> liked<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.810> if<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.019> can<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.260> fold

would have liked it if you can like fold
it<00:02:52.680> down<00:02:52.829> because<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:54.450> take<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.780> off<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.829> have

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
it down because to take it off you have

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.710 
it down because to take it off you have
to<00:02:56.069> just<00:02:56.370> unscrew<00:02:56.879> it<00:02:56.909> and<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.299> might<00:02:57.480> lose<00:02:57.690> it

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
to just unscrew it and you might lose it

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.990 
to just unscrew it and you might lose it
in<00:02:58.079> case<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.500> ever<00:02:58.590> want<00:02:58.859> to<00:02:58.920> use<00:02:59.040> again<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.940> I

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
in case you ever want to use again so I

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.080 
in case you ever want to use again so I
wish<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.659> had<00:03:01.260> integrated<00:03:01.560> into<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.220> monitor

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
wish a had integrated into the monitor

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.990 
wish a had integrated into the monitor
itself<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:06.239> again<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.930> glossy<00:03:07.140> monitor<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.920> a

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
itself and again the glossy monitor is a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.479 
itself and again the glossy monitor is a
fingerprint<00:03:09.000> magnet<00:03:09.299> because<00:03:10.250> this<00:03:11.250> just

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
fingerprint magnet because this just

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.000 
fingerprint magnet because this just
gives<00:03:11.760> okay<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.659> the<00:03:12.870> power<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.859> power

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
gives okay and the power the power

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.129 
gives okay and the power the power
switch<00:03:14.510> personally<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.629> would<00:03:15.750> have<00:03:15.840> liked<00:03:16.019> if

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
switch personally I would have liked if

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.599 
switch personally I would have liked if
they<00:03:16.290> built<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.680> into<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:17.040> monitor<00:03:17.250> because

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
they built it into the monitor because

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.710 
they built it into the monitor because
then<00:03:18.209> if<00:03:18.419> you<00:03:18.540> lose<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.930> power<00:03:19.160> power<00:03:20.160> cable

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
then if you lose the power power cable

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.599 
then if you lose the power power cable
we<00:03:21.720> might<00:03:21.930> just<00:03:21.959> be<00:03:22.349> able<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.560> use<00:03:22.650> another<00:03:22.980> USB

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
we might just be able to use another USB

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.940 
we might just be able to use another USB
cable<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.090> power<00:03:24.239> but<00:03:25.109> if<00:03:25.319> you<00:03:25.380> lose<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.739> one

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
cable to power but if you lose this one

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.289 
cable to power but if you lose this one
you<00:03:26.190> won't<00:03:26.280> be<00:03:26.459> able<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.700> turn<00:03:26.819> it<00:03:26.970> on<00:03:27.090> without

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
you won't be able to turn it on without

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.900 
you won't be able to turn it on without
the<00:03:27.629> exact<00:03:27.959> table<00:03:28.319> so<00:03:29.160> overall<00:03:29.430> this<00:03:29.639> is<00:03:29.700> my

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
the exact table so overall this is my

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.240 
the exact table so overall this is my
general<00:03:30.150> view<00:03:30.629> on<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:31.049> product<00:03:31.379> and<00:03:31.799> the

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
general view on this product and the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.150 
general view on this product and the
major<00:03:32.720> killer<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:34.019> this<00:03:34.169> product<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.829> this

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
major killer of this product is this

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.119 
major killer of this product is this
price<00:03:35.459> tag<00:03:35.700> which<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.120> 130<00:03:36.930> dollars<00:03:37.230> firstly<00:03:38.040> I

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
price tag which is 130 dollars firstly I

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.190 
price tag which is 130 dollars firstly I
think<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.489> is<00:03:38.700> way<00:03:39.150> too<00:03:39.180> much<00:03:39.540> because<00:03:39.780> for

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
think that is way too much because for

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.539 
think that is way too much because for
one<00:03:40.470> hundred<00:03:40.709> thirty<00:03:40.859> dollars<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.519> can

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
one hundred thirty dollars you can

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.849 
one hundred thirty dollars you can
probably<00:03:41.879> get<00:03:42.030> like<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.299> 20<00:03:42.720> inch<00:03:42.810> monitor<00:03:43.199> to

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
probably get like a 20 inch monitor to

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.460 
probably get like a 20 inch monitor to
increase<00:03:44.190> productivity<00:03:44.370> even<00:03:45.000> more<00:03:45.209> so<00:03:46.169> yeah

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
increase productivity even more so yeah
