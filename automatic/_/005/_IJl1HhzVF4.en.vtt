00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 with a record production of grains in the 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.650
 2013 2014 crop Brazil should become 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.599
 the world's leading producer of soybeans and 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.769
 to show how it is done the cultivation of 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.020
 soy in the country 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.390
 we went to the county to smile at 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.130
 mato grosso state that produces more than 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.130
 30% of Brazilian soybeans 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:47.600
 Brazil should register in the harvest of 2013 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:51.740
 2014 production of more than 193 million 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.810
 tons of grain 5.2 percent higher 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.570
 that the previous harvest 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.600
 highlighted in the survey carried out by the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.390
 conab is for soybeans that must have a high 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.510
 of 10 percent in this period, production 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.080
 estimated to be 90 million tonnes of 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.480
 the state of the mato grosso is 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.940
 one of the main responsible for the good 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:19.820
 performance of Brazilian agriculture is 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.130
 mato grosso went along with the policies 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.590
 implemented by the federal government with 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.890
 sure the father is the state that most 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.310
 has advanced on this issue of 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.950
 soybean in the last ten years has 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.140
 has advanced much 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.729
 of some agricultural policies 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.130
 directed towards the center west 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.979
 brazil alone mato grosso produces 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.200
 more than 30% of Brazilian soybean 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.350
 regions of the state known to the environment 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.479
 northern and northeastern regions represent the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.899
 grain producer in the country 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.759
 we have a very rainy regime 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:59.179
 practically regular is and where 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.940
 today we can make practically 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.550
 in 70 and 80 percent of our harvest of 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.600
 Soy able to make a second room or 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.600
 cotton ribisi 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:15.300
 and thus in the middle of the cerrado the soybean occupies 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.490
 today the position of national green gold at 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.950
 420 kilometers from CuiabÃ¡ the municipality of 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.980
 smile has already received the title of 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.570
 national agribusiness capital for being 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.140
 recognized as the largest producer 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.530
 world soybean in the city the grain sack 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.340
 of 60 kilos has reached the price of 61 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.920
 in 2013 in favor of cultivation are the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.900
 climate and soil topography is very 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.270
 It's flatter the rain comes at the right time. 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.000
 It is already programmed since rain is September 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.330
 October is already rain, the already is 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 everything prepared to plant and thus create 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.920
 a mood that is is perfect and was 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.620
 precisely here in a smile that in 1974 the 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.930
 farmer's father roberto bar bought 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.330
 the first land for planting 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.120
 the guess of the family that left the mines 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.050
 the potential of the region has been 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.830
 right 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.830
 since the 1980s, roberto produces 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.590
 soybean and corn on the farm santa candida de 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.720
 The property has increased ten 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.000
 times the original size 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.390
 currently owns more than five 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.660
 thousand hectares of land to be lost 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.600
 view that produce on average more than three 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.840
 tons per hectare is the mainspring and 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.020
 which governs all trade on the scale 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.400
 commercial, including Brazil, and 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.200
 When agriculture goes well, everyone is doing well. 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.270
 to increase productivity roberto 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.430
 in two sheds a fleet of 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.520
 agricultural machines are tractors 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.100
 truck and combine harvesters 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.320
 which modernize the production of the farm 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.020
 part of these machines was purchased with 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.360
 own resources and six others were 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.560
 purchased with program funding 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.740
 federal 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.450
 the interest and the payment term 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.150
 conquered the producer if it is going to increase 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.240
 in hectares you depend too much mark 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.530
 biggest brand 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.500
 to move Brazil to record production 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.110
 agricultural machinery in the last year 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.490
 according to FÃ¡bia from January to November 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.030
 of 2013 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.490
 were sold more than 77 thousand units and 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.040
 the rural credit offered by the government 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.650
 Brazil has boosted trade in these 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.880
 modern machines such as tractors and 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.100
 harvesters 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.040
 which, for example, financed with 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.400
 bnds resources is fully mechanized 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.620
 and by satellites and will be used 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.380
 for the first time in the grain harvest 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.050
 in February this year 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.280
 billion and billions that have been 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.650
 made available to the producer 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.780
 can buy in eight years also with 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.450
 interest rates now at 4 percent 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.550
 bought the new automated machine that 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.160
 I used that machine myself, I left. 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.960
 humidity of its production quantity that 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.870
 You are reaping per hectare make 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.450
 extremely efficient culture as it has 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.910
 besides buying machine as 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.010
 combine harvester 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.990
 also be able to finance and even 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.930
 your truck to pull your production 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.610
 here with agribusiness in franc 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.910
 growth has become synonymous with 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.950
 prosperity to good harvest is excellent 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.840
 for the big producer and even better 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.340
 for the chain of jobs that the 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.950
 activity generates 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.270
 this way the smile stops being 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.580
 county name only 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.730
 The last years also show happiness. 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.220
 in the face of those who live on 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:47.490
 north of Mato Grosso is the case of 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.770
 Santa Catarina nelson 41 eight 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.430
 years as farm manager 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.340
 santa clara and it's not even a dream, nelson thinks 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.790
 change of city or profession 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.610
 Married wife I already have my 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:06.470
 own house in the city has the will to 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.470
 come back just for a walk 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.960
 Tomorrow do not miss the third report 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.910
 on grain production in Brazil 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:42.220
 Let's show the research work. 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.220
 carried out by the Embrapa in the
