00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
welcome to the got wood tutorial this

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.610 
welcome to the got wood tutorial this
isn't<00:00:08.910> how<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.570> get<00:00:09.720> wood<00:00:09.960> on<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.170> first<00:00:10.410> day

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
isn't how to get wood on the first day

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.310 
isn't how to get wood on the first day
tutorial<00:00:11.160> this<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.240> need<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.809> lot<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.170> wood

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
tutorial this is I I need a lot of wood

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.070 
tutorial this is I I need a lot of wood
for<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.710> big<00:00:13.860> project<00:00:14.070> tutorial<00:00:14.750> it's<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.900> lot

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
for a big project tutorial it's a lot

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.500 
for a big project tutorial it's a lot
easier<00:00:16.110> than<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.650> tree<00:00:16.920> farm<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.370> it's<00:00:18.300> pretty

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
easier than a tree farm and it's pretty

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.830 
easier than a tree farm and it's pretty
simple<00:00:19.789> assuming<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.029> are<00:00:21.060> established

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
simple assuming that you are established

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.599 
simple assuming that you are established
you<00:00:22.470> end<00:00:22.619> up<00:00:22.740> with<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.920> lot<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.099> boat<00:00:23.369> meal

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
you end up with a lot of boat meal

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.269 
you end up with a lot of boat meal
nothing<00:00:24.599> to<00:00:24.689> do<00:00:24.869> with<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.039> good

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
nothing to do with it so this is a good

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.109 
nothing to do with it so this is a good
way<00:00:26.429> to<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:27.679> basically<00:00:28.679> you<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.490> grow<00:00:29.699> 20

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
way to do it basically you can grow 20

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.400 
way to do it basically you can grow 20
trees<00:00:30.529> really<00:00:31.529> quick<00:00:32.870> once<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.020> gets<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.260> this

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
trees really quick once it gets to this

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.220 
trees really quick once it gets to this
point<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:35.760> Pistons<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.360> no<00:00:36.480> longer<00:00:36.690> push<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
point the Pistons can no longer push the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.360 
point the Pistons can no longer push the
wood<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.370> cut<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.730> all<00:00:38.879> down<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:40.370> originally

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
wood so you cut it all down I originally

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.450 
wood so you cut it all down I originally
saw<00:00:41.789> etho<00:00:42.180> make<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.989> his<00:00:43.230> LP<00:00:43.410> world<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.370> I

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
saw etho make this in his LP world but I

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.279 
saw etho make this in his LP world but I
don't<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:44.879> he<00:00:45.030> ever<00:00:45.059> made<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> tutorial<00:00:45.780> on

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
don't think he ever made a tutorial on

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.170 
don't think he ever made a tutorial on
it<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.010> all<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.430> make<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.789> quick<00:00:48.059> tutorial

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
it so all this make this quick tutorial

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.729 
it so all this make this quick tutorial
because<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:48.930> quite<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> simple<00:00:49.559> bill<00:00:51.739> you

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
because it's quite a simple bill you

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.520 
because it's quite a simple bill you
will<00:00:52.890> need<00:00:53.070> one<00:00:53.879> redstone<00:00:54.120> torch<00:00:54.660> 2<00:00:55.289> redstone

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
will need one redstone torch 2 redstone

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.299 
will need one redstone torch 2 redstone

that's<00:01:03.269> sort<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> important<00:01:04.080> part<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
that's sort of the important part in a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.510 
that's sort of the important part in a
way<00:01:05.210> anyway<00:01:06.410> where<00:01:07.410> the<00:01:07.530> sapling<00:01:07.980> goes<00:01:08.160> once

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
way anyway where the sapling goes once

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.030 
way anyway where the sapling goes once
it<00:01:08.640> grows<00:01:08.820> into<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.210> tree<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.440> redstone<00:01:10.830> power

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it grows into a tree the redstone power

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.340 
it grows into a tree the redstone power
can<00:01:11.310> travel<00:01:11.550> through<00:01:11.910> the<00:01:12.060> block<00:01:12.270> which<00:01:13.170> will

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
can travel through the block which will

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.910 
can travel through the block which will
trigger<00:01:13.530> I'll<00:01:13.830> trigger<00:01:14.400> all<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> Pistons

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
trigger I'll trigger all the Pistons

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.160 
trigger I'll trigger all the Pistons
it's<00:01:16.920> quite<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> simple<00:01:17.490> setup<00:01:18.920> now<00:01:21.170> currently

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
it's quite a simple setup now currently

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.670 
it's quite a simple setup now currently
redstone<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.190> travel<00:01:23.460> through<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:25.260> corners

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
redstone can travel through the corners

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.610 
redstone can travel through the corners
of<00:01:25.710> glass<00:01:26.160> blocks<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.300> if<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.170> day<00:01:28.380> gets

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
of glass blocks so if that one day gets

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.370 
of glass blocks so if that one day gets
patched<00:01:28.980> or<00:01:29.640> changed<00:01:30.240> you'll<00:01:30.870> just<00:01:31.050> have<00:01:31.230> to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
patched or changed you'll just have to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.490 
patched or changed you'll just have to
redesign<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:32.010> little<00:01:32.310> system<00:01:36.500> redstone

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
redesign this little system redstone

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
power gets to all five Pistons which

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.910 
power gets to all five Pistons which
then<00:01:40.520> push<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.550> tree<00:01:41.910> to<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> side

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.899 

I<00:01:46.680> was<00:01:47.680> saying<00:01:47.860> that<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.130> glass<00:01:48.310> block<00:01:48.700> is

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
I was saying that the glass block is

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.539 
I was saying that the glass block is
important<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.259> glass<00:01:50.890> block<00:01:51.159> is<00:01:51.369> placed

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
important and that glass block is placed

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.530 
important and that glass block is placed
eight<00:01:52.530> seven<00:01:53.530> blocks<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:54.040> air<00:01:54.189> and<00:01:54.430> then<00:01:54.880> one

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
eight seven blocks of air and then one

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.389 
eight seven blocks of air and then one
block<00:01:55.780> of<00:01:55.960> glass<00:01:56.200> this<00:01:56.860> prevents<00:01:57.280> you<00:01:57.369> from

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
block of glass this prevents you from

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.850 
block of glass this prevents you from
getting<00:01:57.549> a<00:01:57.850> ginormous<00:01:58.119> tree<00:01:58.630> which<00:01:59.170> will<00:01:59.409> clog

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
getting a ginormous tree which will clog

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.609 
getting a ginormous tree which will clog
up<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.100> whole<00:02:00.369> system<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:01.030> look<00:02:01.990> ridiculous

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
up the whole system and look ridiculous

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.480 
up the whole system and look ridiculous
i<00:02:04.470> recommend<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.530> builds<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.920> little<00:02:06.159> hole<00:02:06.310> to

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
i recommend you builds a little hole to

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.790 
i recommend you builds a little hole to
stand<00:02:06.759> in<00:02:06.940> while<00:02:07.630> you're<00:02:07.810> planting<00:02:08.709> the

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
stand in while you're planting the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.160 
stand in while you're planting the
saplings<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.910> way<00:02:10.090> you're<00:02:10.330> not<00:02:10.360> buried<00:02:10.929> it

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
saplings that way you're not buried it

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.880 
saplings that way you're not buried it
leaves<00:02:11.580> accidentally<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:17.410> works<00:02:17.680> for

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
leaves accidentally this works for

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.009 
leaves accidentally this works for
regular<00:02:18.250> trees<00:02:18.550> as<00:02:18.760> well<00:02:19.030> as<00:02:19.360> birch<00:02:19.630> trees

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
regular trees as well as birch trees

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.070 
regular trees as well as birch trees
however<00:02:20.980> if<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.489> want<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.450> darker<00:02:22.840> wood

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
however if you want the darker wood

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.420 
however if you want the darker wood
you'll<00:02:23.590> have<00:02:23.799> to<00:02:24.130> raise<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:25.420> glass<00:02:25.870> block

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
you'll have to raise that glass block

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.640 
you'll have to raise that glass block
higher<00:02:27.430> because<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.930> dark<00:02:29.170> wood<00:02:29.380> trees

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
higher because the dark wood trees

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.130 
higher because the dark wood trees
always<00:02:30.069> grow<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.310> bit<00:02:30.549> taller<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.150> as<00:02:31.900> far<00:02:32.080> as

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
always grow a bit taller and as far as

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.289 
always grow a bit taller and as far as
giant<00:02:32.830> jungle<00:02:33.069> trees<00:02:33.370> well<00:02:33.640> this<00:02:33.910> ain't<00:02:34.090> going

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
giant jungle trees well this ain't going

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.729 
giant jungle trees well this ain't going
to<00:02:34.390> work<00:02:34.569> in<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.780> system<00:02:35.250> but<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:38.230> might<00:02:38.709> work

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
to work in that system but it might work

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.950 
to work in that system but it might work
for<00:02:39.069> single<00:02:39.790> jungle<00:02:40.150> trees

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.110 

this<00:02:43.800> is<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:43.980> little<00:02:44.280> project<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.820> built

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
this is a little project that I built

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.630 
this is a little project that I built
using<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.780> lot<00:02:45.960> of<00:02:45.990> wood<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.980> took<00:02:47.190> me<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> few

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
using a lot of wood it took me a few

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.370 
using a lot of wood it took me a few
days<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.880> collect<00:02:48.210> everything<00:02:48.630> but<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.080> think

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
days to collect everything but I think

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:58.780 
days to collect everything but I think
it<00:02:49.470> turned<00:02:49.680> out<00:02:49.770> all<00:02:49.950> right

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:07.089
