00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
obviously but with the way that this is

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.830 
obviously but with the way that this is
done<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.870> forces<00:03:15.410> me<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.530> save<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.920> animals

killed<00:03:37.730> because<00:03:38.510> yeah

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.090 

like<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:22.320> can<00:04:22.470> kind<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.650> explain<00:04:22.919> what

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
like and I can kind of explain what

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.490 
like and I can kind of explain what
happened<00:04:23.370> is<00:04:23.460> they're<00:04:23.750> basically<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:25.380> way

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
happened is they're basically the way

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.219 
happened is they're basically the way
x-ray<00:04:25.889> scope<00:04:26.130> works<00:04:26.419> when<00:04:27.419> you<00:04:27.690> use<00:04:27.870> x-ray

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
x-ray scope works when you use x-ray

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.170 
x-ray scope works when you use x-ray
scope<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.710> writes<00:04:29.070> data<00:04:29.520> into<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.000> game's

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
scope it writes data into the game's

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.400 
scope it writes data into the game's

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
is relative to the cameras position so

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.670 
is relative to the cameras position so
when<00:04:37.500> we<00:04:37.590> get<00:04:37.710> out<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:37.860> bounds<00:04:38.250> I'm<00:04:38.370> dropping

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
when we get out of bounds I'm dropping

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.740 
when we get out of bounds I'm dropping
probably<00:04:40.680> 2030<00:04:41.639> screens<00:04:41.970> total<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.540> the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
probably 2030 screens total and the

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.420 
probably 2030 screens total and the
farther<00:04:42.990> you<00:04:43.139> go<00:04:43.260> down<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.830> more<00:04:43.979> stuff<00:04:44.400> you

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
farther you go down the more stuff you

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.790 
farther you go down the more stuff you
can<00:04:44.729> start<00:04:44.940> to<00:04:45.060> overwrite<00:04:45.419> and<00:04:45.750> in<00:04:46.440> this<00:04:46.560> case

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
can start to overwrite and in this case

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.620 
can start to overwrite and in this case
I<00:04:47.070> go<00:04:47.190> down<00:04:47.310> far<00:04:47.550> enough<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:48.000> I<00:04:48.240> start<00:04:48.510> to

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
I go down far enough and I start to

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.990 
I go down far enough and I start to
overwrite<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.260> event<00:04:49.710> flag<00:04:49.949> for<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.820> game

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
overwrite the event flag for the game

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.670 
overwrite the event flag for the game
being<00:04:51.180> over<00:04:51.510> other<00:04:51.900> brain<00:04:52.110> being<00:04:52.320> dead<00:04:52.500> these

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
being over other brain being dead these

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.430 
being over other brain being dead these
games<00:04:52.919> even<00:04:53.070> started<00:04:53.550> etc<00:04:54.289> so<00:04:55.289> that's

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
games even started etc so that's

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.719 
games even started etc so that's
basically<00:04:55.740> it<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.280> only<00:04:56.400> reason<00:04:56.580> the

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
basically it and the only reason the

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.330 
basically it and the only reason the
colors<00:04:57.050> really<00:04:58.050> bug<00:04:58.650> out<00:04:58.800> there<00:04:59.039> in<00:04:59.130> y'all

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
colors really bug out there in y'all

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.100 
colors really bug out there in y'all
oranges<00:04:59.520> because<00:04:59.910> there's<00:05:00.330> some<00:05:00.539> palette

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
oranges because there's some palette

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.330 
oranges because there's some palette
stuff<00:05:01.320> down<00:05:01.500> there<00:05:01.650> too<00:05:01.830> that<00:05:01.860> gets

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
stuff down there too that gets

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.870 
stuff down there too that gets
overwritten<00:05:03.080> but<00:05:04.080> yeah<00:05:04.199> that's<00:05:04.320> it<00:05:04.530> x-rays<00:05:05.010> my

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
overwritten but yeah that's it x-rays my

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:18.140 
overwritten but yeah that's it x-rays my
broken<00:05:06.240> item<00:05:11.870> was<00:05:12.870> fun<00:05:15.950> yeah<00:05:16.950> that's<00:05:17.250> there's

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
broken item was fun yeah that's there's

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.080 
broken item was fun yeah that's there's
like<00:05:18.300> crash<00:05:18.720> blocks<00:05:19.080> and<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.800> military<00:05:20.370> yeah

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
like crash blocks and the military yeah

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.240 
like crash blocks and the military yeah
there's<00:05:21.750> there's<00:05:22.349> a<00:05:22.500> lot<00:05:22.650> of<00:05:22.740> crash<00:05:22.979> blocks

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
there's there's a lot of crash blocks

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.070 
there's there's a lot of crash blocks
and<00:05:23.460> transition<00:05:23.880> blocks<00:05:24.090> that<00:05:24.270> are<00:05:24.330> really

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
and transition blocks that are really

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.900 
and transition blocks that are really
hard<00:05:25.200> to<00:05:25.380> avoid<00:05:25.560> especially<00:05:26.460> when<00:05:26.550> you<00:05:26.669> can't

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
hard to avoid especially when you can't

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.060 
hard to avoid especially when you can't
actually<00:05:27.150> see<00:05:27.330> sand<00:05:27.810> with<00:05:27.900> sunscreen<00:05:28.169> and<00:05:29.010> I

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
actually see sand with sunscreen and I

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.040 
actually see sand with sunscreen and I
found<00:05:29.280> out<00:05:29.400> today<00:05:29.520> like<00:05:29.910> an<00:05:30.539> hour<00:05:30.690> and<00:05:30.870> a<00:05:30.930> half

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
found out today like an hour and a half

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.230 
found out today like an hour and a half
ago<00:05:31.200> that<00:05:31.320> if<00:05:31.889> you<00:05:32.130> screw<00:05:32.400> it<00:05:32.430> up<00:05:32.550> like<00:05:32.849> five<00:05:33.090> or

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
ago that if you screw it up like five or

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.270 
ago that if you screw it up like five or
six<00:05:33.270> times<00:05:33.450> in<00:05:33.780> a<00:05:33.840> row<00:05:33.990> and<00:05:34.349> crash<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:34.950> game<00:05:35.099> or

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
six times in a row and crash the game or

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.700 
six times in a row and crash the game or
hit<00:05:35.400> bad<00:05:35.550> transitions

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
hit bad transitions

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.020 
hit bad transitions
it<00:05:37.710> puts<00:05:38.010> new<00:05:38.190> blocks<00:05:38.460> in<00:05:38.639> the<00:05:38.729> out-of-bounds

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
it puts new blocks in the out-of-bounds

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.080 
it puts new blocks in the out-of-bounds
area<00:05:39.389> and<00:05:39.930> I<00:05:40.800> don't<00:05:41.280> know<00:05:41.490> what<00:05:41.639> to<00:05:41.760> do<00:05:41.880> with

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
area and I don't know what to do with

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.600 
area and I don't know what to do with
them<00:05:42.270> in<00:05:42.419> there<00:05:42.630> so<00:05:43.050> I<00:05:43.320> have<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:44.099> two<00:05:44.130> extra

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
them in there so I have the two extra

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.650 
them in there so I have the two extra
cars<00:05:44.849> with<00:05:45.030> other<00:05:45.210> saves

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
cars with other saves

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:52.420 
cars with other saves
just<00:05:45.930> in<00:05:46.080> case<00:05:46.229> but<00:05:46.820> I<00:05:47.820> didn't<00:05:48.060> need

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.799 

and<00:05:53.430> it<00:05:53.520> actually<00:05:53.639> like<00:05:53.909> it's<00:05:54.300> not<00:05:54.509> it<00:05:54.599> doesn't

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:54.809 
and it actually like it's not it doesn't

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:56.059 
and it actually like it's not it doesn't
just<00:05:54.930> put<00:05:55.050> it<00:05:55.139> on<00:05:55.199> one<00:05:55.379> file<00:05:55.559> it<00:05:55.710> puts<00:05:55.889> it<00:05:55.979> on

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069 
just put it on one file it puts it on

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.100 
just put it on one file it puts it on
every<00:05:56.369> file<00:05:56.610> in<00:05:56.879> on<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.389> cartridge<00:05:57.779> it's

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
every file in on the cartridge it's

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.180 
every file in on the cartridge it's
really<00:05:58.409> weird<00:05:58.589> I<00:05:59.189> don't<00:05:59.669> understand
