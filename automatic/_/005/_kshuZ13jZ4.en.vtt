00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
builder bearing down on us all how much

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.630 
builder bearing down on us all how much
time<00:01:49.150> we<00:01:49.390> have<00:01:49.420> no<00:01:49.660> one<00:01:50.140> can<00:01:50.350> guess<00:01:50.560> if<00:01:51.190> it<00:01:51.430> is

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
time we have no one can guess if it is

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.690 
time we have no one can guess if it is
rogue<00:01:52.140> precursor<00:01:53.140> technology<00:01:53.320> than<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.370> only

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
rogue precursor technology than the only

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.510 
rogue precursor technology than the only
way<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:54.940> destroy<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.660> is<00:01:55.870> with<00:01:56.230> more<00:01:56.590> precursor

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
way to destroy it is with more precursor

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.790 
way to destroy it is with more precursor
technology<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:58.390> that<00:01:58.420> lies<00:01:59.230> at<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.530> bottom

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
technology and that lies at the bottom

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.460 
technology and that lies at the bottom
of<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.190> catacombs<00:02:00.750> also<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:02.140> large<00:02:02.410> number

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
of the catacombs also the large number

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.710 
of the catacombs also the large number
of<00:02:02.800> eco<00:02:03.160> crystals<00:02:03.580> being<00:02:03.790> moved<00:02:04.000> about<00:02:04.270> can

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
of eco crystals being moved about can

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.470 
of eco crystals being moved about can
mean<00:02:04.870> only<00:02:04.990> one<00:02:05.140> thing<00:02:05.670> someone<00:02:06.670> is<00:02:06.910> trying<00:02:07.330> to

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
mean only one thing someone is trying to

mean only one thing someone is trying to
awaken<00:02:07.840> vast<00:02:08.260> precursor<00:02:08.860> technology<00:02:09.040> I<00:02:09.760> think

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
awaken vast precursor technology I think

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.400 
awaken vast precursor technology I think
