00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
know you can kind of switch it out and

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.420 
know you can kind of switch it out and
have<00:01:03.140> like<00:01:03.440> two<00:01:03.739> different<00:01:03.890> versions

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
have like two different versions

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.760 
have like two different versions
basically<00:01:04.970> because<00:01:05.540> you<00:01:05.660> do<00:01:05.840> have<00:01:05.870> the<00:01:06.470> hair

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
basically because you do have the hair

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.820 
basically because you do have the hair
that<00:01:06.979> it<00:01:07.100> comes<00:01:07.310> with<00:01:07.600> but<00:01:08.600> here's<00:01:08.930> with<00:01:09.800> the

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
that it comes with but here's with the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.670 
that it comes with but here's with the
hat<00:01:10.670> there<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:12.500> there's<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.830> back<00:01:13.040> printing

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
hat there and there's the back printing

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.830 
hat there and there's the back printing
it<00:01:15.680> also<00:01:15.950> has<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.160> second<00:01:16.610> face<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.270> that's

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
it also has a second face and that's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.630 
it also has a second face and that's
what<00:01:18.020> we're<00:01:18.200> going<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:18.440> switch<00:01:18.979> around<00:01:19.130> and

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
what we're going to switch around and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.070 
what we're going to switch around and
put<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.080> hair<00:01:21.080> on<00:01:21.110> for<00:01:22.630> so<00:01:23.630> that's<00:01:23.780> if<00:01:23.960> you

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
put the hair on for so that's if you

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.760 
put the hair on for so that's if you
want<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:24.320> use<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:25.369> hair<00:01:25.640> of<00:01:26.290> course<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:27.500> can

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
want to use the hair of course you can

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.710 
want to use the hair of course you can
you<00:01:28.100> know<00:01:28.190> use<00:01:28.490> it<00:01:28.670> with<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.090> other<00:01:29.210> side<00:01:29.540> if

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
you know use it with the other side if

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.480 
you know use it with the other side if
you<00:01:29.840> want<00:01:30.020> to<00:01:32.770> let's<00:01:33.770> see<00:01:34.040> other<00:01:34.520> face<00:01:34.880> there

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
you want to let's see other face there

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.749 
you want to let's see other face there
that's<00:01:37.490> kind<00:01:37.610> of<00:01:37.790> odd<00:01:38.000> like<00:01:38.300> that<00:01:38.540> though<00:01:39.759> and

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
that's kind of odd like that though and

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.200 
that's kind of odd like that though and
so<00:01:40.910> that<00:01:41.149> is<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.690> Han<00:01:42.229> Solo<00:01:42.590> on<00:01:42.830> Hoth

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
so that is the Han Solo on Hoth

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.810 
so that is the Han Solo on Hoth
minifigure<00:01:44.210> which<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:45.200> me<00:01:45.410> kind<00:01:46.399> of<00:01:46.550> looks

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
minifigure which to me kind of looks

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.200 
minifigure which to me kind of looks
like<00:01:47.890> they<00:01:48.890> just<00:01:49.100> kind<00:01:49.340> of<00:01:49.430> turned<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:49.940> into

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
like they just kind of turned this into

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.790 
like they just kind of turned this into
a<00:01:50.420> promotional<00:01:51.020> figure<00:01:52.840> because<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:54.530> looks

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
a promotional figure because it looks

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.290 
a promotional figure because it looks
like<00:01:54.950> it<00:01:55.100> was<00:01:55.160> kind<00:01:55.399> of<00:01:55.490> left<00:01:55.729> out<00:01:56.000> of<00:01:56.060> the

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
like it was kind of left out of the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.520 
like it was kind of left out of the
Battle<00:01:56.720> of<00:01:56.810> Hoth<00:01:57.050> set<00:01:57.610> but<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:58.850> don't<00:01:59.690> know<00:01:59.750> it

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
Battle of Hoth set but I don't know it

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.779 
Battle of Hoth set but I don't know it
kind<00:02:00.830> of<00:02:00.890> looks<00:02:01.069> like<00:02:01.100> they<00:02:01.310> just<00:02:01.459> had<00:02:01.640> too

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
kind of looks like they just had too

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.300 
kind of looks like they just had too
many<00:02:01.910> many<00:02:02.149> figures<00:02:02.390> in<00:02:02.690> that<00:02:02.869> set<00:02:03.140> so<00:02:04.130> they

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
many many figures in that set so they

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.370 
many many figures in that set so they
just<00:02:04.520> left<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.360> out<00:02:05.569> and<00:02:05.750> put<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:06.050> into<00:02:06.170> a

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
just left this out and put it into a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.980 
just left this out and put it into a
promotional<00:02:06.979> bag<00:02:07.330> which<00:02:08.330> I<00:02:08.479> mean<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:08.810> don't

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
promotional bag which I mean I don't

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.630 
promotional bag which I mean I don't
guess<00:02:09.259> I<00:02:09.380> really<00:02:09.649> mind<00:02:09.890> but<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.220> think<00:02:10.520> they

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
guess I really mind but I think they

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.960 
guess I really mind but I think they
could<00:02:10.819> have<00:02:10.849> found<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:12.500> different<00:02:12.800> figure<00:02:13.250> to

could have found a different figure to

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.750 
could have found a different figure to
make<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.240> promotional<00:02:14.720> figure<00:02:15.130> but<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.400> got<00:02:16.610> it
