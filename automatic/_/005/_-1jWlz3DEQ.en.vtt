00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
enough so you can get the tire on there

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.160 
enough so you can get the tire on there
if<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.790> can't<00:00:12.000> fit<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.360> there<00:00:12.540> for<00:00:12.960> example

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
if it can't fit on there for example

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.589 
if it can't fit on there for example
it's<00:00:14.009> too<00:00:14.160> low<00:00:14.340> then<00:00:14.910> just<00:00:15.120> go<00:00:15.269> ahead<00:00:15.299> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
studs what you want to do is you want to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.060 
studs what you want to do is you want to
tighten<00:01:42.119> them<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.810> order<00:01:43.070> opposites

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
tighten them in this order opposites

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.179 
tighten them in this order opposites
first<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.759> one<00:01:45.030> then<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.869> one<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.439> then

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
first so this one then this one and then

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.460 
first so this one then this one and then
the<00:01:47.340> two<00:01:47.549> ones<00:01:47.759> other<00:01:48.299> than<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.229> one

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
the two ones other than that this one

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.539 
the two ones other than that this one
then<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.820> one<00:01:51.090> two<00:01:51.750> three<00:01:52.560> four<00:01:53.280> now

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
then this one so one two three four now

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.090 
then this one so one two three four now
the<00:01:54.299> reason<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.810> want<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.170> tighten<00:01:55.320> opposite

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
the reason you want to tighten opposite

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.920 
the reason you want to tighten opposite
ones<00:01:56.250> first<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.670> because<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.270> lets<00:01:57.540> your<00:01:57.689> tire

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
ones first is because it lets your tire

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.459 
ones first is because it lets your tire
go<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.469> more<00:01:59.070> evenly<00:01:59.360> now<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.689> for<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.380> know

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
go on more evenly now just for you know

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.770 
go on more evenly now just for you know
extra<00:02:01.799> information<00:02:02.070> whenever<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.479> five

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
extra information whenever you have five

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.050 
extra information whenever you have five
because<00:02:04.259> ciders<00:02:04.560> usually<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:04.979> five<00:02:05.310> or<00:02:05.670> four

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
because ciders usually have five or four

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.050 
because ciders usually have five or four
lug<00:02:06.810> studs<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.560> want<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.890> tire<00:02:08.069> tighten<00:02:08.940> them

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
lug studs you want to tire tighten them

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.620 
lug studs you want to tire tighten them
like<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> star

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
like a star

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.750 
like a star
so<00:02:09.900> one<00:02:10.260> two<00:02:11.070> three<00:02:11.150> four<00:02:12.440> five<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:14.400> that's<00:02:14.550> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so one two three four five so that's the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.220 
so one two three four five so that's the
rule<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.150> let's<00:02:15.330> go<00:02:15.450> ahead<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.690> start<00:02:16.140> with

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
rule so let's go ahead and start with

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.550 
rule so let's go ahead and start with
this<00:02:16.410> one<00:02:16.590> right<00:02:16.620> here<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:19.050> got<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.350> wrong

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
this one right here and I got the wrong

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.670 
this one right here and I got the wrong
size<00:02:19.620> socket<00:02:20.520> awesome<00:02:21.210> all<00:02:21.780> right<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:22.470> one

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
size socket awesome all right this one

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.200 
size socket awesome all right this one
should<00:02:22.860> work<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.070> little<00:02:23.400> bit<00:02:23.520> better<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.000> let's

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
should work a little bit better so let's

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
should work a little bit better so let's
go<00:02:24.390> ahead<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.780> tighten<00:02:25.020> this<00:02:25.110> one<00:02:25.170> first

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:46.340 

there<00:02:34.230> we<00:02:34.350> go<00:02:34.440> have<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.100> opposite<00:02:35.430> one<00:02:45.350> there

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
there we go have the opposite one there

00:02:46.350 --> 00:03:08.950 
there we go have the opposite one there
we<00:02:46.440> go<00:02:46.590> this<00:02:47.160> one<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:58.410> lastly<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.550> one<00:03:07.550> are

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
we go this one and lastly this one are

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.810 
we go this one and lastly this one are
so<00:03:09.960> now<00:03:10.230> all<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.740> our<00:03:10.890> lug<00:03:11.070> nuts<00:03:11.310> are<00:03:11.520> tightened

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
so now all of our lug nuts are tightened

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.940 
so now all of our lug nuts are tightened
now<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.660> see<00:03:13.020> whenever<00:03:13.290> you're<00:03:13.500> changing<00:03:13.860> a

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
now you see whenever you're changing a

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.040 
now you see whenever you're changing a
car<00:03:14.160> or<00:03:14.310> something<00:03:14.520> as<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.330> can<00:03:15.450> see<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.810> have<00:03:16.020> a

car or something as you can see I have a
little<00:03:16.260> bit<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.470> trouble<00:03:16.830> there<00:03:16.860> because

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
little bit of trouble there because

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.340 
little bit of trouble there because
whenever<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.240> would<00:03:18.360> start<00:03:18.660> spinning<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:19.170> or

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
whenever I would start spinning this or

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.770 
whenever I would start spinning this or
trying<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.620> tighten<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.100> my<00:03:20.670> tire<00:03:21.000> would<00:03:21.540> turn

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
trying to tighten it my tire would turn

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.540 
trying to tighten it my tire would turn
with<00:03:22.020> it<00:03:22.050> now<00:03:22.830> things<00:03:23.040> have<00:03:23.100> pretty<00:03:23.370> big

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
with it now things have pretty big

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.730 
with it now things have pretty big
treads<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.030> can<00:03:24.180> just<00:03:24.360> go<00:03:24.480> ahead<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:25.200> hold<00:03:25.560> on

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
treads I can just go ahead and hold on

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.130 
treads I can just go ahead and hold on
to<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.100> get<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.250> good<00:03:26.460> grip<00:03:26.490> but<00:03:27.140> usually

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
to it and get a good grip but usually

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.690 
to it and get a good grip but usually
with<00:03:28.290> cars<00:03:28.590> they<00:03:28.830> don't<00:03:28.950> have<00:03:29.160> as<00:03:29.340> biggest

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
with cars they don't have as biggest

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.940 
with cars they don't have as biggest
transition<00:03:30.390> it's<00:03:30.540> usually<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.990> problem<00:03:31.530> trying

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
transition it's usually a problem trying

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.370 
transition it's usually a problem trying
to<00:03:32.010> tighten<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.370> in<00:03:32.490> your<00:03:32.610> tire<00:03:32.820> spinning<00:03:33.380> so

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
to tighten it in your tire spinning so

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.230 
to tighten it in your tire spinning so
that's<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.890> case<00:03:35.100> just<00:03:35.400> tying<00:03:35.760> them<00:03:35.910> as<00:03:36.030> much

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
that's the case just tying them as much

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.360 
that's the case just tying them as much
as<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.450> can<00:03:36.690> with<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.900> tool<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.500> then<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.130> want

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
as you can with a tool and then you want

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.520 
as you can with a tool and then you want
to<00:03:38.490> lower<00:03:38.730> your<00:03:38.880> jack<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:39.540> once<00:03:40.050> this<00:03:40.200> is<00:03:40.380> on

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
to lower your jack and once this is on

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.080 
to lower your jack and once this is on
the<00:03:40.620> floor<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:41.190> won't<00:03:41.430> spin<00:03:41.670> at<00:03:41.760> all<00:03:41.880> because

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
the floor it won't spin at all because

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.670 
the floor it won't spin at all because
you<00:03:42.360> know<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.570> can't<00:03:42.810> move<00:03:42.930> your<00:03:43.080> entire<00:03:43.350> car

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
you know you can't move your entire car

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.830 
you know you can't move your entire car
so<00:03:44.340> once<00:03:44.610> this<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:44.820> on<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.150> floor<00:03:45.420> after<00:03:45.630> you

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
so once this is on the floor after you

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.870 
so once this is on the floor after you
lower<00:03:46.020> your<00:03:46.230> jack<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.680> want<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.040> tighten<00:03:47.760> them

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
lower your jack you want to tighten them

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.140 
lower your jack you want to tighten them
again<00:03:48.150> in<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.390> same<00:03:48.720> order<00:03:49.140> so<00:03:49.380> now<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.730> our
