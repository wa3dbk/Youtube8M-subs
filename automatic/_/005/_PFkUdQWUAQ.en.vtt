called the south point of pee-pee done
but<00:00:18.330> that's<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.750> large<00:00:19.050> school<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.349> Fusiliers

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
but that's a large school of Fusiliers

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.250 
but that's a large school of Fusiliers
they're<00:00:20.189> just<00:00:20.400> dancing<00:00:20.579> in<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> sunlight<00:00:21.270> and

again I'm just filming more of those
Blue<00:00:34.680> Streak<00:00:34.980> Fusiliers<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.980> there's<00:00:38.160> a

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
Blue Streak Fusiliers and there's a

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
this is a skunk anemone fish well

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.640 
this is a skunk anemone fish well
actually<00:01:28.460> it's<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:28.880> family<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.360> skunk<00:01:29.840> anemone
