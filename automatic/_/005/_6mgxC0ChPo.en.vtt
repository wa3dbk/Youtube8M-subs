00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.110
 on his grave we will use the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.810
 french modeling technique with the 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:30.630
 reverse method so take jal from 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.340
 pink construction be sure to wipe well 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.250
 the brush to avoid the surprises of 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:42.720
 freeze drop the drop and then hold your 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.780
 brush in the method lapel wiped 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.470
 your brush using the end 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.520
 your brush melted on one side 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.520
 then from the other 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.160
 make sure you hold it on 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.380
 brush rather horizontally 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.140
 I held it as flat as possible and 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.030
 pulled towards the cuticles then you 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.759
 can hold your brush at an angle 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.729
 normal and use the brush flat 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:16.680
 to flatten the gel then the side of the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.880
 brush for well drawn light the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.100
 sun do not click in the crisis and 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.909
 rather do sweeping movements 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.909
 with your brush 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.470
 take another drop of gel from 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.430
 construction and the subjects not the 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.720
 brush once the drop deposited on 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:49.909
 the nail you can try your 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:51.979
 brush a little hold your brush a 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.750
 little more vertically in order to be able to 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.950
 integrate the second taste with the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:07.869
 first and to avoid a big line 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:07.869
 at the back now add the white 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.550
 wipe to remove more gel 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.960
 then drop the drop still wiped 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.980
 your brush 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.930
 keep your brush well at 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.160
 horizontally 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.530
 you can turn the finger of your 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:42.319
 client to make sure you can 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:57.980
 keep the brush flat with the 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:59.510
 the brush press a little check 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.810
 that the white is not overflowed on the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.069
 pink if yes you can arrange that with 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.069
 the end of your brush 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:26.870
 take a drop of dew deposited there on 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:28.579
 the stress zone was starting well with 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.949
 the tip of your brush behind the 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:36.530
 drop is stretched there towards the end of 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:39.019
 the nail then take our drops 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.669
 for zone 3 you can turn the 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.409
 your client's finger again 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.409
 to have a better angle 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.310
 let the nails harden a little 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.930
 then you can finch and limay and 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.470
 pass a coat of finishing gel 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.470
 to finish
