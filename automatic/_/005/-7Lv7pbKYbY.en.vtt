00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.670
 Svetlana Chumachenko came to visit us 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.130
 she doesn't just create her own 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.139
 such beauty but also attaches to art 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.880
 everyone hello svetlana 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.529
 you conduct master classes on 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.449
 making articulated dolls 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.519
 tell a lot of people in general come and 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.730
 learn this craft and and how 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.039
 it's popular people don't even come 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.349
 learn so much boredom here do yourself 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.360
 a doll because to learn it means 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:40.379
 continue to work on the doll 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.989
 as this is both difficult and time consuming and very 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.260
 many people they don't have artistic 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.379
 education is therefore easier for them just 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.270
 come to me and under my so to speak 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.370
 looking to make yourself a doll 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.289
 how long does it take to 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.270
 learn this skill there time 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.770
 words here for example if a person is up 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.309
 this never do anything with your own hands 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.410
 the master 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.680
 to me in general, and such people come 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.820
 who in any case did not make dolls 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.070
 I offer for 10-12 lessons this one 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.920
 Lesson 3 hours well, usually more 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.299
 it turns out lessons because all the same 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.570
 it is difficult but you are also hard work 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.090
 You can give advice to beginners but itself 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.369
 points all the same we are worth paying 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.460
 special attention which most often mistakes 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.119
 allow work primarily if you 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.619
 want to make a doll and not just a doll with 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.259
 tattoo or well, it is hinged to read 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:43.140
 search the internet for very much material 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.950
 much to pay attention to 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.740
 anatomy because it 's still a doll 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.500
 it is personal that is practically 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.110
 close to the human body she has 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.670
 should be all that's why you need 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.350
 be sure to read the literature there 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.479
 academic drawing for example on which 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.090
 stage, this realism arises 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.910
 all the same but also you will consider her look 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.009
 really like a person 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.200
 realism arises first in 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.540
 head you close your eyes and you see 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.450
 image of a future doll 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.030
 why does she have a realistic look because 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.310
 that the eyes and the face are not inserted 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.290
 this is probably one of the most important dolls 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.269
 moments tell a truth that some 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.410
 parts can be purchased in specialized 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.110
 stores if any 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.110
 the complexity in the performance of particular details 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.630
 of which the doll is going nowhere 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.299
 they are bought are made by their own 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.110
 hands what is acquired in the doll is 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:49.079
 elastic cord gum for example because 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.269
 what's just a store you can buy 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.389
 it should be bought in a specialized 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.120
 store eyes the same glass 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:03:00.389
 suppose or acrylic authors from and 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.380
 to make hair like some 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:06.359
 materials with a small pattern that is it 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.940
 everything is bought in specialized 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.040
 puppet stores whose stores in 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.750
 Rostov and well, actually dolls with 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.120
 millennial history but still 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.459
 I wonder when they came to us in 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.630
 Russia, where does this fashion come from and 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.720
 at what point exactly 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.240
 hinged doll in this form she 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.830
 came not in fact recently it 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:32.850
 somewhere in the 90s in Japan 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:38.030
 began to make articulated dolls from 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:41.370
 polyurethane in Russia, she probably all 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.320
 2006 and 2008 began to appear exactly 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.300
 the authors 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.910
 Mass production hinge dolls 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.890
 somehow japan in china we don't have exactly 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.870
 factory but the puppeteers are not yet 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.090
 designers of your kind because you need 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.640
 work out completely yes the whole image and 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.650
 clothes and hairstyle and hair color and 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.320
 tell me there are some accessories 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.660
 prototypes or here is the result 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.100
 this is a figment of your imagination 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.040
 only generally when they start 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.690
 be engaged in a doll and very many of mine 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.560
 pupils celebrate it 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.080
 you start paying attention to people 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.870
 completely different you don't watch the poll 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.940
 on the person there why wearing or how 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.000
 he looks good whether you are always bad 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.550
 look what munoz any year 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.860
 what is his hairstyle and what are his 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.800
 accessories ie this is all in my head 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.180
 at the puppeteer is postponed gradually and 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.410
 when you make a doll , these are all 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.890
 small images that are you somewhere 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.980
 see there there they somehow 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.900
 connect all in one pile of wallpaper 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.450
 the simplicity of the doll is gone and you don't even know 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.610
 who will she be and do you think well say 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.410
 who will you be she is silent and only 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.240
 then u tan and says i will 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.910
 for example , but I did not tell the region 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.040
 I want to be such clothes although I went with them 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.950
 parting is not that hard 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.740
 it doesn't always matter where my doll goes 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.280
 because while I'm doing it inside him 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.500
 I live with her here is part of life therefore 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:15.090
 it is important to me that this doll was still 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:19.050
 a man who would love her 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:22.230
 they simply put it's acquired 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.210
 somewhere and apple tree please tell me who 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.610
 more often still order such dolls 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.420
 collectors or really parents 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.130
 I give children to adults 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.040
 collectors, too, well, basically just 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.870
