00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:11.040
 It is a corner of boss green garden hill base body teaching that began 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.870
 Although this corner it's something that I typically answer your questions from everyone 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.640
 I'm going fast 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.039
 Aichi prefecture 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.640
 It is a question from the character list 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.970
 Get out 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.140
 How color affects fish 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.290
 Is Ron what? 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:35.550
 Please tell me including the light and dark reflection contrast 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.270
 It is a common question but 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.270
 This is- 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:49.560
 The back is a question though 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:53.190
 That I mentioned first, I would like you'll technology from the fact 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.780
 Existing food if Ao isobutyl also typified 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.200
 There is no color variation in a fishing bait 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.570
 Cat ladies 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.460
 so 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.420
 Night fishing day 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.950
 In the case of Sakonetsu m 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.950
 What is color? 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.470
 I can not explain the relationship 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.510
 It keeps you say 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.740
 Well do such a thing 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.740
 It's time to water 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:33.430
 Well that everyone in the located on the fish first is that what was the personification 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.480
 It tends to seem like it looks like human beings 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.909
 Also 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.600
 Seen 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.790
 8 It is amazing that human eyes are 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.310
 By I'm a mon it is made well 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:51.150
 For example , I think that everyone has experience, but adding a video camera and a little earlier 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.490
 I got makeup and a large bowl 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.490
 In net 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.990
 It would not escape me the human eye 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.100
 Why This is the brain you have camera shake correction 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.420
 Ne 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.170
 so 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.979
 If there is no brain with only that code 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.650
 That level sewing 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.130
 It is not an underground mall 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.420
 I think what Kotonan be Tteyuu 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.510
 or the is possible because the processing in the Jacob contribution this Pucci of brain 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.510
 so 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.840
 It's I think Fu Tteyuu little Ne Kara' Ja got a question 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.040
 so 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.819
 After all that 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.269
 Kedomo I'm a thing Tteyuu including Well now and Rush 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:43.530
 Maybe I have never been a fish 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:46.950
 It's a fish by which it is a perfume 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:51.750
 I think I'll blur it Kahn Gyro 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:54.220
 I can not distinguish only such images, but I already have 4 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:59.020
 Furthermore 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:02.280
 I wonder if there is something that the strong person knows or there is nothing black 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:07.360
 Jiro is the Tteyuu want also found a link, even for many is 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:10.350
 On the contrary, I think it seems that there is only gray gradation 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.020
 If you say 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.670
 In this regard 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:20.970
 It also says things like Tteyuu Why do not 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.100
 Or Ne 's after all noodles Na or in the eyes of human beings 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:30.140
 The tree line is the heavenly one 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.970
 Well it's a conclusion, so it's bright or dark to say more 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.340
 Even though I 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:40.129
 Such as human is looking 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:44.220
 And Well in cherry Speaking of flowers they are able to handle it its image in mono 9 s 4 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:46.450
 In addition, it is said that it is also taken along 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.460
 Based on the technology 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.010
 It does not so much rely on the woman to see if this 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.700
 That is the conclusion 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.120
 Well in even more researchers are we doing to this specialized research 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:03.790
 Though I do not think that it is peritoneum 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.250
 However , what should we grasp as the side of our angler ? 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.590
 The incorporates kun 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.130
 It is good without thinking sideways 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:16.580
 You should use something that you can fish in 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.580
 The reason is Tennji answer
