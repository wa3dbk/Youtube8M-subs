00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
stuck and when I went to flush it

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.740 
stuck and when I went to flush it
wouldn't<00:02:22.650> go<00:02:23.189> down<00:02:23.269> so<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.360> water<00:02:24.569> wouldn't

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
wouldn't go down so the water wouldn't

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.470 
wouldn't go down so the water wouldn't
kick<00:02:25.019> on<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.590> was<00:02:25.680> supposed<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:26.480> but

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
kick on like it was supposed to but

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
kick on like it was supposed to but
that's<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.750> only<00:02:27.810> problem<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.170> I've<00:02:28.319> had

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
that's the only problem that I've had

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.119 
that's the only problem that I've had
out<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.670> also<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.599> misread<00:02:31.439> the<00:02:31.680> date

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
out of it and also I misread the date

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.319 
out of it and also I misread the date
the<00:02:32.700> manufacturer<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:35.430> last<00:02:35.640> video<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.120> I

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
1971 or something like that but actually

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.140 
1971 or something like that but actually
it's<00:02:43.140> looking<00:02:43.409> at<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.799> was<00:02:43.920> made<00:02:44.129> on<00:02:44.280> July

there<00:02:48.659> is<00:02:48.750> another<00:02:48.989> user<00:02:49.290> here<00:02:49.620> on<00:02:49.889> YouTube

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
there is another user here on YouTube

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.470 
there is another user here on YouTube
the<00:02:52.230> channel<00:02:52.590> ideas<00:02:53.040> who<00:02:53.250> said<00:02:53.519> Tyler<00:02:53.819> I<00:02:54.000> think

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
the channel ideas who said Tyler I think

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.520 
the channel ideas who said Tyler I think
and<00:02:54.780> he<00:02:55.379> has<00:02:55.650> an<00:02:56.069> LG<00:02:56.879> emblem<00:02:57.379> that<00:02:58.379> was

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
and he has an LG emblem that was

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.990 
and he has an LG emblem that was
actually<00:02:59.870> dated<00:03:00.870> July<00:03:01.470> eighteenth<00:03:02.000> 1971

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
actually dated July eighteenth 1971

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.250 
actually dated July eighteenth 1971
which<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:04.079> really<00:03:04.290> kind<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.650> cool<00:03:04.889> i<00:03:04.950> thought

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
which is really kind of cool i thought

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.750 
which is really kind of cool i thought
simply<00:03:07.260> for<00:03:07.439> the<00:03:07.500> fact<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.889> these<00:03:08.549> are

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
simply for the fact that these are

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.699 
simply for the fact that these are
probably<00:03:09.060> made<00:03:09.269> off<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.569> same<00:03:09.810> mold<00:03:10.139> and

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
probably made off the same mold and

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:28.640 
probably made off the same mold and
everything<00:03:14.120> but<00:03:15.120> still<00:03:15.359> flush<00:03:15.659> as<00:03:15.870> well

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.860 

I<00:03:32.190> always<00:03:33.190> thought<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.460> the<00:03:33.940> base<00:03:34.360> design

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
I always thought that the base design

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.110 
I always thought that the base design
was<00:03:35.110> really<00:03:35.380> cool<00:03:35.590> why<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:35.920> liked<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.430> some<00:03:37.030> of

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
was really cool why I liked it some of

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.590 
was really cool why I liked it some of
the<00:03:37.210> newer<00:03:37.390> models<00:03:38.520> was<00:03:39.520> shaped<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:40.150> little

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
the newer models was shaped a little

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.420 
the newer models was shaped a little
different<00:03:41.110> in<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.590> front<00:03:41.860> they<00:03:41.980> kind<00:03:42.190> of<00:03:42.250> they

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
different in the front they kind of they

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.520 
different in the front they kind of they
kind<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.790> narrow<00:03:43.090> towards<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:43.690> front<00:03:43.960> I<00:03:44.200> link

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
kind of narrow towards the front I link

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.010 
kind of narrow towards the front I link
denying<00:03:44.830> around<00:03:45.220> 72<00:03:45.940> 73<00:03:46.510> somewhere<00:03:46.900> along

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
denying around 72 73 somewhere along

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.980 
denying around 72 73 somewhere along
there<00:03:47.230> but<00:03:47.800> from<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.100> early<00:03:48.340> 60s<00:03:48.850> of<00:03:49.750> course

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
there but from the early 60s of course

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.600 
there but from the early 60s of course
also<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.560> other<00:03:50.680> model<00:03:51.100> and<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.250> can't<00:03:51.490> think

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
also the other model and I can't think

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.970 
also the other model and I can't think
of<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.790> name<00:03:51.880> of<00:03:52.090> them<00:03:52.240> right<00:03:52.959> off<00:03:52.990> they<00:03:53.530> were

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
pretty much the same design but anyways
