00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
which I found quite challenging the next

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.310 
which I found quite challenging the next
bit<00:00:53.100> was<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.280> Assessment<00:00:54.000> Center<00:00:54.140> one<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.170> the

bit was the Assessment Center one of the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.670 
bit was the Assessment Center one of the

or<00:02:14.990> know<00:02:15.290> but<00:02:16.220> actually<00:02:16.730> on<00:02:16.940> reflection

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
or know but actually on reflection

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.360 
or know but actually on reflection
because<00:02:17.960> you<00:02:18.170> then<00:02:18.320> go<00:02:18.530> away<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.920> reflect

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370
