00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:09.529
 In this video, we will show you how to use buses and rental cars during your free trip to Guam. 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.529
 Let me introduce 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:27.000
 There is plenty of space to park wherever you travel. 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.880
 I can not speed up and I am used to driving direction 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.899
 It was so much easier than when 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.270
 And another advantage is that you can drive overseas without an international license. 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.270
 It's possible that you have a problem with your country's license . 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.720
 Rental cars are often expensive. 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:50.860
 Rent a day is about 80,000 won. 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.860
 If you contact the tech company in the hotel or nearby, they will pick you up at the hotel 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:01.370
 You should apply at least one day before the most convenient way 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.370
 When I get airtel, I apply to Korea in Korea. 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:11.430
 The method called Bent is the same. 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.430
 You can write down your application and return it at the time of the day you get your turn back. 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.640
 Return is usually solved this release as I guess the hotel parking lot employee discrimination 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.640
 Coming to 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.380
 If you stay for 3 days to 4 days, if you rent a car for about 2 days 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.380
 good 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:38.180
 Because we can not speed up in Guam and the third flour is often on the road 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.180
 There are a lot of times to lead, so we have to drive carefully. 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.560
 Guam rental car does not have navigation 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.410
 But it lights the entire main road 1 road 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.790
 If you get on Route 1, you can come back any time. 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.790
 There are few who are lost. 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:59.909
 When you use a mat cover, you may have time to fill up. 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:05.759
 Most gas stations abroad are self-service stations 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:10.709
 If this self- care is difficult , find Shell Gas Station on Road 1 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:14.220
 The oil value is almost similar, but it is more convenient to do the service. 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.879
 When you select 101 and fill-up, 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.879
 Fill me up 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.920
 It is about 4 hours to 5 hours when you drive by making famous swelling of Guam 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.239
 You can look back on football 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.690
 cci love reporting hill product looking at soldiers 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.050
 Driving a nice road with a view of the beach can be a good trip 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.050
 There is 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.540
 I had many things to do, but the best I remember was from Kwangil . 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:54.489
 Driving in Guam is very similar to ours, but there are 1 other 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:57.640
 When you make a U-turn, you will see a center line on two lines of ascending and descending roads 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.000
 When you make a U-turn while driving, enter it 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.660
 I have to distribute 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.069
 Also in the opposite direction when I entered the house, so u can be 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.260
 Carefully slowly enter the center line of the two lines 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.610
 And when you turn left 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.579
 You can not turn the red left turn display to 2 and the blue left turn display 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:23.230
 I can turn the car around. 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:25.950
 You should understand that the red sign is a preliminary indication. 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.950
 Practical etc. 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:41.140
 I can not even see a red left turn when I turn left. 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.830
 You should see a blue left turn. 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.830
 4 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.540
 And you can use bursts without renting. 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:57.280
 Most of the hotels are located on the Tumon side, 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.849
 There are a few buses, but there are red buses and galleria shuttle buses. 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.849
 You can use 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.340
 The most common red button in the city is a windowless 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:12.110
 It is a bus built for travelers . 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.650
 This bus runs to two places in the north and south centered around Tongwon city. 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.650
 It is divided 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.739
 Charges are bought horses, regardless of the distance 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.739
 I think it is quite expensive even though it is a short distance. 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:32.520
 Guam trip is for two or a family trip you go rather than ride the bus a few times 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.520
 It is much more economical to rent a car. 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:41.690
 And this bus stop also has a Korean update. 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.570
 There will be no inconvenience to use. 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.980
 And the Galleria Duty Free Bus. 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.750
 This is the bus I used the most . 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.110
 North and south 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.020
 2 Enter Onega divided into two courses 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:03.490
 p course south of Tour 4 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.490
 a Course moves two or four sides and the interval between cars is 15 minutes 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.450
 And pick up the travelers in front of each hotel. 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:14.200
 When you come back , you drop in front of the hotel. 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.580
 Air conditioning is cool and the bus is comfortable. 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.780
 Have been 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.780
 This bus is free. 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:28.740
 If you do not rent a car, you should use this bus. 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.770
 In the next video I will introduce the things I traveled sequentially 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.770
 U 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.740
