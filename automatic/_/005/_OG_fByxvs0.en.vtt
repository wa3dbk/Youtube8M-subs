00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.160
 very good all boys and girls today 

00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:04.769
 we want and welcome again my channel 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.629
 today I bring you as usual 

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:10.150
 formerly in my channel bring 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:13.509
 gta 5 information this time finally 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.330
 rockstar has already said that it will be released in the fall 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.670
 the gta 5 for pc and the new generation 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.529
 of consoles a web page called 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.080
 mighty that I'll leave you down at the 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.480
 description and has raised a few possible 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.150
 system requirements that we 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.710
 I would agree to play it, I started reading what 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.379
 they say more or less I'll summarize 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.820
 a little reading because I do not like 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.620
 I am very good saying about the 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.870
 requirements you will see that I finish a lot 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.239
 but good summarizing a little everything says 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.329
 that the most likely thing is that they take it out 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.399
 for microsoft vista xp and 7 but not 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.390
 mention that it is playable in windows 8 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:52.390
 nor are they mentioned in manna, that's true, yes 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.800
 if you do not take it out for windows 8 and mac yo 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.350
 I think it will be a big mistake because now 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.030
 there are many windows 8 and many more and 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.789
 many people who want this game like this 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.340
 that I would rockstar if it were your I would take it 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.640
 for windows 8 at least and well let's go 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.940
 to spend more already to what would be more inside 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.250
 of the computer 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.960
 suppose that the required branch here would be 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.240
 about two gigas I think it's pretty 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.280
 little for this game and that is 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.340
 I would need about four or six girls 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.340
 to obtain optical results 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.400
 32gb of a gigabyte of free in our 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.060
 hard disk and have installed yes or yes the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.740
 direct x 10 or 11 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.560
 more going on more to processor 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:41.960
 we would need a core 2 duo 4600 to 2.4 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:46.860
 gigahertz and there was an athlon 64 x2 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:52.320
 dual-core 5400 more if we are aemead 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.640
 ok and to have the maximum of rows and 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.039
 when I'm afraid to have a maximum 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.340
 result in the game they also tell us 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:05.119
 here that is the best thing would be to have a core 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:11.610
 a core i5 2500 t with 2.3 gigahertz 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:14.340
 for intel and a phenom 2 x 4 975 for md 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.130
 it's worth it as far as graphic cards 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:25.040
 they ask us here for an envy like that post 7 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:27.470
 340 or a hd ati radeon of 33 thousand 800 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.960
 series but to have the best 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.360
 playability that is the graphics to 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.740
 one hundred percent what they put us here 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:41.640
 would be a nvidia geforce gtx 480 or a 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:45.500
 ati radeon hd 6970 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.440
 as you see in the previous 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.600
 system requirements so I see no 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.790
 they are like that of the nasa voucher or not 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.330
 they are computers so very super super 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.510
 powerful I guess because rockstar wants 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.450
 sell since it already got it in 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.670
 ps3 and xbox being one of the most games 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.640
 sold and now wants again 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.780
 triumph in him 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.880
 in the market with the pc so the new 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.319
 generation of consoles so good with 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.300
 these two guys I hope that I have 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.310
 liked that I will bring you more 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.470
 information but I only ask you one thing 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.180
 that you like the video that 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.610
 write if you have not done it yet 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.560
 because not like that, do not miss any video 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.360
 and see you in the next guys yo 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.760
 I'm waiting for this game for a while 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.400
 year so I'm the one who most expect it already 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.700
 you saw that it's a video like that 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.470
 so that it looks more like gta 5 and good 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.330
 because this is this is what I want to be 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.330
 it's my dream finally 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.750
 rockstar has said if we will take them out for 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.340
 pc and new consoles yes finally and good 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.709
 Well this is all guys if you want more 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.690
 information of more games give to ay 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.959
 calvillo subscribe if you are not have 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.530
 more information about uncharted 4 dead 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.480
 island 2 more than gta 5 for pc that good 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.790
 more later because they have not yet 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.070
 pulled out many more but good the big ones 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.100
 the great successes they have announced in 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.470
 e3 well I can bring it here on video 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.000
 so you do not have to read a lot that 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.000
 Sometimes it makes an incredible payment to read 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.549
 but good enough to give the rod 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.079
 and I'm going to say goodbye here the end is over 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.609

 iphone subscribe and you are not and we 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.200
