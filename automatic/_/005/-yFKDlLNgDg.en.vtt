hi right today we're going to continue
with<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.540> panel<00:00:03.870> making<00:00:04.049> process<00:00:04.710> previously

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
with the panel making process previously

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.519 
with the panel making process previously
we<00:00:05.819> talked<00:00:06.060> about<00:00:06.210> annealing<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.080> wheeling

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
we talked about annealing and wheeling

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.040

and<00:00:07.859> shrinking<00:00:08.360> today<00:00:09.360> we're<00:00:09.570> gonna<00:00:09.660> look<00:00:09.870> at

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
and shrinking today we're gonna look at

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.919

all<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> flux<00:01:47.130> we're<00:01:47.670> gonna<00:01:47.790> plan<00:01:48.119> --is--<00:01:48.270> it

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
all the flux we're gonna plan --is-- it

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.359 
all the flux we're gonna plan --is-- it
smooth<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:49.470> we're<00:01:49.590> gonna<00:01:49.710> re<00:01:49.950> wheeling

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
smooth and then we're gonna re wheeling

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.819 
smooth and then we're gonna re wheeling
and<00:01:50.670> hopefully<00:01:51.119> we'll<00:01:51.270> end<00:01:51.570> up<00:01:51.689> with<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:52.680> or

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and hopefully we'll end up with more or

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.069 
and hopefully we'll end up with more or
less<00:01:52.860> an<00:01:53.130> invisible<00:01:53.610> world<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.689> hopefully

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
less an invisible world but hopefully

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.649 
less an invisible world but hopefully
people<00:01:55.229> will<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.649> convinced<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.790> its<00:01:57.000> still

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
people will be convinced of its still

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.590 
people will be convinced of its still
its<00:01:57.810> merits<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> good<00:01:59.899> ok<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:02.600> just

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
its merits and have a good ok so just

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.609 
its merits and have a good ok so just
gonna<00:02:03.930> roughly<00:02:04.229> put<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.590> power

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
gonna roughly put this power

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.350 
gonna roughly put this power
in<00:02:05.860> half<00:02:06.100> it's<00:02:06.340> not<00:02:06.520> all<00:02:06.640> important<00:02:07.180> where

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
in half it's not all important where

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:18.089 
in half it's not all important where
where<00:02:07.659> where<00:02:08.080> that<00:02:08.170> would<00:02:08.349> be<00:02:16.530> probably<00:02:17.530> some

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
where where that would be probably some

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:33.210 
where where that would be probably some

see<00:02:33.430> I've<00:02:34.110> distorted<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.260> panel<00:02:35.590> that's<00:02:35.950> not

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
see I've distorted the panel that's not

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.190 
see I've distorted the panel that's not
a<00:02:36.220> very<00:02:36.400> good<00:02:36.670> fit<00:02:36.940> what<00:02:37.630> we'll<00:02:37.780> do<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.080> we'll

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
a very good fit what we'll do is we'll

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.720 
a very good fit what we'll do is we'll
run<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.620> through<00:02:38.650> on<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.100> wheeler<00:02:39.310> machine

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
run it through on the wheeler machine

00:02:39.730 --> 00:03:15.070 
run it through on the wheeler machine
these<00:02:39.940> two<00:02:40.239> pieces<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.900> smooth<00:02:41.200> them<00:02:41.410> up<00:02:41.530> again

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.950 

okay<00:03:16.080> that's<00:03:16.350> quite<00:03:16.560> good<00:03:20.150> so<00:03:21.150> as<00:03:21.450> they<00:03:21.600> say<00:03:21.840> it

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
okay that's quite good so as they say it

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.170 
okay that's quite good so as they say it
preparation<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.800> all<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.760> what<00:03:23.910> we're<00:03:24.030> going

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
preparation is all so what we're going

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.850

the<00:03:34.770> welding<00:03:35.070> process

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
the welding process

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.970 
the welding process
aluminium<00:03:36.750> wells<00:03:37.200> are<00:03:37.350> about<00:03:37.590> six<00:03:37.890> hundred

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
aluminium wells are about six hundred

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.730 
aluminium wells are about six hundred
and<00:03:38.250> sixty<00:03:38.580> degrees<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.540> oxide<00:03:39.960> layers<00:03:40.260> about

and sixty degrees the oxide layers about

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.760 
and sixty degrees the oxide layers about
eight<00:03:41.010> hundred<00:03:41.280> which<00:03:42.000> means<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.380> oxide

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
eight hundred which means that the oxide

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.740 
eight hundred which means that the oxide
layer<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.250> still<00:03:44.670> intact<00:03:45.090> when<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.570> aluminium

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
layer is still intact when the aluminium

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.410 
layer is still intact when the aluminium
is<00:03:46.170> melted<00:03:46.530> underneath<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:48.000> actually

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
is melted underneath so to actually

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.170 
is melted underneath so to actually
remove<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.260> problem<00:03:49.950> we<00:03:50.430> can<00:03:50.610> file<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.060> and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
remove that problem we can file it and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.750 
remove that problem we can file it and
why<00:03:51.300> rush<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:52.010> so<00:03:53.010> that's<00:03:53.220> what<00:03:53.400> we<00:03:53.520> will<00:03:53.610> now

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
why rush it so that's what we will now

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.110 
why rush it so that's what we will now
do<00:03:53.820> so<00:03:54.800> also<00:03:55.800> there<00:03:56.280> could<00:03:56.400> be<00:03:56.460> undulations

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
do so also there could be undulations

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.980 
do so also there could be undulations
and<00:03:57.680> small<00:03:58.680> bits<00:03:59.040> from<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.150> cooking<00:04:00.510> process

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
and small bits from the cooking process

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:16.880 
and small bits from the cooking process
so<00:04:03.980> need<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.100> adventure<00:04:15.380> ordinarily<00:04:16.380> if<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.739> was

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
so need to adventure ordinarily if I was

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.370 
so need to adventure ordinarily if I was
on<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.790> absolute<00:04:18.060> tunnels<00:04:18.390> on<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.540> car<00:04:18.840> I've

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
on the absolute tunnels on a car I've

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.900 
on the absolute tunnels on a car I've
spend<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.739> little<00:04:19.830> bit<00:04:19.980> more<00:04:20.250> time<00:04:20.489> on<00:04:20.640> it<00:04:20.760> but

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
spend a little bit more time on it but

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.140 
spend a little bit more time on it but
to<00:04:21.440> surface<00:04:22.440> of<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.620> video<00:04:22.890> I'm<00:04:23.669> rushing

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
to surface of the video I'm rushing

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.240 
to surface of the video I'm rushing
through<00:04:24.390> this<00:04:24.600> so<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.350> little<00:04:25.919> bit<00:04:26.100> more

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
through this so it's a little bit more

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.860 
through this so it's a little bit more
interesting<00:04:26.730> to<00:04:26.850> watch<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:29.570> spawn<00:04:30.570> too<00:04:30.720> many

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
interesting to watch I spawn too many

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.450 
interesting to watch I spawn too many
people<00:04:31.140> of<00:04:31.260> these<00:04:31.410> who<00:04:31.620> have<00:04:31.740> attempted<00:04:32.010> oxy

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
people of these who have attempted oxy

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.920 
people of these who have attempted oxy
acetylene<00:04:32.520> welding<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.330> did<00:04:33.510> not<00:04:33.660> follow

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
acetylene welding and did not follow

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:47.220 
acetylene welding and did not follow
these<00:04:34.290> simple<00:04:34.860> rules<00:04:36.740> some<00:04:37.740> tiring<00:04:38.280> edge

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.020 

so<00:04:48.230> that<00:04:48.410> we<00:04:48.530> move<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.740> oxide<00:04:49.190> layer<00:04:49.460> and<00:04:49.640> then

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
so that we move the oxide layer and then

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.750 
so that we move the oxide layer and then
burgers<00:04:50.720> that<00:04:50.750> may<00:04:51.110> be<00:04:51.350> on<00:04:51.650> those<00:04:52.190> on<00:04:52.490> those

burgers that may be on those on those

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.140 
burgers that may be on those on those
two<00:04:52.970> edges<00:04:53.300> but<00:04:53.480> that's<00:04:53.720> not<00:04:53.990> all<00:04:55.030> we're<00:04:56.030> now

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
two edges but that's not all we're now

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.020 
two edges but that's not all we're now
going<00:04:56.390> to<00:04:56.570> use<00:04:56.720> a<00:04:56.990> wire<00:04:57.380> brush<00:04:57.620> now<00:04:57.860> by<00:04:58.700> rights

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
file and I've never had any problem so I

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.220 
file and I've never had any problem so I
don't<00:05:10.340> think<00:05:10.550> that<00:05:10.670> that<00:05:10.970> is<00:05:11.390> such<00:05:11.690> a<00:05:11.720> hard<00:05:12.050> and

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
don't think that that is such a hard and

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.310 
don't think that that is such a hard and
fast<00:05:12.260> rule<00:05:12.590> so<00:05:13.460> in<00:05:13.970> this<00:05:14.060> particular<00:05:14.270> case<00:05:14.570> I'm

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
fast rule so in this particular case I'm

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.110 
fast rule so in this particular case I'm
using<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.710> stainless<00:05:16.010> steel<00:05:16.310> wire<00:05:16.520> brush<00:05:16.850> and

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
using the stainless steel wire brush and

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.090 
using the stainless steel wire brush and
as<00:05:17.450> you<00:05:17.540> can<00:05:17.660> see<00:05:18.940> just<00:05:19.940> wire<00:05:20.270> brushing

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
as you can see just wire brushing

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.710 
as you can see just wire brushing
adjacent<00:05:22.100> to<00:05:22.250> where<00:05:22.370> the<00:05:22.580> edges<00:05:22.910> to<00:05:23.390> where<00:05:23.570> the

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
adjacent to where the edges to where the

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.740 
adjacent to where the edges to where the
weld<00:05:23.930> will<00:05:24.200> be<00:05:24.380> that<00:05:24.920> to<00:05:25.280> removes<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.420> oxide

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
weld will be that to removes the oxide

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.160 
weld will be that to removes the oxide
layers<00:05:27.020> complete<00:05:28.450> the<00:05:29.450> problems<00:05:29.930> with<00:05:30.080> the

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
layers complete the problems with the

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.860 
layers complete the problems with the
oxide<00:05:30.530> layer<00:05:30.560> is<00:05:30.890> now<00:05:31.580> that's<00:05:31.820> explores<00:05:32.450> tool

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
oxide layer is now that's explores tool

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.310 
oxide layer is now that's explores tool
atmosphere<00:05:33.610> ideal<00:05:34.610> for<00:05:34.880> welding<00:05:35.240> its<00:05:35.690> factory

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
atmosphere ideal for welding its factory

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.950 
atmosphere ideal for welding its factory
oxidized<00:05:38.830> subsequently<00:05:40.510> it<00:05:41.510> will<00:05:41.660> become<00:05:41.930> a

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
oxidized subsequently it will become a

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.870 
oxidized subsequently it will become a
problem<00:05:42.140> for<00:05:42.320> leaving<00:05:42.770> so<00:05:43.160> we<00:05:43.280> cannot<00:05:43.610> leave

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
problem for leaving so we cannot leave

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.130 
problem for leaving so we cannot leave
this<00:05:44.180> too<00:05:44.630> long

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
this too long

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.840 
this too long
once<00:05:45.290> I<00:05:45.440> prepared<00:05:45.860> it<00:05:46.070> we<00:05:46.340> must<00:05:46.550> follow<00:05:46.640> the

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
once I prepared it we must follow the

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.910 
once I prepared it we must follow the
process<00:05:47.270> through<00:05:47.510> if<00:05:48.050> you<00:05:48.200> decided<00:05:48.530> to<00:05:48.680> go

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
process through if you decided to go

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.100 
process through if you decided to go
away<00:05:49.040> and<00:05:49.370> have<00:05:49.520> a<00:05:49.550> have<00:05:50.510> a<00:05:50.540> bridge<00:05:50.840> or

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
away and have a have a bridge or

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.750 
away and have a have a bridge or
something<00:05:51.140> like<00:05:51.560> that<00:05:51.620> come<00:05:52.160> back<00:05:52.280> half<00:05:52.610> an

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
something like that come back half an

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.340 
something like that come back half an
hour<00:05:52.850> or<00:05:53.090> an<00:05:53.180> hour<00:05:53.270> later<00:05:53.600> you'd<00:05:53.990> have<00:05:54.170> to

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
hour or an hour later you'd have to

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.500 
hour or an hour later you'd have to
repeat<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:54.800> process<00:05:54.940> so<00:05:55.940> there's<00:05:56.150> a<00:05:56.210> time

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
repeat the process so there's a time

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:17.189 
repeat the process so there's a time
span<00:05:56.900> swimming

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.170 

so<00:06:18.199> let's<00:06:18.439> just<00:06:18.710> have<00:06:18.830> a<00:06:18.889> look<00:06:19.099> now<00:06:19.129> so<00:06:20.029> we've

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
so let's just have a look now so we've

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.959 
so let's just have a look now so we've
got<00:06:20.360> the<00:06:20.449> two<00:06:20.599> pieces<00:06:20.629> in<00:06:21.139> half<00:06:21.610> with<00:06:22.610> filed

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:22.969 
got the two pieces in half with filed

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:25.869 
got the two pieces in half with filed
the<00:06:23.270> edges<00:06:23.629> and<00:06:23.870> with<00:06:24.439> wire<00:06:24.710> brush<00:06:25.039> them<00:06:25.249> they

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:25.879 
the edges and with wire brush them they

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:28.989 
the edges and with wire brush them they
are<00:06:26.029> now<00:06:26.270> ready<00:06:26.300> for<00:06:26.900> the<00:06:27.620> flux<00:06:27.919> and<00:06:28.219> the<00:06:28.789> oxy

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:28.999 
are now ready for the flux and the oxy

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:30.429 
are now ready for the flux and the oxy
acetylene<00:06:29.060> welding<00:06:29.719> which<00:06:29.960> we<00:06:30.110> will<00:06:30.259> talk

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:30.439
