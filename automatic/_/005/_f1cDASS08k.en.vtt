a<00:05:54.479> whole<00:05:55.410> new<00:05:55.440> dimension<00:05:55.890> in<00:05:56.550> ultrasound<00:05:57.410> we

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
a whole new dimension in ultrasound we

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.380 
a whole new dimension in ultrasound we
have<00:05:58.620> found<00:05:58.979> that<00:05:59.280> the<00:05:59.700> ultrasound<00:06:00.180> contrast

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
have found that the ultrasound contrast

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.529 
have found that the ultrasound contrast
performance<00:06:01.380> is<00:06:01.500> excellent<00:06:02.010> and<00:06:02.360> imaging<00:06:03.360> in
