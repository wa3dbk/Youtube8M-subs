00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 It was already college that won a computer. 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.870
 first computer and had few games 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.349
 so kind just a little game besides old people 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.799
 3d games but in this phase read I had 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.780
 little memory is true that it was very new 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.850
 At that time I remember people 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.590
 bought the magazines that came 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.680
 see chance of goal is very good games 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.539
 demonstratives serve the game calls the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.970
 johnsons to know said 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.789
 I did not even have time to remember that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.590
 with the lourinho ranking bad bad 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.980
 if he jumped he would get a key or 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.840
 I took the crystals I remember 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.910
 two then get the keys and could put 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.059
 end to the wave leads to the open green zone in 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.520
 white this guy is the old game of 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.180
 He has a lot of games and games. 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.190
 on the principle about the root the roots 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.520
 of black is inspired by the streets not only 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.440
 Can you be a champion I'm doing here? 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.440
 I'm like near zero 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.490
 We used to talk about games. 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.860
 of the program due to several factors 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.080
 by nostalgia movies that marked the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.180
 time was a revolution in that genre 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.450
 success or failure of the market 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.280
 and vichy the list goes on quite a lot 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.050
 but this is the first time we have brought the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.970
 program the old title where most 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.110
 important is what happened to 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.460
 its creator 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.050
 released in 1988 by ams dose and apple 2 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.050
 We talked about his kiss today. 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.570
 boot because we do not have much to 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.610
 talk about such a simple game if 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.160
 little girl controls 10 environments 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.860
 different looking jewelry items 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.330
 specials like the famous jetpack touch in 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.460
 anything on the screen other than the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.530
 own map or the items to must is 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.380
 certain death and with the control of the game 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.370
 for pc in the 80's are you going 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.410
 die pretty 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.390
 the graphics are very simple until the 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.340
 standards of the time and sound was still 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.080
 of those produced by only the top 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.130
 internal speaker of the 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.720
 computer 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.700
 I know some of you still know that 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.330
 loudspeaker and what speaker is 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.130
 Speaking 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.320
 even with this simplicity all within 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.010
 him a fun game to get through the 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.300
 time 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.220
 so much so that some of its versions 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.560
 were converted to mobile phones 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.330
 before even smartphones now 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.470
 really draws the attention in this game is 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.570
 which in fact it was an exercise 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.150
 created with a series of articles written 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.700
 for a magazine of the time 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.220
 the author not only of the game but also 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.130
 of articles is this young waiter was 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.660
 baptized John Romero for those who do not 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.100
 League is not a Romanian person. 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.860
 responsible for the birth of one of the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.900
 coolest gaming company for pc 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.750
 to id software and its numerous 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.680
 successes are the quim command or are in 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.750
 3d a hero white and better the jack 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.459
 people stop here is good, right now 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.680
 strong competition from the Mario series inside 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.209
 it was not the first game of rosemary 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.910
 that she worked in the industry more than 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.959
 five years to the day of the release of this 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.640
 classic 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.380
 more interesting than the game the 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.120
 character was used in one of the 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.800
 most famous experiments at the beginning of 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.660
 90's on pc 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.760
 at that time the consoles prepared 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.130
 specifically for games such as 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.020
 own ness has more power than 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.910
 pcs mainly in areas where 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.010
 made use of special chips to 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.170
 functions of the game so the genre of 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.060
 platform with fluid relationship of the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.100
 that we see in Mario, it was only possible to be 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.709
 calculated on the computer game not 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.110
 I managed to keep up so much good speed 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.300
 the adventurer David was chosen when 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.000
 the partner of rosemary beyond john 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.860
 carmack was able to create one of the first 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.900
 indigenous peoples of the computer 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.730
 produce platform games 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.130
 this processor can not handle the 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.990
 scene after each step of the doll because 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.370
 not just draw the new objects and 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.960
 repeat on the screen those who had already 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.660
 been calculated 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.670
 after the work finally finishes them 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.830
 used animation already ready for dave 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.630
 to recreate the first phase of super 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.280
 mario bros 3 on pc 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.770
 the small demonstration game of 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.780
 technology was god dave cobb right 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.210
 fried doctor you watch in the background 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.580
 even though it sounds grandfather story 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.530
 from those of seeing the adventures of rosemary and 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.170
 still in the early 1990s 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.930
 were initial cauldrons that ensure 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.940
 success of id software training 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.430
 so it's like this with a bit of history 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.200
 sometimes a completely innocent game 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.920
 sometimes in obese truth of a 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.920
 technological revolution 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.930
 Grandpa as a thing in his enclosure 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.030
 red you sign up can be that 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.370
 I sign up not unless I had 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.810
 had then we go there and charged more 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.270
 depend on you I want to write never 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:56.960
 see no but I'm going to hit all the tones 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:56.960
 15 thousand doses and Jorge was not even there 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:06.470
 completely at ease spend their 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.530
 concentration 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:13.230
 a and so the schematic see write three 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:17.100
 sometimes find a friend write yellow 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.780
 this is the black put the old strike 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.400
 three times that the friend's party rolled over 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.130
 inscribe for them that it is twice and 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.760
 so the staff knows what it was like on the 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:30.000
 right felipe andreoli and maltese short 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.420
 5 hp gets darker by the tv is a 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.420
 sin 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.599
 If you still want to stay, you will not 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.280
 nothing else happens in the video waiting 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:42.729
 that soccer that moved 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.889
 inscribed incredible no longer relaxes everton 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.509
 already wrote a guy will disappear and 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.800
 appear in youtube ads not 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.020
 It has more silly at the end of the video 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.499
 document will not but it will keep mouthing 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:58.710
 from acre am inscribe there in the corner to 

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:58.710
 so up to 3 do not see it
