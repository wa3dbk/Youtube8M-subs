of the game is fairly simple but it's
pretty<00:02:31.950> tricky<00:02:32.190> as<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.610> might<00:02:32.760> imagine<00:02:33.050> each

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
pretty tricky as you might imagine each

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.310 
pretty tricky as you might imagine each
round<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.830> goes<00:02:35.040> by<00:02:35.280> delivers<00:02:35.910> three<00:02:36.750> random

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
round that goes by delivers three random

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.070 
round that goes by delivers three random
tiles<00:02:37.740> onto<00:02:37.980> your<00:02:38.310> play<00:02:38.640> fields<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.270> as

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
tiles onto your play fields and as

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.690 
tiles onto your play fields and as
you've<00:02:40.200> probably<00:02:40.350> noticed<00:02:40.680> your<00:02:41.160> scored<00:02:41.520> for

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
you've probably noticed your scored for

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.550 
you've probably noticed your scored for
the<00:02:41.730> distance<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.840> move<00:02:43.020> each<00:02:43.260> piece

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
the distance that you move each piece

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.950 
the distance that you move each piece
around<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.220> playing<00:02:44.460> field<00:02:44.790> so<00:02:45.720> when<00:02:45.870> you

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
around the playing field so when you

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.260 
around the playing field so when you
start<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.320> game<00:02:46.350> try<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:46.770> move<00:02:46.950> things<00:02:47.370> as<00:02:47.700> far

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
start the game try to move things as far

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.730 
start the game try to move things as far
as<00:02:48.360> possible<00:02:48.600> from<00:02:48.960> one<00:02:49.260> side<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.650> other

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
as possible from one side to the other

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.370 
as possible from one side to the other
then<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.880> starts<00:02:51.210> to<00:02:51.390> get<00:02:51.510> crowded<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.140> your

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
then it starts to get crowded and your

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.860 
then it starts to get crowded and your
options<00:02:52.770> but<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.070> come<00:02:53.280> more<00:02:53.489> limited<00:02:54.090> you

scored<00:02:55.230> 10<00:02:55.500> points<00:02:55.770> for<00:02:56.160> matching<00:02:57.030> 5<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.870> then

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
scored 10 points for matching 5 and then

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.660 
scored 10 points for matching 5 and then
the<00:02:58.290> points<00:02:58.650> go<00:02:58.800> up<00:02:58.830> depending<00:02:59.100> on<00:02:59.489> how<00:02:59.610> many

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
the points go up depending on how many

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.940 
the points go up depending on how many
more<00:03:00.030> pieces<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.540> can<00:03:00.690> match<00:03:00.900> from<00:03:01.170> there<00:03:01.500> all

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
more pieces you can match from there all

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.510 
more pieces you can match from there all
the<00:03:02.430> way<00:03:02.520> up<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.700> 88<00:03:03.090> points<00:03:03.450> for<00:03:03.900> nine<00:03:04.520> not

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
the way up to 88 points for nine not

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.770 
the way up to 88 points for nine not
sure<00:03:05.700> how<00:03:05.850> they<00:03:05.970> came<00:03:06.090> up<00:03:06.150> with<00:03:06.330> these<00:03:06.420> numbers

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
sure how they came up with these numbers

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:15.490 
sure how they came up with these numbers
but<00:03:06.959> i'll<00:03:07.080> take<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.350> 88<00:03:07.680> when<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.890> can<00:03:08.040> get<00:03:08.160> it

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.720 

now<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.620> seems<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:17.010> me<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:17.310> there's<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.550> couple

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
now it seems to me that there's a couple

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.220 
now it seems to me that there's a couple

you can try to keep the play field as
clear<00:03:21.540> as<00:03:21.660> possible<00:03:21.690> by<00:03:22.470> matching<00:03:22.980> 5<00:03:23.310> as<00:03:23.489> many

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.000 
clear as possible by matching 5 as many
times<00:03:24.480> as<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:25.140> or<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.440> can<00:03:25.739> try<00:03:25.890> to

times as you can or you can try to

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.820 
times as you can or you can try to
strategize<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:27.120> line<00:03:27.810> them<00:03:27.959> up<00:03:28.110> into<00:03:28.320> longer

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.120 
strategize and line them up into longer
rows<00:03:29.150> which<00:03:30.150> usually<00:03:30.630> backfires<00:03:31.130> especially
