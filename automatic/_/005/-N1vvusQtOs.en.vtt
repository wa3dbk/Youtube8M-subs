what appear to be four frame L type lens

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.229 
what appear to be four frame L type lens
is<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> same<00:00:56.129> sort<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.430> thing<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.850> used<00:00:57.120> to

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
is the same sort of thing that used to

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.270 
is the same sort of thing that used to
be<00:00:57.360> used<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.750> lighthouses<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:59.100> these

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
be used in lighthouses what these

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.689 
be used in lighthouses what these
actually<00:00:59.730> are<00:00:59.940> are<00:01:00.300> TIR<00:01:01.170> technology<00:01:01.980> or<00:01:02.219> total

actually are are TIR technology or total
internal<00:01:03.210> reflection<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:04.019> there<00:01:04.769> are<00:01:04.920> four

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
internal reflection and there are four

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.149 
internal reflection and there are four
LEDs<00:01:05.880> behind<00:01:06.360> each<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.689> these<00:01:06.840> lenses<00:01:07.200> now<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
LEDs behind each of these lenses now the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.039 
LEDs behind each of these lenses now the
neat<00:01:08.430> thing<00:01:08.670> about<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.750> it's

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
neat thing about this is that it's

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.580 
neat thing about this is that it's
unpolarized<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.460> hook<00:01:11.640> either<00:01:11.850> lead

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
unpolarized so you can hook either lead

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.109 
unpolarized so you can hook either lead
to<00:01:13.590> either<00:01:13.799> side<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.340> power<00:01:14.520> supply<00:01:14.939> in

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
to either side of the power supply in

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.880 
to either side of the power supply in
the<00:01:15.210> aircraft<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.840> there's<00:01:16.020> no<00:01:16.170> possibility

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the aircraft so there's no possibility

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.010 
the aircraft so there's no possibility

GE 4509 now waylynn makes this important

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.810 
GE 4509 now waylynn makes this important
point<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:34.530> you're<00:01:34.710> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.040> sell<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> lamp<00:01:35.640> as

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
a direct replacement it has to go into

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.679 
a direct replacement it has to go into
the<00:01:38.009> same<00:01:38.250> mount<00:01:38.579> therefore<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.240> has<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.570> be

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the same mount therefore it has to be

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.480 
the same mount therefore it has to be
the<00:01:39.810> same<00:01:40.049> size<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:41.070> we're<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.280> talking

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the same size and we're not talking

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.160 
the same size and we're not talking
about<00:01:41.729> diameter<00:01:42.509> we're<00:01:42.689> talking<00:01:43.079> about

about diameter we're talking about

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.830 
about diameter we're talking about
profile<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.579> waylynn<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.119> very<00:01:45.299> carefully

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
profile so waylynn is very carefully

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080 
profile so waylynn is very carefully
kept<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> size<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> heatsink<00:01:47.310> very<00:01:47.729> small

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
kept the size of the heatsink very small

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.289 
kept the size of the heatsink very small

so it's the same size as a 4509 and this

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.060 
so it's the same size as a 4509 and this
is<00:01:51.450> important<00:01:51.960> says<00:01:52.170> wailing<00:01:52.619> because<00:01:52.920> if

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
is important says wailing because if

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.289 
is important says wailing because if
you're<00:01:53.189> going<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.399> compare<00:01:53.729> apples<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.210> apples

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
you're going to compare apples to apples

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.959 
you're going to compare apples to apples
the<00:01:55.170> bulb<00:01:55.409> has<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> same<00:01:56.340> size<00:01:56.670> because

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
the bulb has to be the same size because

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.270 
the bulb has to be the same size because
you<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.450> make<00:01:57.600> an<00:01:57.750> LED<00:01:57.990> much<00:01:58.439> brighter<00:01:58.829> if

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
you can make an LED much brighter if

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.550 
you can make an LED much brighter if
you're<00:01:59.850> willing<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.270> drive<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.780> LEDs<00:02:01.290> much

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.190 
you're willing to drive the LEDs much
harder<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:02.969> requires<00:02:03.509> removing<00:02:04.110> the

look at how the LEDs compare for each of
the<00:03:52.530> bulbs<00:03:52.740> we<00:03:52.950> tested<00:03:53.460> we<00:03:53.610> used<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:53.940> lux<00:03:54.180> meter

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
the bulbs we tested we used a lux meter

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.210 
the bulbs we tested we used a lux meter
to<00:03:54.690> compare<00:03:55.020> relative<00:03:55.470> brightness<00:03:55.620> at<00:03:56.100> each

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220
