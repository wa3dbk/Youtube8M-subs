00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.639 

one<00:00:03.150> of<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.330> more<00:00:03.510> important<00:00:03.960> concepts<00:00:04.440> to

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:04.649 
one of the more important concepts to

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:06.590 
one of the more important concepts to
understand<00:00:05.220> when<00:00:05.490> working<00:00:05.730> with<00:00:06.029> Maya<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.540> the

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
understand when working with Maya is the

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.930 
understand when working with Maya is the
concept<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.470> edge<00:00:07.710> loops<00:00:08.069> now<00:00:08.520> these<00:00:08.700> are<00:00:08.910> just

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
concept of edge loops now these are just

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.330 
concept of edge loops now these are just
groups<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.540> edges<00:00:10.020> that<00:00:10.230> form<00:00:10.769> concentric

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
groups of edges that form concentric

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.220 
groups of edges that form concentric
loops<00:00:11.610> around<00:00:12.059> your<00:00:12.269> model<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.719> it's<00:00:13.019> really

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
loops around your model and it's really

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.740 
loops around your model and it's really
important<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.830> organize<00:00:14.160> your<00:00:15.120> geometry<00:00:15.420> in

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
important to organize your geometry in

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.480 
important to organize your geometry in
this<00:00:15.870> way<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.139> make<00:00:16.380> your<00:00:16.560> model<00:00:16.890> easy<00:00:17.130> to

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
this way to make your model easy to

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.609 
this way to make your model easy to
manipulate<00:00:17.759> as<00:00:18.330> well<00:00:18.930> as<00:00:19.109> deform

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
manipulate as well as deform

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.170 
manipulate as well as deform
particularly<00:00:20.279> if<00:00:20.369> you're<00:00:20.520> doing<00:00:20.640> character

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
particularly if you're doing character

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.599 
particularly if you're doing character
animation<00:00:21.720> now<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> character<00:00:23.100> here

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
animation now I have a character here

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.519 
animation now I have a character here
and<00:00:23.789> let's<00:00:24.390> take<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.570> look<00:00:24.779> at<00:00:24.900> how<00:00:25.140> his

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
and let's take a look at how his

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.490 
and let's take a look at how his
geometry<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.400> organized<00:00:27.269> if<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.990> notice<00:00:28.320> here

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
geometry is organized if you notice here

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.259 
geometry is organized if you notice here
we've<00:00:28.619> got<00:00:28.800> loops<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.430> edges<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:29.970> fact<00:00:30.150> I'm

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
we've got loops of edges in fact I'm

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.000 
we've got loops of edges in fact I'm
gonna<00:00:30.390> go<00:00:30.480> into<00:00:31.050> edge<00:00:31.199> mode<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.830> I'm<00:00:31.890> going

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
gonna go into edge mode here I'm going

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.100 
gonna go into edge mode here I'm going
to<00:00:32.099> double<00:00:32.460> click<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:33.449> of<00:00:33.480> these<00:00:33.660> edges

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
to double click on one of these edges

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.260 
to double click on one of these edges
here<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.340> we've<00:00:35.489> got<00:00:35.670> loops<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
here you can see we've got loops of

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.690 
here you can see we've got loops of
edges<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.559> surround<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.190> character

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
edges that just surround this character

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.630 
edges that just surround this character
and<00:00:38.940> by<00:00:39.420> selecting<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> edge<00:00:40.770> loops<00:00:41.280> I

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and by selecting just the edge loops I

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.940 
and by selecting just the edge loops I
can<00:00:42.510> actually<00:00:42.719> step<00:00:43.170> through<00:00:43.230> parts<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
can actually step through parts of the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.369 
can actually step through parts of the
character<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.550> by<00:00:44.700> hitting<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.600> left<00:00:46.140> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
character just by hitting the left and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.430 
character just by hitting the left and
right<00:00:46.649> arrow<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:47.910> example<00:00:48.329> if<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.690> go<00:00:49.379> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
right arrow so for example if I go to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.069 
right arrow so for example if I go to
his<00:00:49.860> arm<00:00:50.160> here<00:00:50.610> if<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.149> hit<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> left<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.899> right

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
his arm here if I hit the left and right

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.600 
his arm here if I hit the left and right
arrow<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:52.890> step<00:00:53.129> through<00:00:53.460> this

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
arrow I can just step through this

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.779 
arrow I can just step through this
geometry<00:00:54.079> very<00:00:55.079> very<00:00:55.379> quickly<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.160> get<00:00:56.579> from

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
geometry very very quickly and get from

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.660 
geometry very very quickly and get from
one<00:00:56.969> place<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.300> another<00:00:58.070> now<00:00:59.070> Maya<00:00:59.309> has<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
one place to another now Maya has a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.819 
one place to another now Maya has a
number<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.570> tools<00:01:00.870> allow<00:01:01.379> us<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.739> manipulate

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
number of tools allow us to manipulate

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.180 
number of tools allow us to manipulate
both<00:01:02.820> edges<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.629> edge<00:01:04.229> loops<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.920> let's<00:01:05.039> take

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
both edges and edge loops and let's take

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.429 
both edges and edge loops and let's take
a<00:01:05.220> look<00:01:05.430> at<00:01:05.550> some<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.850> those<00:01:06.000> I'm<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:07.320> to

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
a look at some of those I'm going to

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.560 
a look at some of those I'm going to
edit<00:01:07.740> mesh<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.729> fact<00:01:08.850> I'm<00:01:09.000> gonna<00:01:09.119> tear<00:01:09.540> off

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
edit mesh and in fact I'm gonna tear off

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.450 
edit mesh and in fact I'm gonna tear off
this<00:01:09.990> menu<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.770> actually<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.220> see

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
this menu so we can actually just see

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.580 
this menu so we can actually just see
everything<00:01:11.990> first<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.140> all<00:01:13.229> let's<00:01:13.409> take<00:01:13.530> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
everything first of all let's take a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.950 
everything first of all let's take a
look<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.189> slide<00:01:14.490> edge<00:01:14.820> tool<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:15.689> let's

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
look at the slide edge tool now let's

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380 
look at the slide edge tool now let's
say<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.860> edge<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.880> character

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
say I have this edge of the character

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
say I have this edge of the character
selected<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.380> wanted<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.860> could<00:01:20.189> just

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
selected if I wanted to I could just

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.910 
selected if I wanted to I could just
move<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.270> edge<00:01:21.450> example<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.680> this

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
move the edge example if I have this

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.960 
move the edge example if I have this
edge<00:01:23.189> here

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
edge here

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.630 
edge here
this<00:01:24.240> really<00:01:24.509> isn't<00:01:24.810> white<00:01:25.460> perpendicular<00:01:26.460> so

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
this really isn't white perpendicular so

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.039 
this really isn't white perpendicular so
if<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.820> start<00:01:27.060> moving<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.479> edge<00:01:27.630> you're<00:01:27.960> gonna

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
if I start moving the edge you're gonna

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.440 
if I start moving the edge you're gonna
see<00:01:28.290> I'm<00:01:28.380> gonna<00:01:28.470> start<00:01:28.770> reshaping<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
see I'm gonna start reshaping the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.289 
see I'm gonna start reshaping the
character<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.650> we<00:01:31.890> use<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.220> slide<00:01:32.549> edge<00:01:32.880> tool

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
character if we use the slide edge tool

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.359 
character if we use the slide edge tool
this<00:01:33.810> allow<00:01:34.110> us<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.290> actually<00:01:34.770> move<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.070> edge

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
this allow us to actually move the edge

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.910 
this allow us to actually move the edge
along<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> surface<00:01:36.540> without<00:01:37.350> too<00:01:37.740> much

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
along the surface without too much

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.800 
along the surface without too much
deformation<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.850> I'm<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.119> select<00:01:39.299> this

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
deformation so I'm going to select this

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.660 
deformation so I'm going to select this
now<00:01:40.350> notice<00:01:40.680> how<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.950> gives<00:01:41.070> me<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> little<00:01:41.460> hint

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
now notice how it gives me a little hint

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.280 
now notice how it gives me a little hint
it<00:01:41.850> says<00:01:42.000> drag<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.659> middle<00:01:43.079> mouse

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
it says drag with the middle mouse

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.620 
it says drag with the middle mouse
button<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.920> slide<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.820> all<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.390> is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
button to slide so all I have to do is

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.039 
button to slide so all I have to do is
middle<00:01:46.110> mouse<00:01:46.320> over<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.299> move

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
middle mouse over this and I can move

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.440 
middle mouse over this and I can move
this<00:01:49.320> edge<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.920> it'll<00:01:50.220> pretty<00:01:50.610> much<00:01:50.700> maintain

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
this edge and it'll pretty much maintain

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.539 
this edge and it'll pretty much maintain
the<00:01:51.630> shape<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.829> character<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.369> if<00:01:53.460> I'd

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the shape of the character so if I'd

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.370 
the shape of the character so if I'd
select<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.060> edge<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:54.899> hit<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
select this edge and then just hit the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.960 
select this edge and then just hit the
right<00:01:55.530> arrow<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:56.159> select<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.549> whole<00:01:56.700> edge

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
right arrow to select the whole edge

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.690 
right arrow to select the whole edge
loop<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.689> go<00:01:57.869> again<00:01:58.229> slide<00:01:58.890> edge<00:01:59.159> with<00:01:59.490> my

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
loop I can go again slide edge with my

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.660 
loop I can go again slide edge with my
middle<00:02:00.119> mouse<00:02:00.509> button<00:02:00.590> I'm<00:02:01.590> using<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.219> four

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
middle mouse button I'm using this four

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.179 
middle mouse button I'm using this four
edge<00:02:03.060> loops<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.020> also<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.890> use<00:02:05.040> it

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
edge loops but you also can just use it

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.819 
edge loops but you also can just use it
for<00:02:05.299> individual<00:02:06.299> edges<00:02:06.780> as<00:02:06.990> well<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.680> can

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
for individual edges as well so I can

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.729 
for individual edges as well so I can
just<00:02:08.009> slide<00:02:08.670> an<00:02:08.940> individual<00:02:09.570> edge<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.140> again

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
just slide an individual edge and again

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.260 
just slide an individual edge and again
it's<00:02:10.920> going<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.129> try<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.550> stick<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.000> that

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
it's going to try and stick to that

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.020 
it's going to try and stick to that
surface<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.140> great<00:02:13.379> way<00:02:13.620> to

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
surface so this is a great way to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
surface so this is a great way to
reorganize<00:02:15.030> geometry

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
reorganize geometry

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.280 
reorganize geometry
without<00:02:16.500> actually<00:02:17.450> reshaping<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.780> now

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
without actually reshaping it now

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.290 
without actually reshaping it now
there's<00:02:19.500> some<00:02:19.650> other<00:02:19.800> nice<00:02:20.430> little<00:02:20.850> tools

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
there's some other nice little tools

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.150 
there's some other nice little tools
that<00:02:21.690> my<00:02:21.930> house<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.470> what<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.680> called<00:02:22.980> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
that my house and what is called the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.490 
that my house and what is called the
spin<00:02:23.550> edge<00:02:23.820> tool<00:02:24.210> know<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.630> actually<00:02:24.780> new<00:02:25.230> in

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
spin edge tool know this actually new in

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.830 
spin edge tool know this actually new in
Maya<00:02:25.710> 2011<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:27.030> fact<00:02:27.210> let's<00:02:27.420> go<00:02:27.480> ahead<00:02:27.750> and

Maya 2011 and in fact let's go ahead and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.780 
Maya 2011 and in fact let's go ahead and
take<00:02:27.990> this<00:02:28.170> character<00:02:28.710> here<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.220> let's<00:02:29.670> go

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
take this character here and let's go

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.220 
take this character here and let's go
ahead<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.030> play<00:02:30.150> with<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.390> spin<00:02:30.690> edge<00:02:30.900> tool

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
ahead and play with the spin edge tool

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.250 
ahead and play with the spin edge tool
and<00:02:31.500> right<00:02:32.340> click<00:02:32.670> over<00:02:33.000> his<00:02:33.180> face<00:02:33.540> here<00:02:34.080> and

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
and right click over his face here and

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.980 
and right click over his face here and
select<00:02:35.100> this<00:02:35.280> edge<00:02:35.550> on<00:02:35.910> his<00:02:36.270> cheek

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
select this edge on his cheek

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.200 
select this edge on his cheek
now<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:37.620> particular<00:02:37.830> tool<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.760> spin<00:02:39.030> edge

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
now this particular tool the spin edge

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.500 
now this particular tool the spin edge
tool<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.720> actually<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.980> tool<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.910> is<00:02:42.150> best

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
tool is actually a tool that is best

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.940 
tool is actually a tool that is best
used<00:02:42.780> with<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.050> keyboard<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.650> all<00:02:43.710> I<00:02:43.800> have<00:02:43.920> to

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
used with the keyboard so all I have to

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.190 
used with the keyboard so all I have to
do<00:02:44.130> is<00:02:44.220> hold<00:02:44.400> down<00:02:44.490> ctrl<00:02:45.120> +<00:02:45.360> alt<00:02:45.600> or<00:02:45.960> I<00:02:45.990> believe

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
do is hold down ctrl + alt or I believe

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.710 
do is hold down ctrl + alt or I believe
that<00:02:46.470> would<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.590> option<00:02:47.100> on<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.490> Mac<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.970> just

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
that would be option on the Mac and just

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.470 
that would be option on the Mac and just
do<00:02:48.990> right<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:50.040> left<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.880> what<00:02:51.000> we<00:02:51.120> can<00:02:51.270> do<00:02:51.390> is

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
do right and left and what we can do is

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.020 
do right and left and what we can do is
we<00:02:51.600> can<00:02:51.720> actually<00:02:51.840> spin<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.620> geometry<00:02:53.030> to

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
we can actually spin this geometry to

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.600 
we can actually spin this geometry to
line<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.870> up<00:02:55.140> better<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.010> for<00:02:56.160> example<00:02:56.520> if

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
line it up better so for example if

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.150 
line it up better so for example if
maybe<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:57.150> edge<00:02:57.510> coming<00:02:58.320> this<00:02:58.500> way<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.920> not

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
maybe this edge coming this way is not

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.980 
maybe this edge coming this way is not
right<00:02:59.700> for<00:02:59.730> what<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.240> want<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.510> do<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.810> can

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
right for what you want to do you can

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.840 
right for what you want to do you can
put<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.350> there<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.710> now<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:01.860> have<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> complete

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
put it there and now I have a complete

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.670 
put it there and now I have a complete
set<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.360> lines<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.840> go<00:03:04.020> from<00:03:04.230> here<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.650> here

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
set of lines that go from here to here

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.700 
set of lines that go from here to here
and<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.040> may<00:03:05.220> actually<00:03:05.370> be<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.730> better<00:03:06.090> way<00:03:06.360> to

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
and this may actually be a better way to

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.320 
and this may actually be a better way to
reorganize<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:08.070> character's<00:03:08.610> cheek<00:03:09.030> for

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
reorganize the character's cheek for

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.450 
reorganize the character's cheek for
example<00:03:09.810> by<00:03:10.380> using<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.890> left<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.310> right

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
example by using the left and right

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.700 
example by using the left and right
arrows<00:03:11.850> along<00:03:12.270> with<00:03:12.420> ctrl<00:03:12.810> +<00:03:12.990> alt<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.470> can

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
arrows along with ctrl + alt I can

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.610 
arrows along with ctrl + alt I can
actually<00:03:13.890> spin<00:03:14.610> those<00:03:14.910> edges<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:16.260> these<00:03:16.440> are

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
actually spin those edges so these are

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.070 
actually spin those edges so these are
some<00:03:16.800> basic<00:03:17.100> tools<00:03:17.280> for<00:03:17.550> manipulating<00:03:18.390> edges

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
some basic tools for manipulating edges

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.160 
some basic tools for manipulating edges
and<00:03:19.290> edge<00:03:19.740> loops<00:03:20.280> within<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:21.060> model<00:03:21.540> now<00:03:21.989> go

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
and edge loops within a model now go

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.080 
and edge loops within a model now go
ahead<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.380> use<00:03:22.709> these<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:23.190> keep<00:03:23.400> edged<00:03:23.700> loops

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
ahead and use these to keep edged loops

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.750 
ahead and use these to keep edged loops
of<00:03:24.330> your<00:03:24.720> model<00:03:25.140> organized<00:03:25.800> so<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.580> makes

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
of your model organized so that it makes
