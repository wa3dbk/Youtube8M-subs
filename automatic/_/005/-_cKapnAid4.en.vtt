00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.319
 good afternoon today I want with you 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.900
 share a new recipe 1 rice cupcakes 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.160
 the basis of the kefir plan today we will try 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:19.170
 in oil means we need a pack 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.070
 butter 4 eggs 200 grams sugar 400 grams 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.710
 flour and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.330
 A pack of baking powder is you usually 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.039
 use the first thing we do it 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.219
 heat up the oil because it is us 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.510
 need then it will be chilled 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:38.180
 my oils are already warm 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.180
 I'll show you your sugar eggs 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.950
 sew a pair of foam and now 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.230
 we will gradually add a little bit 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.860
 flour and then everything is fine whisk 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.860
 whip 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.060
 so we well beat eggs sugar flour and 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.200
 Now I added a pack of baking powder and 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.320
 We will add the same 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.320
 you 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.270
 so the dough is ready but we want 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.510
 add one little nuance 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.950
 i want to make it chocolate so i 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.590
 add here what are 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:54.320
 and plus i have more nuts 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.490
 baby i'm on a coffee grinder from in front of the corners 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.560
 use all of them because I 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.700
 I want to try to make cupcakes with 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.860
 stuffing 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.790
 so we use mate and again 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.790
 okay, we beat it all up 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.680
 so here is the test ready principle you 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.930
 can add raisins and bake here 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:29.320
 a cupcake I want to try to do with 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:31.840
 see here there is chocolate filling 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.890
 I put my sweet tooth cream 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.040
 just a couple of spoons 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.880
 crushed nuts and cherries 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.700
 pitted 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:45.430
 Now we will fill the molds so 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.300
 silicone molds we are one third and 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.300
 fill the dough 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.620
 let's speed up under our i will show 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:07.550
 you as try to each 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.380
 every cupcake got a cherry 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:16.400
 with this principle we try 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.400
 directly center put 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:30.090
 chocolate filling and top again 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:32.340
 fill those there so we put the stuffing 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.700
 now on top literally on the tea 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:40.010
 spoons before we leave the dough that is full 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:45.200
 covered up our chocolate berries 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.200
 the oven is on at 180 degrees and 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.800
 put in the oven 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.770
 Well , I already pulled out of the oven cupcakes 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.220
 They were baked at 180 degrees 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:03.440
 for 20 minutes you can see here 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:07.410
 there is a little bit of places that the filling wanted 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.680
 top it did not work we 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.730
 gently retrieve will go now 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.739
 the following 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:19.830
 those who we still have will bake 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.109
 you can still make it even tastier 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.990
 make mean look when cupcakes 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.090
 cool completely if you have cheese at home 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.419
 Mascarpone or you have the opportunity 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.729
 yourself and cook just a pastry shop 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.360
 syringe lay a curly top 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.530
 a little 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.950
 it will be more tasty well all pleasant 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.950
