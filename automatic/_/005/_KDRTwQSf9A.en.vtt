submitted<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.400> us<00:00:17.490> by<00:00:17.520> Zandra<00:00:18.380> s312<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.400> is

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
submitted to us by Zandra s312 and it is

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.950 
submitted to us by Zandra s312 and it is
built<00:00:20.670> on<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> canvas<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.330> ford<00:00:21.570> island<00:00:21.720> as

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
built on the canvas of ford island as

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.230 
built on the canvas of ford island as
you<00:00:22.080> can<00:00:22.199> see<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.130> another<00:00:23.340> color<00:00:23.699> coded

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
you can see so it is another color coded

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.540 
you can see so it is another color coded
larger<00:00:24.930> scale<00:00:25.260> competitive<00:00:25.949> map<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.310> believe

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
larger scale competitive map I believe

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.400 
larger scale competitive map I believe
you<00:00:26.609> can<00:00:26.730> play<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.000> with<00:00:27.150> mid-sized<00:00:27.720> larger

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
you can play this with mid-sized larger

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.130 
you can play this with mid-sized larger
sized<00:00:28.619> teams<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.119> purely<00:00:30.480> infantry<00:00:31.019> combat

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
sized teams it is purely infantry combat

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.569 
sized teams it is purely infantry combat
so<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.529> will<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:31.740> be<00:00:31.890> seeing<00:00:32.040> any<00:00:32.130> vehicles

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
so you will not be seeing any vehicles

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.220 
so you will not be seeing any vehicles
on<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.910> map<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.630> actually<00:00:33.750> has<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> rather

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
on this map but it actually has a rather

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.229 
on this map but it actually has a rather
nice<00:00:34.530> flow<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.460> not<00:00:35.610> particularly

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
nice flow to it I it's not particularly

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.760 
nice flow to it I it's not particularly
massive<00:00:36.840> honestly<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.290> kind<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.500> bar<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
massive honestly it's kind of bar of a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.069 
massive honestly it's kind of bar of a
medium<00:00:38.219> sized<00:00:38.430> competitive<00:00:38.969> map<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.360> as

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
medium sized competitive map and as

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.000 
medium sized competitive map and as
you're<00:00:40.200> going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> notice<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.770> there<00:00:40.950> are

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
you're going to notice here there are

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.619 
you're going to notice here there are
certain<00:00:41.250> areas<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:41.640> teleporters<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.480> kind

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
certain areas like teleporters that kind

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.990 
certain areas like teleporters that kind
of<00:00:42.690> mix<00:00:43.079> up<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> combat<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.980> way<00:00:44.129> makes<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:44.969> a

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
of mix up the combat in a way makes it a

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.760 
of mix up the combat in a way makes it a
little<00:00:45.120> bit<00:00:45.300> non-traditional<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:46.140> really<00:00:46.620> like

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
little bit non-traditional I really like

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.229 
little bit non-traditional I really like
the<00:00:46.890> aesthetics<00:00:47.309> kind<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.640> some<00:00:47.760> leaves<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the aesthetics kind of some leaves and

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.910 
the aesthetics kind of some leaves and
some<00:00:48.329> trees<00:00:48.780> kind<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.079> poking<00:00:49.350> off<00:00:49.469> over<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
some trees kind of poking off over the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.590 
some trees kind of poking off over the
side<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.399> mixture<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.910> natural<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
side and the mixture of natural and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.380 
side and the mixture of natural and
unnatural<00:00:51.780> terrain<00:00:52.760> overall<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> map<00:00:54.000> flows

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
unnatural terrain overall the map flows

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.610 
unnatural terrain overall the map flows
very<00:00:54.539> well<00:00:54.899> you're<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.199> notice<00:00:55.350> there's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
very well you're going to notice there's

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.290 
very well you're going to notice there's
a<00:00:55.680> lot<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.860> little<00:00:56.070> skill<00:00:56.489> jump<00:00:56.730> areas<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.180> can

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
a lot of little skill jump areas you can

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.569 
a lot of little skill jump areas you can
use<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.160> thankfully<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> map<00:00:59.430> is

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
use and thankfully the map is

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.520 
use and thankfully the map is
color-coded<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.600> use<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:01.170> call

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
color-coded so you can use that as call

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.770 
color-coded so you can use that as call
out<00:01:01.680> points<00:01:02.039> throughout<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.460> area<00:01:02.609> as<00:01:03.600> you're

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
out points throughout the area as you're

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.359 
out points throughout the area as you're
going<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.960> back<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.409> did<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.680> zone<00:01:04.949> here<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
going to back and did this zone here you

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.010 
going to back and did this zone here you
can<00:01:05.489> see<00:01:05.610> we're<00:01:05.760> currently<00:01:06.030> exploring<00:01:06.600> blue

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
can see we're currently exploring blue

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.719 
can see we're currently exploring blue
area<00:01:07.380> there<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.860> one<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> teleporter

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
area there is one of the teleporter

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.390 
area there is one of the teleporter
zones<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:10.080> kind<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.320> merged<00:01:10.590> into<00:01:10.860> yellow

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
zones and it kind of merged into yellow

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.219 
zones and it kind of merged into yellow
over<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.180> side<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.049> blue

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
over here on this side so blue

teleporter<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.610> mentioned<00:01:18.000> earlier

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
teleporter as I mentioned earlier

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.850 
teleporter as I mentioned earlier
alright<00:01:19.170> here's<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.380> little<00:01:19.560> bit<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.740> game

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
and I'm kind of making my transition

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.490 
and I'm kind of making my transition
over<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.030> red<00:01:24.360> area<00:01:24.810> trying<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.170> hunt<00:01:25.320> down

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500

this<00:01:25.680> player<00:01:25.979> here<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:27.180> notice<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.780> map

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
this player here and you notice this map

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.480 
this player here and you notice this map
is<00:01:28.020> also<00:01:28.560> once<00:01:28.770> again<00:01:28.979> very<00:01:29.189> good<00:01:29.340> for

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
is also once again very good for

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.100 
is also once again very good for
traversing<00:01:29.790> certain<00:01:30.329> areas<00:01:30.659> there's<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.960> nice

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
traversing certain areas there's a nice

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.649 
traversing certain areas there's a nice
flow<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:32.520> cleanly<00:01:33.030> forged<00:01:33.479> there's

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
flow to it it's cleanly forged there's

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.420 
flow to it it's cleanly forged there's
no<00:01:33.750> little<00:01:34.049> sloppy<00:01:34.350> areas<00:01:34.950> or<00:01:35.070> anything<00:01:35.400> like
