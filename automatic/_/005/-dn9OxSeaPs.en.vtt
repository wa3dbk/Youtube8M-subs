00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
if we look bit more at the body you can

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.260 
if we look bit more at the body you can
see<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> infamous<00:00:33.480> shark<00:00:34.110> fin<00:00:34.940> tail<00:00:35.940> at<00:00:36.180> the

see the infamous shark fin tail at the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.840 
see the infamous shark fin tail at the
top<00:00:36.450> there<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:37.829> guitars<00:00:38.160> got<00:00:38.370> no<00:00:38.520> straight

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
top there the guitars got no straight

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.049 
top there the guitars got no straight
edges<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.840> all<00:00:40.230> curved<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.610> all<00:00:41.700> round

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
edges it's all curved and it's all round

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.950 
edges it's all curved and it's all round
it's<00:00:42.360> very<00:00:42.719> much<00:00:42.930> aerodynamic<00:00:44.899> resembles<00:00:45.899> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
it's very much aerodynamic resembles a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.130 
it's very much aerodynamic resembles a
little<00:00:46.170> bit<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.379> spaceship<00:00:46.829> maybe<00:00:47.420> as<00:00:49.280> angle

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
little bit of a spaceship maybe as angle

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.110 
little bit of a spaceship maybe as angle
comes<00:00:52.140> down<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.770> hopefully<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.670> that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
comes down you can hopefully see that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.939 
comes down you can hopefully see that
the<00:00:54.360> guitars<00:00:55.079> curved<00:00:55.620> actual<00:00:56.430> bodies<00:00:56.760> curved

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
the guitars curved actual bodies curved

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.410 
the guitars curved actual bodies curved
you<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.100> actually<00:00:59.219> get<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> bit<00:00:59.730> more<00:00:59.850> mass<00:01:00.149> in

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you can actually get a bit more mass in

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.610 
you can actually get a bit more mass in
the<00:01:00.510> middle<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:00.930> where<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.109> pick<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.410> his

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the middle there where to pick up his

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.670 
the middle there where to pick up his
and<00:01:01.920> until<00:01:02.489> round<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.300> sleek<00:01:04.080> off<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.439> sides

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
and until round and sleek off the sides

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.750 
and until round and sleek off the sides
so<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.519> doesn't<00:01:05.880> detract<00:01:05.970> from<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.640> from<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
so it doesn't detract from the from the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.700 
so it doesn't detract from the from the
sound<00:01:09.000> or<00:01:09.240> anything<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
sound or anything like that and it's a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.310 
sound or anything like that and it's a
string<00:01:10.950> through<00:01:11.159> guitar<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.049> that<00:01:13.049> helps

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
string through guitar and that helps

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.980 
string through guitar and that helps
with<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> sustain<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.400> tuning<00:01:14.990> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
with the sustain and the tuning and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
with the sustain and the tuning and
nothing<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.619> again<00:01:17.159> detract<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.700> away<00:01:17.909> from

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
nothing to again detract it away from

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.760 
nothing to again detract it away from
the<00:01:18.570> sound<00:01:19.470> or<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.189> tuning<00:01:21.229> now<00:01:22.229> we'll<00:01:22.409> go<00:01:22.560> on

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the sound or the tuning now we'll go on

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.190

machine<00:01:36.150> heads<00:01:36.390> were<00:01:36.630> defective<00:01:37.290> when<00:01:37.470> I

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
machine heads were defective when I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.289 
machine heads were defective when I
bought<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.460> had<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> find<00:01:38.939> something

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
bought it and I had to find something

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.359 
bought it and I had to find something
that<00:01:39.329> was<00:01:39.570> pretty<00:01:40.110> much<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.380> same<00:01:40.740> shapes<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that was pretty much the same shapes and

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.389 
that was pretty much the same shapes and
it's<00:01:41.490> slightly<00:01:42.060> smaller<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.979> only<00:01:44.100> off

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
it's slightly smaller but just only off

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.969 
it's slightly smaller but just only off
a<00:01:44.430> little<00:01:44.729> bit<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.259> move<00:01:46.409> along<00:01:46.590> down

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
a little bit so as we move along down

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.850 
a little bit so as we move along down
the<00:01:47.009> fretboard<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.759> will<00:01:47.850> noticed<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:49.470> fret

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the fretboard you will noticed the fret

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.219 
the fretboard you will noticed the fret
markers<00:01:50.280> are<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> shape<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.270> crop<00:01:52.049> circles

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
markers are in the shape of crop circles

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.319 
markers are in the shape of crop circles
and<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:56.100> keep<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.820> line<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and it was to keep in line with the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.120 
and it was to keep in line with the
theme<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.899> guitar<00:01:58.229> which<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.710> be<00:01:58.829> sort

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
theme of the guitar which is to be sort

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.760 
theme of the guitar which is to be sort
of<00:01:59.189> alien<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:01.110> keeping<00:02:01.469> with<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
of alien like and to keeping with the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.510 
of alien like and to keeping with the
you<00:02:02.040> follow<00:02:02.250> G<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:03.409> I<00:02:04.409> don't<00:02:05.159> know<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:05.430> their

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
you follow G and I don't know if their

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.240 
you follow G and I don't know if their
base<00:02:05.700> actually<00:02:05.969> off<00:02:06.420> real<00:02:07.409> crop<00:02:07.649> circles<00:02:08.069> but

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
base actually off real crop circles but

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.010 
base actually off real crop circles but
it's<00:02:08.879> not<00:02:08.970> hard<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.270> design<00:02:09.509> your<00:02:09.660> own<00:02:09.720> crop

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
it's not hard to design your own crop
