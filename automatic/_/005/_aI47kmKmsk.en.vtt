00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
as their leg has a little more

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.080 
as their leg has a little more
articulation<00:02:35.990> it's<00:02:36.140> more<00:02:36.350> like<00:02:36.500> I<00:02:36.590> know<00:02:37.090> sort

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
articulation it's more like I know sort

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.200 
articulation it's more like I know sort
of<00:02:38.180> uh<00:02:38.380> it's<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.470> really<00:02:39.650> weird<00:02:39.920> joint<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.550> think

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
of uh it's a really weird joint I think

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.570 
of uh it's a really weird joint I think
it<00:02:41.540> moves<00:02:42.100> what<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.220> hell

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
it moves what the hell

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.570 
it moves what the hell
moves<00:02:44.390> like<00:02:44.540> this<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.680> then<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.220> can<00:02:46.370> turn<00:02:46.520> it

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
moves like this and then you can turn it

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.640 
moves like this and then you can turn it
around

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
around

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.320 
around
