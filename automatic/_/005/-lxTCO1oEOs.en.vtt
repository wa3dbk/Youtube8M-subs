natural hood a little bit easy okay so

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.230 
natural hood a little bit easy okay so
first<00:00:28.890> things<00:00:29.189> first<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.670> think<00:00:29.970> it's

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
first things first I think it's

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.700 
first things first I think it's
important<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.720> know<00:00:30.929> what<00:00:31.289> your<00:00:31.500> hair

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
important to know what your hair

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.400 
important to know what your hair
porosity<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.610> if<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.690> don't<00:00:33.719> know<00:00:34.050> hair

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
porosity is if you don't know hair

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.590 
porosity is if you don't know hair
prosody<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.250> basically<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.030> ability<00:00:36.450> that

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
prosody is basically the ability that

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.780 
prosody is basically the ability that
your<00:00:36.809> hair<00:00:36.989> has<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.649> absorb<00:00:37.860> moisture<00:00:38.280> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
your hair has to absorb moisture and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.549 
your hair has to absorb moisture and
products<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.629> best<00:00:39.809> way<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.020> figure<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.379> out

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
products the best way to figure this out

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.540 
products the best way to figure this out
is<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.100> do<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:42.030> hair<00:00:42.270> porosity<00:00:42.629> test<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> you

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
is to do the hair porosity test so you

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.330 
is to do the hair porosity test so you
can<00:00:45.030> take<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> glass<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.840> water<00:00:46.110> take<00:00:46.920> strands

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
can take a glass of water take strands

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.670 
can take a glass of water take strands
from<00:00:47.730> all<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.210> parts<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.750> your<00:00:48.930> hair<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.410> get

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
from all the parts of your hair so get

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.010 
from all the parts of your hair so get
it<00:00:49.770> from<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> front<00:00:50.280> beside<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.539> back<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
it from the front beside the back in the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.080 
it from the front beside the back in the
middle<00:00:52.320> drop<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.190> water<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.879> then

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
middle drop it in the water and then

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.760 
middle drop it in the water and then
just<00:00:54.329> see<00:00:54.539> how<00:00:54.780> long<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.170> takes<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.590> your<00:00:55.710> hair

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
just see how long it takes for your hair

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.790 
just see how long it takes for your hair
to<00:00:56.309> either<00:00:56.489> float<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.629> top<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> water<00:00:58.289> or

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
to either float on top of the water or

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.830 
to either float on top of the water or
sink<00:00:59.219> down<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> bottom<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.539> will<00:01:00.719> give

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
sink down to the bottom this will give

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.599 
sink down to the bottom this will give
you<00:01:00.930> an<00:01:01.020> idea<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.440> how<00:01:01.649> your<00:01:02.219> hair<00:01:02.489> is

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
you an idea of how your hair is

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.149 
you an idea of how your hair is
absorbing<00:01:03.059> water<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.960> key<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.409> if<00:01:04.739> your<00:01:04.890> hair

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
absorbing water the key is if your hair

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.969 
absorbing water the key is if your hair
is<00:01:05.189> floating<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:05.939> top<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.510> never<00:01:07.020> sinks<00:01:07.560> that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
is floating on top and never sinks that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.160 
is floating on top and never sinks that
means<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.369> low<00:01:08.850> porosity<00:01:09.119> hair<00:01:09.450> like

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
means you have low porosity hair like

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.530 
means you have low porosity hair like
myself<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.920> very<00:01:11.670> difficult<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.299> get

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
myself it's very difficult to get

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.719 
myself it's very difficult to get
moisture<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.260> products<00:01:13.680> into<00:01:14.280> my<00:01:14.430> hair

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
moisture and products into my hair

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.490 
moisture and products into my hair
without<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.900> know<00:01:16.049> some<00:01:16.290> type<00:01:16.470> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
without you know some type of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.310 
without you know some type of
manipulation<00:01:17.159> with<00:01:17.670> heat<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.720> lift<00:01:18.930> up<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
manipulation with heat to lift up the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.770 
manipulation with heat to lift up the
hair's<00:01:19.560> cuticles<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.340> your<00:01:20.970> hair<00:01:21.210> tends<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
hair's cuticles if your hair tends to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.149 
hair's cuticles if your hair tends to
float<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> little<00:01:22.259> bit<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> middle<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
float a little bit in the middle that

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.359 
float a little bit in the middle that
means<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.990> medium<00:01:24.990> ferocity<00:01:25.290> hair<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
means you have medium ferocity hair and

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.130 
means you have medium ferocity hair and
if<00:01:26.580> your<00:01:26.759> hair<00:01:26.939> immediately<00:01:27.240> drops<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
if your hair immediately drops to the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.870 
if your hair immediately drops to the
bottom<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.130> means<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.579> high

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
bottom and that means that you have high

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.359 
bottom and that means that you have high
porosity<00:01:30.150> hair<00:01:30.479> which<00:01:31.320> means<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.799> your<00:01:32.159> hair

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
porosity hair which means that your hair

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
porosity hair which means that your hair
except<00:01:32.759> swatter<00:01:33.060> quickly<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.990> will<00:01:34.079> also

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
except swatter quickly and it will also

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.200 
except swatter quickly and it will also
lose<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.890> quickly<00:01:35.100> does<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.000> make<00:01:36.180> sense

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
lose it quickly does that make sense

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.539 
lose it quickly does that make sense
okay<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.590> now<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.009> know<00:01:38.040> your<00:01:38.340> hair<00:01:38.490> is

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
okay so now that you know your hair is

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.490 
okay so now that you know your hair is
porosity<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.479> go<00:01:39.630> out<00:01:39.869> into<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.259> world

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
porosity you can go out into the world

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.100 
porosity you can go out into the world
and<00:01:40.829> make<00:01:41.400> really<00:01:41.729> good<00:01:42.030> choices<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
and make really good choices and the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.810 
and make really good choices and the
products<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.649> you're<00:01:43.799> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.310> invest<00:01:44.430> in
