some others have but with the multi hard
case<00:02:38.980> plus<00:02:39.310> but<00:02:39.760> with<00:02:39.879> this<00:02:40.000> 1i<00:02:40.180> don't<00:02:40.450> have<00:02:40.569> an

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.170 
case plus but with this 1i don't have an
issue<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:41.620> there<00:02:41.769> weren't<00:02:41.889> really<00:02:42.010> any

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
issue so there weren't really any

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.470 
issue so there weren't really any
instructions<00:02:43.180> it's<00:02:43.329> pretty

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
instructions it's pretty

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.339 
instructions it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:45.340> let's<00:02:45.579> see<00:02:46.349> slight

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
self-explanatory so let's see slight

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.589 
self-explanatory so let's see slight
that<00:02:47.530> in<00:02:47.709> there<00:02:47.859> like<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.219> this<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.209> really

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
that in there like that this is really

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.739 
that in there like that this is really
soft<00:02:50.019> I<00:02:50.939> would<00:02:51.939> imagine<00:02:52.209> it's<00:02:52.540> going<00:02:52.689> to

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:52.749 
soft I would imagine it's going to

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:54.089 
soft I would imagine it's going to
collect<00:02:53.019> some<00:02:53.230> lint<00:02:53.499> but<00:02:53.680> I'm<00:02:53.799> not<00:02:53.950> really

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
collect some lint but I'm not really

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.949 
collect some lint but I'm not really
sure<00:02:56.280> we'll<00:02:57.280> have<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.519> test<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.849> out<00:02:57.969> and<00:02:58.659> now

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
sure we'll have to test that out and now

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.509 
sure we'll have to test that out and now
I'll<00:02:59.049> let<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.319> know<00:02:59.349> when<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.590> written

has<00:03:03.969> coring<00:03:04.449> around<00:03:04.719> the<00:03:04.870> corners<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:06.040> it's<00:03:06.219> a

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
has coring around the corners so it's a

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.649 
has coring around the corners so it's a
little<00:03:06.430> bit<00:03:06.519> you<00:03:06.969> see<00:03:07.120> how<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.269> have<00:03:07.359> like<00:03:07.569> a

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
little bit you see how you have like a

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.349 
little bit you see how you have like a
little<00:03:07.780> bit<00:03:07.930> of<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.109> backbone<00:03:08.590> there<00:03:09.359> and

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
little bit of a backbone there and

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.089 
little bit of a backbone there and
already<00:03:10.689> that<00:03:10.930> looks<00:03:11.109> pretty<00:03:11.349> sweet<00:03:11.500> that

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
already that looks pretty sweet that

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.490 
already that looks pretty sweet that
with<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.400> black<00:03:12.609> showing<00:03:13.060> through<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:13.540> let's

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
with the black showing through so let's

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.170 
with the black showing through so let's
see<00:03:14.709> so<00:03:14.919> this<00:03:15.549> looks<00:03:15.699> like<00:03:15.879> it's<00:03:16.000> going<00:03:16.090> to

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
see so this looks like it's going to

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.479 
see so this looks like it's going to
stretch<00:03:16.689> around<00:03:16.959> there<00:03:17.349> so<00:03:17.620> let's<00:03:17.829> pull<00:03:18.340> it

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
stretch around there so let's pull it

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.449 
stretch around there so let's pull it
over<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.699> bottom<00:03:21.540> there<00:03:22.540> we<00:03:22.689> go<00:03:22.840> so<00:03:23.829> in<00:03:24.129> here

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
over the bottom there we go so in here

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.550 
over the bottom there we go so in here
there<00:03:25.209> are<00:03:25.269> other<00:03:25.359> otterbox<00:03:25.900> defender<00:03:26.049> series

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
there are other otterbox defender series

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.349 
there are other otterbox defender series

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.170 
actually has a little bit of a button
here<00:03:28.599> so<00:03:28.780> let's<00:03:28.930> see<00:03:29.139> I<00:03:29.169> didn't<00:03:29.439> I<00:03:29.560> didn't<00:03:29.799> look

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
problem though it feels like it's right

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.420 
problem though it feels like it's right

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
clean that up a little bit

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.100

there<00:04:30.490> we<00:04:30.610> go<00:04:30.730> so<00:04:31.650> here<00:04:32.650> is<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.340> impact<00:04:33.730> case

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
there we go so here is the impact case

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.480 
there we go so here is the impact case
now<00:04:35.110> like<00:04:35.260> I<00:04:35.380> said<00:04:35.410> this<00:04:35.710> is<00:04:35.770> probably<00:04:36.250> the

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
now like I said this is probably the

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.700 
now like I said this is probably the
softest<00:04:37.210> silicone<00:04:37.720> case<00:04:37.990> I've<00:04:38.200> ever<00:04:38.290> I've

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
softest silicone case I've ever I've

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.150 
softest silicone case I've ever I've
ever<00:04:39.090> felt<00:04:40.090> it's<00:04:40.360> really<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:41.110> very<00:04:41.440> soft

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
ever felt it's really a very soft

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.460 
ever felt it's really a very soft
material<00:04:42.760> it<00:04:43.210> makes<00:04:43.420> me<00:04:43.540> think<00:04:43.780> maybe<00:04:43.840> it

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
material it makes me think maybe it

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.530 
material it makes me think maybe it
won't<00:04:44.590> attract<00:04:44.980> as<00:04:45.130> much<00:04:45.280> lint<00:04:45.640> about<00:04:46.300> these

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
won't attract as much lint about these

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.830 
won't attract as much lint about these
will<00:04:47.130> but<00:04:48.130> it's<00:04:48.250> hard<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.460> say<00:04:48.670> and<00:04:49.600> I'll<00:04:49.690> let

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
will but it's hard to say and I'll let

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.320 
will but it's hard to say and I'll let
you<00:04:49.930> know<00:04:49.960> in<00:04:50.230> the<00:04:50.260> other<00:04:50.470> review<00:04:51.000> you<00:04:52.000> can<00:04:52.150> see

it's<00:06:04.990> stretched<00:06:05.380> a<00:06:05.590> little<00:06:05.620> bit<00:06:05.950> on<00:06:06.130> here<00:06:06.490> look

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
it's stretched a little bit on here look

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.790 
it's stretched a little bit on here look
great<00:06:07.330> in<00:06:07.450> this<00:06:07.540> that<00:06:08.020> says<00:06:08.260> they're<00:06:08.410> courting

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
great in this that says they're courting

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.210 
great in this that says they're courting
now<00:06:09.550> it's<00:06:10.150> not<00:06:10.390> really<00:06:10.810> rigid<00:06:11.230> so<00:06:11.770> i<00:06:12.040> don't

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
now it's not really rigid so i don't

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.380 
now it's not really rigid so i don't
know<00:06:12.280> if<00:06:12.370> it's<00:06:12.490> just<00:06:12.670> an<00:06:12.790> extra<00:06:13.090> layer<00:06:13.240> of

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
know if it's just an extra layer of

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.170 
know if it's just an extra layer of
silicon<00:06:13.900> because<00:06:14.050> you<00:06:14.170> can<00:06:14.350> see<00:06:14.560> it's<00:06:14.770> raised

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
silicon because you can see it's raised

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.510 
silicon because you can see it's raised
not<00:06:16.180> really<00:06:16.450> sure<00:06:16.690> but<00:06:17.230> this<00:06:17.410> certainly<00:06:17.740> this

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
not really sure but this certainly this

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.830 
not really sure but this certainly this
looks<00:06:18.730> sweet<00:06:18.970> i<00:06:19.000> think<00:06:19.360> with<00:06:19.540> the<00:06:19.630> black

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
looks sweet i think with the black

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.530 
looks sweet i think with the black
showing<00:06:20.320> through<00:06:20.790> kind<00:06:21.790> of<00:06:21.880> enhances<00:06:22.360> the

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
showing through kind of enhances the

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.670 
showing through kind of enhances the
look<00:06:22.720> to<00:06:22.900> it<00:06:23.880> pretty<00:06:24.880> simple<00:06:25.270> case<00:06:25.660> you<00:06:26.590> know

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
look to it pretty simple case you know

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.770 
look to it pretty simple case you know
basic<00:06:27.100> protection<00:06:27.640> i<00:06:27.820> lay<00:06:28.480> on<00:06:28.510> the<00:06:28.750> table

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
basic protection i lay on the table

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.270 
basic protection i lay on the table
you're<00:06:29.410> not<00:06:29.560> going<00:06:29.710> to<00:06:29.770> hit<00:06:29.830> your<00:06:29.950> screen

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
because again this is raised you know a

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.490 
because again this is raised you know a
big<00:06:33.550> deal<00:06:33.730> there<00:06:33.970> and<00:06:34.780> i<00:06:34.870> would<00:06:35.020> imagine<00:06:35.110> this

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
big deal there and i would imagine this

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.330 
big deal there and i would imagine this
will<00:06:35.680> certainly

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
will certainly

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.740 
will certainly
from<00:06:36.639> the<00:06:36.730> fall<00:06:36.940> i'm<00:06:37.060> not<00:06:37.210> going<00:06:37.360> to<00:06:37.389> throw<00:06:37.570> it

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
from the fall i'm not going to throw it

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.010 
from the fall i'm not going to throw it
down<00:06:37.900> or<00:06:38.110> anything<00:06:38.199> but<00:06:39.210> this<00:06:40.210> this<00:06:40.510> back<00:06:40.750> is

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
down or anything but this this back is

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.170 
down or anything but this this back is
pretty<00:06:41.260> strong<00:06:41.530> you<00:06:42.520> can<00:06:42.669> tell<00:06:42.850> it's<00:06:43.000> got<00:06:43.150> a

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
pretty strong you can tell it's got a

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.909 
pretty strong you can tell it's got a
little<00:06:43.330> bit<00:06:43.510> of<00:06:43.540> a<00:06:43.690> rubber<00:06:43.900> if<00:06:44.139> you<00:06:44.260> give<00:06:44.500> to<00:06:44.740> it

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 
little bit of a rubber if you give to it

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.180 
little bit of a rubber if you give to it
so<00:06:45.780> it<00:06:46.780> seems<00:06:47.050> like<00:06:47.169> a<00:06:47.199> decent<00:06:47.380> case<00:06:47.740> like<00:06:48.100> i

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190
