00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
quite a bit different the number one

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.410 
quite a bit different the number one
reason<00:01:37.950> being<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.760> big<00:01:39.090> thing

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
reason being we have this big thing

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.040 
reason being we have this big thing
jammed<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.590> our<00:01:40.710> mouth<00:01:41.300> which<00:01:42.300> means<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.750> can't

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
jammed in our mouth which means we can't

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.860 
jammed in our mouth which means we can't
do<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.620> traditional<00:01:44.370> beatbox<00:01:45.090> kind<00:01:45.630> of

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
do the traditional beatbox kind of

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.190 
do the traditional beatbox kind of
effects<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.710> sounds<00:01:47.220> with<00:01:47.580> our<00:01:47.729> mouths

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
effects and sounds with our mouths

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.550 
effects and sounds with our mouths
secondly<00:01:49.520> most<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.640> our<00:01:50.760> sound<00:01:51.120> comes<00:01:52.080> out<00:01:52.320> of

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
secondly most of our sound comes out of

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.510 
secondly most of our sound comes out of
the<00:01:52.650> Bell<00:01:53.010> and<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:54.180> general<00:01:54.659> area<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.440> so<00:01:56.430> if

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the Bell and this general area and so if

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.430 
the Bell and this general area and so if
we're<00:01:56.670> doing<00:01:56.820> anything<00:01:57.420> off<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.080> side

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
we're doing anything off to the side

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.130 
we're doing anything off to the side
which<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.370> do<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.790> little<00:02:00.540> bit<00:02:00.690> of<00:02:00.720> that<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.080> we

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
which I do a little bit of that and we

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.870 
which I do a little bit of that and we
might<00:02:01.229> talk<00:02:01.409> about<00:02:01.650> that<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.950> future<00:02:02.159> it's

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
might talk about that in the future it's

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.640 
might talk about that in the future it's
not<00:02:03.090> going<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.420> really<00:02:03.750> picked<00:02:04.020> up<00:02:04.200> because

if you have a mic here and just you get
a<00:02:06.540> lot<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.780> sound<00:02:07.020> coming<00:02:07.350> out<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.590> here<00:02:07.770> and

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
a lot of sound coming out of here and

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.410 
a lot of sound coming out of here and
this<00:02:08.009> will<00:02:08.159> get<00:02:08.280> lost<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.909> anything<00:02:09.330> you're

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
this will get lost so anything you're

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.869 
this will get lost so anything you're
doing<00:02:09.599> up<00:02:09.869> here<00:02:10.049> has<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.709> be<00:02:10.830> going<00:02:11.190> through

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
doing up here has to be going through

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.690 
doing up here has to be going through
the<00:02:12.060> horn<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.860> used<00:02:13.860> as<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.010> bell<00:02:14.220> which<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.580> be

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
the horn and used as a bell which can be

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.030 
the horn and used as a bell which can be
a<00:02:14.730> bonus<00:02:15.209> because<00:02:15.450> we<00:02:15.750> have<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.200> amplifier

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
a bonus because we have this amplifier

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.880 
a bonus because we have this amplifier
basically<00:02:17.670> this

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
basically this

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.059 
basically this
big<00:02:18.010> tube<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.400> will<00:02:18.520> help<00:02:18.640> make<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.090> louder

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
big tube that will help make it louder

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.640 
big tube that will help make it louder
so<00:02:21.069> that's<00:02:21.280> one<00:02:21.490> of<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.610> key<00:02:21.790> differences<00:02:22.650> so

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
so that's one of the key differences so

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.910 
so that's one of the key differences so
a<00:02:23.680> lot<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:23.980> these<00:02:24.100> effects<00:02:24.490> aren't<00:02:25.770> aren't<00:02:26.770> as

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
a lot of these effects aren't aren't as

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.470 
a lot of these effects aren't aren't as
simple<00:02:27.069> as<00:02:27.220> just<00:02:27.310> making<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.880> sound<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.450> your

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
simple as just making the sound in your

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.660 
simple as just making the sound in your
mouth<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:29.080> have<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.319> find<00:02:29.620> out<00:02:29.860> some<00:02:30.100> way<00:02:30.160> to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
mouth you have to find out some way to

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.030 
mouth you have to find out some way to
do<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.330> through<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.600> saxophone<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.920> that

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
do it through the saxophone so that

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.810 
do it through the saxophone so that
brings<00:02:33.250> me<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:34.060> three<00:02:34.590> basic<00:02:35.590> sounds<00:02:36.220> that

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
brings me to the three basic sounds that

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.970 
brings me to the three basic sounds that
we're<00:02:36.940> going<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.090> start<00:02:37.420> with<00:02:37.800> greg<00:02:38.800> patello

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
we're going to start with greg patello

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.510 
we're going to start with greg patello
and<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:40.420> flute<00:02:41.050> beatboxing<00:02:41.709> 101<00:02:42.130> he<00:02:42.310> talks

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
and is a flute beatboxing 101 he talks

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.840 
and is a flute beatboxing 101 he talks
about<00:02:42.820> having<00:02:43.200> three<00:02:44.200> basic<00:02:44.560> sounds<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.550> kind

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
about having three basic sounds of kind

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.150 
about having three basic sounds of kind
of<00:02:45.880> like<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.060> bass<00:02:46.270> drum<00:02:46.300> kind<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.410> snare<00:02:47.770> and

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
of like a bass drum kind of a snare and

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.010 
of like a bass drum kind of a snare and
kind<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.550> hi-hat<00:02:48.940> sound<00:02:49.300> which<00:02:49.989> is

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
kind of a hi-hat sound which is

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.040 
kind of a hi-hat sound which is
mimicking<00:02:50.560> obviously<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.250> drum<00:02:51.459> set<00:02:52.050> similar

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
mimicking obviously the drum set similar

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
mimicking obviously the drum set similar
on<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.200> sax<00:02:53.470> but<00:02:53.770> they're<00:02:53.890> different

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
on the sax but they're different

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.009 
on the sax but they're different
techniques<00:02:54.580> first<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.360> all<00:02:55.450> for<00:02:55.690> getting<00:02:55.810> that

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
techniques first of all for getting that

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.550 
techniques first of all for getting that
bass<00:02:56.410> sound<00:02:56.860> I'm<00:02:57.250> mainly<00:02:57.760> doing<00:02:58.360> a<00:02:58.959> technique

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
bass sound I'm mainly doing a technique

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.940 
bass sound I'm mainly doing a technique
called<00:02:59.590> slap<00:03:00.370> tonguing<00:03:01.030> also<00:03:01.840> tongue<00:03:02.320> ramming

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
called slap tonguing also tongue ramming

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.199 
called slap tonguing also tongue ramming
which<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> little<00:03:03.610> bit<00:03:03.670> different<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.150> I'll

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
which is a little bit different and I'll

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.580 
which is a little bit different and I'll
talk<00:03:04.450> about<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:04.900> allows<00:03:05.080> me<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.320> play

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
talk about and that allows me to play

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.340 
talk about and that allows me to play
faster<00:03:06.450> but<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.540> slap<00:03:07.720> tonguing<00:03:08.170> is

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
faster but the slap tonguing is

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.040 
faster but the slap tonguing is
basically<00:03:09.310> taking<00:03:10.000> your<00:03:10.030> tongue<00:03:10.360> creating<00:03:10.989> a

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
basically taking your tongue creating a

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.229 
basically taking your tongue creating a
suction<00:03:11.350> with<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.739> reed<00:03:11.890> yanking<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.000> down

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
suction with the reed yanking it down

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.120 
suction with the reed yanking it down
while<00:03:13.600> puffing<00:03:14.050> air<00:03:14.230> through<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.100> makes

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
while puffing air through and it makes

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.570 
while puffing air through and it makes
this<00:03:15.519> slap<00:03:16.360> tone<00:03:16.830> sounds<00:03:17.830> like<00:03:17.920> this<00:03:18.100> I<00:03:18.280> think

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
this slap tone sounds like this I think

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.020 
this slap tone sounds like this I think
some<00:03:18.760> low<00:03:18.910> notes<00:03:23.370> go<00:03:24.370> up<00:03:24.489> all<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.760> way<00:03:24.850> up<00:03:24.970> the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
some low notes go up all the way up the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.740 
some low notes go up all the way up the
horn<00:03:29.670> I'm<00:03:30.670> mainly<00:03:31.000> going<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.239> be<00:03:31.299> sticking<00:03:31.660> to

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
horn I'm mainly going to be sticking to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:39.990 
horn I'm mainly going to be sticking to
the<00:03:31.840> low<00:03:32.019> notes<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:33.280> get<00:03:33.430> that<00:03:38.790> once<00:03:39.790> again

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
the low notes to get that once again

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.400 
the low notes to get that once again
I'll<00:03:40.090> be<00:03:40.209> mixing<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.570> with<00:03:40.690> this<00:03:41.049> idea

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
I'll be mixing that with this idea

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.870 
I'll be mixing that with this idea
called<00:03:41.590> Poong<00:03:41.950> ramming<00:03:42.340> that<00:03:42.430> allows<00:03:42.640> me<00:03:42.790> to

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
called Poong ramming that allows me to

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.819 
called Poong ramming that allows me to
do<00:03:43.000> this<00:03:46.260> but<00:03:47.260> we'll<00:03:47.380> get<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.620> in<00:03:47.739> the

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
do this but we'll get to that in the

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.470 
do this but we'll get to that in the
future<00:03:48.010> okay<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:49.180> snare<00:03:49.750> sound<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:51.430> call<00:03:52.269> it<00:03:52.390> a

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
future okay the snare sound I call it a

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.470 
future okay the snare sound I call it a
saxophone<00:03:52.959> let's<00:03:53.170> call<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:53.410> a<00:03:53.440> pop<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:55.209> just

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
saxophone let's call it a pop and just

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.060 
saxophone let's call it a pop and just
doing<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:58.209> that's<00:03:58.690> basically<00:03:59.079> just<00:03:59.410> creating

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
doing and that's basically just creating

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.360 
doing and that's basically just creating
some<00:04:00.250> tension<00:04:00.730> in<00:04:01.410> in<00:04:02.410> your<00:04:02.560> mouth<00:04:02.799> and<00:04:03.130> then

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
some tension in in your mouth and then

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.340 
some tension in in your mouth and then
releasing<00:04:03.880> it<00:04:04.470> with<00:04:05.470> a<00:04:05.500> ton<00:04:05.829> of<00:04:05.860> air<00:04:07.350> doesn't

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
releasing it with a ton of air doesn't

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.540 
releasing it with a ton of air doesn't
matter<00:04:08.560> what<00:04:08.739> note<00:04:08.920> you're<00:04:08.950> fingering

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.680 

doesn't<00:04:12.550> really<00:04:12.730> change<00:04:12.819> it<00:04:13.150> too<00:04:13.270> much<00:04:13.420> that

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
doesn't really change it too much that

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.600 
doesn't really change it too much that
gives<00:04:13.900> me<00:04:13.990> that<00:04:14.170> that<00:04:14.560> backbeat<00:04:15.160> that's

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
gives me that that backbeat that's

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.789 
gives me that that backbeat that's
really<00:04:15.880> important<00:04:16.329> for<00:04:16.540> establishing<00:04:17.320> your

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
really important for establishing your

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.910 
really important for establishing your
room<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.130> then<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:18.820> hi-hat<00:04:19.090> sound<00:04:19.920> this

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
room and then the hi-hat sound this

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.350 
room and then the hi-hat sound this
one's<00:04:21.100> pretty<00:04:21.250> easy<00:04:21.370> I'm<00:04:21.730> just<00:04:21.760> doing<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.270> just

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
one's pretty easy I'm just doing it just

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.900 
one's pretty easy I'm just doing it just
like<00:04:25.360> you're<00:04:25.510> tonguing<00:04:26.130> but<00:04:27.130> not<00:04:27.310> giving<00:04:27.760> it

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
like you're tonguing but not giving it

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.330 
like you're tonguing but not giving it
quite<00:04:28.240> enough<00:04:28.570> support<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.710> make<00:04:29.860> an<00:04:30.010> actual

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
quite enough support to make an actual

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.150 
quite enough support to make an actual
sound<00:04:30.880> I'll<00:04:31.540> talk<00:04:31.750> about<00:04:31.780> ideal<00:04:32.620> fingerings

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
sound I'll talk about ideal fingerings

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.740 
sound I'll talk about ideal fingerings
that<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:33.460> can<00:04:33.640> use<00:04:33.850> to<00:04:34.030> get<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.240> maximum

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
that you can use to get the maximum

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:42.710 
that you can use to get the maximum
volume<00:04:34.960> in<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.770> future<00:04:36.040> but<00:04:36.850> it's<00:04:36.970> just<00:04:37.060> this

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.630 

also<00:04:43.720> notice<00:04:44.050> that<00:04:44.080> it<00:04:44.320> helps<00:04:44.650> more<00:04:45.310> fingers

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
also notice that it helps more fingers

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.970 
also notice that it helps more fingers
you<00:04:45.760> do<00:04:45.940> put<00:04:46.180> down<00:04:46.450> that<00:04:46.900> allows<00:04:47.169> that<00:04:47.470> air<00:04:47.710> and

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
you do put down that allows that air and

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.830 
you do put down that allows that air and
the<00:04:48.040> sound<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.820> all<00:04:48.940> be<00:04:49.180> coming<00:04:49.480> out<00:04:49.600> of<00:04:49.630> the

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
the sound to all be coming out of the

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.630 
the sound to all be coming out of the
Bell<00:04:50.080> instead<00:04:50.620> of<00:04:50.710> just<00:04:50.890> kind<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.280> spread<00:04:51.610> out

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
Bell instead of just kind of spread out

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.220 
Bell instead of just kind of spread out
I'm<00:04:52.240> going<00:04:52.390> to<00:04:52.450> have<00:04:52.540> all<00:04:52.660> your<00:04:52.810> fingers<00:04:52.930> down

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
I'm going to have all your fingers down

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.620 
I'm going to have all your fingers down
so<00:04:54.070> you<00:04:54.160> put<00:04:54.340> those<00:04:54.430> three<00:04:54.669> together<00:04:54.760> and<00:04:55.210> you

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
so you put those three together and you

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:05.610 
so you put those three together and you
just<00:04:55.660> create<00:04:56.530> a<00:04:56.560> basic<00:04:56.890> beat<00:04:57.040> like<00:04:57.190> this<00:05:04.620> and

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
just create a basic beat like this and

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.100 
just create a basic beat like this and
of<00:05:05.710> course<00:05:05.950> you<00:05:06.190> can<00:05:06.600> change<00:05:07.600> it<00:05:07.750> up<00:05:07.870> add<00:05:08.080> some

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
of course you can change it up add some

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:24.620 
of course you can change it up add some
syncopation<00:05:08.950> and<00:05:12.419> add<00:05:13.419> some<00:05:13.630> upper<00:05:13.930> notes

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.520 

we're<00:05:25.630> not<00:05:25.750> only<00:05:25.900> going<00:05:26.140> to<00:05:26.200> be<00:05:26.260> talking<00:05:26.410> about

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
we're not only going to be talking about

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.770 
we're not only going to be talking about
those<00:05:26.740> three<00:05:27.100> tones<00:05:27.340> there's<00:05:28.180> a<00:05:28.270> lot<00:05:28.510> of<00:05:28.630> other

those three tones there's a lot of other

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.240 
those three tones there's a lot of other
effects<00:05:29.169> that<00:05:29.320> we<00:05:29.380> can<00:05:29.500> do<00:05:29.620> because<00:05:29.830> this<00:05:29.950> is

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
effects that we can do because this is

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.460 
effects that we can do because this is
this<00:05:30.910> horn<00:05:31.180> can<00:05:31.419> do<00:05:31.540> a<00:05:31.570> lot<00:05:31.840> of<00:05:31.870> surprising

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
things like flutter tonguing but using

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:22.450 
things like flutter tonguing but using
as<00:06:12.949> pitch<00:06:13.250> 'less<00:06:13.580> with<00:06:14.060> pitch<00:06:14.270> list<00:06:14.509> tones<00:06:21.460> get

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
as pitch 'less with pitch list tones get

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.730 
as pitch 'less with pitch list tones get
kind<00:06:22.639> of<00:06:22.699> a<00:06:22.789> roll<00:06:22.940> so<00:06:23.270> lots<00:06:23.570> of<00:06:23.780> things<00:06:23.840> coming
