00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.040 
also didn't want to use for at the back
formation<00:00:47.730> because<00:00:47.820> although<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.510> Alba

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
formation because although we have Alba

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.040 
formation because although we have Alba
on<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:50.160> or<00:00:50.399> yeah<00:00:50.850> Albert<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> left<00:00:51.840> side

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
on the or yeah Albert on the left side

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.869 
on the or yeah Albert on the left side
who's<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> very<00:00:52.829> highly<00:00:53.100> rated<00:00:53.309> left<00:00:53.699> back

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
who's a very highly rated left back

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.180 
who's a very highly rated left back
there<00:00:54.420> isn't<00:00:54.600> anyone<00:00:55.079> particularly<00:00:55.620> good<00:00:55.949> at

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
there isn't anyone particularly good at

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.830 
there isn't anyone particularly good at
the<00:00:56.489> right<00:00:56.730> back<00:00:56.969> position<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.449> think<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.690> best

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the right back position I think the best

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
the right back position I think the best
would<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.079> been<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.320> all<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.859> lower<00:00:59.039> at<00:00:59.489> an

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
would have been like all the lower at an

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.990 
would have been like all the lower at an
82<00:01:00.629> rating<00:01:01.170> however<00:01:01.530> there<00:01:01.770> obviously<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.190> so

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
82 rating however there obviously was so

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.270 
82 rating however there obviously was so
do<00:01:03.210> Ramos<00:01:03.629> at<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:03.930> point<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.159> use

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
do Ramos at one point but we have to use

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.710 
do Ramos at one point but we have to use
them<00:01:05.400> as<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> centre<00:01:05.880> back<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.360> he's<00:01:06.510> so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
them as a centre back because he's so

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
them as a centre back because he's so
much<00:01:06.869> better<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.619> position<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.640> much

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820

to<00:02:32.819> be<00:02:32.910> 13<00:02:33.420> card<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.930> because<00:02:34.380> this<00:02:34.500> one's<00:02:34.739> a

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
to be 13 card is because this one's a

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.130 
to be 13 card is because this one's a
