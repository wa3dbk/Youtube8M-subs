00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960

throwing<00:00:40.590> away<00:00:40.860> GT<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:42.120> GT<00:00:42.629> never

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
happened and I like to think that GT

never really happened a lot of fans

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.490 
never really happened a lot of fans
think<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.660> thing<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.289> know<00:00:49.379> what

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
think so but the thing is you know what

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.619 
think so but the thing is you know what
happened<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.460> leave<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.390> side

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
happened so just leave that to the side

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.080 
happened so just leave that to the side
don't<00:00:51.899> even<00:00:52.170> consider<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.059> what<00:00:54.059> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
don't even consider that and what I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.990 
don't even consider that and what I
thought<00:00:54.600> he<00:00:54.780> was<00:00:54.899> going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.559> maybe<00:00:56.250> keep

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
thought he was going to do is maybe keep

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.689 
thought he was going to do is maybe keep
Super<00:00:57.570> Saiyan<00:00:57.870> 3<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.559> that's<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.010> maybe<00:00:59.340> turn

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
Super Saiyan 3 and that's it maybe turn

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.720 
Super Saiyan 3 and that's it maybe turn
Vegeta<00:01:00.210> into<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> super<00:01:01.379> saiyan<00:01:01.410> 3<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:02.250> stop<00:01:02.550> at

Vegeta into a super saiyan 3 but stop at
their<00:01:02.850> turn<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.570> don't<00:01:03.989> know<00:01:04.140> Gogeta<00:01:04.830> into

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
their turn I don't know Gogeta into

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
it super saiyan 3 and I thought that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.830 
it super saiyan 3 and I thought that
would<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.200> pretty<00:01:13.500> good<00:01:13.619> idea<00:01:14.570> but<00:01:15.570> some

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
would be a pretty good idea but some

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.289 
would be a pretty good idea but some
news<00:01:16.140> has<00:01:16.439> popped<00:01:16.740> up<00:01:16.950> now<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.759> there<00:01:18.060> will

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
news has popped up now that there will

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.719 
news has popped up now that there will
be<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.570> transformation<00:01:19.500> beyond<00:01:19.920> super<00:01:20.460> saiyan

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
be a transformation beyond super saiyan

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.120 
be a transformation beyond super saiyan
3<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.930> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.530> super<00:01:22.740> saiyan

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
3 but it's not going to be super saiyan

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.370 
3 but it's not going to be super saiyan
4<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.180> by<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.630> way<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.259> be

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
4 and by the way it's not going to be

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.399 
4 and by the way it's not going to be
like<00:01:25.650> super<00:01:26.130> saiyan<00:01:26.659> 3.5<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.229> would<00:01:28.380> be

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
like super saiyan 3.5 that that would be

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.130 
like super saiyan 3.5 that that would be
dumb<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.000> going<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.630> called<00:01:30.840> is

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
dumb but what it's going to be called is

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.249 
dumb but what it's going to be called is
Super<00:01:32.100> Saiyan<00:01:32.400> God<00:01:32.909> Super<00:01:34.579> Saiyan<00:01:35.579> God<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.390> mean

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan God I mean

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.679 
Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan God I mean
it's<00:01:37.799> not<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> terrible<00:01:38.670> idea<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.390> movie

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it's not a terrible idea and the movie

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.039 
it's not a terrible idea and the movie
is<00:01:39.720> called<00:01:40.079> battle<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.890> gods<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.450> would

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
is called battle of gods so it would

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.480 
is called battle of gods so it would
kind<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.470> make<00:01:43.619> sense<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.130> Super

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
kind of make sense to have a Super

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.289 
kind of make sense to have a Super
Saiyan<00:01:44.520> God<00:01:45.020> transformation<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:47.270> that<00:01:48.270> just

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
Saiyan God transformation but that just

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.550 
Saiyan God transformation but that just
is<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.200> out<00:01:49.649> there<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.840> let's<00:01:51.840> consider<00:01:52.290> that

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
is so out there and let's consider that

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.580 
is so out there and let's consider that
Super<00:01:53.070> Saiyan<00:01:53.390> God<00:01:54.439> transformation<00:01:55.439> that

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
Super Saiyan God transformation that

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.280 
Super Saiyan God transformation that
Goku<00:01:56.040> has<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> new<00:01:56.880> Dragon<00:01:57.450> Ball<00:01:57.630> Z<00:01:57.659> movie

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
Goku has in the new Dragon Ball Z movie

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.690 
Goku has in the new Dragon Ball Z movie
is<00:01:58.469> going<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.520> be<00:02:00.110> really<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.259> god

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
is going to be really a god

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.109 
is going to be really a god
transformation<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.140> if<00:02:04.140> he<00:02:04.460> becomes<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.909> god

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
transformation and if he becomes a god

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.919 
transformation and if he becomes a god
now<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:07.140> kind<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.619> throws<00:02:08.039> away<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.429> whole

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
now that kind of throws away the whole

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.309 
now that kind of throws away the whole
point<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.140> Goku's<00:02:10.709> character

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
point of Goku's character

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.679 
point of Goku's character
because<00:02:11.680> throughout<00:02:12.430> Dragon<00:02:13.209> Ball<00:02:13.390> and

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689 
because throughout Dragon Ball and

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.949 
because throughout Dragon Ball and
Dragon<00:02:14.200> Ball<00:02:14.379> Z<00:02:14.409> and<00:02:14.769> even<00:02:15.040> dragon<00:02:15.519> ball<00:02:15.700> GT

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
Dragon Ball Z and even dragon ball GT

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.289 
Dragon Ball Z and even dragon ball GT
the<00:02:16.959> whole<00:02:17.200> point<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.859> Goku<00:02:18.519> fighting<00:02:19.120> and

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
the whole point of Goku fighting and

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.199 
the whole point of Goku fighting and
Goku<00:02:19.959> getting<00:02:20.319> stronger<00:02:20.680> was<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.819> he<00:02:21.999> could

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
Goku getting stronger was so he could

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.530 
Goku getting stronger was so he could
like<00:02:22.989> get<00:02:23.260> past<00:02:23.650> his<00:02:23.980> limits<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.549> get<00:02:25.269> better

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
like get past his limits and get better

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.530 
like get past his limits and get better
and<00:02:25.840> better<00:02:26.049> as<00:02:26.290> time<00:02:26.319> went<00:02:26.799> on<00:02:26.950> but<00:02:27.639> now<00:02:27.879> if<00:02:28.269> he

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
and better as time went on but now if he

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.020 
and better as time went on but now if he
becomes<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:29.049> god<00:02:29.230> with<00:02:29.620> immortality<00:02:30.340> and

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
becomes a god with immortality and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.990 
becomes a god with immortality and
limitless<00:02:31.780> power<00:02:32.200> then<00:02:32.829> he<00:02:33.040> has<00:02:33.250> no<00:02:33.579> limits

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
limitless power then he has no limits

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.119 
limitless power then he has no limits
and<00:02:34.120> then<00:02:34.599> like<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.319> whole<00:02:35.500> dragon<00:02:35.829> ball

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
and then like the whole dragon ball

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.069 
and then like the whole dragon ball
story<00:02:36.400> stops<00:02:36.760> there<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:37.269> that's<00:02:37.780> really

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
story stops there so that's really

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.349 
story stops there so that's really
saying<00:02:38.409> like<00:02:38.620> GT<00:02:39.280> never<00:02:39.489> happened<00:02:39.969> Goku

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
saying like GT never happened Goku

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.199 
saying like GT never happened Goku
becomes<00:02:40.689> a<00:02:40.810> god<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.430> Dragon<00:02:42.430> Ball<00:02:42.609> Z<00:02:42.639> ends

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
becomes a god and Dragon Ball Z ends

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.909 
becomes a god and Dragon Ball Z ends
right<00:02:43.389> there<00:02:43.450> nothing<00:02:44.139> ever<00:02:44.319> happens<00:02:44.799> again

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:44.919 
right there nothing ever happens again

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.399 
right there nothing ever happens again
and<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:46.299> really<00:02:46.689> don't<00:02:46.870> want<00:02:47.019> that<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.379> happen

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
and I really don't want that to happen

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.420 
and I really don't want that to happen
so<00:02:48.209> there<00:02:49.209> are<00:02:49.359> no<00:02:49.599> photos<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:50.469> this<00:02:50.889> whole<00:02:51.099> new

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.039 
really proved proof but some trailers

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.559 
to affect the movie but now that I'm
thinking<00:03:16.659> about<00:03:17.259> it<00:03:17.680> this<00:03:18.250> could<00:03:19.000> also<00:03:19.180> affect

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
thinking about it this could also affect

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.439 
thinking about it this could also affect
the<00:03:20.019> goku<00:03:20.560> vs<00:03:21.009> superman<00:03:21.579> battle<00:03:22.030> right

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
the goku vs superman battle right

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:26.069 
the goku vs superman battle right
because<00:03:23.169> think<00:03:23.620> about<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:24.099> goku<00:03:25.060> vs<00:03:25.479> Superman

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
because think about it goku vs Superman

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.860 
because think about it goku vs Superman
no<00:03:26.379> they<00:03:26.949> only<00:03:26.979> calculated<00:03:27.939> for<00:03:28.239> Super<00:03:28.599> Saiyan

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
no they only calculated for Super Saiyan

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.409 
no they only calculated for Super Saiyan
4<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.379> that<00:03:29.470> was<00:03:29.680> it<00:03:29.889> but<00:03:30.370> if<00:03:30.519> there<00:03:30.849> is<00:03:31.120> going

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
4 and that was it but if there is going

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.839 
4 and that was it but if there is going
to<00:03:31.569> be<00:03:31.599> a<00:03:31.720> Super<00:03:32.169> Saiyan<00:03:32.199> God<00:03:32.849> transformation

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
to be a Super Saiyan God transformation

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.960 
to be a Super Saiyan God transformation

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
then they're going to have to do some

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.490 
then they're going to have to do some
recalculations<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.479> see<00:03:37.659> if<00:03:37.750> goku<00:03:38.019> can

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
recalculations to see if goku can

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.729 
recalculations to see if goku can
surpass<00:03:39.189> the<00:03:39.519> man<00:03:39.759> of<00:03:39.970> steel<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.479> yeah<00:03:41.439> that's

surpass the man of steel and yeah that's

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.210 
surpass the man of steel and yeah that's
going<00:03:42.009> to<00:03:42.069> be<00:03:42.759> a<00:03:42.790> lot<00:03:43.599> of<00:03:43.659> work<00:03:43.959> too<00:03:44.229> so<00:03:44.560> we
