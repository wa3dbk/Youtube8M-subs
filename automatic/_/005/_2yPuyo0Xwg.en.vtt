00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 we go 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.359
 today I am going to tell you four very steps 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.370
 simple that we must follow to not 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.250
 have the oily hair I'll know I have 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.860
 Very oily hair is mostly in 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.450
 this part the obvious because already to the day 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.730
 next I have dirty hair but 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.529
 lately I'm dealing with this problem 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.539
 I had quite what happened before 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.730
 I do is four things so right now 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.340
 you can the first error notice that I 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.680
 committed a lot and then it turns out that it is 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.080
 the worst for this problem and it is floating 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.000
 the scalp when others sergio 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.830
 to clean my hair I told myself that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.720
 it's the worst thing you can do and that's what 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.059
 I always did so I advise you 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.769
 you wash your hair more gently than not 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.809
 rub both the scalp so as not to 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.940
 activate the resonances these that 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.890
 they produce the fat the seconds that I am 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.799
 doing is that I had clear hair 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.449
 dirty and if I have work or I have some 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.449
 site can not with dirty hair 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.220
 then I washed it one day and a day 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.530
 also and now what we are going is 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.330
 intersperse what I've spent to a day yes 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.360
 and one day no but mind with the perfect 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.230
 It is a day if we day and not days or be 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.200
 a little 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.750
 and it causes me the problem be noticeable the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.850
 third advice is to use camila and rosemary 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.010
 the chamomile do not worry because you do not 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.450
 it always depends how you use it 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.420
 corpse but they do not recommend it 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.620
 masks I recommend it 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.180
 even infusions on the hair if you want 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.830
 upload about this you also ask us and 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.260
 as I told you in the live and I tell you 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.630
 always but almost all ranges are 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.480
 but my mom is like many officers 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.430
 marÃ­a what products are you want more 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.530
 has used well because they are pretty very 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.380
 very very moisturizing all the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.590
 shampoos I use the light range is such and 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.750
 I started like this to end the roots 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.370
 fats and dry ends that is fair 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.650
 my problem and the good thing is that not also 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.480
 Kills hair or anything but good trying 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.120
 You already tell me that such are the ones that 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.980
 second there is also shampoo there is foam 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.600
 there is also conditioner and everything 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.030
 I also always recommend that for 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.290
 oily hair is not used 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.730
 conditioner but this one they have done 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.190
 precisely for that so that you 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.900
 you can use so nothing thanks for watching
