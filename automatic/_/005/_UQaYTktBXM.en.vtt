YouTube capital G here so I'm asking the

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.510 
YouTube capital G here so I'm asking the
question<00:00:17.900> in<00:00:17.990> this<00:00:18.110> video<00:00:18.260> did<00:00:18.710> my<00:00:18.980> beloved

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
question in this video did my beloved

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.640 
question in this video did my beloved
shadow<00:00:19.730> as<00:00:19.970> you<00:00:20.060> just<00:00:20.330> get<00:00:20.600> power<00:00:20.930> creaked<00:00:21.410> and

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
shadow as you just get power creaked and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.200 
shadow as you just get power creaked and
I<00:00:22.160> honestly<00:00:22.700> think<00:00:23.000> that<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:23.420> answer<00:00:23.930> is

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
I honestly think that the answer is

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.670 
I honestly think that the answer is
significantly<00:00:26.210> for<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:26.540> time<00:00:26.810> ding<00:00:27.080> power

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
significantly for the time ding power

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.650 
significantly for the time ding power
creep<00:00:27.980> is<00:00:28.190> a<00:00:28.550> crazy<00:00:28.880> thing<00:00:29.000> because<00:00:29.450> of<00:00:29.540> how

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
creep is a crazy thing because of how

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.750 
creep is a crazy thing because of how
fast<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.140> game<00:00:30.320> is<00:00:30.560> now<00:00:30.740> it<00:00:31.010> seems<00:00:31.400> to<00:00:31.580> happen

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
fast the game is now it seems to happen

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.660 
fast the game is now it seems to happen
from<00:00:32.180> set<00:00:32.509> to<00:00:32.540> set<00:00:32.830> but<00:00:33.830> I'm<00:00:34.130> not<00:00:34.280> talking

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
from set to set but I'm not talking

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
about power creeps in the sense that the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.340 
about power creeps in the sense that the
deck<00:00:37.100> can't<00:00:37.370> compete<00:00:37.730> I'm<00:00:38.300> just<00:00:38.660> talking<00:00:39.110> in

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
deck can't compete I'm just talking in

deck can't compete I'm just talking in
the<00:00:39.530> sense<00:00:39.800> that<00:00:39.890> to<00:00:40.340> me<00:00:40.880> it<00:00:41.000> feels<00:00:41.150> like<00:00:41.300> shed

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
the sense that to me it feels like shed

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.050 
the sense that to me it feels like shed
always<00:00:41.840> just<00:00:42.050> kind<00:00:42.320> of<00:00:42.410> dropped<00:00:42.800> a<00:00:42.950> tear<00:00:43.280> or<00:00:43.910> at

always just kind of dropped a tear or at

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.720 
always just kind of dropped a tear or at
least<00:00:44.210> half<00:00:44.480> a<00:00:44.630> tear<00:00:44.840> because<00:00:45.680> of<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.520> set

secrets<00:00:47.060> of<00:00:47.120> eternity<00:00:47.540> if<00:00:47.660> you<00:00:47.810> look<00:00:48.020> at<00:00:48.170> that

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
secrets of eternity if you look at that

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.319 
secrets of eternity if you look at that
set<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:49.430> look<00:00:49.610> at<00:00:49.730> all<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.150> major

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
set and you look at all the major

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.300 
set and you look at all the major
players<00:00:50.630> from<00:00:50.870> last<00:00:50.960> format<00:00:51.590> obviously<00:00:52.190> the

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
players from last format obviously the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.790 
players from last format obviously the
big<00:00:52.489> three<00:00:52.790> shadows<00:00:53.270> please<00:00:53.750> burning<00:00:54.560> abyss

big three shadows please burning abyss

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.470 
big three shadows please burning abyss
and<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:55.430> escalates<00:00:55.940> because<00:00:56.239> they<00:00:56.420> were

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
and it escalates because they were

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.360 
and it escalates because they were
always<00:00:56.780> very<00:00:57.140> relevant<00:00:57.739> you<00:00:58.100> know<00:00:58.130> they

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
always very relevant you know they

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.270 
always very relevant you know they
usually<00:00:58.910> had<00:00:59.239> about<00:00:59.420> one<00:00:59.840> or<00:01:00.230> two<00:01:00.260> spots<00:01:01.010> in

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
usually had about one or two spots in

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.999 
usually had about one or two spots in
every<00:01:01.820> major<00:01:02.120> tournament<00:01:02.840> you<00:01:03.590> look<00:01:03.739> at<00:01:03.890> the

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
every major tournament you look at the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.340 
every major tournament you look at the
support<00:01:04.430> that<00:01:04.729> each<00:01:04.940> deck<00:01:05.210> got<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:05.750> the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
support that each deck got and the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.410 
support that each deck got and the
shadow<00:01:06.620> support<00:01:07.100> just<00:01:07.310> doesn't<00:01:07.700> stack<00:01:07.880> up<00:01:08.120> and

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
shadow support just doesn't stack up and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.830 
shadow support just doesn't stack up and
we<00:01:08.870> already<00:01:09.350> knew<00:01:09.650> this<00:01:09.890> going<00:01:10.130> in<00:01:10.840> initially

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
we already knew this going in initially

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.240 
we already knew this going in initially
I<00:01:11.870> didn't<00:01:12.260> really<00:01:12.440> think<00:01:12.590> that<00:01:12.740> it<00:01:12.860> would<00:01:13.100> be

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
I didn't really think that it would be

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.950 
I didn't really think that it would be
that<00:01:13.490> big<00:01:13.940> of<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.120> deal<00:01:14.210> I<00:01:14.300> was<00:01:14.360> like<00:01:14.510> okay

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
that big of a deal I was like okay

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.300 
that big of a deal I was like okay
they're<00:01:15.140> just<00:01:15.170> really<00:01:15.560> only<00:01:15.680> one<00:01:15.830> shut<00:01:16.190> our

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
they're just really only one shut our

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.430 
they're just really only one shut our
support<00:01:16.790> card<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.720> deck<00:01:17.900> will<00:01:18.080> be<00:01:18.170> fine

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
support card and the deck will be fine

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.060 
support card and the deck will be fine
but<00:01:19.220> if<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:19.940> look<00:01:20.270> at<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.780> gap<00:01:21.080> last<00:01:21.560> format

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
but if you look at the gap last format

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.250 
but if you look at the gap last format
you<00:01:22.370> know<00:01:22.490> between<00:01:22.729> shadows<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:23.930> all<00:01:24.080> the

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
you know between shadows and all the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.380 
you know between shadows and all the
other<00:01:24.380> decks<00:01:24.710> I<00:01:24.860> mean<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:25.190> was<00:01:25.370> so<00:01:25.670> minuscule

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
other decks I mean it was so minuscule

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.719 
other decks I mean it was so minuscule
and<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:27.110> seems<00:01:27.409> like<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:28.159> gap<00:01:28.430> has

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
and it seems like the gap has

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.300 
and it seems like the gap has
significantly<00:01:29.540> widened<00:01:30.170> because<00:01:30.650> shadows

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
significantly widened because shadows

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.980 
significantly widened because shadows
don't<00:01:31.580> have<00:01:31.729> anything<00:01:32.119> to<00:01:32.479> add<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:32.659> their

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
don't have anything to add to their

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.289 
don't have anything to add to their

is<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:56.000> serious<00:01:56.570> struggle<00:01:56.930> I'm<00:01:57.140> like<00:01:57.290> holy

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
is a serious struggle I'm like holy

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.880 
is a serious struggle I'm like holy
it<00:01:58.400> was<00:01:58.640> not<00:01:58.939> that<00:01:59.150> hard<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.720> beat<00:01:59.900> ex<00:02:00.170> deck<00:02:00.530> you

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
it was not that hard to beat ex deck you

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.130 
it was not that hard to beat ex deck you
know<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.220> last<00:02:01.400> week<00:02:01.700> I'll<00:02:02.630> give<00:02:02.869> you<00:02:03.020> an

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
know the last week I'll give you an

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.649 
know the last week I'll give you an
example<00:02:03.580> so<00:02:04.580> teller<00:02:04.820> Knights<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.299> is<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.450> deck

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
example so teller Knights this is a deck

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.050 
example so teller Knights this is a deck
where<00:02:05.900> for<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.619> most<00:02:06.799> part<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.369> know<00:02:07.400> it's<00:02:07.939> a

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
where for the most part you know it's a

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.899 
where for the most part you know it's a
pretty<00:02:08.299> good<00:02:08.629> matchup<00:02:08.929> but<00:02:09.549> now

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
pretty good matchup but now

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.330 
pretty good matchup but now
so<00:02:11.090> tonight<00:02:11.540> skin<00:02:11.900> they<00:02:12.169> can<00:02:12.200> basically<00:02:12.590> do<00:02:13.099> to

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
so tonight skin they can basically do to

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.630 
so tonight skin they can basically do to
shed

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
shed

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.060 
shed
which<00:02:13.970> shadows<00:02:14.300> word<00:02:14.720> had<00:02:15.140> been<00:02:15.350> notoriously

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
which shadows word had been notoriously

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.800 
which shadows word had been notoriously
known<00:02:16.280> for<00:02:16.580> doing<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:16.970> them<00:02:17.120> they<00:02:17.270> can<00:02:17.480> put

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
known for doing to them they can put

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.320 
known for doing to them they can put
their<00:02:18.470> foot<00:02:18.920> on<00:02:19.160> your<00:02:19.340> throat<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.970> mean<00:02:20.090> when

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
their foot on your throat I mean when

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.930 
their foot on your throat I mean when
you<00:02:20.450> do<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.660> play<00:02:21.020> where<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:21.800> Trevor<00:02:22.520> somebody

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
you do a play where you Trevor somebody

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.460 
you do a play where you Trevor somebody
again<00:02:23.240> it's<00:02:23.450> already<00:02:23.600> been<00:02:23.840> established<00:02:24.440> I

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
again it's already been established I

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.990 
again it's already been established I
think<00:02:24.740> Trevor<00:02:25.100> is<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.520> greatest<00:02:25.850> thing<00:02:25.970> since

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
think Trevor is the greatest thing since

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.390 
think Trevor is the greatest thing since
sliced<00:02:26.330> bread<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:27.230> know<00:02:27.320> it's<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.620> good<00:02:27.830> play

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
sliced bread you know it's a good play

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.270 
sliced bread you know it's a good play
you<00:02:28.730> know<00:02:28.880> you<00:02:29.510> balance<00:02:30.020> potential<00:02:30.770> like

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
you know you balance potential like

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.740 
you know you balance potential like
constructs<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.120> stuff<00:02:32.240> like<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.540> maybe

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
constructs and stuff like that maybe

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.180 
constructs and stuff like that maybe
when<00:02:32.990> it's<00:02:33.230> kind<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.470> hard<00:02:33.620> if<00:02:33.770> your<00:02:33.920> opponent

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
when it's kind of hard if your opponent

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.770 
when it's kind of hard if your opponent
has<00:02:34.280> went<00:02:34.460> on<00:02:34.580> board<00:02:34.820> but<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.360> point<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.660> you

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
has went on board but the point is you

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.780 
has went on board but the point is you
get<00:02:35.990> rid<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:36.380> shuttle<00:02:36.620> fusion<00:02:37.040> hopefully

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
get rid of this shuttle fusion hopefully

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.370 
get rid of this shuttle fusion hopefully
you<00:02:37.880> hit<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.060> card<00:02:38.330> in<00:02:38.540> their<00:02:38.750> hand<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:39.110> you

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
you hit a card in their hand that you

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.540 
you hit a card in their hand that you
know<00:02:39.500> wasn't<00:02:39.770> that<00:02:40.130> all<00:02:40.220> monster

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
know wasn't that all monster

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.760 
know wasn't that all monster
because<00:02:40.760> they'll<00:02:40.880> trigger<00:02:41.209> but<00:02:41.900> for<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.590> most

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
because they'll trigger but for the most

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.100 
because they'll trigger but for the most
part<00:02:43.040> that's<00:02:43.160> all<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.490> really<00:02:43.640> could<00:02:43.910> do<00:02:44.110> that

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
part that's all you really could do that

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.990 
part that's all you really could do that
should<00:02:45.230> all<00:02:45.380> player<00:02:45.620> can<00:02:45.830> easily<00:02:46.340> answer<00:02:46.550> with

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
should all player can easily answer with

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.120 
should all player can easily answer with
you<00:02:47.240> know<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.720> fusion<00:02:48.350> or<00:02:48.590> something<00:02:48.950> like<00:02:49.070> that

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
you know a fusion or something like that

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.640 
you know a fusion or something like that
but<00:02:49.520> now<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:49.970> them<00:02:50.090> having<00:02:50.420> diamund<00:02:50.959> it's

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
but now with them having diamund it's

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.479 
but now with them having diamund it's
ridiculous

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
ridiculous

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.250 
ridiculous
because<00:02:52.910> not<00:02:53.090> only<00:02:53.120> do<00:02:53.450> they<00:02:53.570> get<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.780> Trevor

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
because not only do they get the Trevor

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.770 
because not only do they get the Trevor
but<00:02:54.980> then<00:02:55.220> with<00:02:55.670> Diamond<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.209> can't<00:02:56.600> answer

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
but then with Diamond you can't answer

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.390 
but then with Diamond you can't answer
with<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.110> shuttle<00:02:57.380> Fusion<00:02:57.830> I<00:02:57.890> mean<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.130> can

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
with the shuttle Fusion I mean you can

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.130 
with the shuttle Fusion I mean you can
but<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:58.700> have<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.940> use<00:02:59.060> real<00:02:59.300> resources<00:02:59.810> from

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
but you have to use real resources from

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.680 
but you have to use real resources from
your<00:03:00.260> hand<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.890> even<00:03:01.610> if<00:03:01.820> you<00:03:02.090> do<00:03:02.360> have<00:03:02.570> the

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
your hand and even if you do have the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.210 
your hand and even if you do have the
resources<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.290> actually<00:03:03.440> use<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.010> fusion

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
resources to actually use the fusion

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.490 
resources to actually use the fusion
after<00:03:04.610> getting<00:03:04.820> hit<00:03:05.030> with<00:03:05.180> trevor<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:06.020> dude'

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
after getting hit with trevor the dude'

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.410 
after getting hit with trevor the dude'
has<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.709> built<00:03:07.040> in<00:03:07.190> shadow<00:03:07.550> imprisoning<00:03:08.120> mirror

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
has a built in shadow imprisoning mirror

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.780 
has a built in shadow imprisoning mirror
that<00:03:08.900> he<00:03:09.020> could<00:03:09.200> use<00:03:09.230> like<00:03:09.709> three<00:03:10.070> times<00:03:10.370> and

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
that he could use like three times and

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.300 
that he could use like three times and
to<00:03:11.750> make<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:11.959> even<00:03:12.320> more<00:03:12.350> insane<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.160> could

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
to make it even more insane and I could

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.470 
to make it even more insane and I could
be<00:03:13.459> wrong<00:03:13.580> about<00:03:13.640> this<00:03:13.910> but<00:03:13.970> I'm<00:03:14.150> pretty<00:03:14.390> sure

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
be wrong about this but I'm pretty sure

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.650 
be wrong about this but I'm pretty sure
that<00:03:14.630> I'm<00:03:14.870> not<00:03:15.110> if<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.860> detach<00:03:16.370> Trevor<00:03:17.300> he'll

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
that I'm not if you detach Trevor he'll

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.600 
that I'm not if you detach Trevor he'll
trigger<00:03:17.989> as<00:03:18.110> well<00:03:18.290> it's<00:03:18.680> like<00:03:18.830> it's<00:03:18.980> even<00:03:19.130> not

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
trigger as well it's like it's even not

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.520 
trigger as well it's like it's even not
I<00:03:19.910> mean<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.720> crazy

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
I mean it is crazy

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.070 
I mean it is crazy
you<00:03:22.070> know<00:03:22.190> so<00:03:22.370> tellers<00:03:22.700> basically<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:23.570> kind<00:03:24.019> of

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
you know so tellers basically I kind of

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.500 
you know so tellers basically I kind of
feel<00:03:24.230> like<00:03:24.260> they<00:03:24.470> pulled<00:03:24.830> ahead<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.610> knee<00:03:26.239> and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
feel like they pulled ahead and knee and

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.150 
feel like they pulled ahead and knee and
the<00:03:26.630> matchup<00:03:26.810> like<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.380> minute<00:03:27.650> even<00:03:27.830> if<00:03:28.040> you

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
the matchup like a minute even if you

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.729

summoners<00:04:55.900> art<00:04:56.169> I<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:56.919> thought<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.460> first<00:04:57.580> time

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
summoners art I I thought the first time

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.340 
summoners art I I thought the first time
that<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.180> card<00:04:58.390> was<00:04:58.540> played<00:04:58.720> it<00:04:59.140> was<00:04:59.320> a

that the card was played it was a
pendulum<00:04:59.680> still<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.340> nine<00:05:00.850> thus<00:05:01.300> they

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
pendulum still of nine thus they

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.409 
pendulum still of nine thus they
couldn't<00:05:01.750> get<00:05:02.590> enough<00:05:02.770> pendulum<00:05:03.370> when<00:05:04.030> they

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
couldn't get enough pendulum when they

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.770 
couldn't get enough pendulum when they
had<00:05:04.600> scout<00:05:04.870> but<00:05:05.169> I<00:05:05.350> found<00:05:06.070> that<00:05:06.310> was

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
had scout but I found that was

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.060 
had scout but I found that was
definitely<00:05:07.780> not<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:07.930> case<00:05:08.260> and<00:05:08.530> with<00:05:08.740> stove

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
definitely not the case and with stove

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.640 
definitely not the case and with stove
you<00:05:09.700> know<00:05:09.820> shadows<00:05:10.660> were<00:05:10.810> already<00:05:11.110> highly

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
you know shadows were already highly

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.740 
you know shadows were already highly
susceptible<00:05:11.950> to<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:13.000> whole<00:05:13.210> like<00:05:13.450> if<00:05:13.630> you

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
susceptible to the whole like if you

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.270 
susceptible to the whole like if you
have<00:05:13.840> carrier<00:05:14.320> with<00:05:14.500> a<00:05:14.530> sacrifice<00:05:15.040> your

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
have carrier with a sacrifice your

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.830 
have carrier with a sacrifice your
opponent<00:05:15.669> tributes<00:05:16.150> and<00:05:16.360> they<00:05:16.540> can<00:05:16.690> bounce

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
opponent tributes and they can bounce

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.140 
opponent tributes and they can bounce
you're<00:05:17.080> fusions<00:05:17.500> but<00:05:18.010> now<00:05:18.250> if<00:05:18.610> you<00:05:18.820> do<00:05:19.000> that

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
you're fusions but now if you do that

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.300 
you're fusions but now if you do that
play<00:05:19.419> and<00:05:19.720> you<00:05:20.200> tribute<00:05:20.560> for<00:05:20.710> stuff<00:05:20.950> I<00:05:21.160> mean

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
play and you tribute for stuff I mean

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.890 
play and you tribute for stuff I mean
you<00:05:21.460> could<00:05:21.639> be<00:05:21.760> you<00:05:22.000> basically<00:05:22.450> could<00:05:22.720> get

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
you could be you basically could get

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.260 
you could be you basically could get
your<00:05:23.020> entire<00:05:23.139> field<00:05:23.800> spawn<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:24.880> get<00:05:25.180> all

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
your entire field spawn and get all

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.540 
your entire field spawn and get all
decayed<00:05:25.660> so<00:05:26.229> I<00:05:26.500> mean<00:05:26.650> your<00:05:26.890> clean<00:05:27.160> match<00:05:27.310> up

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
decayed so I mean your clean match up

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.180 
decayed so I mean your clean match up
just<00:05:27.760> got<00:05:27.910> significantly<00:05:28.750> worse<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.380> you

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
just got significantly worse and you

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.090 
just got significantly worse and you
know<00:05:30.310> I'm<00:05:30.610> really<00:05:30.850> hoping<00:05:31.360> that<00:05:31.690> in<00:05:32.530> turn<00:05:32.800> over

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
know I'm really hoping that in turn over

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.190 
know I'm really hoping that in turn over
souls<00:05:33.310> are<00:05:33.550> wait<00:05:33.669> now<00:05:33.850> cross<00:05:34.120> over<00:05:34.270> souls<00:05:34.660> that

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
souls are wait now cross over souls that

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.760 
souls are wait now cross over souls that
the<00:05:35.410> water<00:05:35.710> fusion<00:05:36.640> will<00:05:37.240> be<00:05:37.390> insanely<00:05:38.050> broken

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
the water fusion will be insanely broken

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.159 
the water fusion will be insanely broken
because<00:05:39.070> at<00:05:39.400> this<00:05:39.580> point<00:05:39.850> I<00:05:40.150> kind<00:05:40.900> of<00:05:40.990> think

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
because at this point I kind of think

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.800 
because at this point I kind of think
that<00:05:41.350> shuttles<00:05:41.710> needed<00:05:42.250> um<00:05:42.729> in<00:05:43.240> in<00:05:43.600> this

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
that shuttles needed um in in this

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.420 
that shuttles needed um in in this
current<00:05:44.260> format<00:05:44.620> I<00:05:44.680> mean<00:05:44.890> maybe<00:05:45.070> this<00:05:45.250> is<00:05:45.400> just

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
current format I mean maybe this is just

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.460 
current format I mean maybe this is just
overreaction<00:05:46.240> but<00:05:46.390> I<00:05:46.419> feel<00:05:46.750> like<00:05:46.900> shadows<00:05:47.229> are

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
overreaction but I feel like shadows are

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.620 
overreaction but I feel like shadows are
kind<00:05:48.070> of<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.370> fourth<00:05:48.640> best<00:05:48.970> deck<00:05:49.330> right<00:05:49.570> now

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
kind of the fourth best deck right now

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.270 
kind of the fourth best deck right now
without<00:05:50.110> including<00:05:50.410> the<00:05:50.650> cost<00:05:50.979> or<00:05:51.130> anything

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
without including the cost or anything

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.550 
without including the cost or anything
let<00:05:51.940> me<00:05:51.970> know<00:05:52.150> what<00:05:52.300> you<00:05:52.419> guys<00:05:52.570> think<00:05:52.900> do<00:05:53.500> you

feel<00:05:53.919> that<00:05:54.160> shadows<00:05:54.700> got<00:05:54.910> power<00:05:55.180> creep

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
feel that shadows got power creep

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.810 
feel that shadows got power creep
