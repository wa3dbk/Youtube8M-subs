like<00:01:19.110> these<00:01:19.500> amps<00:01:20.210> he's<00:01:21.210> probably<00:01:21.479> cool

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
like these amps he's probably cool

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.050 
like these amps he's probably cool

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
capacitor everything is temporary I plan

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.060 
capacitor everything is temporary I plan
on<00:01:29.640> getting<00:01:29.939> home<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.380> plan<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:31.860> getting

on getting home I plan on getting

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.569 
on getting home I plan on getting
getting<00:01:32.820> either<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.720> more<00:01:33.960> subs<00:01:34.369> I'm<00:01:35.369> not

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
getting either for more subs I'm not

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.770 
getting either for more subs I'm not
sure<00:01:35.759> how<00:01:35.909> they're<00:01:35.970> gonna<00:01:36.210> fit<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
sure how they're gonna fit in here and

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.319 
sure how they're gonna fit in here and
man<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.610> apparently<00:01:38.610> they're<00:01:38.880> getting<00:01:39.090> for

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
man but apparently they're getting for

man but apparently they're getting for
more<00:01:39.540> or<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.810> getting<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:41.009> for<00:01:41.369> more<00:01:41.549> subs

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
more or just getting like for more subs

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.120 
more or just getting like for more subs
that<00:01:42.119> hit<00:01:42.299> harder<00:01:42.600> than<00:01:42.630> these<00:01:42.869> ones<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.950> know

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
that hit harder than these ones you know

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.080 
that hit harder than these ones you know
and<00:01:45.860> definitely<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> future<00:01:47.220> um

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and definitely in the future um
