00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the look at Windows 10 and it they make

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.340 
the look at Windows 10 and it they make
it<00:00:41.760> easier<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.360> initial<00:00:42.600> setup<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.170> not

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
it easier to the initial setup to not

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.930 
it easier to the initial setup to not
use<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> Microsoft<00:00:44.219> account<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:44.670> make<00:00:44.820> it

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
use the Microsoft account they make it

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.420 
use the Microsoft account they make it
easier<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.360> use<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.500> system<00:00:46.739> itself<00:00:47.100> without

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
easier to use the system itself without

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.400 
easier to use the system itself without
an<00:00:47.550> account<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.120> attach<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.930> Microsoft

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
an account you can attach a Microsoft

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.520 
an account you can attach a Microsoft
account<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:50.610> any<00:00:50.730> app<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.350> be<00:00:52.350> either

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
account to any app that be either

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.319 
account to any app that be either
requires<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.250> which<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:53.640> very<00:00:53.670> many<00:00:54.059> or

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
requires it which is not very many or

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.970 
requires it which is not very many or
would<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.719> better<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:55.920> example

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
would be better with it so for example

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.250 
would be better with it so for example
if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.579> want<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> use<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> msn

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
if you just want to use you know the msn

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.569 
if you just want to use you know the msn
weather<00:00:58.440> app<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.920> get<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.280> know<00:00:59.370> your

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
weather app and get you know your

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.549 
weather app and get you know your
favorite<00:00:59.910> cities<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.660> there<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.320> sign<00:01:01.530> in

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
favorite cities in there you can sign in

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.139 
favorite cities in there you can sign in
there<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.010> don't<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.789> worry<00:01:02.910> about<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
there and don't have to worry about the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.850 
there and don't have to worry about the
rest<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> system<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.290> think<00:01:04.680> that's

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
rest of the system so I think that's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.289 
rest of the system so I think that's
really<00:01:05.070> cool<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.560> I've<00:01:07.560> been<00:01:07.970> in<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.119> course

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
in Windows 7 and you kind of compare

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.149 
in Windows 7 and you kind of compare
these<00:01:15.689> things<00:01:15.900> side<00:01:16.080> by<00:01:16.110> side<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.619> know<00:01:16.710> how

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.219 
always for the better and this was one
that<00:01:42.000> really<00:01:42.150> stood<00:01:42.420> out<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.810> me<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that really stood out for me in that

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.710 
that really stood out for me in that
course<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:44.000> kind<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.090> collecting<00:01:45.479> all<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
course of kind of collecting all the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.780 
course of kind of collecting all the
different<00:01:46.079> changes<00:01:46.560> between<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.159> OS<00:01:47.369> version

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
different changes between the OS version

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.219 
different changes between the OS version
so<00:01:48.000> that's<00:01:48.329> kind<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.659> cool<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.110> you've

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
so that's kind of a cool but if you've

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.490 
so that's kind of a cool but if you've
been<00:01:49.320> holding<00:01:49.770> off<00:01:50.960> yeah<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.170> interesting

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
been holding off yeah it's interesting

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.929 
been holding off yeah it's interesting
that<00:01:52.770> they<00:01:52.979> backed<00:01:53.220> off<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.820> little

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
that they backed off on that a little

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.050 
that they backed off on that a little
bit<00:01:54.439> yeah<00:01:55.439> yeah<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.189> think<00:01:56.490> there<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.790> bunch
