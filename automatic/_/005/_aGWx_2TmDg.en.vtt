00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.260
 do not 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:12.769
 I'm on top of a UFO on top of a 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.080
 UFO because it's someone good normally 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.410
 the aliens use or mis to transport themselves 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.800
 not that maybe some taxi stands or 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.880
 or take the micro no no have been found 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.949
 aliens on the walls of the truck is is 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.090
 a classic always always happens I 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.470
 found several and 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.059
 but good the idea of this video is to be 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.980
 one of those someone super invincible 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.260
 genetically modified that escaped 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.970
 of a military prison and what 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.800
 normally it happens as well in the nasa as well 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.350
 that they escape and then pass 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.600
 explosions and destroy the world if this 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.670
 kind of good stuff as they come I'll be 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.890
 testing mods because it is assumed that 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.470
 aliens are the ones who make the mods 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.500
 then like that when modifying all this 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.239
 because they have all the weapons and therefore 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.370
 let's try how much we can get 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.989
 to be like these aliens as I am a 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.549
 someone can practically control the 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.040
 I can control the time of day 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:07.750
 I can control all the factors that 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.990
 I want for example if I want that 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.340
 it is snowing because this someone can 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.220
 doing that is not you can do that 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.310
 snow can change the weather your will 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.799
 because it's kind of really 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.780
 superior who has this power and also 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.689
 that the missiles do not affect it they throw it 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.030
 but they do not kill it as a metaphor if 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.130
 we can also appear UFOs because 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.750
 as we are alias, as I told you 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.119
 they leave are transported in UFOs so 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.500
 we can create we can create many 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.080
 many of these 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.840
 so that it travels badly in the military and 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.160
 see observe in your visuals obviously 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.900
 as we are or we do not go out we can take 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.420
 Christmas trees when we are given the 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.729
 you win and in this case you can stay 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.560
 there a little stuck but in the end it is 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:55.540
 which is what comes out we can also put 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.010
 posters and imagine yourself or imagination 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.200
 someone doing all this like in the 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.540
 military base we can also jump to 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.490
 impressive heights because today what 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.860
 interesting about this is that being a 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.979
 alien you can do these things because 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.170
 you have like control of reality 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.020
 alternate where you can take wrestlers 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.030
 like the one that's going to come out here watch pum 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.739
 although obviously seeing that I am a 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.989
 Alien then he's going to scare us and 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.530
 I guess you see, this has already scared you 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.530
 Listen 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.920
 and he decided to commit suicide was not 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.660
 it was necessary for me to do it but I jorge 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.550
 the impact of duty and I think if you 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.560
 you throw the roof before you 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.110
 take out the organs and make you suffer for 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.770
 better hours as well as faster 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.110
 and it broke down and it's just 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.740
 break good anyway I think that 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.690
 there is a military man dies and see how they are 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.700
 a few years we can put UFOs 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.710
 suspended in the nothing as well as in the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.690
 sky observe that they are there 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.300
 completely floating and are too many 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.560
 what a bad day to see this observe but 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.240
 Also good cup bathing suit 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.740
 for fear or if you know why the rate 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.480
 from the bathroom when something scares you 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.340
 I do not know what it's for here 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.220
 we have the limbo of bath rates 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.470
 serve in that serve imagine that 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.240
 imagine being trapped like in a 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.520
 reality as well as there are many fees 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.220
 of the bathroom floating and that you can not 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.080
 wake up do not stain imagine how 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.760
 we are or not sales we can change at sight 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.800
 of someone and that is what you can do 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.060
 being a someone like that is how they see the 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.310
 aliens because someone was wondering how 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.080
 see an alien as well as a person who happened 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.550
 my sergeant here with my powers of 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.950
 someone I'm going to plant some seedlings 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.050
 so that you can cultivate them when 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.800
 grow a little more and go crazy with 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.800
 his friends 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.910
 I am an alien 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.910
 I am an alien
