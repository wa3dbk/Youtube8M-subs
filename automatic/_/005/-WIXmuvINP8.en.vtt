00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
flavors watching together so what we are

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.040 
flavors watching together so what we are
doing<00:01:03.050> is<00:01:03.260> we<00:01:03.379> are<00:01:03.410> kind<00:01:03.980> of<00:01:04.100> using<00:01:04.489> that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
doing is we are kind of using that

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.990 
doing is we are kind of using that
flavor<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.040> complexity<00:01:07.550> what<00:01:07.850> is

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
flavor the the complexity what is

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.960 
flavor the the complexity what is
present<00:01:08.540> in<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:09.080> particular<00:01:09.770> brand<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.550> we

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
present in a particular brand and we

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.080 
present in a particular brand and we
will<00:01:11.060> try<00:01:11.300> to<00:01:11.330> blend<00:01:11.990> it<00:01:12.140> with<00:01:12.399> mixology<00:01:13.399> so

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
will try to blend it with mixology so

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.340 
will try to blend it with mixology so
and<00:01:14.300> this<00:01:14.479> time<00:01:14.660> it's<00:01:14.840> going<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.050> be<00:01:15.110> in<00:01:15.259> a

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
and this time it's going to be in a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.700 
and this time it's going to be in a
molecule<00:01:15.979> away<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.060> we'll<00:01:17.180> be<00:01:17.270> using<00:01:17.710> an

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
molecule away so we'll be using an

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:27.570 
molecule away so we'll be using an
amazing<00:01:19.190> vodka<00:01:19.490> Kariba<00:01:20.119> for<00:01:20.720> making<00:01:20.990> her
