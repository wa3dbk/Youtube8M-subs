00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.730
 good stable you are in the channel of 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.590
 world team 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.590
 I'm going to teach you how to do your mission 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.060
 in training and you learn them 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.670
 but there is a 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.670
 the tricks but if it's something that we 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.970
 they teach in the game and you see it only 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.970
 OK 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:31.270
 that you have the r1 of the games 4 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.740
 three hundred as much 360 as in teams 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.410
 when play 3 was the same 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.240
 that you keep the r1 and the two 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.460
 Directionals not only directional 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.010
 is any of either of the two 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.250
 depends on what you do, you make a 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.220
 submission or another and then move 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.530
 quickly 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.530
 in the direction of which is the left 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.920
 for example to the right you release the 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.510
 command if you look at the screen in 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.080
 moment I put the blue arrow you see 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.370
 you give the address to the left 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.780
 towards the address that says you can 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.030
 drop the stick does not need to 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.470
 keep up 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.470
 for example it would be to the left 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.840
 you can let go, leave the screen with 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.130
 put the indicator again towards the 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.079
 left 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.020
 you see that he sees the air pressure that up 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:30.079
 of 75 percent 80 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.399
 what do we do next this is your mission 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.399
 and it is already 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.689
 in moving the directional is not necessary 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.840
 keep the buttons because this 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.829
 for example it does not say it in the tutorial 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.619
 and you can get involved and make less 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:54.390
 fortune and in the end nothing comes out because 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.640
 It's very simple but you have to know 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.280
 the kids I hope today without there 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.460
