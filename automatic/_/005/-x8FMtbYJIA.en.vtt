 the tournament at the end is very cool 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.160
 It's also the third time I've been here. 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.739
 I always go out thinking about the next 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.769
 It's a pleasure to meet denny chin friends. 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.450

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.299
 cool I had with the fifth was 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.959
 I also feel the people here are very 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.959
 good people 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.890
 and we have to remember the main prize 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:17.489
 that at the end of the clinic we are going to have a vacancy 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.500
 we raffle a spot for the cruise that 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.599
 we do it once a year and it's a 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.319
 clinic on the high seas to this show 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:28.290
 not if you see here you will compete 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.420
 but in a draw but burn a clinic 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:36.930
 on the high seas but that burns a guy plays 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:41.730
 and tennis on the high seas outside and beauty right 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:44.099
 So it's serious that you can participate. 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.209
 You'll be there, you should be more at the 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.900

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.900

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.030

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.160
