00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
this deck has well I think they're all

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.920 
this deck has well I think they're all
five<00:00:44.830> plies<00:00:45.190> it's<00:00:45.820> got<00:00:46.030> a<00:00:46.060> red<00:00:46.330> middle<00:00:46.690> ply

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
five plies it's got a red middle ply

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.240 
five plies it's got a red middle ply
into<00:00:47.800> brown<00:00:48.760> ones<00:00:49.420> also<00:00:50.170> which<00:00:50.890> is<00:00:51.040> pretty

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
into brown ones also which is pretty

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.200 
into brown ones also which is pretty
cool<00:00:51.490> on<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:52.540> sanding<00:00:53.020> is<00:00:53.200> really<00:00:53.470> nice<00:00:53.680> as

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
cool on the sanding is really nice as

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.740 
cool on the sanding is really nice as
you<00:00:55.210> can<00:00:55.240> see<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.640> sides<00:01:01.120> are<00:01:01.300> all<00:01:01.330> even

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
you can see it's the sides are all even

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.690 
you can see it's the sides are all even
their<00:01:02.440> nose<00:01:02.620> and<00:01:02.890> tail<00:01:03.100> are<00:01:03.400> good

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.319 

the<00:01:07.479> size<00:01:07.899> is<00:01:08.729> compared<00:01:09.729> to<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:09.850> Berlin<00:01:10.149> one

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
the size is compared to a Berlin one

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.340 
the size is compared to a Berlin one
it's<00:01:10.509> pretty<00:01:11.259> much<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.890> same<00:01:11.920> I'd<00:01:12.850> say<00:01:13.350> maybe

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
it's pretty much the same I'd say maybe

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.340 
it's pretty much the same I'd say maybe
a<00:01:14.499> tiny<00:01:14.859> bit<00:01:15.009> shorter<00:01:15.929> but<00:01:16.929> just<00:01:17.259> barely<00:01:17.590> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
a tiny bit shorter but just barely and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.889 
a tiny bit shorter but just barely and
the<00:01:20.350> lacquer<00:01:20.590> is<00:01:20.859> pretty<00:01:21.130> shiny

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.120 

it's<00:01:24.909> not<00:01:25.909> as<00:01:26.149> much<00:01:26.840> as<00:01:27.049> a<00:01:27.079> Berlin<00:01:27.500> would<00:01:27.649> but

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
it's not as much as a Berlin would but

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.789 
it's not as much as a Berlin would but
it's<00:01:28.310> very<00:01:28.490> close<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.409> might<00:01:30.409> be<00:01:30.560> a<00:01:30.590> little

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
it's very close and might be a little

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.580 
it's very close and might be a little
better<00:01:30.890> because<00:01:31.130> Berlin<00:01:31.700> ones<00:01:31.880> are<00:01:32.000> kind<00:01:32.179> of

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
better because Berlin ones are kind of

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.200 
better because Berlin ones are kind of
ridiculously<00:01:33.590> shiny<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.729> I<00:01:34.759> think<00:01:35.030> these<00:01:35.149> are

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
ridiculously shiny so I think these are

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.169 
ridiculously shiny so I think these are
basically<00:01:35.810> perfect<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.069> just<00:01:37.280> as<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:37.939> can<00:01:38.060> see

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
basically perfect so just as you can see

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.219 
basically perfect so just as you can see
the<00:01:38.299> shape<00:01:38.539> is<00:01:38.780> really<00:01:38.990> nice<00:01:40.689> mellow<00:01:41.689> concave

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
the shape is really nice mellow concave

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.249 
the shape is really nice mellow concave
and<00:01:43.119> just<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.209> perfect<00:01:44.630> amount<00:01:44.840> of<00:01:44.990> steepness

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
and just a perfect amount of steepness

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:52.630 
and just a perfect amount of steepness
on<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.740> nose<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.130> tail<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:47.590> pretty<00:01:48.590> solid<00:01:51.280> so

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
on the nose and tail and pretty solid so

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.760 
on the nose and tail and pretty solid so
oh<00:01:52.670> yeah<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:53.539> all<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.109> holes<00:01:54.560> are

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
oh yeah and all the the holes are

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.440 
oh yeah and all the the holes are
drilled<00:01:54.920> really<00:01:55.280> well<00:01:55.399> I<00:01:55.429> got<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.909> trucks<00:01:56.299> on

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
drilled really well I got the trucks on

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.240 
drilled really well I got the trucks on
very<00:01:56.720> easily<00:01:56.929> so<00:01:57.920> it's<00:01:58.099> pretty<00:01:58.369> much<00:01:58.489> perfect

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
very easily so it's pretty much perfect

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.300 
very easily so it's pretty much perfect
and<00:02:01.840> I<00:02:02.840> don't<00:02:02.899> really<00:02:03.200> know<00:02:03.860> there's<00:02:04.130> not

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
and I don't really know there's not

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.319
