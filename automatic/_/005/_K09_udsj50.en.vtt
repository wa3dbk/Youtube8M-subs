00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
this video and I noticed the one that

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.290 
this video and I noticed the one that
did<00:04:54.080> not<00:04:54.260> moisturize<00:04:54.950> well<00:04:55.460> I<00:04:55.640> did<00:04:55.940> but<00:04:56.120> like

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
did not moisturize well I did but like

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.750 
did not moisturize well I did but like
not<00:04:56.540> really<00:04:57.050> was<00:04:57.350> the<00:04:57.530> pigmented<00:04:58.100> shades<00:04:58.430> and

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
not really was the pigmented shades and

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.270 
not really was the pigmented shades and
I'm<00:04:59.270> not<00:04:59.510> sure<00:04:59.750> what<00:05:00.050> it<00:05:00.140> is<00:05:00.320> about<00:05:00.560> pigmented

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
I'm not sure what it is about pigmented

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.370 
I'm not sure what it is about pigmented
shades<00:05:01.610> maybe<00:05:02.000> it's<00:05:02.180> because<00:05:02.540> of<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:02.750> dyes<00:05:03.020> in

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
shades maybe it's because of the dyes in

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.210 
shades maybe it's because of the dyes in
it<00:05:03.560> that<00:05:03.800> makes<00:05:04.040> it<00:05:04.340> like<00:05:05.410> not<00:05:06.410> mooster<00:05:06.890> izing
