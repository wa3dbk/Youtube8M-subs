00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
dying so a little bit more of a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.350 
dying so a little bit more of a
strategic<00:02:49.530> part<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.520> it<00:02:50.670> endless<00:02:51.000> or<00:02:51.180> does

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
strategic part so is it endless or does

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.510

it<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.900> there<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.200> time<00:02:52.440> limit<00:02:52.740> or<00:02:52.800> just<00:02:52.950> just<00:02:53.100> go

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
it is there a time limit or just just go

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.100 
it is there a time limit or just just go
until<00:02:53.850> someone<00:02:54.150> dies<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.840> think<00:02:54.960> the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
until someone dies so I think the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.510 
until someone dies so I think the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
default ten time limit is about ten

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.160 
default ten time limit is about ten
minutes<00:02:56.640> but<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.360> does<00:02:57.570> seem<00:02:57.600> pretty<00:02:57.960> that's

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170
