00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
recommend this stuff okay now today I've

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.530 
recommend this stuff okay now today I've
already<00:03:13.409> laid<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.620> flashing<00:03:14.579> back<00:03:14.730> in<00:03:15.000> she's

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
already laid the flashing back in she's

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.940 
already laid the flashing back in she's
going<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.780> use<00:03:15.959> some<00:03:16.139> new<00:03:16.260> aluminum<00:03:16.709> flashing

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
going to use some new aluminum flashing

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.259 
going to use some new aluminum flashing
but<00:03:17.280> then<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.519> took<00:03:17.639> a<00:03:17.790> look<00:03:17.940> at<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.150> old

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
but then I took a look at the old

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.720 
but then I took a look at the old
flashing<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.019> it's<00:03:19.109> actually<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.730> steel

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
flashing and it's actually a steel

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.720 
flashing and it's actually a steel
galvanized<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:22.019> it's<00:03:22.319> in<00:03:22.530> great<00:03:22.769> shape<00:03:22.829> so<00:03:23.370> I

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
galvanized and it's in great shape so I

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.750 
galvanized and it's in great shape so I
put<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.030> back<00:03:24.150> up<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:25.230> as<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.709> can<00:03:25.889> see<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.430> is

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
put it back up and as you can see it is

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.710 
put it back up and as you can see it is
over<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:28.709> membrane<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:30.060> there<00:03:30.209> is<00:03:30.299> no<00:03:30.480> way

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
over the membrane so there is no way

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.240 
over the membrane so there is no way
that<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.019> water<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.379> going<00:03:31.409> to<00:03:31.560> get<00:03:31.709> in<00:03:31.859> behind

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
that the water is going to get in behind

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.030 
that the water is going to get in behind
here<00:03:32.519> into<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.420> wall<00:03:33.629> at<00:03:34.500> least<00:03:34.709> not<00:03:34.859> from

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
here into the wall at least not from

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.099 
here into the wall at least not from
here<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:36.389> start<00:03:36.750> with<00:03:36.810> getting<00:03:37.049> the

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
here so you start with getting the

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:52.630 
here so you start with getting the
shingles<00:03:37.530> put<00:03:37.859> down<00:03:38.099> right<00:03:38.400> now

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.770 

and<00:03:53.640> my<00:03:53.819> bottom<00:03:54.239> shingle<00:03:54.690> in<00:03:54.840> place<00:03:55.310> so<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:56.340> can

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
and my bottom shingle in place so I can

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.750 
and my bottom shingle in place so I can
push<00:03:57.780> this<00:03:58.020> down<00:03:58.230> over<00:03:58.590> makes<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.310> nice<00:03:59.520> tight

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
push this down over makes a nice tight

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.630 
push this down over makes a nice tight
seal<00:04:00.450> over<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.959> top<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.319> it<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.680> don't<00:04:02.190> waste

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
seal over the top of it so I don't waste

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.340 
seal over the top of it so I don't waste
a<00:04:02.850> bunch<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.150> shingles<00:04:03.540> cutting<00:04:03.870> them<00:04:03.959> up

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
a bunch of shingles cutting them up

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.020 
a bunch of shingles cutting them up
I<00:04:04.380> made<00:04:04.739> this<00:04:04.890> pattern<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.640> fits<00:04:05.880> around

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
I made this pattern that fits around

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.050 
I made this pattern that fits around
this<00:04:07.010> fits<00:04:08.010> around<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> top<00:04:08.550> of<00:04:08.700> this<00:04:08.760> vent

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
this fits around the top of this vent

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.970 
this fits around the top of this vent
seal<00:04:09.480> I'll<00:04:09.989> use<00:04:10.230> this<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.500> cut<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:10.890> shingle

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
seal I'll use this to cut the shingle

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.479 
seal I'll use this to cut the shingle
hey<00:04:13.980> that's<00:04:14.190> it

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489
