00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
I don't worry about moving it around the

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.710 
I don't worry about moving it around the
reason<00:01:54.549> why<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:54.700> put<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:55.000> two<00:01:55.149> stick<00:01:55.450> stands

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
reason why you put the two stick stands

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.630 
reason why you put the two stick stands
because<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:56.140> won't<00:01:56.289> burn<00:01:56.679> you<00:01:57.250> know<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.460> pie

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
because it won't burn you know the pie

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.100 
because it won't burn you know the pie
is<00:01:57.700> so<00:01:57.970> hot<00:01:58.149> I<00:01:58.179> would<00:01:58.329> burn<00:01:58.600> through<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.869> soles

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
is so hot I would burn through the soles

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.230 
is so hot I would burn through the soles
