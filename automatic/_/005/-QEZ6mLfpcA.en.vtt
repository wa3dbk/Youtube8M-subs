00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
because I attached my pouch at the top

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.059 
because I attached my pouch at the top

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
without a way to detach it so I have to

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.039 
without a way to detach it so I have to
loop<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.609> through<00:02:28.639> my<00:02:29.060> body<00:02:29.329> in<00:02:29.629> order<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.900> get

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
the top on it was the biggest fail for

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.750 
the top on it was the biggest fail for
this<00:02:32.659> outfit

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.210 

I<00:02:39.840> had<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.870> lot<00:02:41.080> of<00:02:41.110> leftover<00:02:41.379> red<00:02:41.860> cotton

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
I had a lot of leftover red cotton

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.949 
I had a lot of leftover red cotton
fabric<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.879> ended<00:02:43.060> up<00:02:43.090> using<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.510> for<00:02:43.870> my

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
fabric and ended up using that for my

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.350 
fabric and ended up using that for my
pleated<00:02:44.349> skirt<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:45.280> definitely<00:02:45.760> isn't<00:02:46.000> the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
pleated skirt it definitely isn't the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.179 
pleated skirt it definitely isn't the
ideal<00:02:46.659> traffic<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.260> use<00:02:47.439> when<00:02:47.620> making<00:02:47.769> a

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
ideal traffic to use when making a

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:49.619 
ideal traffic to use when making a
pleated<00:02:48.519> skirt<00:02:48.549> but<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.150> ended<00:02:49.329> up<00:02:49.360> working

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
pleated skirt but it ended up working

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.110 
pleated skirt but it ended up working
okay<00:02:50.319> in<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.620> end<00:02:50.799> there<00:02:51.760> are<00:02:51.819> a<00:02:51.909> lot<00:02:52.090> of

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
okay in the end there are a lot of

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.729

feel<00:02:55.780> comfortable<00:02:55.989> in<00:02:56.349> I<00:02:56.849> guess<00:02:57.849> I<00:02:58.000> could<00:02:58.120> have

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
feel comfortable in I guess I could have

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.050 
feel comfortable in I guess I could have
attached<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.870> belt<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.890> skirt<00:03:00.190> but<00:03:00.670> I

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
attached the belt to the skirt but I

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.390 
attached the belt to the skirt but I
don't<00:03:02.049> really<00:03:02.200> think<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.620> far<00:03:02.860> ahead

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
don't really think that far ahead

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.259 
don't really think that far ahead
so<00:03:03.579> doesn't<00:03:04.360> work<00:03:04.659> out<00:03:04.840> for<00:03:05.019> me<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:07.000> same

the things that require maximum
stretching<00:03:45.580> a<00:03:46.030> high<00:03:46.780> quality<00:03:47.049> pictured<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
stretching a high quality pictured the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.140 
stretching a high quality pictured the
design<00:03:47.920> that<00:03:48.160> goes<00:03:48.370> on<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.670> legging<00:03:49.000> was

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
design that goes on the legging was

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.030 
design that goes on the legging was
really<00:03:49.510> difficult<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:50.049> find<00:03:50.260> sight<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.680> use<00:03:50.860> my

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
really difficult to find sight to use my

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.119 
really difficult to find sight to use my
imagination<00:03:51.209> for<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.299> most<00:03:52.510> part<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.739> design

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
imagination for the most part the design

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.339 
imagination for the most part the design
looks<00:03:54.340> much<00:03:54.760> better<00:03:55.030> in<00:03:55.239> pixels<00:03:55.660> on<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.810> person

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
looks much better in pixels on a person

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.440 
looks much better in pixels on a person
but<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.040> think<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.580> turned<00:03:57.790> out<00:03:57.940> fairly<00:03:58.299> well

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
but I think it turned out fairly well

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.910 
but I think it turned out fairly well
overall<00:03:59.610> and<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:01.569> staff<00:04:01.900> yeah<00:04:02.380> maybe<00:04:02.709> the

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
overall and the staff yeah maybe the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.890 
overall and the staff yeah maybe the
staff<00:04:03.190> was<00:04:03.400> such<00:04:03.610> a<00:04:03.640> workout<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.510> used<00:04:04.720> an

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
staff was such a workout I used an

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.509 
staff was such a workout I used an
insulation<00:04:05.260> foam<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:05.860> carved<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.250> with<00:04:06.400> an

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
insulation foam and carved it with an

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.030 
insulation foam and carved it with an
extra<00:04:06.880> bread<00:04:07.060> knife<00:04:07.269> or<00:04:07.510> head<00:04:07.630> lying<00:04:07.810> around

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
extra bread knife or head lying around

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.559 
extra bread knife or head lying around
after<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.280> was<00:04:09.400> happy<00:04:09.730> with<00:04:09.849> the<00:04:09.910> shape<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.360> used

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
after I was happy with the shape I used

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.960 
after I was happy with the shape I used
paper<00:04:10.780> mache<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.470> give<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.650> definition<00:04:12.129> then<00:04:12.910> I

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
paper mache to give a definition then I

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.030 
paper mache to give a definition then I
use<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.180> combination<00:04:13.569> of<00:04:13.930> newspaper<00:04:14.470> and<00:04:14.650> paper

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
use a combination of newspaper and paper

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.580 
use a combination of newspaper and paper
towels<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.549> so<00:04:15.670> texture<00:04:16.000> works<00:04:16.209> so<00:04:16.540> well<00:04:16.810> when

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
towels and so texture works so well when

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.990 
towels and so texture works so well when
you<00:04:17.709> paste<00:04:18.010> it<00:04:18.280> on<00:04:18.400> you<00:04:18.549> kind<00:04:18.760> of<00:04:18.789> want<00:04:18.970> to

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
you paste it on you kind of want to

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.879 
you paste it on you kind of want to
wrinkle<00:04:19.359> it<00:04:19.600> up<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:19.930> make<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:20.079> chunky<00:04:20.410> so<00:04:20.799> it

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
wrinkle it up and make it chunky so it

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.190 
wrinkle it up and make it chunky so it
imitates<00:04:21.370> texture<00:04:21.940> of<00:04:22.210> actual<00:04:22.750> wood

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
imitates texture of actual wood

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.529
