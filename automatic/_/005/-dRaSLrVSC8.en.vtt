00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.460 
they're actually different thread
pitches<00:04:34.620> right<00:04:35.430> so<00:04:36.150> comes<00:04:36.720> with<00:04:36.870> tuning<00:04:37.169> bolts

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
pitches right so comes with tuning bolts

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.760 
pitches right so comes with tuning bolts
and<00:04:37.620> two<00:04:37.740> new<00:04:37.890> flat<00:04:38.700> washers<00:04:39.410> just<00:04:40.410> remove

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
and two new flat washers just remove

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.210 
and two new flat washers just remove
those<00:04:40.950> and<00:04:42.110> these<00:04:43.110> shocks<00:04:43.470> are<00:04:43.650> actually<00:04:44.070> the

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
those and these shocks are actually the

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.350 
those and these shocks are actually the
club<00:04:44.850> sport<00:04:45.210> version<00:04:45.650> which<00:04:46.650> is<00:04:47.360> different

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
club sport version which is different

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.850 
club sport version which is different
from<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.570> v3<00:04:48.930> because<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.470> comes<00:04:49.620> with<00:04:49.710> the

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
from the v3 because it comes with the

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.290 
from the v3 because it comes with the
new<00:04:50.040> top<00:04:50.669> hats

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
new top hats

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.560 
new top hats
I<00:04:51.710> used<00:04:52.729> pretty<00:04:53.729> much<00:04:53.820> quite<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.360> few

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
I used pretty much quite a few

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.960 
I used pretty much quite a few
suspension<00:04:55.050> systems<00:04:55.380> on<00:04:55.500> them<00:04:55.650> on<00:04:56.130> a<00:04:56.220> market<00:04:56.700> I

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
suspension systems on them on a market I

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.290 
suspension systems on them on a market I
think<00:04:57.470> personally<00:04:58.470> I<00:04:58.680> think<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.490> kW<00:05:00.000> rides

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
think personally I think the kW rides

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.240 
think personally I think the kW rides
the<00:05:00.479> best<00:05:00.690> as<00:05:00.930> far<00:05:01.169> as<00:05:01.229> street<00:05:01.470> driving<00:05:01.680> it

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
the best as far as street driving it

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.400 
the best as far as street driving it
actually<00:05:03.060> I<00:05:03.120> think<00:05:03.180> rides<00:05:03.600> better<00:05:03.810> than<00:05:03.990> stock

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
actually I think rides better than stock

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.159 
actually I think rides better than stock
which<00:05:04.710> is<00:05:04.860> pretty<00:05:05.430> scary

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
which is pretty scary

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.010 
which is pretty scary
you're<00:05:07.169> constantly<00:05:07.890> and<00:05:08.550> it<00:05:08.640> sounds<00:05:08.970> too<00:05:09.300> too

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
you're constantly and it sounds too too

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.469 
you're constantly and it sounds too too
good<00:05:10.200> to<00:05:10.320> be<00:05:10.410> true<00:05:10.440> right<00:05:10.830> but<00:05:11.280> yeah<00:05:12.060> it<00:05:12.240> almost

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
good to be true right but yeah it almost

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.840 
good to be true right but yeah it almost
sounds<00:05:12.780> too<00:05:12.900> good<00:05:12.930> to<00:05:13.169> be<00:05:13.290> true<00:05:13.380> but<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:14.010> is<00:05:14.160> it

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
sounds too good to be true but it is it

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.969 
sounds too good to be true but it is it
just<00:05:15.120> rides<00:05:15.360> impeccably<00:05:16.050> well<00:05:16.140> it's<00:05:16.650> it's

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
just rides impeccably well it's it's

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.159 
just rides impeccably well it's it's
incredible<00:05:17.550> so<00:05:18.450> we're<00:05:18.600> going<00:05:18.690> to<00:05:18.780> push<00:05:18.990> the

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
incredible so we're going to push the

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.240 
incredible so we're going to push the
shock<00:05:19.380> through<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:20.100> put<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:21.020> two<00:05:22.020> bolts<00:05:23.010> on

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
shock through and put the two bolts on

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.890 
shock through and put the two bolts on
top<00:05:23.900> with<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:25.020> washer

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
top with the washer

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.310 
top with the washer
just<00:05:27.900> so<00:05:28.020> it<00:05:28.140> holds<00:05:28.320> it<00:05:28.470> in<00:05:28.650> place<00:05:29.990> it'll<00:05:30.990> come

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
just so it holds it in place it'll come

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.630 
just so it holds it in place it'll come
back<00:05:31.530> to<00:05:31.710> this<00:05:31.830> later<00:05:32.790> to<00:05:33.450> tighten<00:05:34.140> it<00:05:34.260> down<00:05:34.640> so

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
back to this later to tighten it down so

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.900 
back to this later to tighten it down so
we're<00:05:36.300> going<00:05:36.390> to<00:05:36.480> lift<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.780> suspension<00:05:36.990> up<00:05:37.530> a

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
we're going to lift the suspension up a

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.130 
we're going to lift the suspension up a
little<00:05:38.910> bit<00:05:39.950> and<00:05:40.950> put<00:05:41.280> this<00:05:41.460> shop<00:05:42.330> bolt<00:05:42.600> on<00:05:42.930> the

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
little bit and put this shop bolt on the

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.940 
little bit and put this shop bolt on the
bottom<00:05:43.170> three

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
bottom three

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.850 
bottom three
let's<00:05:44.760> go<00:05:45.200> providing<00:05:46.200> some<00:05:46.320> resistance

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
let's go providing some resistance

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.220 
let's go providing some resistance
because<00:05:47.310> effective<00:05:48.000> is<00:05:48.450> still<00:05:48.720> connected<00:05:48.990> to

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
because effective is still connected to

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.680 
because effective is still connected to
sway<00:05:49.620> bar<00:05:49.890> in<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.160> other<00:05:50.400> side<00:05:51.330> is<00:05:51.420> actually

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
sway bar in the other side is actually

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
sway bar in the other side is actually
pushing<00:05:51.930> it<00:05:52.170> down<00:05:53.660> but<00:05:54.660> it's<00:05:54.990> not<00:05:55.080> backing<00:05:55.440> me

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
pushing it down but it's not backing me

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.710 
pushing it down but it's not backing me
so<00:05:55.890> do<00:05:56.730> that<00:05:57.260> there<00:05:58.260> you<00:05:58.290> go<00:05:59.360> Wow<00:06:00.420> that's

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
so do that there you go Wow that's

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.070 
so do that there you go Wow that's
awfully<00:06:01.140> long<00:06:01.290> bolt<00:06:02.720> and<00:06:03.720> then<00:06:03.840> we're<00:06:03.960> going

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
awfully long bolt and then we're going

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.630 
awfully long bolt and then we're going
to<00:06:04.110> use<00:06:04.260> that<00:06:04.380> 12<00:06:04.650> millimeter<00:06:05.100> nut<00:06:05.340> on<00:06:05.550> the

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
to use that 12 millimeter nut on the

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.350 
to use that 12 millimeter nut on the
backside<00:06:05.820> of<00:06:06.060> this<00:06:07.760> brake<00:06:08.760> line<00:06:08.970> bolt<00:06:09.210> oh

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
backside of this brake line bolt oh
