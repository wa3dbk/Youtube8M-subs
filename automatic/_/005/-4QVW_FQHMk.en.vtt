off<00:00:05.910> as<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.089> joke<00:00:06.390> here<00:00:07.350> at<00:00:07.470> work<00:00:07.649> someone<00:00:07.980> was

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
off as a joke here at work someone was

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.160 
off as a joke here at work someone was
suggesting<00:00:08.580> that<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.760> should<00:00:09.030> make<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.690> 9-volt

nine volts and simply had a seven

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
segment display that would light up with

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.820

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350

unfortunately<00:00:25.500> because<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.130> displays<00:00:26.430> are

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
unfortunately because the displays are

could do a little bit better than that

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.780 
could do a little bit better than that

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790

segment<00:00:49.829> display<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:51.539> obviously<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> little

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
segment display is is obviously a little

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.170 
segment display is is obviously a little
bit<00:00:52.289> more<00:00:52.860> complicated<00:00:53.190> than<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.760> would<00:00:53.940> like

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
bit more complicated than I would like

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.650 
bit more complicated than I would like
to<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.510> done<00:00:54.750> all<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.260> discrete<00:00:55.680> logic<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
to have done all in discrete logic the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.660 
to have done all in discrete logic the
and<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.770> easiest<00:00:59.010> way<00:00:59.160> obviously<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.609> is

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and the easiest way obviously to do is

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.099 
and the easiest way obviously to do is
to<00:00:59.760> just<00:00:59.910> use<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.090> microcontroller<00:01:00.750> or

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
to just use a microcontroller or

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.950 
to just use a microcontroller or
something<00:01:01.890> smarter<00:01:02.609> than<00:01:02.760> doing<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.210> discrete

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
something smarter than doing it discrete

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.230 
something smarter than doing it discrete
but<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.500> took<00:01:05.100> upon<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.549> challenge<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.970> doing

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
but I took upon the challenge of doing

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.570 
but I took upon the challenge of doing
it<00:01:06.330> discrete<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.290> made<00:01:07.650> voltage<00:01:08.040> detectors

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
it discrete so I made voltage detectors

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.270 
it discrete so I made voltage detectors
super<00:01:09.150> primitive<00:01:09.830> they're<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.070> Zener

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
super primitive they're just a Zener

super primitive they're just a Zener

for<00:01:47.579> all<00:01:47.790> voltages<00:01:48.180> above<00:01:48.450> 8<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.079> not<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.799> for

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
for all voltages above 8 but not on for

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.670 
for all voltages above 8 but not on for
voltages<00:01:50.340> above<00:01:50.460> 9<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.750> that's<00:01:52.049> pretty<00:01:52.439> easy

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
voltages above 9 so that's pretty easy

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.720 
voltages above 9 so that's pretty easy
to<00:01:52.920> do<00:01:53.070> in

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
to do in

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.700 
to do in
in<00:01:54.060> some<00:01:54.330> analog<00:01:54.630> electronics<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.290> made<00:01:55.470> three

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
in some analog electronics I made three

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.410 
in some analog electronics I made three
voltage<00:01:56.010> detectors<00:01:56.490> one<00:01:56.730> for<00:01:56.970> greater<00:01:57.240> than

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
voltage detectors one for greater than

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.120 
voltage detectors one for greater than
seminole<00:01:57.930> greater<00:01:58.140> volts<00:01:58.500> eight<00:01:58.770> or<00:01:58.950> greater

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
seminole greater volts eight or greater

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.460 
seminole greater volts eight or greater
volts<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.610> nine<00:01:59.850> or<00:02:00.000> greater<00:02:00.180> volts<00:02:00.510> and<00:02:00.690> then

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
volts and nine or greater volts and then

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.900 
volts and nine or greater volts and then
I<00:02:01.500> ran<00:02:01.830> them<00:02:01.980> through<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.160> decode<00:02:02.490> tree<00:02:02.760> which

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
I ran them through the decode tree which

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.150 
I ran them through the decode tree which
looks<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.150> bit<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.330> this<00:02:03.660> I<00:02:03.930> probably<00:02:04.800> could

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
looks a bit like this I probably could

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.380 
looks a bit like this I probably could
have<00:02:05.190> done<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.490> logic<00:02:05.790> here<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:06.030> little<00:02:06.210> bit

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
have done the logic here a little bit

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.030 
have done the logic here a little bit
better<00:02:07.940> but<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.330> any<00:02:09.480> case<00:02:09.540> I<00:02:10.020> probably<00:02:10.770> should

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
better but in any case I probably should

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.770 
better but in any case I probably should
have<00:02:11.130> done<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.370> altogether<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:12.120> seven<00:02:12.690> or

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
have done is altogether the seven or

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.930 
have done is altogether the seven or
eight<00:02:12.900> volt<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.380> use<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.040> negated<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.760> turn

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
eight volt and use that negated to turn

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.530 
eight volt and use that negated to turn
off<00:02:15.650> DN<00:02:16.650> e<00:02:16.770> but<00:02:17.070> alas<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.000> did<00:02:18.030> not<00:02:18.270> do<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.510> that

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
off DN e but alas I did not do it that

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.120 
off DN e but alas I did not do it that
way<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> way<00:02:19.680> it's<00:02:19.800> currently

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
way and this is the way it's currently

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.490 
way and this is the way it's currently
implemented<00:02:20.930> okay<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:21.990> let's<00:02:22.230> look<00:02:22.320> at<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
implemented okay so let's look at the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.250 
implemented okay so let's look at the
practical<00:02:22.860> circuit<00:02:23.420> still<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.540> solderless

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
practical circuit still on a solderless

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.050 
practical circuit still on a solderless
breadboard<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:25.950> will<00:02:26.550> actually<00:02:26.760> probably

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
breadboard I will actually probably

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.240 
breadboard I will actually probably
build<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.660> one<00:02:27.870> onto<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.770> more<00:02:28.980> permanent

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
build this one onto a more permanent

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.610 
build this one onto a more permanent
form<00:02:29.670> because<00:02:30.570> it's<00:02:30.720> such<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.870> gag<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.350> it's

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
form because it's such a gag and it's

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.730 
form because it's such a gag and it's
actually<00:02:32.040> useful<00:02:33.740> so<00:02:34.740> here<00:02:35.550> is<00:02:35.700> my<00:02:36.660> LED<00:02:37.320> tester

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
actually useful so here is my LED tester

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.770 
actually useful so here is my LED tester
which<00:02:38.520> is<00:02:38.700> he<00:02:39.000> had<00:02:39.090> another<00:02:39.300> nine<00:02:39.540> volt

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
which is he had another nine volt

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.570 
which is he had another nine volt
battery<00:02:40.050> topper<00:02:40.380> it's<00:02:41.130> just<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.340> bunch<00:02:41.490> of

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
battery topper it's just a bunch of

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.390 
battery topper it's just a bunch of
resistors<00:02:41.820> that<00:02:42.270> set<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.680> know<00:02:43.770> currents<00:02:44.190> for

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
resistors that set you know currents for

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.370 
resistors that set you know currents for
a<00:02:44.430> average<00:02:45.240> kind<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.570> LED<00:02:45.870> voltage<00:02:46.200> drop<00:02:46.350> of

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
a average kind of LED voltage drop of

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.640 
a average kind of LED voltage drop of
around<00:02:46.710> 2.5<00:02:47.190> volts<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.880> 50<00:02:48.360> 2020<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.500> use

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
around 2.5 volts to 50 2020 and I use

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.470 
around 2.5 volts to 50 2020 and I use
the<00:02:49.800> 20<00:02:50.070> s<00:02:50.130> together<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.640> can<00:02:50.850> brightness

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
the 20 s together so I can brightness

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.080 
the 20 s together so I can brightness
match<00:02:51.690> or<00:02:51.870> color<00:02:52.050> match<00:02:52.260> LEDs<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.890> then<00:02:53.640> you

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
match or color match LEDs and then you

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.940 
match or color match LEDs and then you
know<00:02:54.180> 10<00:02:54.450> 5<00:02:55.430> 2<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.730> 1<00:02:57.150> milliamp<00:02:57.870> that's<00:02:58.620> so

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
know 10 5 2 and 1 milliamp that's so

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.490 
know 10 5 2 and 1 milliamp that's so
it's<00:02:59.220> useful<00:02:59.400> yeah<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.060> also<00:03:00.300> if<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.690> lazy<00:03:01.230> or

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
it's useful yeah and also if you lazy or

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.770 
it's useful yeah and also if you lazy or
you<00:03:01.860> have<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.160> LED<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.850> isn't<00:03:03.209> really<00:03:03.480> marked

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
you have a LED that isn't really marked

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.030 
you have a LED that isn't really marked
very<00:03:03.900> well<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.230> can<00:03:04.260> just<00:03:04.530> shove<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.800> in<00:03:04.890> there

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
very well you can just shove it in there

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.440 
very well you can just shove it in there
and<00:03:05.190> turn<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.550> around<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:06.030> get<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.330> in<00:03:06.390> the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
and turn it around to get it in the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.760 
and turn it around to get it in the
right<00:03:06.600> polarity<00:03:07.940> again<00:03:08.940> trivial<00:03:09.450> project<00:03:09.870> not

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
right polarity again trivial project not

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.830 
right polarity again trivial project not
really<00:03:11.040> worth<00:03:11.190> talking<00:03:11.550> about<00:03:11.730> but<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.690> made

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
really worth talking about but I made

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.020 
really worth talking about but I made
this<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.989> long<00:03:13.140> time<00:03:13.170> ago<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.800> I've<00:03:13.920> used<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.820> on

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
this a long time ago and I've used it on

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.790 
this a long time ago and I've used it on
a<00:03:15.420> regular<00:03:15.810> basis<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.230> just<00:03:16.410> leave<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.590> here<00:03:16.680> on

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
a regular basis I just leave it here on

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.949 
a regular basis I just leave it here on
the<00:03:16.890> bench<00:03:17.010> with<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.250> 9-volt<00:03:17.550> battery<00:03:17.820> on<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:17.970> ok

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
the bench with a 9-volt battery on it ok

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.530 
the bench with a 9-volt battery on it ok
so<00:03:19.530> yes<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.310> put<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.610> new<00:03:20.760> battery<00:03:21.060> in<00:03:21.090> recently

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
so yes I put the new battery in recently

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.750 
so yes I put the new battery in recently
and<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.959> should<00:03:22.140> be<00:03:22.230> pre-dawn<00:03:22.680> Cha<00:03:23.280> pretty

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
and it should be pre-dawn Cha pretty

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.740 
and it should be pre-dawn Cha pretty
done<00:03:23.940> alive<00:03:25.310> ok<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.670> yep<00:03:27.209> sure<00:03:27.480> enough<00:03:29.750> nine

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
done alive ok so yep sure enough nine

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.300 
done alive ok so yep sure enough nine
point<00:03:31.050> seven<00:03:31.200> volts<00:03:31.620> that's<00:03:31.709> actually<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.100> very

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
point seven volts that's actually a very

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.610 
point seven volts that's actually a very
fresh<00:03:32.700> 9-volt<00:03:33.120> battery<00:03:33.390> as<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.660> can<00:03:33.810> see<00:03:34.020> now

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
fresh 9-volt battery as you can see now

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.920 
fresh 9-volt battery as you can see now
display<00:03:34.950> says<00:03:35.190> 9<00:03:37.370> ok<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:39.180> here's<00:03:39.780> another

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
display says 9 ok so here's another

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.240 
display says 9 ok so here's another
random<00:03:40.230> battery<00:03:40.590> that's<00:03:40.770> been<00:03:40.890> sitting<00:03:41.220> on

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
random battery that's been sitting on

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.710 
random battery that's been sitting on
the<00:03:41.400> bench<00:03:41.430> I've<00:03:42.209> been<00:03:42.360> using<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.690> for

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
the bench I've been using it for

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.000 
the bench I've been using it for
everything<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:43.140> probably<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.500> bit<00:03:43.709> depleted

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
everything is probably a bit depleted

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.590 
everything is probably a bit depleted
eight<00:03:47.010> point<00:03:47.310> six<00:03:47.550> volts<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.330> isn't

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
eight point six volts so it isn't

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.270 
eight point six volts so it isn't
greater<00:03:48.989> than<00:03:49.170> nine<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:49.650> it's<00:03:49.800> saying<00:03:49.980> eight

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
greater than nine so it's saying eight

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.260 
greater than nine so it's saying eight
fair<00:03:51.060> enough

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.250 

we're<00:03:54.270> gonna<00:03:54.450> get<00:03:54.600> in<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.780> progressively

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
we're gonna get in the progressively

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.180 
we're gonna get in the progressively
more<00:03:55.500> dead<00:03:55.800> region<00:03:57.560> so<00:03:58.560> as<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.710> can<00:03:58.800> see<00:03:59.040> it's

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
more dead region so as you can see it's

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.470 
more dead region so as you can see it's
barely<00:03:59.580> lighting<00:04:00.240> up<00:04:00.360> seven<00:04:00.780> for<00:04:00.990> this<00:04:02.480> 7.07

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
barely lighting up seven for this 7.07

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.450 
barely lighting up seven for this 7.07
yeah<00:04:04.290> just<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.560> little<00:04:04.710> bit<00:04:04.800> below<00:04:04.920> seven<00:04:05.370> so

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
yeah just a little bit below seven so

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.190 
yeah just a little bit below seven so
it's<00:04:05.550> right<00:04:05.760> on<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:05.940> threshold<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.510> turning

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
it's right on the threshold of turning

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.660 
it's right on the threshold of turning
on<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.410> seven<00:04:08.480> and<00:04:09.590> we<00:04:10.590> have<00:04:10.770> some<00:04:11.220> profoundly

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
on the seven and we have some profoundly

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.640 
on the seven and we have some profoundly
dead<00:04:11.910> batteries<00:04:12.330> here<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:13.230> I<00:04:13.260> actually<00:04:13.410> had

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
dead batteries here that I actually had

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.990 
dead batteries here that I actually had
to<00:04:13.740> hook<00:04:13.830> two<00:04:14.040> of<00:04:14.130> them<00:04:14.220> up<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.520> get<00:04:14.790> enough

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
to hook two of them up to get enough

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.540 
to hook two of them up to get enough

novel<00:04:19.170> battery<00:04:19.530> it's<00:04:19.830> probably<00:04:20.400> pretty<00:04:20.820> sick

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
novel battery it's probably pretty sick

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.760 
novel battery it's probably pretty sick
and<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.360> shouldn't<00:04:21.660> use<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:22.020> so<00:04:22.290> that<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.620> top

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
and you shouldn't use it so that the top

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.070 
and you shouldn't use it so that the top
three<00:04:22.800> digits<00:04:23.280> worked<00:04:23.490> out<00:04:23.670> to<00:04:24.270> be<00:04:24.390> actually

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
three digits worked out to be actually

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.870 
three digits worked out to be actually
pretty<00:04:25.200> pretty<00:04:25.770> useful<00:04:26.160> in<00:04:26.280> terms<00:04:26.430> of<00:04:26.640> what's

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
pretty pretty useful in terms of what's

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.720 
pretty pretty useful in terms of what's
a<00:04:27.030> usable<00:04:27.930> battery<00:04:28.200> verse<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.730> excellent

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
a usable battery verse a excellent

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.850 
a usable battery verse a excellent
battery<00:04:30.860> okay<00:04:31.860> so<00:04:31.920> we'll<00:04:32.220> start<00:04:32.310> off<00:04:33.740> do<00:04:34.740> that

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
battery okay so we'll start off do that

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.920 
battery okay so we'll start off do that
again<00:04:35.130> we'll<00:04:35.790> let<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.240> battery<00:04:36.480> recover<00:04:36.810> for

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
again we'll let the battery recover for

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.500 
again we'll let the battery recover for
a<00:04:37.020> second<00:04:37.460> so<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.550> starts<00:04:38.850> off<00:04:38.940> at<00:04:39.090> nine<00:04:39.240> and

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
a second so it starts off at nine and

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.570 
a second so it starts off at nine and
then<00:04:39.600> rapidly<00:04:39.900> goes<00:04:40.500> through<00:04:40.830> eight<00:04:41.280> and

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
then rapidly goes through eight and

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.370 
then rapidly goes through eight and
drops<00:04:41.760> down<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.120> seven<00:04:42.450> so<00:04:42.750> two<00:04:42.840> batteries

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
drops down to seven so two batteries

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.920 
drops down to seven so two batteries
here<00:04:43.590> in<00:04:43.770> series<00:04:44.160> delivering<00:04:45.090> seven<00:04:45.690> point

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
here in series delivering seven point

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.210 
here in series delivering seven point
three<00:04:45.960> volts<00:04:46.470> so<00:04:46.620> they're<00:04:46.770> they're<00:04:47.190> pretty

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
three volts so they're they're pretty

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.110 
three volts so they're they're pretty
much<00:04:47.550> had<00:04:47.850> it<00:04:49.340> okay<00:04:50.340> let's<00:04:50.730> try<00:04:50.880> it<00:04:50.940> on<00:04:51.060> the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
much had it okay let's try it on the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.450 
much had it okay let's try it on the
power<00:04:51.270> supply<00:04:51.450> and<00:04:52.040> crank<00:04:53.040> up<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.340> voltage

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
power supply and crank up the voltage

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:05.909 
power supply and crank up the voltage
slowly

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.430 

okay<00:05:06.919> so<00:05:06.980> here<00:05:07.310> we're<00:05:07.430> at<00:05:07.550> six<00:05:07.910> point<00:05:08.440> two

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
okay so here we're at six point two

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.650 
okay so here we're at six point two
volts<00:05:09.470> and<00:05:10.190> it's<00:05:10.370> six<00:05:10.760> point<00:05:11.030> nine<00:05:11.090> volts<00:05:11.240> and

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
volts and it's six point nine volts and

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.340 
volts and it's six point nine volts and
it's<00:05:11.780> just<00:05:12.020> starting<00:05:12.230> to<00:05:12.410> turn<00:05:12.590> on<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:12.800> seven

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
it's just starting to turn on the seven

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.020 
it's just starting to turn on the seven
let's<00:05:15.350> go<00:05:15.680> up<00:05:15.830> a<00:05:15.919> little<00:05:16.070> bit<00:05:18.880> you<00:05:19.880> can<00:05:20.000> see

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
let's go up a little bit you can see

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.940 
let's go up a little bit you can see
that<00:05:20.180> transition<00:05:20.660> to<00:05:20.990> eight<00:05:21.200> is<00:05:21.500> just

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
that transition to eight is just

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.650 
that transition to eight is just
starting<00:05:22.400> there<00:05:22.639> around<00:05:22.880> seven<00:05:23.330> point<00:05:23.570> nine

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
starting there around seven point nine

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.520 
starting there around seven point nine
volts<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.800> it's<00:05:25.610> transitioned<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.210> eight

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
volts and it's transitioned to eight

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.050 
volts and it's transitioned to eight
pretty<00:05:27.530> much<00:05:27.830> completely<00:05:28.310> at<00:05:28.639> eight<00:05:28.790> point

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
pretty much completely at eight point

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.110 
pretty much completely at eight point
one<00:05:29.150> volts<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:30.650> then<00:05:31.520> we'll<00:05:31.639> dial<00:05:31.820> it<00:05:32.000> up<00:05:32.060> a

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
one volts and then we'll dial it up a

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.830 
one volts and then we'll dial it up a
bit<00:05:32.210> more<00:05:33.580> and<00:05:34.580> the<00:05:34.760> transition<00:05:35.270> to<00:05:35.300> nine<00:05:35.600> is

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
bit more and the transition to nine is

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.580 
bit more and the transition to nine is
much<00:05:35.990> more<00:05:36.169> abrupt

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
much more abrupt

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.440 
much more abrupt
that's<00:05:39.590> right<00:05:39.830> around<00:05:40.070> nines<00:05:40.580> almost<00:05:41.060> exactly

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
that's right around nines almost exactly

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.960 
that's right around nines almost exactly
I<00:05:41.750> just<00:05:42.560> lucked<00:05:42.770> out<00:05:42.950> that<00:05:43.280> the<00:05:43.430> resistor<00:05:43.790> days

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
I just lucked out that the resistor days

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.900 
I just lucked out that the resistor days
that<00:05:44.180> I<00:05:44.270> picked<00:05:44.570> for<00:05:45.020> tuning<00:05:45.740> the<00:05:45.910> busyness

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
that I picked for tuning the busyness

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.879 
that I picked for tuning the busyness
with<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.419> point<00:05:47.690> was<00:05:47.990> pretty<00:05:48.440> close<00:05:48.650> to<00:05:48.710> being

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
with the point was pretty close to being

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.219 
with the point was pretty close to being
spot-on

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
spot-on

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.010 
spot-on
okay<00:05:51.229> so<00:05:51.950> really<00:05:52.669> simple<00:05:52.970> project<00:05:53.419> kind<00:05:53.900> of

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
okay so really simple project kind of

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.640 
okay so really simple project kind of
stupid<00:05:54.380> but<00:05:54.590> also<00:05:55.330> yeah<00:05:56.330> pretty<00:05:56.780> humorous<00:05:57.290> and

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
stupid but also yeah pretty humorous and

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.320 
stupid but also yeah pretty humorous and
I<00:05:57.770> think<00:05:58.160> I<00:05:58.220> will<00:05:58.370> burn<00:05:58.520> it<00:05:58.580> build<00:05:59.000> it<00:05:59.120> into<00:05:59.240> a

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
I think I will burn it build it into a

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.640 
I think I will burn it build it into a
more<00:05:59.510> permanent<00:05:59.780> form<00:06:00.110> because<00:06:00.410> it<00:06:00.530> will

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
more permanent form because it will

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.670 
more permanent form because it will
actually<00:06:00.830> be<00:06:01.130> useful

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
actually be useful

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.740 
actually be useful
all<00:06:03.680> right<00:06:03.889> um<00:06:04.250> I'll<00:06:04.940> just<00:06:05.000> zoom<00:06:05.330> in<00:06:05.540> so<00:06:05.690> you

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
all right um I'll just zoom in so you

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.560 
all right um I'll just zoom in so you
can<00:06:05.840> have<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:05.990> look<00:06:06.169> at<00:06:06.229> my<00:06:06.550> ugly<00:06:07.570> construction

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
can have a look at my ugly construction

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:16.650 
can have a look at my ugly construction
here

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.990 

but<00:06:17.230> yeah<00:06:17.380> that's<00:06:17.620> a<00:06:17.800> nice<00:06:18.280> simple<00:06:18.490> one<00:06:18.760> here

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
but yeah that's a nice simple one here

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.800 
but yeah that's a nice simple one here
for<00:06:19.240> for<00:06:19.510> day<00:06:19.630> ten<00:06:21.120> please<00:06:22.120> keep<00:06:22.720> the

you'd<00:06:26.020> like<00:06:26.200> me<00:06:26.320> to<00:06:26.350> work<00:06:26.590> on<00:06:27.660> in<00:06:28.660> the<00:06:28.720> comments

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.170 
you'd like me to work on in the comments

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.080 
you'd like me to work on in the comments
section<00:06:29.440> and<00:06:29.590> I'll<00:06:29.710> have<00:06:29.950> a<00:06:29.980> look<00:06:30.130> at<00:06:30.220> him<00:06:30.310> I've

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
section and I'll have a look at him I've

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.150 
section and I'll have a look at him I've
got<00:06:31.300> a<00:06:31.480> whiteboard<00:06:32.140> full<00:06:32.440> of<00:06:32.530> ideas<00:06:32.920> now

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
got a whiteboard full of ideas now

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.620 
got a whiteboard full of ideas now
unfortunately<00:06:33.760> many<00:06:33.880> of<00:06:34.030> them<00:06:34.150> are<00:06:34.300> more<00:06:34.450> than

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
unfortunately many of them are more than

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.450 
unfortunately many of them are more than
one<00:06:34.840> day<00:06:35.050> they're<00:06:35.320> somewhat<00:06:35.710> non-trivial<00:06:36.130> but

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
one day they're somewhat non-trivial but

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.650 
one day they're somewhat non-trivial but
there's<00:06:36.580> a<00:06:36.640> few<00:06:36.760> bits<00:06:36.970> and<00:06:37.060> pieces<00:06:37.270> that<00:06:37.510> could

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660 
there's a few bits and pieces that could

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.920 
there's a few bits and pieces that could
maybe<00:06:37.840> be<00:06:38.220> done<00:06:39.220> as<00:06:40.030> individual<00:06:40.540> projects

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
maybe be done as individual projects

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.300 
maybe be done as individual projects
that<00:06:41.080> would<00:06:41.170> work<00:06:41.350> towards<00:06:41.530> one<00:06:41.890> larger

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
that would work towards one larger

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.500 
that would work towards one larger
project<00:06:42.730> so<00:06:42.820> we<00:06:42.940> might<00:06:43.120> start<00:06:43.540> doing<00:06:44.110> that

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
project so we might start doing that

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.670 
project so we might start doing that
okay<00:06:46.680> until<00:06:47.680> then<00:06:47.860> bye
