00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.560
 to see for those who have problems and they 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:10.040
 so your iphone after having 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.570
 I've done the icloud bypass what they're going 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.990
 to do is 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.000
 with a chip or with the same one that they already had 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.000
 inside they are going to extract 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.800
 this alone can do the same as 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.990
 always does 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.450
 they will place it on an iphone 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.450
 this perfect that works very well 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.770
 to insert the sim 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.640
 and once you recognize them you are going to leave 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.640
 to configuration 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.390
 phone 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.910
 down here at the end of the sim are going to 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.290
 activate a pin let's say we can put 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.890
 four zeros 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.890
 okay 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:13.340
 if they do not leave we will give you 41 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.340
 okay 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.960
 Unite is activated from zinc 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.060
 Well, he left me active with 1 2 3 4 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.220
 is already active 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.220
 now let's get these and this one 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.040
 of this iphone this is without any 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.180
 problem this works well 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.180
 and we are going to insert it 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.130
 on the iphone that we just unlocked 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.170
 and we insert and we give good range 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.000
 before retry, ask for the code 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.159
 pin that is what we just put 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.719
 on the other phone we will give 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.670
 unlock here we will place 1234 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.549
 that was the pin that we assigned 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.399
 we're going to have it here to get the 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.399
 sim and we give him ok 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.070
 here it says that the pin is correct and at 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.070
 get out that screen let's take out the sim 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:28.270
 we leave that message like that and we return it 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:31.970
 to insert the sim and we give it ok 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.220
 here shows the message of the pin code 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.069
 if it does not go out the first time, they'll go back to 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.939
 try to unblock 1 2 3 4 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.909
 try to take out and put back the 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:48.780
 racing fast once you have said 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.780
 which is correct 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.800
 we take it out 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.130
 and we put it back 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.980
 I give him ok 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:03.120
 and after being if he came, he sends me this 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.720
 I already give you only ok message and I give it 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.720
 behind 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.330
 and it is perfect and enters 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.330
 keep in mind that this chip that you 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.250
 leave inside is the one that will serve them 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.460
 for 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.260
 to continue using it in this way 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.260
 here you can turn it off 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.080
 and when you turn on the suns, you're just going to 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:34.750
 send the message where in pin code you 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.530
 they are going to give good will give the options ok 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.530
 and unlock
