00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
be more accurate by twenty percent if

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.740 
be more accurate by twenty percent if
you<00:02:09.929> go<00:02:10.110> last<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:11.069> let's<00:02:11.700> say<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.450> have

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
you go last so let's say that you have

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
you go last so let's say that you have
focused

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
focused

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.180 
focused
and<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.100> go<00:02:14.280> last<00:02:14.580> instead<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.240> having<00:02:15.510> a

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
and you go last instead of having a

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.890 
and you go last instead of having a
seventy<00:02:17.190> percent<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.850> change<00:02:18.150> chance<00:02:18.720> of

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
seventy percent of change chance of

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.140 
seventy percent of change chance of
killing<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.410> going<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.770> be<00:02:19.890> 84<00:02:20.520> who<00:02:20.820> is<00:02:20.940> like

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
killing is going to be 84 who is like

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
killing is going to be 84 who is like
decent<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:22.340> unless<00:02:23.340> or<00:02:23.640> let's<00:02:24.420> say<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.750> you

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
decent but unless or let's say that you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.230 
decent but unless or let's say that you
have<00:02:25.380> Qaeda<00:02:25.710> bomb<00:02:25.830> like<00:02:26.190> in<00:02:26.400> these<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:27.090> these

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
have Qaeda bomb like in these and these

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.070 
have Qaeda bomb like in these and these
slappers<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.500> instead<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.040> having<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.610> tea<00:02:30.080> it's

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
slappers so instead of having a tea it's

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.120 
slappers so instead of having a tea it's
going<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.350> be<00:02:31.530> 96<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.490> that's<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.210> lot<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:34.350> so

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
going to be 96 and that's a lot and so

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.300 
going to be 96 and that's a lot and so
we<00:02:35.850> want<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.120> give<00:02:36.360> these<00:02:36.710> laprez<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.920> water

we're<00:04:17.549> going<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:18.390> be<00:04:18.540> able<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:19.230> take<00:04:19.470> heat

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
we're going to to be able to take heat

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.090 
we're going to to be able to take heat
even<00:04:20.370> though<00:04:20.609> we<00:04:21.030> want<00:04:21.270> to<00:04:21.390> go<00:04:22.109> last<00:04:22.440> like<00:04:22.860> a

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
even though we want to go last like a

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.159 
even though we want to go last like a
lot<00:04:23.340> of<00:04:23.370> times<00:04:23.760> it<00:04:24.270> really<00:04:24.570> doesn't<00:04:25.020> matter

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
lot of times it really doesn't matter

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.470 
lot of times it really doesn't matter
because<00:04:25.470> we<00:04:25.770> have<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.190> really<00:04:26.520> awesome<00:04:26.669> natural

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
of diesel operas in action so all right

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.980 
of diesel operas in action so all right
i<00:04:34.830> start<00:04:35.520> off<00:04:35.610> with<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.850> name<00:04:36.150> ball<00:04:36.390> against<00:04:36.840> a

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
i start off with the name ball against a

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.590 
i start off with the name ball against a
modest<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.800> scarf<00:04:38.130> seen<00:04:38.400> before<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:38.910> the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
modest the scarf seen before and the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.970 
modest the scarf seen before and the
surplus<00:04:39.990> a<00:04:40.020> little<00:04:40.320> bit<00:04:40.470> too<00:04:40.620> obvious<00:04:40.950> so

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
surplus a little bit too obvious so

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.490 
surplus a little bit too obvious so
that's<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.670> reason<00:04:41.700> why<00:04:42.090> i<00:04:42.140> switch<00:04:43.140> out<00:04:43.290> into

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
that's the reason why i switch out into

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.610 
that's the reason why i switch out into
my<00:04:43.650> lab<00:04:44.010> rat<00:04:44.250> not<00:04:44.460> only<00:04:44.990> reserving<00:04:45.990> my<00:04:46.110> my<00:04:46.440> but

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
my lab rat not only reserving my my but

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.880 
my lab rat not only reserving my my but
also<00:04:47.270> for<00:04:48.270> cindy<00:04:48.660> singapore<00:04:49.260> to<00:04:49.440> switch<00:04:49.650> out

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
also for cindy singapore to switch out

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.190 
also for cindy singapore to switch out
so<00:04:50.160> he's<00:04:50.370> going<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.580> switch<00:04:50.820> out<00:04:51.060> into<00:04:52.020> his

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
so he's going to switch out into his

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.370 
so he's going to switch out into his
amber<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:52.940> a<00:04:53.940> switch<00:04:54.330> was<00:04:54.510> pretty<00:04:54.810> obvious<00:04:55.050> so

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
amber and a switch was pretty obvious so

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.280 
amber and a switch was pretty obvious so
i<00:04:55.680> decided<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.340> go<00:04:56.520> out<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:57.270> i<00:04:57.420> decided<00:04:58.200> to<00:04:58.260> go
