when<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.120> pick<00:00:09.300> up<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.480> pattern<00:00:09.690> it's<00:00:10.080> always

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
when you pick up a pattern it's always

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.020 
when you pick up a pattern it's always
really<00:00:10.620> clear<00:00:10.950> about<00:00:11.040> what<00:00:11.219> kind<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.670> yarn<00:00:11.880> you

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
really clear about what kind of yarn you

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.670 
really clear about what kind of yarn you
need<00:00:12.180> to<00:00:12.300> use<00:00:12.450> for<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:12.690> pattern<00:00:13.170> but<00:00:13.559> you're

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
need to use for that pattern but you're

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.290 
need to use for that pattern but you're
never<00:00:13.950> limited<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.550> using<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> yarn<00:00:15.059> they

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.300 
never limited to using the yarn they

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.210 
never limited to using the yarn they
call<00:00:15.510> for<00:00:15.809> we're<00:00:16.320> going<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.529> talk<00:00:16.740> here<00:00:17.010> about

things you pretty much want to remember
the<00:00:21.930> first<00:00:22.200> is<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.619> fiber<00:00:22.890> type<00:00:23.220> patterns

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the first is the fiber type patterns

the first is the fiber type patterns
will<00:00:24.300> either<00:00:24.419> call<00:00:24.720> for<00:00:25.079> a<00:00:25.489> animal<00:00:26.489> fiber<00:00:26.730> or<00:00:27.029> a

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
will either call for a animal fiber or a

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.920 
will either call for a animal fiber or a
cellulose<00:00:27.689> fiber<00:00:27.930> or<00:00:28.200> a<00:00:28.560> synthetic<00:00:28.800> fiber<00:00:29.310> and

that makes it very washable of course of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.720 
that makes it very washable of course of
course<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:01.110> can<00:01:01.440> change<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.310> up<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.700> can

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
course you can change that up you can

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.329 
course you can change that up you can
take<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.329> pattern<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.810> is<00:01:04.079> using<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.979> example

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
take a pattern that is using for example

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.190 
take a pattern that is using for example
a<00:01:05.430> wool<00:01:05.640> fiber<00:01:05.970> ended<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.509> with<00:01:06.570> cotton<00:01:06.810> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
a wool fiber ended it with cotton and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.749 
a wool fiber ended it with cotton and
there's<00:01:07.530> always<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.979> chance<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.640> will

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
there's always a chance that you will

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.550 
there's always a chance that you will
greatly<00:01:09.000> improve<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.689> pattern<00:01:10.020> as<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.409> is

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
greatly improve on the pattern as it is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.309 
greatly improve on the pattern as it is
but<00:01:11.100> chances<00:01:11.850> are<00:01:12.149> it's<00:01:12.390> not<00:01:12.509> going<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.109> look

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:13.319 
but chances are it's not going to look

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.440 
but chances are it's not going to look
like<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.890> does<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> pattern<00:01:14.819> photo<00:01:15.060> just

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
like it does in the pattern photo just

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.660 
like it does in the pattern photo just
keep<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.899> mind<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:17.130> next<00:01:17.280> thing<00:01:17.549> you

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
keep that in mind the next thing you

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.279 
keep that in mind the next thing you
want<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.880> pay<00:01:18.030> attention<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.689> yarn<00:01:18.960> weight

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
want to pay attention to is yarn weight

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.910 
want to pay attention to is yarn weight
so<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.829> you<00:01:20.039> can<00:01:20.189> get<00:01:20.340> gauged<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.799> kind<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.829> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
so that you can get gauged and kind of a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.469 
so that you can get gauged and kind of a
new<00:01:23.069> system<00:01:23.490> that's<00:01:23.579> coming<00:01:23.789> out<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.329> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
new system that's coming out that you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.349 
new system that's coming out that you
see<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.719> lot<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.109> patterns<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:27.090> yarn

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
see a lot of patterns and on the yarn

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.959 
see a lot of patterns and on the yarn
ball<00:01:27.659> bands<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.069> little<00:01:29.340> graphic<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
ball bands is it's a little graphic a

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:31.999 
ball bands is it's a little graphic a
little<00:01:30.210> skein<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> number<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.619> that

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
little skein with a number on it that

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.010 
little skein with a number on it that
tells<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.670> what<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:32.969> weight<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.479> fiber<00:01:33.749> is

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
tells you what the weight of fiber is

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.989 
tells you what the weight of fiber is
and<00:01:34.289> we're<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.499> to<00:01:34.530> talk<00:01:34.770> about<00:01:34.799> those<00:01:35.280> but

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:35.999 
and we're going to talk about those but

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:38.239 
and we're going to talk about those but
really<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.630> look<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:37.020> what<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> gauges<00:01:37.950> on

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
really if you look at what the gauges on

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:41.599 
really if you look at what the gauges on
the<00:01:38.880> yarn<00:01:39.119> ball<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.439> ball<00:01:40.649> band<00:01:40.950> it'll

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
the yarn ball on the ball band it'll

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.129 
the yarn ball on the ball band it'll
give<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.969> a<00:01:41.999> number<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.479> stitches<00:01:42.719> per<00:01:43.109> inch

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:43.139 
give you a number of stitches per inch

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:45.410 
give you a number of stitches per inch
using<00:01:43.679> a<00:01:43.889> certain<00:01:44.219> size<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.609> needle<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.119> you

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
using a certain size of needle if you

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.149 
using a certain size of needle if you
can<00:01:45.569> match<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:46.319> with<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.709> pattern

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
can match that up with the pattern
