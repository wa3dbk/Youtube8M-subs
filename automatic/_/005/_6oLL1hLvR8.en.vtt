reef tank in which we've just put some

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.490 
reef tank in which we've just put some
fish<00:00:07.470> in<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:08.370> we've<00:00:08.790> put<00:00:09.030> several<00:00:09.330> tangs<00:00:10.080> into

fish in and we've put several tangs into
the<00:00:10.710> tank<00:00:11.250> because<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.750> needed<00:00:12.750> some

decent-sized feature fish to really set

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.050 
decent-sized feature fish to really set
the<00:00:16.500> tank<00:00:16.710> off<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.670> one<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:17.970> most

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the tank off and one of the most

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.060 
the tank off and one of the most
beautiful<00:00:18.539> things<00:00:18.570> about<00:00:18.840> teens<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.529> how<00:00:19.710> much

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
beautiful things about teens is how much

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.220 
beautiful things about teens is how much
they<00:00:20.279> change<00:00:20.640> color<00:00:20.939> like<00:00:21.210> you'll<00:00:21.840> literally

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
they change color like you'll literally

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.250 
they change color like you'll literally
see<00:00:22.560> them<00:00:22.680> go<00:00:22.859> from<00:00:23.010> dark<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.609> light

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
see them go from dark to light

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.370 
see them go from dark to light
I'm<00:00:25.830> barred<00:00:26.279> -<00:00:26.580> not<00:00:26.760> bad<00:00:27.060> pattern<00:00:28.050> -<00:00:28.199> not

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
I'm barred - not bad pattern - not

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.320 
I'm barred - not bad pattern - not
pattern<00:00:28.710> they're<00:00:29.609> really<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.090> you'll<00:00:30.179> see

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
pattern they're really and you'll see

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.790 
pattern they're really and you'll see
them<00:00:30.449> grazing<00:00:30.869> off<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> rock<00:00:31.260> all<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.470> time

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
them grazing off the rock all the time

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.400 
them grazing off the rock all the time
like<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.070> one's<00:00:32.279> starting<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:32.940> already

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
like this one's starting to do already

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.569 
like this one's starting to do already
but<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> main<00:00:34.649> thing<00:00:34.829> about<00:00:34.860> tangs<00:00:35.309> is

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
but the main thing about tangs is

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.040 
but the main thing about tangs is
putting<00:00:35.880> them<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.090> at<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.210> same<00:00:36.420> time<00:00:36.480> is

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
putting them in at the same time is

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.500 
putting them in at the same time is
definitely<00:00:37.309> helpful<00:00:38.309> because<00:00:39.090> now<00:00:39.239> that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
definitely helpful because now that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.670 
definitely helpful because now that
we've<00:00:39.629> got<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> bunch<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.140> tangs<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
we've got a bunch of tangs in the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.369 
we've got a bunch of tangs in the
aquarium<00:00:41.030> adding<00:00:42.030> more<00:00:42.210> later<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:42.930> a

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
aquarium adding more later on can be a

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.770 
aquarium adding more later on can be a
bit<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.920> trouble<00:00:44.250> because<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.120> territoriality

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
bit of trouble because of territoriality

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.369 
bit of trouble because of territoriality
and<00:00:46.640> what<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> territoriality<00:00:48.239> does<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:49.020> that

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and what the territoriality does is that

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.540 
and what the territoriality does is that
for<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.590> first<00:00:49.829> few<00:00:49.980> days<00:00:50.160> they're<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
for the first few days they're going to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.400 
for the first few days they're going to
want<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.730> pick<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.030> each<00:00:51.149> other<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.629> set<00:00:52.260> their

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
want to pick on each other to set their

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.380 
want to pick on each other to set their
dominance<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.059> increase

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
dominance and that's going to increase

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.119 
dominance and that's going to increase
the<00:00:54.660> amount<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.930> stress<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.800> fish<00:00:56.010> are

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the amount of stress that the fish are

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.090 
the amount of stress that the fish are
going<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:57.030> under<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.620> if<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> fish<00:00:58.949> are

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
going to be under and if the fish are

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.639 
going to be under and if the fish are
under<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> whole<00:00:59.550> lot<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> stress<00:01:00.180> then<00:01:01.140> their

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
under a whole lot of stress then their

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.500 
under a whole lot of stress then their
immune<00:01:01.890> system<00:01:02.250> will<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.520> suppressed<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.359> all

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
immune system will be suppressed and all

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.509 
immune system will be suppressed and all
of<00:01:03.660> their<00:01:03.840> energy<00:01:04.320> will<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.739> their<00:01:04.890> fight

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
of their energy will be in their fight

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.730 
of their energy will be in their fight
or<00:01:05.640> flight<00:01:05.850> system<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.450> their<00:01:06.740> respiration

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
or flight system and their respiration

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.980 
or flight system and their respiration
system<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.430> forth<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.000> trying<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.810> keep

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
system and so forth so trying to keep

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.859 
system and so forth so trying to keep
the<00:01:10.140> fish<00:01:10.850> just<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.000> they<00:01:12.119> settled<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.570> quickly

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the fish just so they settled in quickly

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.929 
the fish just so they settled in quickly
is<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.130> key<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.340> making<00:01:14.640> sure<00:01:14.790> they

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
is really the key to making sure they

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.120 
is really the key to making sure they
don't<00:01:15.000> get<00:01:15.270> diseased<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:16.200> they<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.680> actually

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
don't get diseased if they do actually

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.850 
don't get diseased if they do actually
get<00:01:17.310> diseased<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:19.320> want<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.530> treat<00:01:19.710> them

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
get diseased then you want to treat them

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.520 
get diseased then you want to treat them
as<00:01:19.979> fast<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.610> possible<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:21.990> want<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> be

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
as fast as possible so you want to be

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.789 
as fast as possible so you want to be
adding<00:01:22.970> medications<00:01:23.970> such<00:01:24.299> as<00:01:24.330> medic<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
adding medications such as medic the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.070 
adding medications such as medic the
second<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.970> notice<00:01:27.360> any<00:01:27.689> sort<00:01:27.990> of

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
second that you notice any sort of

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.499 
second that you notice any sort of
problem<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.790> only<00:01:29.970> reason<00:01:30.180> why<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.299> wouldn't

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
problem the only reason why you wouldn't

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.450 
problem the only reason why you wouldn't
pre<00:01:30.810> dose<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.500> isn't<00:01:31.650> real<00:01:31.890> cheap<00:01:32.189> stuff

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
pre dose it is it isn't real cheap stuff

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.370 
pre dose it is it isn't real cheap stuff
but<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.509> lot<00:01:33.659> cheaper<00:01:33.840> than<00:01:33.960> losing<00:01:34.350> your

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
but it's a lot cheaper than losing your

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.800 
but it's a lot cheaper than losing your
fish<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:36.000> first<00:01:36.240> thing<00:01:36.329> you'd<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> do

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
fish so the first thing you'd want to do

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.960 
fish so the first thing you'd want to do
is<00:01:37.200> lower<00:01:37.710> your<00:01:37.799> salinity<00:01:38.310> make<00:01:38.700> sure<00:01:38.850> your

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
is lower your salinity make sure your

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.390 
is lower your salinity make sure your
salinity<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.479> about<00:01:39.689> point<00:01:39.869> O<00:01:40.049> 2<00:01:40.350> O<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:41.369> that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
salinity is about point O 2 O so that

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.980 
salinity is about point O 2 O so that
will<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:41.790> mean<00:01:41.939> add<00:01:42.090> some<00:01:42.270> RO<00:01:42.450> water<00:01:42.750> or

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
will just mean add some RO water or

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.520 
will just mean add some RO water or
whatever<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.380> need<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.899> then<00:01:45.899> medical
