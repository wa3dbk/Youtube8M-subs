00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.389
 watching TV 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.800
 national without me because I kept seeing 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.710
 television 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.460
 Pablito what happens is you never

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.910
 television 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.590
 because it's like that over and over again 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.280
 because they always give and they say 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.580
 things we educate them in the same way 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.910

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:31.949
 lack of discipline on the part of his mother 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.659

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.659
 father 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:46.790

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:50.120
 He is cheerful and enthusiastic sometimes 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:55.150
