00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
they look like right now they're not

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.149 
they look like right now they're not
quite<00:01:52.659> where<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:52.869> wanted<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.289> be<00:01:53.409> isolate<00:01:54.039> them

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
quite where I wanted to be isolate them

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.810 
quite where I wanted to be isolate them
to<00:01:54.340> shrink<00:01:54.610> up<00:01:54.789> quite<00:01:55.030> a<00:01:55.060> bit<00:01:55.330> um<00:01:56.610> these<00:01:57.610> are<00:01:57.670> my

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
to shrink up quite a bit um these are my

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.969 
to shrink up quite a bit um these are my
knee<00:01:58.030> straps<00:01:58.600> about<00:01:58.990> someone<00:01:59.320> later<00:01:59.530> they

knee straps about someone later they

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.889 
knee straps about someone later they
probably<00:02:00.250> will<00:02:00.700> only<00:02:00.729> need<00:02:01.149> maybe<00:02:01.179> one<00:02:01.690> more

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
probably will only need maybe one more

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.830 
probably will only need maybe one more
agitation<00:02:02.409> cycle<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.069> they'll<00:02:03.220> be<00:02:03.340> good<00:02:03.840> I

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
agitation cycle and they'll be good I

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.469 
agitation cycle and they'll be good I

just wanted to show you that about the

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.469 
just wanted to show you that about the
halfway<00:02:07.659> mark<00:02:07.840> on<00:02:08.289> what<00:02:08.619> they<00:02:08.739> look<00:02:08.950> like

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479
