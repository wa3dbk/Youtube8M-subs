00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
it I got it at Home Depot for a dollar

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.270 
it I got it at Home Depot for a dollar
each<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.899> got<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> whole<00:00:43.440> plethora<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:44.040> these

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
each and I got a whole plethora of these

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.340 
each and I got a whole plethora of these
and<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:45.210> come<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.480> different<00:00:45.570> sizes<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.289> you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
and they come in different sizes so you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.139 
and they come in different sizes so you
can<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.070> two-inch<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
can see here is a two-inch one and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.080 
can see here is a two-inch one and
basically<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.020> inch<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.520> not<00:00:50.520> necessarily

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
basically the inch is not necessarily

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.600 
basically the inch is not necessarily
the<00:00:51.270> size<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:51.840> how<00:00:52.050> how<00:00:52.680> much<00:00:52.949> open<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.460> can

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the size but how how much open this can

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.209 
the size but how how much open this can
go<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.390> tap<00:00:54.989> onto<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.500> two<00:00:55.949> inch<00:00:56.129> thick

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
go so this can tap onto a two inch thick

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.849 
go so this can tap onto a two inch thick
surface<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.199> one<00:00:58.469> inch<00:00:58.710> I

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
surface this one can do like one inch I

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.099 
surface this one can do like one inch I
use<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.309> mostly<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.180> on-the-go<00:01:00.690> stuff

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
use this one mostly for on-the-go stuff

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.740 
use this one mostly for on-the-go stuff
and<00:01:01.399> then<00:01:02.399> there's<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> little<00:01:03.180> itty<00:01:03.390> tiny

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and then there's a little itty tiny

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.560 
and then there's a little itty tiny
bitty<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.350> half<00:01:04.710> inch<00:01:04.979> guy<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.150> can

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
bitty like half inch guy here that I can

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.030 
bitty like half inch guy here that I can
just<00:01:06.750> use<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.049> general<00:01:07.350> stuff<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:07.890> not

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
just use for general stuff it's not

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.550 
just use for general stuff it's not
super<00:01:08.939> useful<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.720> still<00:01:09.960> helps<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
super useful but it still helps and it
