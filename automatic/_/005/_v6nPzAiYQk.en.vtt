00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
flames stayed away from the engine Oh

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.710 
flames stayed away from the engine Oh
outside<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.130> windows<00:01:51.460> were<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.390> sitting<00:01:52.540> in

me on the other side so was just the
other<00:01:58.900> wing<00:01:59.140> but<00:01:59.560> yeah<00:02:00.190> so<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.790> only<00:02:00.880> thing

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
other wing but yeah so the only thing

other wing but yeah so the only thing
you<00:02:01.210> saw<00:02:01.360> on<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.570> other<00:02:01.600> side<00:02:01.930> was<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.080> plane

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
you saw on the other side was the plane

amazing<00:02:20.770> thing<00:02:20.860> about<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.100> almost<00:02:21.459> was<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
amazing thing about this almost was the

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.060 
amazing thing about this almost was the
speed<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.480> all<00:02:22.600> happened<00:02:23.020> well<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:23.890> was

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
speed of it it all happened well it was

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.750 
speed of it it all happened well it was
because<00:02:24.550> we<00:02:24.700> were<00:02:24.880> just<00:02:25.120> taken<00:02:25.540> off<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.760> we

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
because we were just taken off and we

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.790 
because we were just taken off and we
the<00:02:28.150> pilot<00:02:28.570> said<00:02:28.780> we'd<00:02:28.959> have<00:02:29.110> gone<00:02:29.440> about<00:02:29.739> a

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
the pilot said we'd have gone about a

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.880 
the pilot said we'd have gone about a
100<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.430> 150<00:02:31.150> feet<00:02:31.390> in<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.630> air<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.320> then<00:02:32.800> you

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
100 to 150 feet in the air and then you

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.250 
100 to 150 feet in the air and then you
heard<00:02:33.070> this<00:02:33.250> little<00:02:33.430> bang<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.420> then<00:02:34.870> all<00:02:35.050> of<00:02:35.080> a

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
absolutely brilliant he did you have

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.850 
absolutely brilliant he did you have
time<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.840> make<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.019> circuit<00:02:47.470> or<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.650> just<00:02:47.769> have

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
time to make a circuit or you just have

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.080 
time to make a circuit or you just have
to<00:02:47.920> put<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.130> airplane<00:02:48.250> down<00:02:48.580> there<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:48.970> then

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
to put the airplane down there and then

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.060 
to put the airplane down there and then
he<00:02:49.330> put<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.660> down<00:02:49.810> there<00:02:50.049> and<00:02:50.080> then<00:02:50.380> he<00:02:50.530> cut<00:02:50.950> the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
he put it down there and then he cut the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.430 
he put it down there and then he cut the
engine<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.610> engine<00:02:51.910> seemed<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.570> be<00:02:53.049> cut<00:02:53.290> off

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
engine the engine seemed to be cut off

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.979 
engine the engine seemed to be cut off
in<00:02:53.650> absolute<00:02:54.370> seconds<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.720> plane

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
in absolute seconds that the plane

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.949 
in absolute seconds that the plane
tipped<00:02:56.350> a<00:02:56.530> bit<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:57.010> then<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.540> tipped<00:02:58.540> off<00:02:58.720> to

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
tipped a bit and then it tipped off to

00:02:58.959 --> 00:02:59.610 
tipped a bit and then it tipped off to
the<00:02:59.110> right

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
the right

crash<00:03:01.600> positions<00:03:02.110> so<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.680> remember<00:03:03.040> Bryn<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.340> I

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
crash positions so I remember Bryn and I

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.729 
crash positions so I remember Bryn and I
pushing<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:03.970> seats<00:03:04.180> forward<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:05.019> apparently

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
pushing the seats forward and apparently

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.070 
pushing the seats forward and apparently
we<00:03:05.860> hit<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.130> runway<00:03:06.390> for<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.420> period<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.840> time

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
we hit the runway for a period of time

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.590 
we hit the runway for a period of time
but<00:03:08.680> then<00:03:08.920> we<00:03:09.130> hit<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.430> field<00:03:09.730> which<00:03:10.209> put<00:03:10.450> it

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
but then we hit this field which put it

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.660 
but then we hit this field which put it
probably<00:03:11.049> in<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.200> end<00:03:11.290> sadism<00:03:11.680> but<00:03:12.430> we<00:03:12.549> were

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
probably in the end sadism but we were

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.610 
probably in the end sadism but we were
bumping<00:03:13.060> don't<00:03:13.570> any<00:03:13.780> sense<00:03:14.110> though<00:03:14.350> in<00:03:14.470> which

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
bumping don't any sense though in which

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.170 
bumping don't any sense though in which
if<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:14.769> put<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.190> over<00:03:15.310> dramatically<00:03:15.850> you<00:03:15.940> felt

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
if I put it over dramatically you felt

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.640 
if I put it over dramatically you felt
that<00:03:16.450> was<00:03:16.570> it<00:03:16.720> you'd<00:03:16.840> had<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.019> well<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.530> were

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
that was it you'd had it well you were

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.320 
that was it you'd had it well you were
you<00:03:17.830> were<00:03:18.010> waiting<00:03:18.220> for<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.549> impact<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:19.209> were

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
you were waiting for the impact you were

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.640 
you were waiting for the impact you were
thinking<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:19.720> were<00:03:19.870> going<00:03:20.019> to<00:03:20.140> hit<00:03:20.230> something

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
thinking you were going to hit something

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.310 
thinking you were going to hit something
but<00:03:21.010> once<00:03:21.670> that<00:03:21.790> stopped<00:03:22.299> then<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.019> next

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
but once that stopped then the next

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.660 
but once that stopped then the next
