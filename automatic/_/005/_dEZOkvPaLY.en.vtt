probably<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.450> any<00:01:09.630> chance<00:01:10.520> but<00:01:11.520> that

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
probably to have any chance but that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.219 
probably to have any chance but that
that's<00:01:11.820> probably<00:01:12.030> going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.450> unlikely<00:01:12.840> so

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
that's probably going to be unlikely so

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.840 
that's probably going to be unlikely so
it's<00:01:13.799> going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.040> be<00:01:14.130> really<00:01:14.580> really

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it's going to be really really

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.760 
it's going to be really really
interesting<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.930> best<00:01:16.170> things<00:01:16.409> got<00:01:16.650> is

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
interesting and the best things got is

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.450 
interesting and the best things got is
the<00:01:16.860> bike<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.430> if<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.390> had<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.369> whatever<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the bike and if you had the whatever the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.240 
the bike and if you had the whatever the
procedures<00:01:21.000> done<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.350> jacked<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.070> bit

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
procedures done to be jacked up a bit

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.429 
procedures done to be jacked up a bit
you<00:01:23.280> might<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> bit<00:01:24.600> more<00:01:24.659> hope<00:01:25.020> there<00:01:25.259> too

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
you might have a bit more hope there too

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.350 
you might have a bit more hope there too
in<00:01:25.590> his<00:01:25.619> bike<00:01:25.920> while<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> say<00:01:27.210> if

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
in his bike while I was going to say if

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.230 
in his bike while I was going to say if
there's<00:01:27.390> anything<00:01:27.869> or<00:01:28.380> any<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.880> three

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
there's anything or any of the three

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240 
there's anything or any of the three
disciplines<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.680> might<00:01:31.890> lack

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
disciplines that I think you might lack

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.340 
disciplines that I think you might lack
in<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.119> bike<00:01:33.360> riding<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.049> tell

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
in is the bike riding because you tell

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.770 
in is the bike riding because you tell
people<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.040> get<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.549> their<00:01:35.880> bike<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:36.659> how

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
people to get on their bike but how

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.899 
people to get on their bike but how
often<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.439> your<00:01:37.590> bike<00:01:37.770> I'm<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.790> my

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
often are you on your bike I'm not on my

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.670 
often are you on your bike I'm not on my
bike<00:01:39.060> very<00:01:39.299> often<00:01:39.659> right<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> could<00:01:40.470> start

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
bike very often right but I could start

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.429 
bike very often right but I could start
learning<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.659> well<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.720> can't<00:01:42.990> wait<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.170> see

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
learning so well I can't wait to see

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.990 
learning so well I can't wait to see
this<00:01:43.560> all<00:01:43.829> go<00:01:44.009> down<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.490> course<00:01:44.670> we'll<00:01:44.880> be

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
this all go down and of course we'll be

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.969
