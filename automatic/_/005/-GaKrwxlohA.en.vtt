00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.480
 hello dear friends here is the cover 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.670
 already I welcome you to a new one 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.230
 elder scrolls online video and today 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.570
 I want you a little addon 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.970
 which I personally very much 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.769
 think well and which probably 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.019
 many of you are interested out there 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.930
 it is in principle a kind 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:37.210
 gadafis know many from wow it means 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.280
 namely have sap and we can ourselves 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.199
 if I am here with my 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.809
 card activate the filter many 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.820
 show different points 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.530
 let's say where we for example 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.150
 we have found raw materials here 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.010
 For example, heart is found it will be us 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.869
 also indicated which doctors exactly 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.879
 we have found ourselves 

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:56.290
 leave where we found which plants 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.180
 we have let us know 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.920
 which rest we have found and 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.629
 especially interesting we can 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.729
 let us know where we are 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.080
 but they still have found 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.060
 English but that's not special 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.430
 bad we want only after all 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.470
 So we can have that symbol 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.300
 With the help of this addons raw materials 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.730
 collect and at a later date 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.290
 come back and this again 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.970
 Collect the same thing 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.400
 By the way, also for herbs we see 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.010
 here for example we have different 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.870
 collected herbs that we then find 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.360
 The map can also mark it exactly 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.850
 which herbs we have collected for 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.590
 example here a mountain flower and if 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.880
 we will come back here later 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.409
 We also have a mountain flower here 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.630
 so if you are certain 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.360
 then you can use materials 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.220
 Help this addon find these exactly 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.570
 Of course you have to do this for the first time 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.130
 have found 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.050
 when we look into the settings 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.520
 There we have the possibility there 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.190
 a little something we can change 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.300
 for example, change the color by 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.580
 we are here now 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.560
 schmid pin options so that's the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.750
 Doctors meant pin color we can now 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.510
 just try to set to red 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.000
 open our card and pull that all 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.740
 are now colored red 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.229
 and so is the card 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.580
 I can make it clearer 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.020
 I hope that parents can be a bit 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.700
 help in the future if you have more 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.200
 information wishes you will find 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.880
 below in the video description just like that 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.960
 like the detailed article 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.880
 I wish you a nice day 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.420
 until then until next time yours 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.420
 cover
