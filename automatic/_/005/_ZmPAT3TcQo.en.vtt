00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.649
 when this video is for people 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.109
 who have problems installing a 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.020
 shared printer in the network of the 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.780
 home or office I had this problem in 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:18.340
 my office and it did not allow me to install a 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.539
 printer that energy use then and the 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.789
 moment that I had to add the 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.810
 printer marks you this error has 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.340
 much 0 2 and a number 6 or 7 other number 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.800
 I found a website that 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.480
 they tell you that the problem is for the 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.670
 system registry that is corrupt 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.920
 because it is shared many times with 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.059
 several computers tell you that you should 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.070
 to start the system editor of the 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.630
 register rather then for those who 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.059
 they have windows seven down they're going to 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.070
 home search and write require e 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.870
 they start the system in windows 8 it is what 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.760
 same they go to one side select the 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.130
 magnifying glass and they write refer and there starts in 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.490
 the registry editor 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.310
 here the folder that is h klm as it 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.380
 shows in the address is h 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.600
 local machine and follow the whole route 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.850
 until you get to servers here eye on the 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.310
 servers folder there are other folders not 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.960
 worry the servers folder will 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.420
 you have to eliminate with everything you have 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.910
 in then press delete from 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.340
 lead right click and delete does not matter and 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.680
 accept and I'll show you in the video 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.990
 how to follow this whole route and all the 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.440
 steps that showed on this page for 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.690
 solve this problem the video is a 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.460
 little time since I'm not going to edit it 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.040
 in a matter of time I am going to show you 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.960
 the whole process since I was marked 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.610
 error when selecting the printer that 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.110
 is on a network so they can see that if 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.119
 solve ok 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.210
 here as you can see it does not let me install 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.250
 the printer or connect it not even me 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.229
 I recommend you have them at hand 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.229
 also the printer drivers that 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.140
 want to use and have them installed in 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.700
 your computer where they will use it here 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.009
 As you can see, I have already opened the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.700
 editor of the registry and I will continue the 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.170
 route 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.170
 they send me here on this page 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.030
 then we follow the main folder 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.480
 which is the local machine and we follow all 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.710
 the address as it appears on the screen 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.020
 I'll leave you in the description of 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:22.530
 video the page where you will find 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.750
 the solution and also this the route of 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.720
 folders that have to follow eye with 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.470
 this will not erase anything else since 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.240
 edit the ere the editor of the record is 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.890
 very dangerous since they can ruin 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.810
 windows completely or some 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.050
 functions and they're going to have to reinstall 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.380
 the system if it's going so badly or if it's going 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.050
 good or regular they will have nothing more than 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.130
 recover the system without having to 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.130
 uninstall everything 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.049
 as I remembered the video is a little 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.220
 delayed since there are many folders 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.130
 that must follow 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.390
 and remember to get to the servers folder 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.740
 Inside that folder there are more folders 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.080
 then only selection in the 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.780
 servers folder and give the button 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.690
 delete delete as you want 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.000
 as you know how to do it and you have to 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.130
 delete that folder when doing it 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.570
 you have to solve the problem if 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.690
 it is not solved and it reappears 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.360
 the same thing comes back because I am 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.270
 happened to the first one appeared again 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.100
 the same server folder empty but 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.570
 I already deleted it again and it left me 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.260
 install the printer as I am 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.510
 showing in this video 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.220
 this problem I was reading that is 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.470
 constant 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.360
 and that I can possibly go back to 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.610
 appear and you have to do all the 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.600
 process again then how can 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.910
 see here 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.680
 I'm already selecting the printer that 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.680
 I want to use that is in the network 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.630
 and already in salty 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.670
 for her is here already ready for woman 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.560
 I'm even putting it as 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.130
 default printer 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.349
 and as you can see, he left me 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.139
 install it and if indeed already the 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:19.259
 can you use there in my work 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.959
 well that's it and I have more 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:25.409
 videos and we have some other problems 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.120
 I have more videos you can also make me 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:29.370
 questions or answer them shortly 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.150
 if sometimes I can not answer you 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.069
 time is because youtube does not allow me 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.770
 answer me appears only for 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:40.180
 select I like I do not like but I do not 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.160
 lets answer 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.520
 over all that is the problem why I 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.069
 I'm late answering
