00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
together so we have this arm here comes

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.240 
together so we have this arm here comes
out<00:02:54.650> like<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:59.120> so<00:03:00.120> in<00:03:00.299> there<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.630> magnet

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250
