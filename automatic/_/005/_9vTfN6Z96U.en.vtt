00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
and then feared me bum bum hey guys this

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.650 
and then feared me bum bum hey guys this
is<00:00:13.230> super<00:00:13.710> Canadian<00:00:14.219> fair<00:00:14.519> here<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.330> we're

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
is super Canadian fair here and we're

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.320 
is super Canadian fair here and we're
just<00:00:15.809> going<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.049> go<00:00:16.199> over<00:00:16.230> quickly<00:00:17.119> for<00:00:18.119> feed

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
just going to go over quickly for feed

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.420 
just going to go over quickly for feed
the<00:00:18.480> beast<00:00:18.660> how<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.140> make<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> macerator<00:00:20.189> and

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
the beast how to make a macerator and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.580 
the beast how to make a macerator and
how<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> power<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:21.750> very<00:00:21.960> simple<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.529> it

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
how to power it it's very simple and it

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.859 
how to power it it's very simple and it
should<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> short<00:00:23.100> video<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:24.210> first<00:00:24.449> off<00:00:24.660> to

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
should be a short video so first off to

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.960 
should be a short video so first off to
make<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.830> fairly<00:00:26.130> difficult<00:00:26.430> because

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
make it it's fairly difficult because

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.450 
make it it's fairly difficult because
this<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.539> mindcrack<00:00:28.109> variation<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.010> so

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
this is the mindcrack variation of it so

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.690 
this is the mindcrack variation of it so
it's<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.730> take<00:00:29.849> three<00:00:30.300> diamonds<00:00:31.550> in<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
it's going to take three diamonds in the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.580 
it's going to take three diamonds in the
top<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.239> then<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> middle<00:00:34.079> beside<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
top and then in the middle beside the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.770 
top and then in the middle beside the
middle<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:34.980> then<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:36.030> machine<00:00:36.420> block<00:00:36.660> in

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
middle and then this machine block in

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.569 
middle and then this machine block in
the<00:00:36.870> very<00:00:37.050> center<00:00:37.410> an<00:00:37.590> advanced<00:00:38.070> circuit

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the very center an advanced circuit

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.639 
the very center an advanced circuit
below<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.180> four<00:00:39.750> pieces<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.110> flinch<00:00:40.410> at<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
below and four pieces of flinch at the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.170 
below and four pieces of flinch at the
corners<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.250> that's<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.850> make<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.149> a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
corners and that's going to make you a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.479 
corners and that's going to make you a
macerator<00:00:42.920> so<00:00:43.920> after<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.190> get<00:00:44.399> your

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
macerator so after you get your

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.910 
macerator so after you get your
macerator<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.840> either<00:00:45.960> power<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.530> using

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
macerator you can either power it using

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.250 
macerator you can either power it using
a<00:00:47.039> generator<00:00:47.309> or<00:00:47.879> using<00:00:48.690> any<00:00:48.780> source<00:00:49.079> of

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
a generator or using any source of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.860 
a generator or using any source of
renewable<00:00:49.399> fuel<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.910> your<00:00:51.149> solar<00:00:51.390> panels

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
renewable fuel like your solar panels

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.430 
renewable fuel like your solar panels
your<00:00:52.230> wind<00:00:53.070> turbines<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.940> your<00:00:54.809> water<00:00:55.110> mills

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
your wind turbines and your water mills

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.950 
your wind turbines and your water mills
so<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> most<00:00:56.610> basic<00:00:56.879> one<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.510> obviously<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
so the most basic one is obviously the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.439 
so the most basic one is obviously the
generator<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.309> put<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> fuel<00:00:59.850> inside<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
generator you put a fuel inside the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.900 
generator you put a fuel inside the
generator<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.109> not<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.890> through<00:01:02.309> wire

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
generator and not going through wire

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.969 
generator and not going through wire
whether<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.750> glass<00:01:04.110> fiber<00:01:04.379> cable<00:01:04.830> or

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
whether this is glass fiber cable or

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.149 
whether this is glass fiber cable or
copper<00:01:05.640> cable<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.450> goes<00:01:06.720> into<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.290> macerator

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
copper cable it goes into the macerator

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.000 
copper cable it goes into the macerator
and<00:01:08.479> it'll<00:01:09.479> power<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.290> little<00:01:10.590> bar<00:01:10.770> right

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
and it'll power this little bar right

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.310 
and it'll power this little bar right
here<00:01:11.869> just<00:01:12.869> break<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.250> let's<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.330> use

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
here just break that and let's just use

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.810 
here just break that and let's just use
some<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.680> fuel<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.220> i'll<00:01:17.310> show<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.549> how<00:01:17.580> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
some of the fuel so i'll show you how it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.960 
some of the fuel so i'll show you how it
works<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.310> full

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
works here so as you can see a full

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.109 
works here so as you can see a full
charge<00:01:24.299> will<00:01:24.659> macerate<00:01:25.229> one<00:01:25.590> thing<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.790> after

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
charge will macerate one thing but after

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.340 
charge will macerate one thing but after
that<00:01:27.240> charge<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.570> done<00:01:27.840> you're<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.200> have

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that charge is done you're going to have

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.399 
that charge is done you're going to have
to<00:01:28.500> wait<00:01:28.619> until<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.850> full<00:01:30.630> again<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:31.350> you

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
to wait until it is full again for you

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.020 
to wait until it is full again for you
to<00:01:31.500> macerate<00:01:31.829> something<00:01:32.189> else<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.880> that's

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
to macerate something else so that's

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.789 
to macerate something else so that's
what<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> generators<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.380> connect<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
what the generators for you connect the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.170 
what the generators for you connect the
generator<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.909> see<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
generator to it as you can see the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.999 
generator to it as you can see the
generators<00:01:36.659> power<00:01:36.900> level<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.350> down<00:01:37.590> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
generators power level is going down and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.460 
generators power level is going down and
the<00:01:38.369> masqueraders<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.329> back<00:01:39.540> up<00:01:39.810> so

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the masqueraders is going back up so

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.450 
the masqueraders is going back up so
that's<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.680> easy<00:01:40.920> way<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.130> do<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:42.259> you<00:01:43.259> can

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
that's the easy way to do it you can

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.179 
that's the easy way to do it you can
attach<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.670> an<00:01:44.820> advanced<00:01:45.119> solar<00:01:45.450> panel<00:01:46.189> or

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
attach it to an advanced solar panel or

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.609 
attach it to an advanced solar panel or
just<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.640> regular<00:01:47.759> solar<00:01:48.180> panel<00:01:48.630> but<00:01:48.810> obviously

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
just a regular solar panel but obviously

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.960 
just a regular solar panel but obviously
an<00:01:49.710> event<00:01:49.920> solar<00:01:50.189> panel<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.520> going<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> be<00:01:50.790> much

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
an event solar panel is going to be much

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.620 
an event solar panel is going to be much
faster<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> same<00:01:52.950> thing<00:01:53.479> but<00:01:54.479> you

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
faster so it's the same thing but you

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.539 
faster so it's the same thing but you
could<00:01:54.780> always<00:01:54.960> add<00:01:55.200> some<00:01:55.409> overclockers<00:01:56.250> which

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
could always add some overclockers which

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.670 
could always add some overclockers which
have<00:01:56.909> become<00:01:57.149> very<00:01:57.299> hard<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.990> make<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:58.439> if<00:01:58.590> you

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
have become very hard to make but if you

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.170 
have become very hard to make but if you
can<00:01:58.799> get<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> few<00:01:59.280> a<00:02:00.049> whole<00:02:01.049> bunch<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.469> there<00:02:02.180> it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
can get a few a whole bunch in there it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.609 
can get a few a whole bunch in there it
can<00:02:03.390> really<00:02:03.689> master<00:02:03.869> eight<00:02:04.140> things<00:02:04.380> very<00:02:04.560> fast

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
can really master eight things very fast

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.130 
can really master eight things very fast
as<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.340> see<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:06.090> cannot<00:02:06.390> generate<00:02:06.930> as

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
as you can see it cannot generate as

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.339 
as you can see it cannot generate as
fast<00:02:07.530> as<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.099> using<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.599> fast<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.200> it

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
fast as it is using so it's fast but it

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.730 
fast as it is using so it's fast but it
also<00:02:10.470> uses<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.890> lot<00:02:11.129> more<00:02:11.280> fuel<00:02:11.670> per<00:02:12.000> overclock

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
also uses a lot more fuel per overclock

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.100 
also uses a lot more fuel per overclock
and<00:02:13.580> this<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.120> just<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.390> small<00:02:14.510> little<00:02:14.660> ray<00:02:15.080> I

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
and this is just a small little ray I

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.230 
and this is just a small little ray I
set<00:02:15.380> up<00:02:15.500> here<00:02:15.770> it's<00:02:16.280> very<00:02:16.490> easy<00:02:16.700> how<00:02:17.030> I<00:02:17.060> got

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
set up here it's very easy how I got

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.810 
set up here it's very easy how I got
this<00:02:17.390> one<00:02:17.450> advanced<00:02:17.930> solar<00:02:18.230> panel<00:02:18.710> hooked<00:02:19.640> up

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
this one advanced solar panel hooked up

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.760 
this one advanced solar panel hooked up
to<00:02:19.940> all<00:02:19.970> four<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.600> these<00:02:21.020> master<00:02:21.500> Raiders

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
to all four of these master Raiders

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.400 
to all four of these master Raiders
using<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:22.220> glass<00:02:22.460> fiber<00:02:22.730> cable<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:24.290> if<00:02:24.350> you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
using this glass fiber cable so if you

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.650 
using this glass fiber cable so if you
go<00:02:24.500> over<00:02:24.680> here<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.130> can<00:02:25.310> put<00:02:26.150> your<00:02:26.270> diamonds

each<00:02:38.210> or<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.750> master<00:02:39.110> eight<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.410> will

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
each or that you master eight you will

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.240 
each or that you master eight you will
get<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.920> dust<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:41.120> as<00:02:41.240> you<00:02:41.300> can<00:02:41.480> see<00:02:41.660> from<00:02:41.900> this

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
get to dust so as you can see from this

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.140 
get to dust so as you can see from this
diamond<00:02:43.250> or<00:02:45.340> you're<00:02:46.340> going<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:46.760> get<00:02:46.940> to

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
diamond or you're going to get to

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.230 
diamond or you're going to get to
diamond<00:02:47.480> dust<00:02:47.630> okay<00:02:48.020> there<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.200> go<00:02:48.940> from<00:02:49.940> the

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
diamond dust okay there you go from the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.850 
diamond dust okay there you go from the
mat<00:02:50.450> from<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.750> eye<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.020> obviously<00:02:51.320> to<00:02:51.530> iron

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
mat from the eye and obviously to iron

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.090 
mat from the eye and obviously to iron
dust<00:02:52.100> gold<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:53.060> gold<00:02:53.300> dust<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.930> 10<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.530> 210

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
dust gold to gold dust and 10 is 210

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.960 
dust gold to gold dust and 10 is 210
dust<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.780> that's<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.590> it's<00:02:57.890> pretty<00:02:58.160> basic

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
dust so that's it it's pretty basic

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.490 
dust so that's it it's pretty basic
let's<00:02:59.330> just<00:02:59.480> go<00:02:59.540> over<00:02:59.660> how<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.840> craft<00:03:00.080> it<00:03:00.230> again

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
let's just go over how to craft it again

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.890 
let's just go over how to craft it again
Oh<00:03:00.680> already<00:03:01.010> made<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.400> oh<00:03:01.520> well<00:03:01.790> thanks<00:03:02.750> for
