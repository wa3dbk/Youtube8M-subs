00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.999
 or friends how about in today's video 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.009
 let's go back to addressing issues 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:11.720
 related to the decline 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:15.290
 8 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.600
 in previous videos we have explained the 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.360
 importance of knowing block 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.020
 block it in agreement and for this we have 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.270
 explained 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.860
 we have a little memory what is the 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.430
 escape knot or a mule knot 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:35.010
 that does not serve as I say in a descent in 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.510
 which we need then for the reason x 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.850
 leave it blocked either for 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.370
 act in the installation or to do 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.320
 a photo or to make any maneuver 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.980
 that allows us to have our hands free 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.650
 in agreement we have explained as it is 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.780
 says the escape knot does not delay well 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.700
 today we are going to go a step further and we are going to 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.700
 explain one of the basic maneuvers 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.890
 which it is none other than the keylock 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.010
 lock key 8 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.970
 this is something basic that we should know 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.940
 when we use the descent according 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.700
 for this we are going to install 8 as 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.940
 we always agree what happened 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.900
 through it through the big hole and we leave 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.780
 whenever they ride over 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.190
 well to avoid what would be a 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.350
 descent let's do it just like 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.990
 we would do our going here as well as 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.630
 we have said in other occasions we have 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.280
 a braking capacity determined by 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.950
 our braking capacity in function 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.230
 of the characteristics of the rope and of 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.690
 the circumstances of the descent itself 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.390
 if it is very vertical if there are many meters 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.270
 of rope that we hang will bring you this 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.610
 descent can not be a bit back 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.830
 find therefore we go from what 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.380
 which is called that has already been explained to 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.420
 previous videos pass what would be the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.160
 rope inside the carabiner that like 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.380
 you already know this is the modality of 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:07.270
 touch 8 in true mode of agreement 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:10.899
 well here as you observe I can 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.830
 remain hanging quietly but the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.830
 hand of being 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.069
 let's do what I said that is the 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.140
 Basic lock key of 8 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.480
 first what I will have to do is 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.150
 the top rope that I'm on 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.920
 extending the one we have tense worth 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.420
 I'm going to make it on the rope 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.150
 left over why I'm holding it 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.760
 to descend I'm going to go up and I'm going to 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.829
 to cross from behind for this I will stay 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.500
 hold the 8 because it can be have 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:43.890
 hostile as you observe and I'm going to put 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.360
 behind here 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.650
 in these moments given the 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.959
 circumstances of this afternoon 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.870
 of this dental cord I'm staying 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.209
 totally blocked but to have a 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.220
 extra security would be convenient to do 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.519
 the following once we have done 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.310
 that first maneuver we now put through 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.140
 inside the carabiner we have the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.709
 rest of rope we make a small vessel 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.840
 and we put it inside the carabiner and 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.859
 we go up and do again with this 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.019
 loop that we have left 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.950
 fix the loop that we have left 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.079
 exactly the same 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.379
 we go back behind and we think 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.750
 that now we tighten the rope and here 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.060
 we are perfectly blocked without 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.579
 no kind of problem right now with 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.739
 total security we can maneuver and 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.049
 do any circumstance now 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.770
 let's go the inverse step that would be 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.450
 we unlock 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.930
 the first one is not going to bring us any 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.930
 problem 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.900
 return to take out the first one is worth attentive 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.900
 now we continue with the first blockade 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.959
 we hold the rope well because 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.640
 when we retire obviously we are going to 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.640
 extend a little fijaros 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.090
 you have to force yourself to unlock 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.069
 and as you can see I'm back 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.880
 perfectly in descent situation 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.340
 in agreement 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.709
 Very good friends 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.800
 well up to here the explanation of the video 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.620
 today it is not another to call her 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.250
 basic lock for him from the short 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.880
 8 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.880
 goodbye
