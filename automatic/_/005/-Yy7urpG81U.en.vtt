action that you want out of this bridge

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.379 
action that you want out of this bridge
it's<00:02:56.680> not<00:02:56.920> limiting<00:02:57.310> in<00:02:57.400> any<00:02:57.549> way<00:02:57.760> which<00:02:58.239> is

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
it's not limiting in any way which is

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.830 
it's not limiting in any way which is
not<00:02:58.569> really<00:02:58.959> nice<00:02:59.109> control<00:03:00.010> wise<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:01.510> can<00:03:01.569> see

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
not really nice control wise you can see

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.390 
not really nice control wise you can see
we've<00:03:02.019> got<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.139> volume<00:03:02.470> at<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.620> front<00:03:02.889> and<00:03:03.129> then

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
we've got a volume at the front and then

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.270 
we've got a volume at the front and then
we<00:03:03.760> have<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.090> two<00:03:04.389> bad<00:03:04.689> EQ<00:03:05.439> so<00:03:06.040> we've<00:03:06.189> got

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
we have the two bad EQ so we've got

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.339 
we have the two bad EQ so we've got
basically<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.790> treble<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.389> a<00:03:07.629> bass<00:03:07.810> which<00:03:08.139> we

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
basically a treble and a bass which we

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.080 
basically a treble and a bass which we
will<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.889> I'll<00:03:09.159> go<00:03:09.310> over<00:03:09.430> all<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.639> sounds<00:03:10.000> and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
will and I'll go over all the sounds and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.399 
will and I'll go over all the sounds and
how<00:03:10.239> much<00:03:10.389> boost<00:03:10.629> and<00:03:10.810> cut<00:03:10.959> with<00:03:11.049> will<00:03:11.230> going

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
how much boost and cut with will going

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.319 
how much boost and cut with will going
on<00:03:11.620> on<00:03:11.739> each<00:03:11.859> one<00:03:12.069> run<00:03:12.609> and<00:03:12.730> plug<00:03:12.879> it<00:03:13.000> in<00:03:13.120> and

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
on on each one run and plug it in and

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.030 
on on each one run and plug it in and
we've<00:03:13.840> got<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.049> jack<00:03:14.260> socket<00:03:14.500> at<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.859> back

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
we've got the jack socket at the back

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.400 
we've got the jack socket at the back
here<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.489> front-loading<00:03:15.910> jack<00:03:16.180> socket<00:03:16.410> and

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
here so a front-loading jack socket and

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.129 
here so a front-loading jack socket and
as<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.620> can<00:03:17.709> see<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.970> control<00:03:19.540> cavity

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
as you can see the control cavity

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.439 
as you can see the control cavity
there's<00:03:20.650> no<00:03:20.829> cavity<00:03:21.250> plate<00:03:21.669> on<00:03:21.819> the<00:03:21.940> back<00:03:22.150> so

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
there's no cavity plate on the back so

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.259 
there's no cavity plate on the back so
it's<00:03:22.629> routed<00:03:23.019> into<00:03:23.379> the<00:03:23.500> body<00:03:23.709> very<00:03:24.639> simple<00:03:25.060> if

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
it's routed into the body very simple if

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.640 
it's routed into the body very simple if
you<00:03:25.419> should<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:25.810> want<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.109> change<00:03:26.410> anything

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
you should you want to change anything

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.830 
you should you want to change anything
