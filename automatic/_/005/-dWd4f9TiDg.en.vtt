00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.720 

okay<00:00:01.260> so<00:00:01.530> I'm<00:00:01.680> today<00:00:02.040> I<00:00:02.070> wanted<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.399> show<00:00:02.550> you<00:00:02.610> a

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
okay so I'm today I wanted to show you a

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.210 
okay so I'm today I wanted to show you a
chicken<00:00:03.300> factory<00:00:03.570> now<00:00:04.350> these<00:00:04.470> are<00:00:04.680> extremely

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
chicken factory now these are extremely

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.600 
chicken factory now these are extremely
useful<00:00:05.370> now<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:05.879> chickens<00:00:06.210> drop<00:00:07.610> all

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
useful now that chickens drop all

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.900 
useful now that chickens drop all
chicken<00:00:09.030> when<00:00:09.719> you<00:00:09.840> kill<00:00:09.990> them<00:00:10.170> now<00:00:10.320> and

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
chicken when you kill them now and

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.100 
chicken when you kill them now and
there's<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.940> lot<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.120> different<00:00:12.480> designs<00:00:12.750> out

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
there's a lot of different designs out

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.919 
there's a lot of different designs out
there<00:00:13.139> boy<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.070> think<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.700> one<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.360> simplest

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
there boy I think this one is a simplest

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.019 
there boy I think this one is a simplest
one<00:00:16.139> basically<00:00:17.010> doesn't<00:00:17.369> really<00:00:17.580> need<00:00:17.850> that

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
one basically doesn't really need that

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.450 
one basically doesn't really need that
much<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.810> build<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.250> so<00:00:20.250> I'm<00:00:20.340> basically

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
much to build it so I'm basically

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.790 
much to build it so I'm basically
checking<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.060> factory<00:00:21.359> we'll<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:21.800> it'll

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
checking the factory we'll just it'll

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.990 
checking the factory we'll just it'll
give<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.039> pretty<00:00:23.550> much<00:00:23.730> unlimited<00:00:23.970> eggs<00:00:24.449> and

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
give you pretty much unlimited eggs and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.720 
give you pretty much unlimited eggs and
also<00:00:27.000> pretty<00:00:27.269> much<00:00:27.449> an<00:00:27.599> American<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:28.289> well<00:00:28.470> so

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
also pretty much an American as well so

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.769 
also pretty much an American as well so
it<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:29.910> takes<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.210> bit<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.359> patience

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
it just takes a bit of patience

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.979 
it just takes a bit of patience
especially<00:00:30.929> if<00:00:31.349> you're<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.590> survival<00:00:31.949> mode<00:00:32.989> so

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
especially if you're in survival mode so

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.139 
especially if you're in survival mode so
the<00:00:34.140> way<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.290> works<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.730> first<00:00:36.000> thing

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the way it works is the first thing

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.430 
the way it works is the first thing
you'll<00:00:36.329> need<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.660> build<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.200> little

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
you'll need to build is this little

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.979 
you'll need to build is this little
building<00:00:37.590> here<00:00:37.760> which<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.180> actual<00:00:39.300> light

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
building here which is the actual light

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.930 
building here which is the actual light
keeping<00:00:40.739> Gary<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.219> chickens<00:00:41.550> where<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.820> get

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
keeping Gary for chickens where you get

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.410 
keeping Gary for chickens where you get
all<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> eggs<00:00:42.300> from<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:43.710> again<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.129> in

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
all the eggs from and again it's in

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.700 
all the eggs from and again it's in
survival<00:00:45.420> mode<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> thing<00:00:46.320> you

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
survival mode this is the thing you

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.810 
survival mode this is the thing you
don't<00:00:46.920> need<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> worry<00:00:47.250> about<00:00:47.370> any<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.730> this

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
don't need to worry about any of this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.340 
don't need to worry about any of this
until<00:00:48.090> you've<00:00:48.420> got<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.809> with<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> large

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
until you've got this with a large

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.279 
until you've got this with a large
chickens<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.980> because<00:00:50.879> obviously<00:00:51.289> you

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
chickens in it because obviously you

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.660 
chickens in it because obviously you
can't<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.590> give<00:00:52.860> yourself<00:00:53.160> eggs<00:00:53.460> or

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
can't just give yourself eggs or

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.930 
can't just give yourself eggs or
anything<00:00:54.829> you<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:55.980> get<00:00:56.100> eggs<00:00:56.280> by<00:00:56.579> walking

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
anything you just get eggs by walking

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.340 
anything you just get eggs by walking
around<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.329> follow<00:00:57.480> any<00:00:57.600> chickens<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.140> drop

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
around and follow any chickens and drop

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.729 
around and follow any chickens and drop
them<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.820> once<00:00:59.820> you've<00:00:59.910> got<00:01:00.090> eggs<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.480> just

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
them and once you've got eggs you just

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.840 
them and once you've got eggs you just
obviously<00:01:01.739> make<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> ladder<00:01:02.640> or

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
obviously make like a ladder or

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.240 
obviously make like a ladder or
something<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.239> here<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.949> keep<00:01:04.949> throwing

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
something up here and just keep throwing

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.210 
something up here and just keep throwing
eggs<00:01:05.519> over<00:01:05.760> there<00:01:05.869> until<00:01:06.869> chickens<00:01:07.320> spawn<00:01:08.040> in

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
eggs over there until chickens spawn in

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.880 
eggs over there until chickens spawn in
here<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.900> then<00:01:09.900> then<00:01:10.080> down<00:01:10.260> down

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
here and then then down down

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.880 
here and then then down down
continuously<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:11.850> eggs<00:01:12.590> they'll<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.710> go

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
continuously like eggs they'll just go

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.810 
continuously like eggs they'll just go
down<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:17.250> only<00:01:17.460> thing<00:01:17.640> with

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
down here but and the only thing with

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.249 
down here but and the only thing with
this<00:01:17.970> design<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.900> use<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> lot<00:01:19.229> of

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
this design is you have to use a lot of

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.960 
this design is you have to use a lot of
science<00:01:19.500> because<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> layer<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.610> water<00:01:20.790> on

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
science because it's a layer of water on

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.640 
science because it's a layer of water on
top<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.330> layer<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.659> signs<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.500> goes

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
top of a layer of signs and then it goes

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.780 
top of a layer of signs and then it goes
into<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:22.950> little<00:01:23.009> canal<00:01:23.460> system<00:01:24.799> but<00:01:25.799> it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
into this little canal system but it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.219 
into this little canal system but it
doesn't<00:01:27.150> really<00:01:27.390> take<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.840> much<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
doesn't really take that much and it

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.719 
doesn't really take that much and it
doesn't<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:28.619> need<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.829> be<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.220> big<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> N

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
doesn't really need to be this big the N

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.039 
doesn't really need to be this big the N
reason<00:01:29.939> I'm<00:01:30.030> only<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.329> big<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.659> gonna<00:01:30.869> like

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
reason I'm only this big is gonna like

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.679 
reason I'm only this big is gonna like
how<00:01:31.850> there's<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.939> channel<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.270> water<00:01:33.390> just

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
how there's a channel of water just

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.499 
how there's a channel of water just
there<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.320> will<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.619> ends<00:01:34.950> right<00:01:35.100> here

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
there and it will it ends right here

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.179 
there and it will it ends right here
since<00:01:36.509> it'll<00:01:36.720> cause<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> mess<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:38.159> is

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
since it'll cause a mess so then that is

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.960 
since it'll cause a mess so then that is
another<00:01:38.610> 8<00:01:39.270> blocks<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.869> water<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.670> once<00:01:41.850> you've

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
another 8 blocks of water so once you've

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.069 
another 8 blocks of water so once you've
got<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.270> all<00:01:42.420> stored<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.720> once<00:01:42.869> you've<00:01:42.960> got

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
got that all stored in once you've got

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.679 
got that all stored in once you've got
enough<00:01:43.259> chickens<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.740> there<00:01:44.360> they'll<00:01:45.360> start

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
enough chickens in there they'll start

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.580 
enough chickens in there they'll start
laying<00:01:45.930> eggs<00:01:47.509> which<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.380> collect

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
laying eggs which you can just collect

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.649 
laying eggs which you can just collect
wherever<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.070> want<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.369> collect<00:01:50.610> them<00:01:50.729> and

then you can either just keep

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.240 
then you can either just keep
continuously<00:01:55.049> adding

and all of them dispensers are hooked up

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.890 
and all of them dispensers are hooked up
to<00:02:40.850> this<00:02:41.060> little<00:02:41.299> mini<00:02:41.420> clocking<00:02:43.900> which

to this little mini clocking which
continuously<00:02:45.410> going<00:02:45.590> around<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.100> that<00:02:46.340> as

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
continuously going around and that as

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.699 
continuously going around and that as
almost<00:02:46.670> that's<00:02:47.030> all<00:02:47.180> hooked<00:02:47.870> up<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> lever

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
almost that's all hooked up to a lever

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.120 
almost that's all hooked up to a lever
and<00:02:49.480> when<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.600> turn<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.049> when<00:02:51.319> you<00:02:51.440> pull<00:02:52.040> the

and when you turn the when you pull the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.830 
and when you turn the when you pull the
lever

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
lever

lever
it'll<00:02:53.840> continuously<00:02:54.380> fire<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.830> eggs<00:02:55.130> out<00:02:55.459> of

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
it'll continuously fire the eggs out of

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.809 
it'll continuously fire the eggs out of
Spencer's<00:02:56.120> here<00:02:56.299> in<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.480> wall<00:02:57.819> and

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
Spencer's here in the wall and

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.509 
Spencer's here in the wall and
eventually<00:02:59.450> it'll<00:02:59.900> come<00:03:00.049> out<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:04.280> then<00:03:04.400> I'll

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
eventually it'll come out and then I'll

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.569 
eventually it'll come out and then I'll
walk<00:03:04.700> into<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.060> fire<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:06.440> burn<00:03:07.010> drop<00:03:07.489> the

walk into the fire and burn drop the

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:08.890 
walk into the fire and burn drop the
stuff<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:07.940> then<00:03:08.060> because<00:03:08.329> they're<00:03:08.480> on<00:03:08.630> fire

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
stuff and then because they're on fire

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.310 
stuff and then because they're on fire
when<00:03:09.079> they<00:03:09.200> die<00:03:09.350> they<00:03:09.680> drop<00:03:10.010> cooked<00:03:10.340> chicken

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
when they die they drop cooked chicken

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.780 
when they die they drop cooked chicken
now<00:03:12.320> there<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:13.630> some<00:03:14.630> straight<00:03:14.989> chickens<00:03:15.410> that

now there is some straight chickens that

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.069 
now there is some straight chickens that
get<00:03:16.790> left<00:03:17.030> behind<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.540> here<00:03:18.370> like<00:03:19.370> there<00:03:19.640> and
