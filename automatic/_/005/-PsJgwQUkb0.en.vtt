thinking<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.920> filter<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.280> by<00:00:11.940> now<00:00:12.120> versus

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
thinking the filter is by now versus

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.410 
thinking the filter is by now versus
250,000<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.710> if<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.309> 250,000<00:00:15.269> not

for about 0 is 1 for 500k there so if
you<00:00:56.699> got<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.260> 20,000<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.920> would

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
you got it for 20,000 it would

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.150 
you got it for 20,000 it would
definitely<00:00:59.250> sell<00:00:59.670> for<00:00:59.879> 400<00:01:00.359> k<00:01:00.539> um<00:01:01.010> since<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
definitely sell for 400 k um since this

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.539 
definitely sell for 400 k um since this
one<00:01:02.340> isn't<00:01:02.609> selling<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.080> that's<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> lowest

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
one isn't selling and that's the lowest

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.230 
one isn't selling and that's the lowest
so<00:01:05.549> that's<00:01:05.760> 300<00:01:06.659> k<00:01:06.780> profit<00:01:07.260> right<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.369> so

so that's 300 k profit right there so

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.310 
so that's 300 k profit right there so
it's<00:01:09.479> an<00:01:09.659> easy<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.500> simple<00:01:10.710> way<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:12.320> make

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
most of the time what I think happens is

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.080 
most of the time what I think happens is
kids<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:41.130> don't<00:01:41.880> not<00:01:42.299> necessarily<00:01:43.020> kids<00:01:43.259> but

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
kids like don't not necessarily kids but

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.370 
kids like don't not necessarily kids but
people<00:01:45.090> don't<00:01:45.299> know<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:46.110> they

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
people don't know like what they

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.889 
people don't know like what they
actually<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.860> for<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.310> they<00:01:47.460> put<00:01:47.729> just<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
actually go for so they put just like a

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.649 
actually go for so they put just like a
random<00:01:49.610> price<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:50.820> because<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.210> these

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
random price up because it these

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.090 
random price up because it these
collectibles<00:01:52.140> were<00:01:52.229> out<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> while<00:01:52.649> ago<00:01:52.680> so

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
collectibles were out a while ago so

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.679 
collectibles were out a while ago so
they'll<00:01:53.250> probably<00:01:53.430> think<00:01:54.119> they're<00:01:54.390> useless

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
they'll probably think they're useless

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.959

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
you should do this it's easy property

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.860 
you should do this it's easy property
you<00:05:31.540> get<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:31.840> a<00:05:31.870> million<00:05:32.140> in<00:05:32.380> no<00:05:32.620> time<00:05:33.060> so<00:05:34.060> let's

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
you get to a million in no time so let's

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.310 
you get to a million in no time so let's
see<00:05:35.200> let's<00:05:35.560> do<00:05:35.710> 550<00:05:36.520> because<00:05:37.510> i<00:05:37.660> saw<00:05:37.930> there<00:05:38.260> was
