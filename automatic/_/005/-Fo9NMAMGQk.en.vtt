what's up guys in turn out that scare

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.710 
what's up guys in turn out that scare
and<00:00:02.100> today<00:00:02.310> we're<00:00:02.490> gonna<00:00:02.550> be<00:00:02.879> doing<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.270> review

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
and today we're gonna be doing a review

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:13.120 
and today we're gonna be doing a review
of<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.080> dell<00:00:04.589> mini<00:00:04.859> 9

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.100 

all<00:00:14.130> right<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.550> Dell<00:00:14.730> 99<00:00:15.180> was<00:00:15.540> probably

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
all right so the Dell 99 was probably

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.080 
all right so the Dell 99 was probably
one<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.620> the<00:00:16.800> first<00:00:16.980> netbooks<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.670> be<00:00:17.760> released

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
one of the first netbooks to be released

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.430 
one of the first netbooks to be released
on<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.300> netbook<00:00:18.690> craze<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:18.960> happened<00:00:19.410> a

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
on the netbook craze that happened a

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.260 
on the netbook craze that happened a
couple<00:00:19.470> years<00:00:19.740> ago<00:00:20.040> I<00:00:20.310> believe<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.060> was

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
couple years ago I believe this was

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.010 
couple years ago I believe this was
released<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.960> about<00:00:22.220> 2008<00:00:23.220> 2009<00:00:23.940> time<00:00:24.690> period

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
released in about 2008 2009 time period

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.109 
released in about 2008 2009 time period
era<00:00:25.230> but<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> reason<00:00:26.279> why<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.430> bought<00:00:26.820> this

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
era but the reason why I bought this

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.720 
era but the reason why I bought this
it's<00:00:27.509> because<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:28.500> still<00:00:28.770> very<00:00:28.950> relevant<00:00:29.490> in

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
it's because it's still very relevant in

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.999 
it's because it's still very relevant in
today's<00:00:30.090> netbook<00:00:30.630> market<00:00:30.840> because<00:00:31.290> if<00:00:31.919> you

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
today's netbook market because if you

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.250 
today's netbook market because if you
don't<00:00:32.189> know<00:00:32.340> netbooks<00:00:32.880> all<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.930> same

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
don't know netbooks all have the same

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.560 
don't know netbooks all have the same
processor<00:00:35.010> type<00:00:35.250> as<00:00:35.490> well<00:00:36.000> as<00:00:36.060> the<00:00:36.329> same

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
processor type as well as the same

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.990 
processor type as well as the same
graphics<00:00:37.350> card<00:00:37.650> and<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.190> same<00:00:38.400> amount<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> RAM

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
graphics card and the same amount of RAM

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.680 
graphics card and the same amount of RAM
1<00:00:39.870> gigabyte<00:00:40.730> but<00:00:41.730> what<00:00:41.910> makes<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.480> one

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
1 gigabyte but what makes this one

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.990 
1 gigabyte but what makes this one
different<00:00:42.720> is<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.620> actually<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.280> sub

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
different is that it's actually a sub

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.610 
different is that it's actually a sub
compact<00:00:47.690> netbook<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.810> actually<00:00:49.200> smaller

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
compact netbook it's actually smaller

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.010 
compact netbook it's actually smaller
than<00:00:49.740> your<00:00:50.010> average<00:00:50.160> netbook<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:50.810> here<00:00:51.810> I<00:00:51.840> have

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
than your average netbook so here I have

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.290 
than your average netbook so here I have
a<00:00:53.600> DVD<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.870> case<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.790> to<00:00:56.790> compare<00:00:57.120> that

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
a DVD in a case and to compare that

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.140 
a DVD in a case and to compare that
that's<00:00:57.660> how<00:00:57.870> big<00:00:58.110> this<00:00:58.320> netbook<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:59.150> probably

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
that's how big this netbook is probably

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.460 
that's how big this netbook is probably
something<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.570> little<00:01:00.750> bit<00:01:00.840> more<00:01:00.870> relevant

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
something a little bit more relevant

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.800 
something a little bit more relevant
here<00:01:02.870> see<00:01:03.870> here's<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.470> mouse<00:01:05.689> your<00:01:06.689> average

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
here see here's a mouse your average

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.710 
here see here's a mouse your average
computer<00:01:07.200> mouse<00:01:07.759> as<00:01:08.759> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
computer mouse as you can see it's a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.499 
computer mouse as you can see it's a
very<00:01:09.750> small<00:01:10.080> netbook<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.490> would<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.299> say

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
very small netbook I would have to say

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.209 
very small netbook I would have to say
that<00:01:12.930> there's<00:01:13.530> your<00:01:13.820> business<00:01:14.820> card<00:01:16.070> I'd<00:01:17.070> have

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 
that there's your business card I'd have

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.340 
that there's your business card I'd have
to<00:01:17.340> say<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:17.969> a<00:01:17.999> very<00:01:18.329> small<00:01:18.899> netbook

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
to say that this is a very small netbook

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.560 
to say that this is a very small netbook
and<00:01:19.619> that's<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.670> reason<00:01:20.939> why<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.060> bought<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.420> is

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and that's the reason why I bought it is

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.749 
and that's the reason why I bought it is
because<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.020> ultra<00:01:22.499> portable<00:01:22.799> now<00:01:23.579> this

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
because it's ultra portable now this

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.520 
because it's ultra portable now this
thing<00:01:23.999> that<00:01:24.420> MIT<00:01:24.630> links<00:01:24.990> are<00:01:25.109> different<00:01:25.409> than

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
thing that MIT links are different than

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.770 
thing that MIT links are different than
other<00:01:25.679> ones<00:01:25.770> since<00:01:26.249> it's<00:01:26.429> so<00:01:26.549> small<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.240> does

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
other ones since it's so small it does

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.599 
other ones since it's so small it does
lack<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.229> hard<00:01:28.439> drive<00:01:28.530> space<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.219> it<00:01:29.399> has<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
lack in hard drive space it is it has a

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:33.800 
lack in hard drive space it is it has a
16<00:01:30.299> gigabyte<00:01:30.569> SSD<00:01:31.850> which<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:32.999> a<00:01:33.119> solid-state

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
16 gigabyte SSD which is a solid-state

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.580 
16 gigabyte SSD which is a solid-state
drive<00:01:34.219> now<00:01:35.240> why<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> thought<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.049> was<00:01:37.259> cool<00:01:37.439> is

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
drive now why I thought that was cool is

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.590 
drive now why I thought that was cool is
because<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.189> only<00:01:38.490> need<00:01:38.819> it<00:01:38.969> for<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.240> internet

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
because I only need it for the internet

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.359 
because I only need it for the internet
strictly<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.649> I<00:01:40.710> don't<00:01:40.920> need<00:01:41.069> to<00:01:41.159> store

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
strictly and I don't need to store

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.249 
strictly and I don't need to store
anything<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.819> it<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.179> 16<00:01:42.600> gigabyte<00:01:42.810> SSD

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
anything on it so the 16 gigabyte SSD

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.739 
anything on it so the 16 gigabyte SSD
was<00:01:43.619> perfect<00:01:44.039> for<00:01:44.219> me<00:01:44.310> because<00:01:44.509> solid<00:01:45.509> state

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:45.749 
was perfect for me because solid state

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:47.749 
was perfect for me because solid state
disks<00:01:46.229> offer<00:01:46.409> more<00:01:46.889> speed<00:01:47.249> so<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.579> will

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
disks offer more speed so this will

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.819 
disks offer more speed so this will
actually<00:01:48.179> be<00:01:48.329> faster<00:01:48.899> than<00:01:49.499> your<00:01:49.679> average

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
actually be faster than your average

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.219 
actually be faster than your average
netbook<00:01:50.399> as<00:01:50.579> well<00:01:51.119> as<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.389> remove<00:01:51.719> the<00:01:51.929> stop

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
netbook as well as I remove the stop

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.969 
netbook as well as I remove the stop
Windows<00:01:52.649> XP<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.399> replaced<00:01:53.819> Ubuntu<00:01:54.569> with<00:01:54.810> it

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
Windows XP and replaced Ubuntu with it

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.580 
Windows XP and replaced Ubuntu with it
which<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> Linux<00:01:56.700> distribution<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.590> let's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
which is a Linux distribution and let's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.529 
which is a Linux distribution and let's
just<00:01:58.770> do<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> quick<00:01:59.399> Hardware<00:01:59.969> review<00:02:00.299> here

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
just do a quick Hardware review here

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.629 
just do a quick Hardware review here
this<00:02:01.049> comes<00:02:01.350> with<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> 9<00:02:01.859> inch<00:02:02.069> screen<00:02:02.189> that's

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:02.639 
this comes with a 9 inch screen that's

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:04.969

let<00:03:02.390> me<00:03:02.420> get<00:03:02.630> a<00:03:02.660> better<00:03:02.960> angle<00:03:04.180> this<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:05.240> a<00:03:05.390> bun

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
let me get a better angle this is a bun

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.630 
let me get a better angle this is a bun
to<00:03:06.460> 11.4<00:03:08.140> now<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.440> bunch<00:03:09.710> of<00:03:09.860> runs<00:03:10.130> insanely

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
to 11.4 now a bunch of runs insanely

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.550 
to 11.4 now a bunch of runs insanely
fast<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.270> I<00:03:11.300> think<00:03:11.600> it<00:03:11.690> is<00:03:11.810> one<00:03:12.170> of<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.350> best

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
fast and I think it is one of the best

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.110 
fast and I think it is one of the best
operating<00:03:13.040> systems<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.520> can<00:03:13.640> put<00:03:13.820> on<00:03:13.970> this

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
operating systems you can put on this

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.090 
operating systems you can put on this
netbook<00:03:14.360> now<00:03:15.020> this<00:03:15.200> netbook<00:03:15.410> is<00:03:15.800> unique

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
netbook now this netbook is unique

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.760

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
because it does support Mac OS X but I

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.620
