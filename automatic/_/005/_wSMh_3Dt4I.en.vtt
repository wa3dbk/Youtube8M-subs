transmission<00:03:22.750> so<00:03:22.900> even<00:03:23.170> erica<00:03:23.530> can<00:03:23.680> drive<00:03:23.890> it

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
transmission so even erica can drive it

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.270 
transmission so even erica can drive it
and<00:03:24.420> reverse<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:26.470> course<00:03:26.800> all<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.040> your

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
and reverse of course all of your

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.100 
and reverse of course all of your
shifting<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.940> done<00:03:28.210> with<00:03:28.450> these<00:03:28.600> paddle

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
shifting is done with these paddle

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.970 
shifting is done with these paddle
shifters<00:03:29.590> here<00:03:29.980> this<00:03:30.220> is<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.550> upside

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
shifters here this is the upside

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.740 
shifters here this is the upside
and<00:03:32.099> this<00:03:32.459> would<00:03:32.640> be<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.909> down<00:03:33.090> side<00:03:33.420> over

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
and this would be the down side over

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.729 
and this would be the down side over
here<00:03:35.480> 220<00:03:36.480> mile<00:03:36.629> an<00:03:36.810> hour<00:03:36.900> speed<00:03:37.080> 0<00:03:37.319> which<00:03:37.590> we

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
here 220 mile an hour speed 0 which we

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.830 
here 220 mile an hour speed 0 which we
could<00:03:37.920> probably<00:03:38.069> get<00:03:38.549> to

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
could probably get to

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.050 
could probably get to
yellow<00:03:40.470> tak

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
yellow tak

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.540
