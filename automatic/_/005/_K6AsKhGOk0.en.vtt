natural-born<00:04:38.500> athletes<00:04:39.500> in<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.800> sense<00:04:40.040> that

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
natural-born athletes in the sense that

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.570 
natural-born athletes in the sense that
Michael<00:04:40.520> Jordan<00:04:40.910> is<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:41.510> and<00:04:42.430> Terrell<00:04:43.430> Owens

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
Michael Jordan is and and Terrell Owens

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.670 
Michael Jordan is and and Terrell Owens
and<00:04:43.940> so<00:04:44.090> on<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:44.390> so<00:04:44.450> forth<00:04:44.570> that's<00:04:45.410> correct

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
and so on and so forth that's correct

and so on and so forth that's correct
they're<00:04:45.980> born<00:04:46.370> with<00:04:46.730> the<00:04:46.850> ability<00:04:46.880> that's

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
they're born with the ability that's

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.690 
they're born with the ability that's
absolutely<00:04:48.290> and<00:04:48.500> you<00:04:48.530> select<00:04:49.100> that<00:04:49.190> so<00:04:49.520> that's

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
absolutely and you select that so that's

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.010 
absolutely and you select that so that's
part<00:04:50.000> of<00:04:50.090> your<00:04:50.210> skill<00:04:50.540> but<00:04:50.660> then<00:04:50.780> you<00:04:50.870> have<00:04:50.990> to

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
part of your skill but then you have to

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.200 
part of your skill but then you have to
harness<00:04:51.350> that<00:04:51.500> yes<00:04:52.040> when<00:04:52.280> we<00:04:52.370> try<00:04:52.640> them

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
harness that yes when we try them

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.909 
harness that yes when we try them
