00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
is a couple things one will automate

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.450 
is a couple things one will automate
everything<00:00:19.420> for<00:00:19.930> you<00:00:20.080> but<00:00:20.289> you'll<00:00:21.100> notice

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
everything for you but you'll notice

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.089 
everything for you but you'll notice
that<00:00:21.849> your<00:00:22.240> focusing<00:00:22.869> is<00:00:23.050> set<00:00:23.230> to<00:00:23.439> AI<00:00:23.680> servo

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
that your focusing is set to AI servo

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.429 
that your focusing is set to AI servo
which<00:00:24.939> means<00:00:25.240> it's<00:00:25.480> going<00:00:25.660> to<00:00:25.750> continuously

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
which means it's going to continuously

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.830 
which means it's going to continuously
focus<00:00:26.920> as<00:00:27.250> long<00:00:27.670> as<00:00:27.939> the<00:00:28.179> shutter<00:00:28.449> button<00:00:28.750> is

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
focus as long as the shutter button is

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.679 
focus as long as the shutter button is
pressed<00:00:29.109> halfway<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.880> other<00:00:31.000> thing<00:00:31.330> the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
pressed halfway the other thing the

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.020 
pressed halfway the other thing the
camera<00:00:32.080> optimizes<00:00:32.740> the<00:00:32.770> drive<00:00:33.190> mode<00:00:33.520> to

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
camera optimizes the drive mode to

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.389 
camera optimizes the drive mode to
continuous<00:00:34.660> shooting<00:00:34.899> so<00:00:35.680> that<00:00:35.829> as<00:00:36.129> long<00:00:36.370> as

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
continuous shooting so that as long as

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.369 
continuous shooting so that as long as
you<00:00:36.640> hold<00:00:36.879> down<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.329> shutter<00:00:37.570> button<00:00:37.660> the

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
you hold down the shutter button the

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.290 
you hold down the shutter button the
camera<00:00:38.590> will<00:00:38.890> continuously<00:00:39.399> take<00:00:39.820> pictures

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
camera will continuously take pictures

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.569 
camera will continuously take pictures
at<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:40.780> rate<00:00:41.050> of<00:00:41.079> about<00:00:41.350> three<00:00:42.039> and<00:00:42.100> a<00:00:42.190> half<00:00:42.219> per

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
at a rate of about three and a half per

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.639 
at a rate of about three and a half per
second<00:00:43.090> so<00:00:43.629> you<00:00:43.690> have<00:00:43.930> a<00:00:43.960> better<00:00:44.140> chance<00:00:44.500> of

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
second so you have a better chance of

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.770 
second so you have a better chance of
capturing<00:00:45.070> the<00:00:45.250> action<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:46.149> problem<00:00:46.629> with

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
capturing the action the problem with

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.709 
capturing the action the problem with
this<00:00:46.899> mode<00:00:47.230> is<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:47.980> ISO<00:00:48.610> is<00:00:48.789> set<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:49.090> auto<00:00:49.329> and

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
this mode is that ISO is set to auto and

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.350 
this mode is that ISO is set to auto and
white<00:00:50.289> balance<00:00:50.649> is<00:00:50.800> set<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.100> auto<00:00:51.280> now<00:00:52.149> white

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
balance being set to auto is okay if

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.430 
balance being set to auto is okay if
you're<00:00:54.640> outdoors<00:00:54.789> but<00:00:55.750> if<00:00:55.840> it's<00:00:56.020> an<00:00:56.140> indoor

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
you're outdoors but if it's an indoor

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.590 
you're outdoors but if it's an indoor
event<00:00:56.829> you<00:00:57.160> may<00:00:57.280> want<00:00:57.520> to<00:00:57.579> set<00:00:57.820> this<00:00:58.059> to<00:00:58.449> either

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
event you may want to set this to either

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.170 
event you may want to set this to either
tungsten<00:00:59.170> or<00:00:59.289> florescent<00:00:59.800> to<00:01:00.309> compensate<00:01:00.850> for

tungsten or florescent to compensate for

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.389 
tungsten or florescent to compensate for
the<00:01:01.359> color<00:01:01.570> temperature<00:01:01.809> so<00:01:02.559> instead<00:01:02.980> let's

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
the color temperature so instead let's

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.720 
the color temperature so instead let's
go<00:01:03.579> ahead<00:01:03.789> and<00:01:03.969> change<00:01:04.210> your<00:01:04.390> mode<00:01:04.540> dial<00:01:04.750> to

go ahead and change your mode dial to

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.840 
go ahead and change your mode dial to
shutter<00:01:06.730> priority<00:01:06.940> it's<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.810> TV<00:01:08.290> option<00:01:08.950> TV

stands<00:01:10.150> for<00:01:10.360> time<00:01:10.570> value<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.500> what<00:01:11.890> this<00:01:12.040> does

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
stands for time value and what this does

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.000 
stands for time value and what this does
is<00:01:12.670> allow<00:01:12.970> us<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.870> set<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.200> shutter<00:01:14.380> speed<00:01:14.650> and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
is allow us to set the shutter speed and

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.010 
is allow us to set the shutter speed and
that's<00:01:15.400> exactly<00:01:15.790> what<00:01:16.120> we<00:01:16.240> want<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.510> do<00:01:16.660> when

dealing with sports we want a very fast
shutter<00:01:19.060> speed<00:01:19.450> so<00:01:19.660> that<00:01:20.260> we<00:01:20.560> can<00:01:20.710> stop<00:01:21.010> the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
shutter speed so that we can stop the

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630

fine remember you don't want to use the

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.170 
fine remember you don't want to use the

flash even though it is possible to use
in<00:02:16.359> this<00:02:16.510> mode<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.049> want<00:02:17.409> to<00:02:17.530> avoid<00:02:17.799> using<00:02:17.859> it

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
in this mode you want to avoid using it

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.119 
in this mode you want to avoid using it
because<00:02:18.489> again<00:02:18.849> this<00:02:19.780> flash<00:02:20.140> is<00:02:20.500> really<00:02:20.980> only

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
because again this flash is really only

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.119 
because again this flash is really only
good<00:02:21.430> for<00:02:21.760> about<00:02:22.060> 15<00:02:22.659> feet<00:02:22.989> and<00:02:23.260> it's<00:02:23.739> going<00:02:23.920> to

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
good for about 15 feet and it's going to

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.069 
good for about 15 feet and it's going to
dramatically<00:02:24.700> slow<00:02:25.060> down<00:02:25.299> the<00:02:25.569> continuous

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
enough I can just increase it a little

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.000 
enough I can just increase it a little
bit<00:03:40.299> more<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.750> then<00:03:41.319> take<00:03:41.500> another<00:03:41.650> picture

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
wouldn't need as fast of a shutter speed

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.809 
wouldn't need as fast of a shutter speed
as<00:03:47.019> if<00:03:47.409> the<00:03:47.560> action<00:03:47.889> we're<00:03:48.099> moving<00:03:48.400> across<00:03:48.699> the

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
as if the action we're moving across the

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.520 
as if the action we're moving across the
frame<00:03:49.269> so<00:03:49.840> press<00:03:50.079> the<00:03:50.109> shutter<00:03:50.379> button

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
frame so press the shutter button

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.149 
frame so press the shutter button
halfway<00:03:51.780> right<00:03:52.780> now<00:03:52.989> my<00:03:53.620> aperture<00:03:54.040> is

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
halfway right now my aperture is

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.969 
halfway right now my aperture is
blinking<00:03:54.669> at<00:03:54.819> me<00:03:54.849> because<00:03:55.269> F<00:03:55.750> 3.5<00:03:56.590> is<00:03:56.829> the

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:56.979 
blinking at me because F 3.5 is the

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:59.610 
blinking at me because F 3.5 is the
widest<00:03:57.459> possible<00:03:57.699> aperture<00:03:58.419> I<00:03:58.449> can<00:03:58.780> set<00:03:59.079> using

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
widest possible aperture I can set using

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.520 
widest possible aperture I can set using
this<00:03:59.739> lens<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.419> my<00:04:01.419> shutter<00:04:01.750> speed<00:04:02.109> is<00:04:02.349> not

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
this lens and my shutter speed is not

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.649 
this lens and my shutter speed is not
allowing<00:04:02.979> for<00:04:03.220> enough<00:04:03.459> light<00:04:03.729> so<00:04:04.060> it's

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 
allowing for enough light so it's

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:05.939 
allowing for enough light so it's
warning<00:04:04.989> me<00:04:05.049> that<00:04:05.169> the<00:04:05.409> image<00:04:05.620> will<00:04:05.769> be<00:04:05.919> a

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
warning me that the image will be a

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.399 
warning me that the image will be a
little<00:04:06.099> bit<00:04:06.310> dark<00:04:06.549> if<00:04:07.120> this<00:04:07.419> is<00:04:07.569> the<00:04:07.720> case<00:04:07.930> I'm

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
little bit dark if this is the case I'm

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.369 
little bit dark if this is the case I'm
going<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.650> need<00:04:08.859> to<00:04:09.069> slow<00:04:09.549> down<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.930> shutter

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
going to need to slow down the shutter

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.849 
going to need to slow down the shutter
speed<00:04:11.590> or<00:04:11.919> increase<00:04:12.849> the<00:04:13.030> ISO<00:04:13.530> because<00:04:14.530> I

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
speed or increase the ISO because I

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:15.869 
speed or increase the ISO because I
don't<00:04:15.040> want<00:04:15.159> to<00:04:15.220> slow<00:04:15.370> down<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.579> shutter

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
don't want to slow down the shutter

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.060 
don't want to slow down the shutter
speed<00:04:16.030> too<00:04:16.329> much<00:04:16.599> I'm<00:04:17.470> going<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.739> bring<00:04:17.919> that

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
speed too much I'm going to bring that

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.219 
speed too much I'm going to bring that
down<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.340> 1<00:04:18.639> over<00:04:18.849> 500<00:04:19.449> I<00:04:19.570> think<00:04:19.780> that's<00:04:19.930> fine

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
down to 1 over 500 I think that's fine

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.969 
down to 1 over 500 I think that's fine
but<00:04:20.889> I'm<00:04:21.039> also<00:04:21.190> going<00:04:21.549> to<00:04:21.639> increase<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.539> ISO

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
but I'm also going to increase the ISO

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.110 
but I'm also going to increase the ISO
to<00:04:23.979> 400<00:04:24.639> press<00:04:25.479> set<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.669> go<00:04:27.669> down

to 400 press set and go down

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.100 
to 400 press set and go down
now<00:04:28.599> I'm<00:04:28.779> okay

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
now I'm okay

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.410 
now I'm okay
my<00:04:29.320> aperture<00:04:29.650> is<00:04:29.770> at<00:04:29.920> f5<00:04:30.340> and<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:31.030> can<00:04:31.210> go<00:04:31.330> ahead

my aperture is at f5 and I can go ahead

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.380
