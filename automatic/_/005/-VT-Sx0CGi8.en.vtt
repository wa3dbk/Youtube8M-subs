is<00:01:52.210> sort<00:01:53.210> of<00:01:53.240> update<00:01:53.420> is<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.110> Avatar<00:01:54.560> system

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
is sort of update is the Avatar system

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.800 
is sort of update is the Avatar system
and<00:01:55.340> if<00:01:55.520> you've<00:01:55.700> noticed<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:56.180> before<00:01:56.300> but<00:01:56.570> the

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
and if you've noticed it before but the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.290 
and if you've noticed it before but the
appetizers<00:01:57.320> used<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.650> be<00:01:57.800> sort<00:01:58.130> of<00:01:58.300> smaller

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
appetizers used to be sort of smaller

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.190 
appetizers used to be sort of smaller
and<00:01:59.680> chunkier<00:02:01.150> whereas<00:02:02.150> now<00:02:02.330> they've

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
and chunkier whereas now they've

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.600 
and chunkier whereas now they've
actually<00:02:03.350> gone<00:02:03.560> full<00:02:03.830> size<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:04.310> their<00:02:04.460> heads

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
actually gone full size so their heads

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.130 
actually gone full size so their heads
actually<00:02:04.940> in<00:02:05.030> proportion<00:02:05.510> with<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.659> body<00:02:05.930> and

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
actually in proportion with the body and

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.719 
actually in proportion with the body and
the<00:02:06.200> reason<00:02:06.830> for<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:07.010> is<00:02:07.220> because<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.490> lot<00:02:07.700> of

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
the reason for that is because a lot of

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.249 
the reason for that is because a lot of
the<00:02:07.820> Kinect<00:02:08.179> games<00:02:08.420> are<00:02:08.659> about<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.140> be

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
the Kinect games are about to be

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.350 
the Kinect games are about to be
released<00:02:09.799> in<00:02:10.069> about<00:02:10.159> 10<00:02:10.489> days<00:02:10.519> time<00:02:10.879> actually

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
released in about 10 days time actually

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.720 
released in about 10 days time actually
use<00:02:11.900> your<00:02:12.080> avatar<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:12.830> for<00:02:13.159> example<00:02:13.250> whether

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
use your avatar so for example whether

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.820 
use your avatar so for example whether
you're<00:02:13.909> playing<00:02:14.090> kinect<00:02:14.540> adventures<00:02:14.629> or<00:02:15.350> even

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
you're playing kinect adventures or even

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.650 
you're playing kinect adventures or even
playing<00:02:16.069> kinect<00:02:16.370> joyride<00:02:16.790> your<00:02:17.150> avatar<00:02:17.510> will

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
playing kinect joyride your avatar will

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.860 
playing kinect joyride your avatar will
actually<00:02:17.900> sit<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.470> those<00:02:18.800> games<00:02:19.130> and

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
actually sit in those games and

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.180 
actually sit in those games and
I<00:02:19.900> think<00:02:20.290> what's<00:02:20.500> happening<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.069> actually

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
I think what's happening is you actually

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.550 
I think what's happening is you actually
in<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.489> full-size<00:02:21.970> avatar<00:02:22.870> rather<00:02:23.140> than<00:02:23.349> a

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
in the full-size avatar rather than a

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.229 
in the full-size avatar rather than a
small<00:02:23.950> body<00:02:24.129> in<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.370> giant<00:02:24.580> head<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.940> actually

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
small body in a giant head to actually

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.390 
small body in a giant head to actually
play<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.870> game<00:02:26.140> as<00:02:26.230> if<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.440> makes<00:02:26.650> sense<00:02:26.860> so

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
play the game as if that makes sense so

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.589 
play the game as if that makes sense so
what<00:02:27.580> happened<00:02:27.819> is<00:02:27.849> the<00:02:28.000> first<00:02:28.209> time<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.480> go

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
what happened is the first time you go

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.199 
what happened is the first time you go
to<00:02:28.659> customize<00:02:29.140> your<00:02:29.230> avatar<00:02:29.790> what<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.879> will<00:02:31.000> do

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
to customize your avatar what it will do

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.300 
to customize your avatar what it will do
is<00:02:31.450> go<00:02:32.110> ahead<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.349> resize<00:02:32.769> all<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.069> clothing

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
is go ahead and resize all the clothing

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.820 
is go ahead and resize all the clothing
so<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.060> believe<00:02:34.269> some<00:02:34.659> of<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.810> clothing<00:02:35.140> won't

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
so I believe some of the clothing won't

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.500 
so I believe some of the clothing won't
be<00:02:35.980> available<00:02:36.250> straight<00:02:36.700> away<00:02:36.909> as<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.120> believe

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
be available straight away as I believe

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.880 
be available straight away as I believe
there<00:02:37.629> will<00:02:37.690> be<00:02:37.780> updates<00:02:38.140> for<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:38.470> clothing

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
there will be updates for the clothing

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.100 
there will be updates for the clothing
whether<00:02:39.459> they<00:02:39.610> stretch<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.120> resize<00:02:40.480> them<00:02:40.720> or

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
whether they stretch and resize them or

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.649 
whether they stretch and resize them or
however<00:02:41.440> they<00:02:41.709> adjust<00:02:42.040> amazed<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:43.540> what

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
however they adjust amazed it's what

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:44.789 
however they adjust amazed it's what
i've<00:02:43.720> done<00:02:43.840> here<00:02:43.900> is<00:02:44.140> just<00:02:44.349> gone<00:02:44.530> into<00:02:44.650> the

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
i've done here is just gone into the

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.880 
i've done here is just gone into the
Avatar<00:02:45.190> panel<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.349> see<00:02:47.349> if<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.470> can<00:02:47.620> show<00:02:47.829> you

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
Avatar panel and see if I can show you

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.569 
Avatar panel and see if I can show you
that<00:02:48.129> while<00:02:48.879> it<00:02:49.030> loads<00:02:50.040> there<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.159> go<00:02:51.370> now

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
that while it loads there you go now

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.190 
that while it loads there you go now

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
probably won't show on mine because I've

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.360 
probably won't show on mine because I've
actually<00:02:53.379> had<00:02:53.709> this<00:02:53.950> dashboard<00:02:54.790> update<00:02:56.340> for<00:02:57.340> a

okay<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.140> in<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.319> case<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:23.430> would<00:03:23.550> say<00:03:23.730> that

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
okay and in this case it would say that

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.130 
okay and in this case it would say that
it<00:03:23.940> was<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.090> problem<00:03:24.420> because<00:03:24.569> I<00:03:24.750> did<00:03:24.959> mine

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
it was a problem because I did mine

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.780 
it was a problem because I did mine
yesterday<00:03:25.170> when<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:25.709> got<00:03:25.890> this<00:03:25.980> new<00:03:26.190> update<00:03:26.310> so

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
yesterday when I got this new update so

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.100 
yesterday when I got this new update so
I'm<00:03:27.180> not<00:03:27.239> too<00:03:27.360> worried<00:03:27.720> about<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.080> be

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
I'm not too worried about that to be

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.860 
I'm not too worried about that to be
honest<00:03:30.860> so<00:03:31.860> it's<00:03:32.010> all<00:03:32.099> pretty<00:03:32.310> much<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:33.750> know

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
honest so it's all pretty much you know

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.089 
honest so it's all pretty much you know
it's<00:03:33.989> all<00:03:34.110> pretty<00:03:34.260> much<00:03:34.349> the<00:03:34.470> same<00:03:34.650> as

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
it's all pretty much the same as
