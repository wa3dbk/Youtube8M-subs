 according to m 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.240

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.480
 method 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.710

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.689
 m 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:34.570

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.889
 we laughed 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.889
 I immediately 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:08.809
 came on the scene 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:12.219
 the humans cadh to grab them tome sucided 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:16.069
 it's not my fault nobody knows who mine is 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:22.709
 this something 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.569
 It's my fault 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.029
 the apal is a daily star sailor and disordered behavior in the mountains 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.889
 it's me who told them that in the end it will go helped in his collection 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.639
 in the word meuse 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.709
 claimed to dexia am fanned skate that to attract participate the most valuable 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.459

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.799

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:42.970
 this report brings 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.200
 in need of cash especially I try 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.309
 but the police jumped at the opportunity 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.639
 but in fact it did not take strachan on the basis of three-year-old grapple 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.109
 the assembly at the conclusion inquiry amstad likely match and involved per year 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.819

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.019
 eric woerth 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.969
 the police may be right 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.379
 they are there to watch over the interests of the people 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.579
 they are even paid to put their lives in jeopardy in their quest for justice and 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.579
 equity 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.629
 but these are not explain why all that is possible to draw 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:30.629

 but as no need because the troops ended in themselves 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.369
