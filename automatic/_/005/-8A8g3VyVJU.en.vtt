00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
one thing that happened with the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.810 
one thing that happened with the
packaging<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.840> mine<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.340> actual

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
packaging of mine is that the actual

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.119 
packaging of mine is that the actual
product<00:01:03.300> fell<00:01:03.629> out<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:04.439> coming<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.890> now

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
product fell out it's not coming out now

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.670 
product fell out it's not coming out now
so<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.580> guess<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.880> fixed<00:01:06.150> itself<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:07.350> it's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
so I guess it fixed itself but it's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.560 
so I guess it fixed itself but it's
glued<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> back<00:01:08.490> there<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.150> mine<00:01:09.360> isn't

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
glued on the back there and mine isn't

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.230 
glued on the back there and mine isn't
glued<00:01:09.869> anymore<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.549> yeah<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.210> a

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
glued anymore but so yeah that was a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.850 
glued anymore but so yeah that was a
negative<00:01:12.510> about<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> products<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.590> ever<00:01:13.680> had

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
negative about the products and ever had

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.800 
negative about the products and ever had
it<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.159> very<00:01:14.340> long<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.299> came<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.689> of

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
it for very long and it just came out of

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.719 
it for very long and it just came out of
the<00:01:15.900> compact<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.890> that's<00:01:17.220> what<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.460> looks<00:01:17.580> like

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the compact so that's what it looks like

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.859 
the compact so that's what it looks like
realistically

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
realistically

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.230 
realistically
but<00:01:19.409> I'll<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:20.009> put<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.580> my<00:01:20.759> finger<00:01:20.820> there

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
but I'll just put it on my finger there

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.060 
but I'll just put it on my finger there
so<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.229> pigmented<00:01:22.799> as

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
so as you can see it is pigmented as

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.929 
so as you can see it is pigmented as
anything<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.320> that<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.950> looks<00:01:26.820> like

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
anything and that is what it looks like

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.749 
anything and that is what it looks like
on<00:01:27.270> my<00:01:27.720> wrist<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.530> definitely<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.700> more

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
on my wrist it's definitely a more

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.910 
on my wrist it's definitely a more
in-your-face<00:01:30.390> highlighter<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:31.770> not

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
more than what I normally would just so

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.510 
more than what I normally would just so

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
it will show up on camera so I'm just

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.249 
it will show up on camera so I'm just

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
on this much in real life um so it is

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.210 
on this much in real life um so it is
definitely<00:03:13.459> super<00:03:14.270> shimmery<00:03:15.220> definitely

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
definitely super shimmery definitely

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.520 
definitely super shimmery definitely
noticeable<00:03:16.820> but<00:03:17.000> I<00:03:17.060> think<00:03:17.360> that<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.989> is<00:03:18.200> still

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
noticeable but I think that it is still

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.040 
noticeable but I think that it is still
really<00:03:18.860> really<00:03:19.010> pretty<00:03:19.750> okay<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:20.930> that's

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
really really pretty okay and that's

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.750 
really really pretty okay and that's
what<00:03:21.170> it<00:03:21.350> looks<00:03:21.380> like<00:03:21.680> on<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.160> inner<00:03:22.340> corners

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
what it looks like on the inner corners

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.660 
what it looks like on the inner corners
of<00:03:22.790> my<00:03:23.000> eye<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:24.830> just<00:03:25.010> brightens<00:03:25.190> them<00:03:25.519> up

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
of my eye so it just brightens them up

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.160 
of my eye so it just brightens them up
and<00:03:25.850> then<00:03:26.150> another<00:03:26.420> place<00:03:26.690> that<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.989> could

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
and then another place that you could

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.020 
and then another place that you could
definitely<00:03:27.320> put<00:03:27.590> this<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:28.100> underneath<00:03:28.580> your

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
definitely put this is underneath your

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.300 
definitely put this is underneath your
brows<00:03:29.420> but<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:29.959> already<00:03:30.230> have<00:03:30.530> kind<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.040> like<00:03:31.280> a

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
brows but I already have kind of like a

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.490 
brows but I already have kind of like a
I<00:03:31.730> left<00:03:32.390> her<00:03:32.510> there<00:03:32.690> so<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.900> don't<00:03:33.140> really<00:03:33.230> want

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
I left her there so I don't really want

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.920 
I left her there so I don't really want
to<00:03:33.590> put<00:03:33.769> it<00:03:33.860> there<00:03:34.040> right<00:03:34.190> now<00:03:34.430> um

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
to put it there right now um

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.110 
to put it there right now um
so<00:03:36.470> yeah<00:03:36.650> then<00:03:36.860> I<00:03:37.010> guess<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.340> could<00:03:37.519> also<00:03:37.730> put

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
so yeah then I guess you could also put

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.820 
so yeah then I guess you could also put
it<00:03:38.239> on<00:03:38.390> your<00:03:38.600> neck<00:03:38.780> if<00:03:39.080> you<00:03:39.230> just<00:03:39.380> want<00:03:39.590> some

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830
