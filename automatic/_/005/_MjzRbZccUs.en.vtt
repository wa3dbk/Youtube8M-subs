00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello girls today I teach you how to do 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.319
 hanger that I promised you is very simple 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.530
 how are you going to see and this in my case is 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.690
 for my sister you are going to need a 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.599
 rule to draw a line that is left 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.050
 well straight and where will they all match 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.180
 the lower parts of the letters the name 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 that you want to write with wire in the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.529
 hanger you are going to have to write without 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.449
 lift the pencil from the paper because 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.420
 will be where will the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.489
 wire I'm modifying to adapt 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.270
 a little bit the letters and put them all 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.270
 at the same level 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.610
 The next thing I do is take the 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.630
 definitive wire have to be finite 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:03.080
 so that I let you model it and nothing else 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.360
 to pass it over each of 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.470
 the lyrics that you have done all the time 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.070
 without without cutting the wire or anything like 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.070
 you are watching 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.359
 maybe it will cost you a little work and 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.750
 you are going to have to have enough 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:28.479
 patience to achieve it but good everything 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.219
 it is achieved and it is worth it for the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.219
 final result that you are going to have 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.990
 and well more or less there you are seeing a 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.800
 little what is the final result that I 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.540
 has remained to me of the letters I think that 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.760
 is pretty well accomplished and so 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.460
 least I liked it 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.430
 I have taken this hanger and I have removed it 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.480
 the part is where the 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:15.440
 trousers or whatever 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.980
 and in the two holes I had I had 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.530
 put each end of the wire try 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.409
 that you stay well focused on the word 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.470
 or if it is a name composed therefore that 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:30.200
 be well centered and nothing simply 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.349
 with a little bit of silicone or glue 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.610
 you have at home what you see 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.610
 just hook the ends 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.730
 that's how it would look like and I like it 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.200
 decorate it a little more to make it more 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.450
 pimp 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.870
 then what I've done has been 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.870
 catch some of these diamonds 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.870
 little stones 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.800
 and nothing I have been placing 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.739
 and try to have more or less the 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.240
 same distance so everything is very 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.010
 harmonic 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.980
 and that's how it would be with the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.740
 little stones to finish and that is 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.420
 a bit like the one I made for myself 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.070
 wedding since this is also for the day 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.540
 of my wedding so he can hang his 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:26.450
 dress I have used a tie just like 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.960
 the one that I used as the theme of my 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.600
 wedding is the color pink because I have taken one 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.620
 of the same color and simply because what 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.620
 bind and you're 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.159
 and as good as you are watching a 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.790
 little bit of decoration at the ends of 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.790
 tape 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.980
 but well this is already a little to taste 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.590
 that's how we would stay, I think it's 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.230
 super good is super economical and for a 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.150
 gift is great I hope you have 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.020
 liked and we keep seeing 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.020
 bye
