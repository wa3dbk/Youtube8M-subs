00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
balanced I was able to sense a lot of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.460

good<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.340> before<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.880> know<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.570> base

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
good so before you know the the base

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.330 
good so before you know the the base
kind<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.350> overpowered<00:01:11.100> through<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
kind of overpowered through the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.399 
kind of overpowered through the
headphones<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.030> wasn't<00:01:12.299> as<00:01:12.450> Cleon

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
headphones and it wasn't as Cleon

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.289 
headphones and it wasn't as Cleon
certain<00:01:13.799> songs<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.460> certain<00:01:14.729> movies<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.180> were

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
certain songs or certain movies you were

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.749 
certain songs or certain movies you were
watching<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:15.990> these<00:01:16.740> beats<00:01:17.009> executives<00:01:17.640> were

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
watching but these beats executives were

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.880 
watching but these beats executives were
actually<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.540> well-balanced<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.740> far

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
actually really well-balanced so as far

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.770 
actually really well-balanced so as far
as<00:01:19.950> sound<00:01:20.250> goes<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.970> think<00:01:21.390> they're<00:01:21.540> better

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
as sound goes up I think they're better

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.990 
as sound goes up I think they're better
now<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.500> compared<00:01:23.130> with<00:01:23.250> bass<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.939> you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
now we compared with bass and you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.700 
now we compared with bass and you
compare<00:01:24.390> them<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.689> beat<00:01:24.990> studio<00:01:25.259> it's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
compare them with a beat studio it's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.460 
compare them with a beat studio it's
pros<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:27.000> might<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.810> less<00:01:28.080> base

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
pros you might have a little less base

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.780 
pros you might have a little less base
but<00:01:28.799> I'm<00:01:28.890> tell<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.130> right<00:01:29.250> now<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.640> lot

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
but I'm tell you right now it's a lot

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.210 
but I'm tell you right now it's a lot
clearer<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.479> lot<00:01:30.600> cleaner<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.650> crisper

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
clearer it's a lot cleaner it's crisper

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.399 
clearer it's a lot cleaner it's crisper
so<00:01:32.490> as<00:01:33.180> far<00:01:33.329> as<00:01:33.390> sound<00:01:33.720> goes<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.229> definitely

headphones<00:02:16.940> i<00:02:17.120> thought<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.420> beats<00:02:17.660> mixers

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
headphones i thought the beats mixers

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.160 
headphones i thought the beats mixers
were<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.380> little<00:02:18.530> too<00:02:18.860> tight<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:20.209> small<00:02:20.959> as

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
were a little too tight and small as

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.710 
were a little too tight and small as
well<00:02:21.349> so<00:02:21.590> they<00:02:21.680> kind<00:02:21.860> of<00:02:21.890> hurt<00:02:22.069> my<00:02:22.130> ears<00:02:22.489> I<00:02:22.790> love

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
well so they kind of hurt my ears I love

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.229 
well so they kind of hurt my ears I love
the<00:02:23.870> beats<00:02:24.050> pros<00:02:24.440> except<00:02:24.800> they<00:02:24.890> were<00:02:24.980> huge<00:02:25.400> any

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
the beats pros except they were huge any

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.449 
the beats pros except they were huge any
other<00:02:26.360> they<00:02:26.540> wait<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.959> lot<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.560> again<00:02:27.950> made<00:02:28.310> my

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
other they wait a lot and again made my

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.430 
other they wait a lot and again made my
ears<00:02:28.670> hot<00:02:28.940> I'm<00:02:29.180> gonna<00:02:29.690> be<00:02:29.750> studios<00:02:30.170> I've<00:02:30.319> been

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
ears hot I'm gonna be studios I've been

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.680 
ears hot I'm gonna be studios I've been
so<00:02:30.560> far<00:02:30.739> I<00:02:30.980> think<00:02:31.280> very<00:02:31.519> comfortable<00:02:32.300> because

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
so far I think very comfortable because

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.820 
so far I think very comfortable because
they're<00:02:32.959> made<00:02:33.080> of<00:02:33.200> plastic<00:02:33.680> they're

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
they're made of plastic they're

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.620 
they're made of plastic they're
lightweight<00:02:34.069> so<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.790> think<00:02:35.180> it's<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.450> good

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
lightweight so I think it's a good

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.509 
lightweight so I think it's a good
compromise<00:02:36.050> now<00:02:36.470> these<00:02:36.620> aren't<00:02:36.830> as<00:02:36.980> light<00:02:37.310> as

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
compromise now these aren't as light as

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.120 
compromise now these aren't as light as
your<00:02:38.000> beats<00:02:38.269> studios<00:02:38.780> are<00:02:39.620> there<00:02:39.830> gonna<00:02:39.920> be<00:02:40.040> a

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
your beats studios are there gonna be a

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.949 
your beats studios are there gonna be a
little<00:02:40.220> bit<00:02:40.340> heavier<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.790> be<00:02:40.910> aluminum<00:02:41.360> but<00:02:41.750> so

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
little bit heavier to be aluminum but so

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.979 
little bit heavier to be aluminum but so
far<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.530> like<00:02:43.400> them<00:02:43.790> they're<00:02:44.030> comfortable<00:02:44.450> they

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
far I like them they're comfortable they

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.780 
far I like them they're comfortable they
sound<00:02:45.230> good<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.440> it's<00:02:46.160> cool<00:02:46.340> but<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.489> was<00:02:46.610> kinda

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
sound good and it's cool but I was kinda

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.400 
sound good and it's cool but I was kinda
like<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.940> make<00:02:47.120> sure<00:02:47.239> all<00:02:47.480> headphones<00:02:48.019> finally

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
like a make sure all headphones finally

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.199 
like a make sure all headphones finally

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
put together you get the design of

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.449 
put together you get the design of
almost<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.660> studio's<00:02:51.049> but<00:02:51.260> yet<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.980> get<00:02:52.190> the

almost the studio's but yet you get the
build<00:02:53.360> quality<00:02:53.630> when<00:02:54.019> you're<00:02:54.110> really<00:02:54.230> gonna

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
build quality when you're really gonna

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.520 
build quality when you're really gonna
snap<00:02:54.769> them<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.160> also<00:02:55.430> get<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.819> cuffs<00:02:56.090> were

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530
