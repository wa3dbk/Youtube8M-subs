00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.780
 so this we are shooting video stopped 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.870
 temperature after heating 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:17.730
 car autonomous heater here 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.270
 we have what looks like this 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.270
 degrees 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:29.890
 there is a heater 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:34.210
 which is already working on this 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:37.750
 He works already 30 minutes heated until 74 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.830
 degree of tension we now have 11 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:47.500
 volt because the ignition is on 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:48.640
 he did with 5000 489 strokes but 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.730
 This we then count how much he 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.260
 fuel on thought that we have we 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:01.720
 There is a car which is filled with oil 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:04.409
 standard Mordovian so here such here 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.409
 system assembled 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.290
 which are often not visible here such 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.060
 here are the temperature sensors first drawing 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.270
 probe here there now deep 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.359
 straight into the oil of the road from there 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.209
 more or less than an attempt was made to stay 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:25.250
 I press there 3 shove here 

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:30.990
 measure the temperature that circulates 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.970
 through the throttle node teperecha where what 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.430
 So 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.620
 figure 1 means something temperature 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.380
 olive oil 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.320
 duck like this number two here 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.090
 corresponds to the yellow mgtf sensor 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.580
 which screw here that is this 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.580
 here's the temperature 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.070
 the heater goes to the maximum 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.659
 cd1 mode 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.659
 oil temperature 10 degrees 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.789
 2 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.580
 we have here 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.319
 not 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.079
 made take 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.079
 already three hair answers here on the head 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.950
 he's there us battery which is it 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.740
 sat measures this native battery 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.920
 all clear 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.920
 Yes 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:38.930
 Well, to warm it up here that comes out 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:40.430
 doing this we go we get started and here it is 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.760
 what does the native arrow show here 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.760
 by the way 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.390
 so power temperature temperature 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:59.150
 minimum power time 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:02.970
 shooting range 74 degrees what to do 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.340
 we start the initial temperature of the oil 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:13.050
 it was 18 8 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:16.490
 and the air temperature was 1710 me 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.930
 recorded imperial handwriting 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.930
 Here is some background information 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.250
 We look that at us temperatures become 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.730
 oil temperature temperature 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.730
 coolant 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:43.670
 aha literature oil rises how much 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.670
 quick quick 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.380
 raises general judgment about temperature 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.450
 oils 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.450
 a bit to the very depths of 2 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.580
 Here is such a construction 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.170
 but winter is cold as it were before 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.470
 so just minutes wait for the charging moment not 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.840
 not very interesting 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.730
 it is clear that the oil is not heated 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.850
 global of course well he is there 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.430
 that temperature is positive 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:53.450
 after starting very quickly from this 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.450
 longer time 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:11.140
 so 1 is on the dipstick temperature 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.290
 oils are 15 half degrees to and they grow 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.410
 they know there is time to grow up to work 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:20.500
 dynamics is not very interesting in this 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.770
 now on here here here at this point 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.170
 and in fact temperature 3 is this here 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.260
 The head of the block on this sensor is necessary 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:32.240
 I'm pressed and just loose 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.660
 Now here I pulled this out 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.790
 flax sensor and I can't see you 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.790
 hangs a bit like fashion 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.389
 the reason to drag the street problem 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.420
 I will take dandy rotaru law 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.420
 negatively 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:15.740
 well yes yes between termination see 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:19.550
 what interesting doesn't really work but 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:25.090
 such a temperature stove. what is there blowing 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.090
 a little bit of everything is uncovered 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.240
 onboard refreshed 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:47.630
 so the fuel on the swing that's how much 6511 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.630
 clicks jocks 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.900
 but it is 2 on dynamics through speed 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:58.130
 grows like 37 minutes but it's already 40 minutes 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:02.610
 almost working minimum mode 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:06.180
 literature to temperature temperature 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:09.300
 after charging 75 degrees in general 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.480
 almost matches this thing as if 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.480
 principle 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:23.009
 so well and what happens here 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:25.879
 and the oil started to get out 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:25.879
 stop business 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.619
 as led at 17 this on the streets 

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:33.619
 but 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.889
 lets go faster 

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:43.590
 oil temperature 31 degrees is good 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.590
 take out 

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.650
 and not very clean everything turns out 

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.300
 here it is our sensor 

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:57.539
 that's what it looks like 

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:04.620
 I hope you all share tons of butter 

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:08.730
 all in general, then in this video cheek 

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.730
 footage off
