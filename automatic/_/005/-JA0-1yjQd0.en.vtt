00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.360
 in humans they are followed tonics is formed 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.720
 the info point today this video guide 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.300
 let's show you how to remove the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.970
 container for the south ice door 11 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.969
 52 regardless of which model 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.840
 you have from multi floor to darwin soul 

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.840
 that the top of the range 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.230
 do the removal we will show you how 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.920
 do the removal of the container and how 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.540
 clean it for both situations in the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.460
 meaning that there are two types of cleaning 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.020
 that beauty that goes 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.470
 simply on emptying the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.000
 container and police in quotation marks 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.130
 thorough that the police there 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.620
 we recommend doing this every time because 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.810
 however it takes very little time 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.989
 if you do it really every time a photo 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:01.500
 finally we have our style here 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.979
 the review you have it under the link 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.049
 the ball in description we go to 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.180
 release with the appropriate key a 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.200
 container for the poor obviously not 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.720
 we followed it to avoid scenes of 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.120
 mass escapes of people we do 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.979
 see how you go through the special 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:25.020
 release button we're going to let go 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.280
 lower part of the convent and see 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.200
 that a little dust always goes down 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.229
 because inside there is still us 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.360
 we have already washed it and if you do one 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.400
 displacement so hypothesized to have a 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.710
 basket under the canvas open e 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.760
 empty the excess dust 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.369
 that you have story you can help with 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.909
 the appropriate comb to lower the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.070
 excess powder that gets stuck 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.890
 we remind you that the powder challenge is 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.659
 made to never have dust at a 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.780
 level higher than indicated for 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.700
 which would then plug the grill in 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.130
 endowment so on this is a thing on 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.590
 where you have to be careful is not a thing 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.460
 complicated because in reality it is difficult 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.100
 fill the 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.170
 in love it is the container with a house 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.970
 of 130 square meters in an aspiration 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.819
 let alone say that it is impossible 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.010
 once you have wanted to release the 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.230
 container to make the police more 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.530
 thorough you see that the container 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.450
 release by pressing the gray button a 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.540
 which you can access after this here not 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.770
 wash under water and this part that 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.569
 the one you have already seen in 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.060
 review and obviously full of dust 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.200
 because the interior cannot be washed 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.000
 you can simply give it some 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.170
 blow to release the dust from the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.180
 cones this part the washed and cleaned with 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.970
 hands or with a phallus if you are very much 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.850
 the part about this is picky 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.769
 filter if you do this part often 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.930
 right the outside remains very much 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.050
 clean indeed you see that the humidity is 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.540
 the interior is perfectly clean 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.940
 quarters yes in quotation marks 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.620
 dust that hardens cannot be 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.350
 punished and left it exactly like that 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.230
 as the mind obviously this kind of 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.019
 system is based not to lose power 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.299
 of aspirations now that I give myself a 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.180
 moment the container I'll show you 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.780
 as you go to close you have to do a 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.110
 fit these two edges together 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.739
 the bore holes that there are once 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.630
 are you there 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.829
 you see that the first the first hook yes 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.450
 also click is the gray one for 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.760
 unhook the container the second 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.670
 hook that is the red one and that one 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.000
 negative 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.500
 we closed yes we have already closed 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.049
 here is one related to the container 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.440
 lower because in this way they release it 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.440
 is closed 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.180
 I did it for a looser 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.209
 probably this is the same time 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.370
 which you use to do it when it is dirty 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.370
 a greeting from the deputy point of fo
