you in HD I'm gonna do a quick little
video<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.689> the<00:00:21.689> comparisons<00:00:22.260> between<00:00:22.320> LED<00:00:23.310> and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
video on the comparisons between LED and

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.300 
video on the comparisons between LED and
metal<00:00:24.269> halide<00:00:24.510> lighting<00:00:24.990> I've<00:00:25.800> been<00:00:26.099> using

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
metal halide lighting I've been using

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.640 
metal halide lighting I've been using
both<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.660> tank<00:00:27.930> for<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> while<00:00:28.410> now<00:00:28.619> I

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
both on this tank for the while now I

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.500 
both on this tank for the while now I
just<00:00:29.160> recently<00:00:29.400> switched<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.000> metal<00:00:30.240> halide

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
just recently switched to metal halide

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.889 
just recently switched to metal halide
after<00:00:31.439> using<00:00:31.619> LEDs<00:00:32.160> for<00:00:32.520> about<00:00:32.880> 7<00:00:33.540> months<00:00:33.719> now

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
after using LEDs for about 7 months now

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.030 
after using LEDs for about 7 months now
and<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.100> wanted<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.550> point<00:00:35.940> out<00:00:36.090> some

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
and I just wanted to point out some

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.130 
and I just wanted to point out some
differences<00:00:38.040> I've<00:00:38.370> noticed<00:00:38.700> between<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
differences I've noticed between the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.910 
differences I've noticed between the
metal<00:00:40.440> halides<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:42.000> LEDs<00:00:42.930> right<00:00:43.770> now

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
metal halides and the LEDs right now

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.040 
metal halides and the LEDs right now
we're<00:00:44.070> looking<00:00:44.280> at<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> tank<00:00:44.809> over<00:00:45.809> its

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
we're looking at the tank over its

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.520 
we're looking at the tank over its
underneath<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:47.039> 250<00:00:47.969> watt<00:00:48.059> reef<00:00:48.510> star<00:00:49.050> metal

halide<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> stock<00:00:50.910> reached

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239

our hey LED bulb

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.350 
our hey LED bulb
I<00:00:52.460> might<00:00:53.460> upgrade<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.710> Phoenix<00:00:56.489> 20<00:00:57.120> KS

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
I might upgrade to the Phoenix 20 KS

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.470 
I might upgrade to the Phoenix 20 KS
possibly<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.289> future<00:00:59.090> because<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.210> really

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
possibly in the future because I really

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.810 
possibly in the future because I really
do<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> bluer<00:01:01.109> look<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.949> bulb

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
do like a bluer look and that this bulb

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.130 
do like a bluer look and that this bulb
doesn't<00:01:03.120> really<00:01:03.239> provide<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:03.899> I'm<00:01:04.110> just

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
doesn't really provide it but I'm just

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.070 
doesn't really provide it but I'm just
going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.439> show<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.030> some<00:01:06.030> differences<00:01:06.840> I've

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
going to show you some differences I've

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.600 
going to show you some differences I've
noticed<00:01:07.439> mostly<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> corals<00:01:10.130> under<00:01:11.130> LED

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
noticed mostly in the corals under LED

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.190 
noticed mostly in the corals under LED
and<00:01:12.049> metal<00:01:13.049> halide<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.560> then<00:01:13.680> I'll<00:01:13.860> do<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
and metal halide and then I'll do a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.690 
and metal halide and then I'll do a
comparison<00:01:16.200> picture<00:01:16.860> between<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.520> two

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
comparison picture between the two

the<00:01:20.490> first<00:01:20.759> difference<00:01:21.150> I've<00:01:21.299> noticed<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the first difference I've noticed and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.969 
the first difference I've noticed and
this<00:01:21.869> was<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.200> most<00:01:22.380> immediate<00:01:22.799> difference

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
this was the most immediate difference

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.399 
this was the most immediate difference
was<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.930> mil<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.890> pour<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.159> got<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:27.170> got<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
was the this mil of pour I got I got it

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.469 
was the this mil of pour I got I got it
look<00:01:28.740> bit<00:01:29.100> ago<00:01:29.340> because<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.850> was<00:01:29.909> browning<00:01:30.390> out

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
look bit ago because it was browning out

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.929 
look bit ago because it was browning out
and<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.689> cheap<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.530> thought<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.829> would<00:01:31.979> see

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
and is cheap and I thought I would see

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.359 
and is cheap and I thought I would see
what<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.119> could<00:01:33.299> do<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.530> literally<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
what I could do for it the literally the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.660 
what I could do for it the literally the
day<00:01:35.909> after<00:01:35.990> I<00:01:36.990> put<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> metal<00:01:38.070> halides<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.490> it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
day after I put the metal halides on it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.850 
day after I put the metal halides on it
started<00:01:39.060> bleeding<00:01:39.509> out<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.840> crazy<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.380> had<00:01:40.680> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
started bleeding out like crazy I had it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.999 
started bleeding out like crazy I had it
about<00:01:41.400> midway<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.210> tank<00:01:42.860> off-center<00:01:43.860> and

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
about midway in the tank off-center and

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.190 
about midway in the tank off-center and
it<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.119> started<00:01:45.299> bleeding<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.720> crazy<00:01:45.780> so

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
it just started bleeding like crazy so

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.069 
it just started bleeding like crazy so
hopefully<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:47.430> revive<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.630> put<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.930> all

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
hopefully I can revive it I put it all

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.600 
hopefully I can revive it I put it all
the<00:01:49.200> way<00:01:49.229> down<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> sand<00:01:49.950> as<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.430> see

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the way down on the sand as you can see

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.389 
the way down on the sand as you can see
and<00:01:51.020> I<00:01:52.020> don't<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.290> any<00:01:52.439> fragging<00:01:52.890> equipment

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
and I don't have any fragging equipment

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.010 
and I don't have any fragging equipment
to<00:01:53.549> save<00:01:53.790> some<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.119> branches<00:01:54.630> so

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
to save some of the branches so

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.580 
to save some of the branches so
hopefully<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:57.119> putting<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.659> down<00:01:58.049> under<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
hopefully the putting it down under the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.679 
hopefully the putting it down under the
light<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.979> good<00:01:59.100> enough<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.790> far<00:02:00.390> as<00:02:00.479> color

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
light is good enough as far as color

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.899 
light is good enough as far as color
goes<00:02:00.930> under<00:02:01.530> LEDs<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.040> was<00:02:02.250> noticing<00:02:02.700> some

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
goes under LEDs I was noticing some

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.910 
goes under LEDs I was noticing some
green<00:02:03.180> tips<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.780> Underhill<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.350> I'm<00:02:04.619> noticing

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
green tips and Underhill is I'm noticing

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.449 
green tips and Underhill is I'm noticing
them<00:02:05.490> as<00:02:05.670> well<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.890> obviously<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.190> bleaching

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
them as well but obviously the bleaching

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.780 
them as well but obviously the bleaching
is<00:02:09.000> taking<00:02:09.989> over<00:02:10.229> from<00:02:10.349> almost<00:02:11.039> complete

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
is taking over from almost complete

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.810 
is taking over from almost complete
was<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> change<00:02:13.230> I've<00:02:13.410> noticed<00:02:13.800> in<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.280> candy

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
was a change I've noticed in this candy

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.850 
was a change I've noticed in this candy
cane<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.510> fact<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.050> it's<00:02:16.260> splitting

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
cane is the fact that it's splitting

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.710 
cane is the fact that it's splitting
this<00:02:17.460> candy<00:02:17.790> cane<00:02:17.970> has<00:02:18.120> been<00:02:18.270> showing<00:02:18.450> signs

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
this candy cane has been showing signs

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.690 
this candy cane has been showing signs
of<00:02:18.990> splitting<00:02:19.380> for<00:02:19.530> about<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> month<00:02:20.190> under<00:02:20.520> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
of splitting for about a month under the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.600 
of splitting for about a month under the
LEDs<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.500> could<00:02:22.500> see<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:22.980> had<00:02:23.100> two<00:02:23.370> heads

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
LEDs I could see that it had two heads

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.910 
LEDs I could see that it had two heads
and<00:02:24.000> it's<00:02:24.510> really<00:02:24.690> kind<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.930> shrunken<00:02:25.350> up<00:02:25.500> but

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
and it's really kind of shrunken up but

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.920 
and it's really kind of shrunken up but
under<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.580> hay<00:02:26.700> lights<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.510> lot<00:02:27.810> more

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
under the hay lights it's a lot more

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.620 
under the hay lights it's a lot more
swollen<00:02:28.350> like<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:28.890> should<00:02:29.130> be<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:30.270> can<00:02:30.480> see

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
swollen like it should be and I can see

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.710 
swollen like it should be and I can see
you<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:30.900> see<00:02:31.110> on<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:32.190> head<00:02:32.490> right<00:02:32.520> here<00:02:33.150> that

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
you can see on this head right here that

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.680 
you can see on this head right here that
it<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:33.930> just<00:02:34.650> beginning<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.100> split<00:02:36.030> which<00:02:36.330> is<00:02:36.480> a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
it is just beginning to split which is a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.530 
it is just beginning to split which is a
good<00:02:36.990> sign<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:38.030> haven't<00:02:39.030> noticed<00:02:39.210> any

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
good sign I haven't noticed any

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.720 
good sign I haven't noticed any

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.540 
enemy and my galaxy quarrel they're both
doing<00:02:44.460> very<00:02:44.820> well<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:46.830> they're<00:02:47.370> both

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
doing very well the the they're both

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.460 
doing very well the the they're both
responding<00:02:48.180> very<00:02:48.420> well<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.110> hey<00:02:49.230> lights

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
responding very well to the hey lights

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.730 
responding very well to the hey lights
the<00:02:50.100> anenome<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:51.140> just<00:02:52.140> as<00:02:52.290> big<00:02:52.470> as<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.710> was

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
the anenome is just as big as it was

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.120 
the anenome is just as big as it was
before<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.580> i've<00:02:53.820> seen<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:55.080> has<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.950> same

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
before and i've seen it it has the same

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.300 
before and i've seen it it has the same
colors<00:02:56.490> as<00:02:56.880> under<00:02:57.540> LEDs<00:02:57.990> so<00:02:58.800> no<00:02:59.400> issues<00:02:59.640> there

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
colors as under LEDs so no issues there

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.590 
colors as under LEDs so no issues there
I've<00:03:02.310> noticed<00:03:02.670> under<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.970> hay<00:03:03.090> lights<00:03:03.300> that

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
I've noticed under the hay lights that

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.860 
I've noticed under the hay lights that
some<00:03:04.260> softie<00:03:04.890> corals<00:03:05.430> and/or<00:03:05.940> some<00:03:06.210> easier<00:03:06.750> to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
some softie corals and/or some easier to

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.410 
some softie corals and/or some easier to
grow<00:03:07.050> corals<00:03:07.410> are<00:03:07.590> coming<00:03:08.280> out<00:03:08.430> like<00:03:09.210> this

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
grow corals are coming out like this

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.320 
grow corals are coming out like this
mushroom<00:03:09.930> on<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> snail<00:03:10.650> shell<00:03:10.680> used<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.910> be

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
mushroom on a snail shell used to be

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.990 
mushroom on a snail shell used to be
just<00:03:13.200> risked<00:03:13.710> like<00:03:13.860> hiding<00:03:14.400> in<00:03:14.460> the<00:03:14.550> mud<00:03:14.700> this

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
just risked like hiding in the mud this

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.240 
just risked like hiding in the mud this
shell<00:03:15.480> all<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.870> time<00:03:16.080> but<00:03:16.320> what<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.980> hey<00:03:17.100> lies

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250

shell all the time but what the hey lies
on<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.580> mushroom<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.030> sticking<00:03:18.360> out<00:03:18.390> quite<00:03:18.600> a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
on the mushroom is sticking out quite a

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.699 
on the mushroom is sticking out quite a
bit<00:03:18.840> also<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.770> bird's<00:03:19.980> nest<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:21.200> just<00:03:22.200> doing

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
bit also that bird's nest is just doing

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.040 
bit also that bird's nest is just doing
fine<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:22.920> have<00:03:23.190> bleached<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:23.820> out<00:03:23.970> from<00:03:24.840> under

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
fine I have bleached it out from under

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.980 
fine I have bleached it out from under
the<00:03:25.140> LEDs<00:03:25.530> just<00:03:25.560> from<00:03:26.190> being<00:03:26.310> too<00:03:26.520> close<00:03:26.990> so

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
the LEDs just from being too close so

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.100 
the LEDs just from being too close so
it's<00:03:28.470> starting<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.040> recover<00:03:29.310> right<00:03:29.550> now<00:03:30.110> the

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
it's starting to recover right now the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.810 
it's starting to recover right now the
corals<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.560> are<00:03:31.650> doing<00:03:32.010> well<00:03:32.220> would<00:03:32.580> be<00:03:32.700> the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
corals that are doing well would be the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.510 
corals that are doing well would be the
green<00:03:32.970> star<00:03:33.270> polyps<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.740> Duncan<00:03:35.190> corals

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
green star polyps and the Duncan corals

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.550 
green star polyps and the Duncan corals
obviously<00:03:36.030> green<00:03:36.270> star<00:03:36.510> polyps<00:03:36.840> will<00:03:36.990> do<00:03:37.140> well

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
obviously green star polyps will do well

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.710 
obviously green star polyps will do well
in<00:03:37.830> any<00:03:38.040> environment<00:03:38.370> but<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.209> didn't<00:03:39.480> notice

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
in any environment but I didn't notice

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.380 
in any environment but I didn't notice
under<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.020> LEDs<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.709> they<00:03:40.890> were<00:03:41.390> shrinking

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
under the LEDs that they were shrinking

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.080 
under the LEDs that they were shrinking
away<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.690> lot<00:03:43.020> during<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.440> day<00:03:43.670> but<00:03:44.670> that's<00:03:44.850> not

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
away a lot during the day but that's not

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.340 
away a lot during the day but that's not
the<00:03:45.180> case<00:03:45.300> with<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.540> metal<00:03:45.750> halides<00:03:46.050> they're

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
the case with the metal halides they're

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.190 
the case with the metal halides they're
just<00:03:46.890> about<00:03:47.100> out<00:03:47.340> all<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.940> time<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.810> Duncans

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
just about out all the time the Duncans

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.770 
just about out all the time the Duncans
are<00:03:49.320> also<00:03:49.920> out<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.550> noticed<00:03:51.090> with<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.420> LEDs

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
are also out I noticed with the LEDs

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.600 
are also out I noticed with the LEDs
that<00:03:51.860> throughout<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:52.980> day<00:03:53.010> they<00:03:53.250> would<00:03:53.370> close

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
that throughout the day they would close

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.880 
that throughout the day they would close
up<00:03:53.640> and<00:03:54.000> open<00:03:54.270> back<00:03:54.420> up<00:03:54.630> again<00:03:54.870> but<00:03:55.530> they<00:03:55.680> seem

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
up and open back up again but they seem

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.949 
up and open back up again but they seem
to<00:03:55.920> be<00:03:56.070> open<00:03:56.459> pretty<00:03:56.850> much<00:03:57.000> all<00:03:57.300> day<00:03:57.360> long<00:03:57.720> with

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
to be open pretty much all day long with

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.260 
to be open pretty much all day long with

of them a Crow's I've noticed really the
same<00:04:17.580> coloration<00:04:18.120> probably<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.840> little<00:04:19.020> bit

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
same coloration probably a little bit

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.310 
same coloration probably a little bit
more<00:04:19.260> brighter<00:04:19.859> hues<00:04:20.780> purple<00:04:21.780> as<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.049> can<00:04:22.200> see

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
more brighter hues purple as you can see

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.030 
more brighter hues purple as you can see
the<00:04:22.500> grape<00:04:22.710> juice

the grape juice
has<00:04:24.370> been<00:04:24.520> showing<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:24.970> little<00:04:25.120> bit<00:04:25.210> more

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
coral on the right I think pretty sure

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.530 
coral on the right I think pretty sure
that's<00:04:32.380> an<00:04:32.560> acro<00:04:32.890> of<00:04:33.190> some<00:04:33.670> kind<00:04:33.910> it's<00:04:34.150> growing

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
that's an acro of some kind it's growing

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.930 
that's an acro of some kind it's growing
on<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.110> two<00:04:35.350> tips<00:04:35.740> very<00:04:36.130> nicely<00:04:36.430> which<00:04:36.790> it

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
on the two tips very nicely which it

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.530 
on the two tips very nicely which it
wasn't<00:04:37.270> under<00:04:37.420> the<00:04:37.510> LEDs<00:04:38.100> but<00:04:39.100> on<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:39.910> the

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
wasn't under the LEDs but on the the

wasn't under the LEDs but on the the
hydro<00:04:41.500> in<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:41.920> middle<00:04:42.160> still<00:04:42.550> showing<00:04:42.820> some

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
hydro in the middle still showing some

hydro in the middle still showing some
growth<00:04:43.270> and<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:45.150> this<00:04:46.150> one<00:04:46.480> right<00:04:46.810> here<00:04:47.260> we're

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
growth and the this one right here we're

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.860 
growth and the this one right here we're
showing<00:04:48.040> some<00:04:48.580> pretty<00:04:48.970> nice<00:04:49.210> growth<00:04:49.570> under

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870

showing some pretty nice growth under
the<00:04:49.990> LEDs<00:04:50.320> and<00:04:51.030> it's<00:04:52.030> doing<00:04:52.690> well<00:04:53.230> under<00:04:53.620> the

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
the LEDs and it's doing well under the

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.770 
the LEDs and it's doing well under the
halides<00:04:54.250> these<00:04:54.610> are<00:04:54.820> right<00:04:55.210> underneath<00:04:55.600> the

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
halides pretty far up in the tank and

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.890 
halides pretty far up in the tank and
I'm<00:04:59.250> noticing<00:05:00.390> probably<00:05:01.390> a<00:05:01.450> little<00:05:01.750> bit

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
I'm noticing probably a little bit

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.480 
I'm noticing probably a little bit
better<00:05:02.080> polyp<00:05:02.530> extension<00:05:03.010> out<00:05:03.100> of<00:05:03.220> that<00:05:03.310> one

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
better polyp extension out of that one

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.110 
better polyp extension out of that one
and<00:05:04.530> this<00:05:05.530> coral<00:05:05.860> right<00:05:05.980> here<00:05:06.280> is<00:05:06.490> still<00:05:06.910> not

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
and this coral right here is still not

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.700 
and this coral right here is still not
doing<00:05:07.270> anything<00:05:07.540> I'm<00:05:07.840> still<00:05:08.380> trying<00:05:08.590> to<00:05:08.620> get

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
doing anything I'm still trying to get

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.330 
doing anything I'm still trying to get
my<00:05:08.830> parameters<00:05:09.460> in<00:05:09.670> line<00:05:11.070> overall<00:05:12.070> I'm<00:05:12.190> pretty

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
my parameters in line overall I'm pretty

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.280 
my parameters in line overall I'm pretty
satisfied<00:05:13.030> with<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.300> halides<00:05:13.690> because<00:05:14.110> they

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
satisfied with the halides because they

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.240 
satisfied with the halides because they
do<00:05:14.350> provide<00:05:14.980> a<00:05:15.340> nice<00:05:16.290> coloration<00:05:17.290> of<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:18.160> the

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
do provide a nice coloration of to the

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.520 
do provide a nice coloration of to the
tank<00:05:18.580> they<00:05:19.240> provide<00:05:19.540> a<00:05:19.570> fuller<00:05:19.840> color<00:05:20.170> where

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
tank they provide a fuller color where

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.170 
tank they provide a fuller color where
you<00:05:20.770> can<00:05:20.980> see<00:05:21.220> in<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.430> back<00:05:21.580> corners<00:05:22.030> you

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
you can see in the back corners you

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.060 
you can see in the back corners you
could<00:05:22.330> also<00:05:22.450> see<00:05:22.690> my<00:05:22.810> two<00:05:22.870> wave<00:05:23.710> makers

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
could also see my two wave makers

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.410 
could also see my two wave makers
because<00:05:24.310> they<00:05:24.460> provide<00:05:24.970> more<00:05:25.120> coverage

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
because they provide more coverage

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.600 
because they provide more coverage
whereas<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:25.960> LEDs<00:05:26.320> did<00:05:26.830> not<00:05:27.010> because<00:05:27.430> this<00:05:27.550> is

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
whereas the LEDs did not because this is

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.690 
whereas the LEDs did not because this is
a<00:05:27.790> three-foot<00:05:28.270> tank<00:05:28.620> it's<00:05:29.620> suspended<00:05:30.250> at<00:05:30.520> the

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
a three-foot tank it's suspended at the

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.670 
a three-foot tank it's suspended at the
same<00:05:30.970> exact<00:05:31.660> height<00:05:31.960> as<00:05:32.170> the<00:05:32.290> other<00:05:32.440> one<00:05:32.650> and

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
same exact height as the other one and

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.070 
same exact height as the other one and
it's<00:05:33.070> basically<00:05:33.700> the<00:05:33.910> same<00:05:34.210> size<00:05:34.510> fixture<00:05:34.990> as

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
it's basically the same size fixture as

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.490 
it's basically the same size fixture as
my<00:05:35.200> LEDs<00:05:35.700> but<00:05:36.700> the<00:05:37.420> one<00:05:37.630> thing<00:05:37.900> more<00:05:38.110> it<00:05:38.290> is

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
my LEDs but the one thing more it is

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.120 
my LEDs but the one thing more it is
lacking<00:05:38.820> obviously<00:05:39.820> is<00:05:40.210> the<00:05:40.840> color<00:05:41.320> on<00:05:41.740> the

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
lacking obviously is the color on the

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.830 
lacking obviously is the color on the
LEDs<00:05:42.460> I<00:05:42.610> could<00:05:42.850> turn<00:05:43.090> off<00:05:43.240> the<00:05:43.450> whites<00:05:43.630> at

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
LEDs I could turn off the whites at

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.500 
LEDs I could turn off the whites at
night<00:05:44.020> enjoy<00:05:44.860> the<00:05:45.220> glowing<00:05:45.550> colors<00:05:46.240> of<00:05:46.420> the

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
night enjoy the glowing colors of the

night enjoy the glowing colors of the
corals<00:05:46.840> under<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.140> ACT<00:05:47.260> annex<00:05:47.910> whereas<00:05:48.910> this

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
corals under the ACT annex whereas this

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.600 
corals under the ACT annex whereas this
I<00:05:49.300> cannot<00:05:49.540> I<00:05:49.840> have<00:05:49.870> to<00:05:50.290> purchase<00:05:50.920> some

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
I cannot I have to purchase some

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.380 
I cannot I have to purchase some
academic<00:05:52.330> actinic<00:05:53.080> supplementation<00:05:54.390> another

negative aspect of the metal halides

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.520 
negative aspect of the metal halides
would<00:05:57.490> be<00:05:57.700> obviously<00:05:58.330> the<00:05:58.780> power<00:05:59.020> consumption

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
would be obviously the power consumption

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.260 
would be obviously the power consumption
over<00:06:00.160> anything<00:06:00.400> but<00:06:00.760> I<00:06:00.790> really<00:06:00.880> don't<00:06:01.180> have

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
over anything but I really don't have

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.900 
over anything but I really don't have

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
any data to compare to with the LEDs but

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.300 
any data to compare to with the LEDs but
I<00:06:04.150> did<00:06:04.420> notice<00:06:04.810> a<00:06:05.050> significant<00:06:05.830> increase<00:06:06.190> in

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.340 
temperature of since running these I
usually<00:06:08.440> have<00:06:08.620> my<00:06:08.650> tank<00:06:09.130> set<00:06:09.970> around<00:06:10.390> 78<00:06:11.140> with

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
usually have my tank set around 78 with

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.740 
usually have my tank set around 78 with
the<00:06:11.440> reef<00:06:11.620> keeper<00:06:11.830> and<00:06:12.250> I<00:06:12.940> had<00:06:13.120> no<00:06:13.360> problem

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
the reef keeper and I had no problem

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.260 
the reef keeper and I had no problem
achieving<00:06:14.170> that<00:06:14.350> with<00:06:14.410> the<00:06:15.010> LEDs<00:06:15.910> in<00:06:16.090> place

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
achieving that with the LEDs in place

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.720 
achieving that with the LEDs in place
but<00:06:16.540> now<00:06:16.990> that<00:06:17.170> I<00:06:17.200> have<00:06:17.320> the<00:06:17.470> halides<00:06:17.860> it<00:06:18.250> has

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
but now that I have the halides it has

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.140 
but now that I have the halides it has
increased<00:06:19.210> to<00:06:19.780> 81<00:06:20.500> I've<00:06:20.800> also<00:06:21.160> seen<00:06:21.430> it<00:06:21.580> go<00:06:22.030> up

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
increased to 81 I've also seen it go up

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.380 
increased to 81 I've also seen it go up
to<00:06:22.240> 82<00:06:22.600> which<00:06:22.750> isn't<00:06:22.960> a<00:06:23.260> huge<00:06:23.890> issue<00:06:24.390> because

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
to 82 which isn't a huge issue because

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.990 
to 82 which isn't a huge issue because
it's<00:06:25.570> not<00:06:25.750> overly<00:06:26.260> hot<00:06:26.830> not<00:06:27.250> causing<00:06:27.670> the<00:06:27.850> fish

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
it's not overly hot not causing the fish

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.850 
it's not overly hot not causing the fish
in<00:06:28.150> you<00:06:28.210> distress<00:06:28.570> or<00:06:28.720> anything<00:06:28.900> but<00:06:29.740> that

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
in you distress or anything but that

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.580 
in you distress or anything but that
still<00:06:30.100> is<00:06:30.160> kind<00:06:31.120> of<00:06:31.480> a<00:06:31.510> concern<00:06:32.140> I<00:06:32.169> might<00:06:32.440> have

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
still is kind of a concern I might have

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.909 
still is kind of a concern I might have
to<00:06:32.740> buy<00:06:32.860> a<00:06:32.890> fan<00:06:33.310> or<00:06:33.520> possibly<00:06:34.030> even<00:06:34.120> a<00:06:34.330> chiller

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
to buy a fan or possibly even a chiller

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.159 
to buy a fan or possibly even a chiller
to<00:06:35.919> cool<00:06:35.950> down<00:06:36.910> the<00:06:36.940> tank<00:06:37.300> especially<00:06:37.900> on<00:06:38.020> my

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
to cool down the tank especially on my

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:39.360 
to cool down the tank especially on my
new<00:06:38.290> tank<00:06:38.530> since<00:06:38.740> I'm<00:06:38.890> going<00:06:39.070> to<00:06:39.160> be<00:06:39.250> running

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
new tank since I'm going to be running

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.870 
new tank since I'm going to be running
two<00:06:39.700> of<00:06:39.850> these<00:06:40.770> I've<00:06:41.770> only<00:06:41.950> had<00:06:42.190> them<00:06:42.430> on<00:06:42.580> for

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
two of these I've only had them on for

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.350 
two of these I've only had them on for
maybe<00:06:43.750> a<00:06:43.870> week<00:06:44.110> or<00:06:44.290> so<00:06:44.440> so<00:06:44.740> I<00:06:45.460> would<00:06:45.850> have<00:06:46.090> I'm

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
maybe a week or so so I would have I'm

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.730 
maybe a week or so so I would have I'm
probably<00:06:46.660> gonna<00:06:46.840> do<00:06:46.960> some<00:06:47.110> updates<00:06:47.410> in<00:06:47.620> the

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
probably gonna do some updates in the
