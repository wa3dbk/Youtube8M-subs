possession but to consider the goal the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.019 
possession but to consider the goal the
way<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:21.000> did<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.539> was<00:00:21.690> all<00:00:21.840> throw<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.820> they<00:00:23.820> pick

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
way we did it was all throw in they pick

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.540 
way we did it was all throw in they pick
it<00:00:24.119> up<00:00:24.240> take<00:00:24.419> it<00:00:24.449> quickly<00:00:25.130> and<00:00:26.130> before<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
it up take it quickly and before you

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.829 
it up take it quickly and before you
know<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.119> back<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.419> net<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:27.720> it's

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:27.839 
know it's in the back of the net so it's

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.409 
know it's in the back of the net so it's
hard<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> take<00:00:28.320> but<00:00:29.130> what<00:00:29.759> I<00:00:29.789> will<00:00:29.939> say<00:00:29.999> is<00:00:30.150> we

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
hard to take but what I will say is we

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:31.759 
hard to take but what I will say is we
created<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.839> best<00:00:30.990> chances<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.470> night<00:00:31.650> we

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590
