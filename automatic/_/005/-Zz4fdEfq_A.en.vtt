00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
this is the perfect brush because it

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.340

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
brown liner and I'm going to draw a

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.899 
brown liner and I'm going to draw a
crease<00:02:29.579> right<00:02:29.790> above<00:02:30.780> my<00:02:31.590> actual<00:02:32.220> crease<00:02:32.579> and

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
crease right above my actual crease and

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.210 
crease right above my actual crease and
now<00:02:33.720> when<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.959> use<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.409> lining<00:02:34.709> make<00:02:34.950> sure<00:02:35.069> it's

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
now when you use a lining make sure it's

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.670 
now when you use a lining make sure it's
really<00:02:35.519> smooth<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.359> blendable<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.409> thing<00:02:37.560> is

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
really smooth and blendable the thing is

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.080 
really smooth and blendable the thing is
this<00:02:37.769> is<00:02:37.920> actually<00:02:38.040> an<00:02:38.340> eyebrow<00:02:38.519> pencil<00:02:38.790> but

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
this is actually an eyebrow pencil but

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.339 
this is actually an eyebrow pencil but
it's<00:02:39.180> terrible<00:02:39.689> as<00:02:39.810> an<00:02:39.900> eyebrow<00:02:40.079> pencil

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
it's terrible as an eyebrow pencil

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.619 
it's terrible as an eyebrow pencil
because<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.859> moves<00:02:41.010> around<00:02:41.159> so<00:02:41.400> much<00:02:41.700> but<00:02:42.269> it's

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
because it moves around so much but it's

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.089 
because it moves around so much but it's
perfect<00:02:43.079> for<00:02:43.109> this<00:02:43.409> because<00:02:43.769> it's<00:02:43.980> really

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
perfect for this because it's really

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.140 
perfect for this because it's really
easy<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.549> blend

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
easy to blend

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.399 
easy to blend
so<00:02:45.480> I'm<00:02:45.569> actually<00:02:45.629> to<00:02:45.840> go<00:02:45.959> into<00:02:46.109> a<00:02:46.139> floating

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
so I'm actually to go into a floating

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.830 
so I'm actually to go into a floating
crease<00:02:46.889> which<00:02:47.040> means<00:02:47.220> I'm<00:02:47.340> going<00:02:47.549> just<00:02:47.940> wing

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
crease which means I'm going just wing

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.330 
crease which means I'm going just wing
it<00:02:48.870> out<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.079> little<00:02:49.349> bit<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.769> then<00:02:50.129> I'm<00:02:50.190> gonna

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
it out a little bit and then I'm gonna

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.940 
it out a little bit and then I'm gonna
take<00:02:50.489> this<00:02:50.609> eyebrow<00:02:50.970> brush<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.599> I'm<00:02:52.470> going<00:02:52.889> to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
take this eyebrow brush and I'm going to

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.250 
take this eyebrow brush and I'm going to
start<00:02:53.519> blending<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.359> upwards<00:02:54.569> it's<00:02:55.170> gonna

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
start blending it upwards it's gonna

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.640 
start blending it upwards it's gonna
create<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.739> look<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:56.720> blended<00:02:57.720> gradient<00:02:58.319> look

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
create to look a blended gradient look

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.979 
create to look a blended gradient look
so<00:02:59.189> I'm<00:02:59.250> just<00:02:59.489> doing<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.090> I'm<00:03:00.420> going<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:00.720> just

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
so I'm just doing that I'm going to just

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.229 
so I'm just doing that I'm going to just
keep<00:03:01.200> blending<00:03:01.439> it<00:03:01.709> upwards<00:03:01.970> making<00:03:02.970> sure<00:03:03.060> to

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
keep blending it upwards making sure to

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.390 
keep blending it upwards making sure to
still<00:03:03.480> keep<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.959> line<00:03:04.379> it's<00:03:04.739> not<00:03:04.859> perfect

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
still keep that line it's not perfect

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.550 
still keep that line it's not perfect
but<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.879> I'll<00:03:06.269> fix<00:03:06.569> that<00:03:06.659> next<00:03:07.049> unless<00:03:07.319> it's<00:03:07.500> a

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
but it I'll fix that next unless it's a

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.399 
but it I'll fix that next unless it's a
