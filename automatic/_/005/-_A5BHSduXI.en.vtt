00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.420

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.519
 good to tell you first that there has been 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.960
 been super exciting to count the photos 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.140
 super exciting because there has been a 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.380
 tie almost until the end is worth so 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.910
 well I leave it there and now who is the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:39.040
 winner 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:41.829
 in the winners they have been Chinese and 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.870
 draco has known 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.000
 many many votes that have said that 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.140
 they were chiri draco 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.510
 but today here comes a series of 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.230
 surprise logically with them two I will do 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.420
 a series as I said is the prize but 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.930
 On the other hand I thought that like them 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.360
 they are people that I already know, I'm going to do 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.040
 something a little more special and is that not 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.750
 they're only going to win the prize 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.000
 what was it about recording a series with me 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.410
 but they will also win going to 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.790
 earn it the second classified so 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.460
 who has been the second person 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.020
 classified good the first ones already said 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.899
 draco and chilling 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.409
 first I will say the fifth place is 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.600
 the fifth person according to you what 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.539
 better house has done that the truth is that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.399
 it was a pass from home it has been all 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:37.380
 girls rk for a little bit I do not lie 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.100
 such portal ivÃ¡n has been the person who 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.420
 has been fifth in the standings 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.969
 although the truth is that it has been for nothing 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.069
 it has been by two votes and then it has gone 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:51.929
 all girls that has been fourth but 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.729
 by very little I already have by two votes 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:58.140
 there has been the truth was very very very 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.490
 matched everything and then we went to the second 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.440
 Market Stall 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.260
 incredibly worth incredibly 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.950
 I was counting the and in the second 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.879
 there has been a tie 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.680
 what does that mean that what 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.480
 that I had thought was cider 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.209
 cuisine and won because you were 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.769
 dais by victors was going to record what 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.050
 I have told you with the second person 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.230
 classified what has been the problem or 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.019
 the advantage for us or for me that 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.220
 as second classified there were two 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:34.900
 that means they were villamil and 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.629
 gonzalo acosta 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.909
 have remained in the second place that 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.670
 it happens clear it is assumed that a person 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.470
 would be the winner to record with me but 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.569
 they have not been drag queen chili and I said 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.860
 then to another more 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.470
 but as to tie me I would have to 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.260
 choose so that one of the two was the 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.629
 winner the second winner 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.890
 Well, I 'm not going to choose it, I 'm going to record 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:04.329
 with esteban villamil a series with 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:08.170
 Gonzoalo Acosta another series and with Siri 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.519
 draco another series is worth so decided 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.530
 although in this case there will be three 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.840
 winners has been chance if not 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.280
 there would have been two but it has been 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.560
 yes, so I hope that you 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.540
 have liked this whole series if it has 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.690
 liked to leave it in the comments worth 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.870
 and there will be a second season a second 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.640
 contest for which if there is still 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.709
 do not prepare anything is worth it because I have a 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.329
 surprise and it's a surprise inside the 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.090
 way you have to do the house 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.430
 so do not start doing it 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.489
 until I tell you so good 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.639
