00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
this will be my first actually and it's

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.990 
this will be my first actually and it's
how<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.839> rank<00:00:07.140> up<00:00:07.230> fast<00:00:07.290> in<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.859> game<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.250> think

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
how to rank up fast in the game I think

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.089 
how to rank up fast in the game I think
that<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.300> video<00:00:09.660> needs<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.019> be<00:00:10.110> made<00:00:10.320> just

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
that this video needs to be made just

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.490 
that this video needs to be made just
because<00:00:11.370> with<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.900> influx<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.440> new

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
because with the the influx of new

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.740 
because with the the influx of new
players<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.670> will<00:00:14.790> be<00:00:14.940> picking<00:00:15.299> up<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.480> game

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
players that will be picking up the game

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.269 
players that will be picking up the game
I<00:00:15.929> really<00:00:16.230> think<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.529> they're<00:00:17.039> going<00:00:17.220> to

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
I really think that they're going to

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.340 
I really think that they're going to
want<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.520> know<00:00:17.640> how<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.910> or<00:00:18.300> even<00:00:18.779> yourself

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
want to know how to or even yourself

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.890 
want to know how to or even yourself
maybe<00:00:19.560> we'll<00:00:20.010> once<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.420> know<00:00:21.420> how<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.570> rank<00:00:21.810> up

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
maybe we'll once it know how to rank up

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.109 
maybe we'll once it know how to rank up

that holds on to it gets double XP but

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.859 
that holds on to it gets double XP but
they<00:01:04.920> don't<00:01:05.040> only<00:01:05.309> get<00:01:05.549> double<00:01:06.180> XP<00:01:06.450> towards

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
they don't only get double XP towards

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.450 
they don't only get double XP towards
the<00:01:07.260> score<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> game<00:01:07.710> they<00:01:08.010> get<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.250> for

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the score of the game they get it for

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.090 
the score of the game they get it for
themselves<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.180> instead<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.900> getting<00:01:10.020> 50<00:01:10.500> 50

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
themselves so instead of getting 50 50

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.980 
themselves so instead of getting 50 50
points<00:01:11.430> i<00:01:11.640> think<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:11.970> 50<00:01:12.240> points<00:01:12.510> 50<00:01:12.750> points

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
points i think it's 50 points 50 points

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.200 
points i think it's 50 points 50 points
of<00:01:13.049> kill<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.830> wind<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.100> getting<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.430> hundred<00:01:14.760> so

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
of kill you wind up getting a hundred so

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.200 
of kill you wind up getting a hundred so
it's<00:01:15.570> really<00:01:15.750> ideal<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:16.880> while<00:01:17.880> you're

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
it's really ideal because while you're

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.700 
it's really ideal because while you're
winning<00:01:18.509> you're<00:01:18.630> still<00:01:18.869> getting<00:01:18.990> double<00:01:19.409> XP

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
winning you're still getting double XP

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.770 
winning you're still getting double XP
as<00:01:19.799> well<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.240> lot<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.570> fun<00:01:21.689> to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
as well so it's a it's a lot of fun to

so<00:03:04.519> i<00:03:04.549> can<00:03:04.730> stay<00:03:04.910> up<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.090> UAV<00:03:05.420> in<00:03:05.540> dead<00:03:05.720> silence

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
so i can stay up the UAV in dead silence

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.050 
so i can stay up the UAV in dead silence
or<00:03:06.260> so<00:03:06.350> i<00:03:06.410> don't<00:03:06.620> have<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.769> i<00:03:06.980> be<00:03:07.250> clunking

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
or so i don't have to i be clunking

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.370 
or so i don't have to i be clunking
around<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.390> map<00:03:08.569> when<00:03:08.780> i<00:03:08.810> do<00:03:08.930> want<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.260> move

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
around the map when i do want to move

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.650 
around the map when i do want to move
the<00:03:10.010> next<00:03:10.220> one<00:03:10.310> is<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.459> ump<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:10.940> is<00:03:11.060> great

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
the next one is the ump this is great

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.539 
the next one is the ump this is great
for<00:03:11.690> just<00:03:12.049> running<00:03:12.410> around<00:03:12.500> for<00:03:13.250> some<00:03:13.400> reason

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
for just running around for some reason

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.789 
for just running around for some reason
I've<00:03:13.790> noticed<00:03:14.090> that<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.299> UMP<00:03:14.720> runs<00:03:14.959> faster<00:03:15.530> or

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
I've noticed that the UMP runs faster or

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.680 
I've noticed that the UMP runs faster or
you<00:03:16.100> run<00:03:16.280> faster<00:03:16.730> with<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:16.910> UMP<00:03:17.329> than<00:03:17.510> any

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
you run faster with the UMP than any

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.190 
you run faster with the UMP than any
other<00:03:17.900> submachine<00:03:18.440> gun<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.269> two<00:03:20.269> I<00:03:20.660> don't

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
other submachine gun and two I don't

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.720 
other submachine gun and two I don't
know<00:03:21.260> compliment<00:03:21.859> then<00:03:21.980> I<00:03:22.100> have<00:03:22.220> extreme

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
know compliment then I have extreme

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.550

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
conditioning on quick trial pro allows

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.590 
conditioning on quick trial pro allows
you<00:03:24.799> to<00:03:24.980> just<00:03:25.250> like<00:03:25.459> sprint<00:03:25.940> full<00:03:26.150> out<00:03:26.329> and

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
you to just like sprint full out and

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.390 
you to just like sprint full out and
then<00:03:26.720> abs<00:03:27.200> really<00:03:27.500> quick<00:03:27.799> aim<00:03:27.980> down<00:03:28.130> sights

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
then abs really quick aim down sights

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.970 
then abs really quick aim down sights
that<00:03:28.519> is<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:28.940> dead<00:03:29.900> silence<00:03:30.290> just<00:03:30.380> so<00:03:30.590> I<00:03:30.620> don't

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
that is and dead silence just so I don't

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
you know again be clunking around the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.420 
you know again be clunking around the
map<00:03:32.780> when<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:32.959> am<00:03:33.109> running<00:03:33.290> around<00:03:33.590> next<00:03:34.160> one<00:03:34.280> is

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
map when I am running around next one is

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.970 
map when I am running around next one is
the<00:03:34.459> PP<00:03:34.910> 90<00:03:35.269> I<00:03:35.450> have<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.780> silencer<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.320> a<00:03:36.769> red

dot I it there's nothing against the
sites<00:03:40.730> for<00:03:40.970> this<00:03:41.120> gun<00:03:41.269> I<00:03:41.299> just<00:03:41.600> like<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.900> right

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
sites for this gun I just like the right

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.780 
sites for this gun I just like the right
now<00:03:42.200> for<00:03:42.440> this<00:03:42.590> is<00:03:42.769> basically<00:03:43.100> my<00:03:43.220> search<00:03:43.609> and

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
now for this is basically my search and

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.000 
now for this is basically my search and
destroy<00:03:43.910> kit<00:03:44.299> when<00:03:45.079> I<00:03:45.109> when<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:45.470> want<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.739> go<00:03:45.859> and

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
destroy kit when I when I want to go and

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.289 
destroy kit when I when I want to go and
get<00:03:46.070> a<00:03:46.130> bunch<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.430> kills<00:03:46.640> insertions<00:03:47.090> or<00:03:47.150> sure

get a bunch of kills insertions or sure

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.000 
get a bunch of kills insertions or sure
I<00:03:47.329> just<00:03:47.630> put<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:47.870> on<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:48.440> can<00:03:48.620> just<00:03:48.769> run

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
I just put this on and you can just run

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.440 
I just put this on and you can just run
around<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.310> map<00:03:49.489> if<00:03:49.700> they<00:03:49.820> do<00:03:49.880> happen<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.299> get

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
around the map if they do happen to get

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.660 
around the map if they do happen to get
a<00:03:50.510> UAV<00:03:50.780> you're<00:03:51.170> perfectly<00:03:51.680> fine<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.310> hidden

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
a UAV you're perfectly fine and hidden

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.030 
a UAV you're perfectly fine and hidden
it's<00:03:53.239> basically<00:03:53.600> like<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:53.900> stealth<00:03:54.230> class<00:03:54.530> that

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
it's basically like a stealth class that

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.280 
it's basically like a stealth class that
you're<00:03:55.250> really<00:03:55.430> mobile<00:03:55.850> with<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.299> the<00:03:56.720> pp<00:03:56.989> 90

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
you're really mobile with and the pp 90

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.900 
you're really mobile with and the pp 90
is<00:03:57.350> just<00:03:57.709> an<00:03:57.799> amazing<00:03:57.980> gun<00:03:58.340> by<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.549> way<00:03:58.700> same

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
is just an amazing gun by the way same

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.750 
is just an amazing gun by the way same
with<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.120> UMP<00:03:59.769> next<00:04:00.769> is<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:00.980> ACR<00:04:01.400> this<00:04:01.640> is

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
with the UMP next is the ACR this is

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.150 
with the UMP next is the ACR this is
much<00:04:02.000> like<00:04:02.269> the<00:04:02.420> type<00:04:02.660> 95<00:04:02.959> it's<00:04:03.799> now<00:04:03.920> first

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
much like the type 95 it's now first

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.250 
much like the type 95 it's now first
fire<00:04:04.370> but<00:04:04.609> it's<00:04:04.760> just<00:04:05.150> a<00:04:05.269> ridiculously<00:04:05.989> good

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
fire but it's just a ridiculously good

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.970 
fire but it's just a ridiculously good
gun<00:04:06.530> really<00:04:07.519> good<00:04:07.700> and<00:04:07.880> really<00:04:08.859> accurate<00:04:09.859> as

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
gun really good and really accurate as

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.590 
gun really good and really accurate as
well<00:04:10.160> it<00:04:10.280> doesn't<00:04:10.549> have<00:04:10.639> the<00:04:10.670> fastest<00:04:11.359> fire

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
well it doesn't have the fastest fire

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.379 
well it doesn't have the fastest fire
rate<00:04:11.810> but<00:04:12.079> i<00:04:12.489> definitely<00:04:13.489> recommend<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:14.120> in

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
rate but i definitely recommend this in

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.240 
rate but i definitely recommend this in
the<00:04:14.480> time<00:04:14.630> 95<00:04:15.049> if<00:04:15.530> you<00:04:15.709> just<00:04:15.920> want<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.100> go

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
the time 95 if you just want to go

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.319 
the time 95 if you just want to go
around<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.639> kill<00:04:16.789> a<00:04:16.820> whole<00:04:16.970> bunch<00:04:17.180> of<00:04:17.269> stuff

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
around and kill a whole bunch of stuff

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.719 
around and kill a whole bunch of stuff
and<00:04:17.720> i<00:04:18.440> think<00:04:18.680> i<00:04:18.739> have<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.890> same<00:04:19.130> perks<00:04:19.370> setup

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
and i think i have the same perks setup

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.229 
and i think i have the same perks setup
yeah<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.150> do

the last one is the my points Creek take
er<00:04:24.810> down<00:04:24.960> our<00:04:25.289> class<00:04:25.830> I<00:04:26.130> guess<00:04:26.280> could<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:26.520> call

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.420 
think if you take down a an attack
helicopter<00:04:33.750> with<00:04:34.259> this<00:04:34.410> thing<00:04:34.560> you<00:04:34.650> get<00:04:34.800> 500

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
helicopter with this thing you get 500

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.790 
helicopter with this thing you get 500
XP<00:04:35.699> which<00:04:36.360> is<00:04:36.539> the<00:04:36.690> equivalent<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:37.199> five<00:04:37.410> kills

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
XP which is the equivalent of five kills

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.490 
XP which is the equivalent of five kills
so<00:04:38.520> yeah<00:04:39.210> it's<00:04:39.539> really<00:04:39.750> good<00:04:39.990> if<00:04:40.110> you<00:04:40.259> want<00:04:40.440> to

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
so yeah it's really good if you want to

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.200 
so yeah it's really good if you want to
rank<00:04:40.650> up<00:04:40.770> fast<00:04:40.830> use<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.610> Stinger<00:04:41.940> as<00:04:42.060> your

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
rank up fast use the Stinger as your

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.510 
rank up fast use the Stinger as your
secondary<00:04:42.599> any<00:04:42.930> time<00:04:43.470> they<00:04:43.620> get<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.800> UAV<00:04:44.069> just

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
secondary any time they get a UAV just

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.820 
secondary any time they get a UAV just
pull<00:04:44.669> it<00:04:44.819> out<00:04:44.940> shoot<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:45.389> down<00:04:45.509> I'm<00:04:46.410> using<00:04:46.620> them

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
pull it out shoot it down I'm using them

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.640 
pull it out shoot it down I'm using them
for<00:04:46.860> it<00:04:47.310> it's<00:04:48.060> not<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.360> best<00:04:48.509> gun<00:04:48.750> but<00:04:48.960> I<00:04:49.020> seem

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
for it it's not the best gun but I seem

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.469 
for it it's not the best gun but I seem
to<00:04:49.800> have<00:04:49.979> become<00:04:50.370> attached<00:04:50.819> to<00:04:51.000> it<00:04:51.120> i<00:04:51.210> really

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
to have become attached to it i really

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.010 
to have become attached to it i really
like<00:04:51.660> it<00:04:51.979> and<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:54.120> answer<00:04:54.330> is<00:04:54.419> a<00:04:54.509> good<00:04:54.659> gun<00:04:54.810> i
