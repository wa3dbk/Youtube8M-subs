is nice and behind him that's the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.940 
is nice and behind him that's the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
question though it's a forward pass this

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.280 
question though it's a forward pass this
is<00:01:32.220> where<00:01:32.430> he<00:01:32.760> is<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.990> where<00:01:34.230> he<00:01:34.500> is

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
is where he is this is where he is

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.280 
is where he is this is where he is
but<00:01:36.680> he<00:01:36.770> steps<00:01:37.100> back<00:01:37.730> that's<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.600> forward<00:01:39.050> path

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
but he steps back that's a forward path

it's where the ball is to where the ball
go<00:02:38.410> that's<00:02:38.769> what<00:02:38.920> I'm<00:02:39.040> saying<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.790> ball<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
go that's what I'm saying the ball the

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.720 
go that's what I'm saying the ball the
ball<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:40.870> above<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.560> line<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.799> little<00:02:42.220> bit

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
ball is above the line a little bit

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.000

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.880 
this ball is above the line a little bit
I<00:02:45.220> think<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.180> tough<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.569> call

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
I think it's tough to call

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.370 
I think it's tough to call
to<00:02:48.100> be<00:02:48.190> honest<00:02:48.490> with<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.940> bulls<00:02:49.810> released

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
to be honest with the bulls released

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.080 
to be honest with the bulls released
from<00:02:50.620> about<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.890> half<00:02:51.190> yard<00:02:51.490> in<00:02:51.730> front<00:02:51.850> of<00:02:52.030> the

from about a half yard in front of the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.870 
from about a half yard in front of the
25<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.990> it's<00:02:53.680> caught<00:02:53.950> in<00:02:53.980> almost<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.760> same

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
25 and it's caught in almost the same

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.199 
25 and it's caught in almost the same
start<00:02:55.420> Mike<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:55.900> think<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.800> is<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.550> lateral<00:02:57.970> I

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
start Mike I think that is a lateral I

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.940 
start Mike I think that is a lateral I
initially<00:03:01.209> thought<00:03:01.240> it<00:03:01.690> was<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.900> forward<00:03:02.440> pass

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
initially thought it was a forward pass

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.850 
initially thought it was a forward pass
but<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.090> look<00:03:04.360> at<00:03:04.540> those<00:03:04.690> two<00:03:04.750> angles<00:03:05.260> on<00:03:05.680> that

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
but you look at those two angles on that

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.710 
but you look at those two angles on that
replay<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:06.610> don't<00:03:06.880> think<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.209> looks<00:03:07.480> like<00:03:07.660> a

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
replay I don't think that looks like a

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.290 
replay I don't think that looks like a
direct<00:03:08.350> line<00:03:08.740> and<00:03:09.070> there<00:03:09.190> was<00:03:09.340> no<00:03:09.550> penalty<00:03:09.790> so

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
direct line and there was no penalty so

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.150 
direct line and there was no penalty so
they<00:03:10.450> have<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.870> find<00:03:11.110> something<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.620> overturn

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
they have to find something to overturn

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.220 
they have to find something to overturn
