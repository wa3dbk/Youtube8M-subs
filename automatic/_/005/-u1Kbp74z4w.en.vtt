seven and does cover it up we talked
about<00:03:28.440> these<00:03:28.709> patterns<00:03:28.980> here<00:03:29.250> this<00:03:29.459> was

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
about these patterns here this was

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.390 
about these patterns here this was
yesterday's<00:03:30.360> pattern<00:03:30.870> called<00:03:31.830> Vienna<00:03:32.250> if

yesterday's pattern called Vienna if
you're<00:03:32.549> looking<00:03:32.790> up<00:03:32.910> all<00:03:33.090> these<00:03:33.180> Kegel

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
you're looking up all these Kegel

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.869 
you're looking up all these Kegel
patterns<00:03:33.900> there<00:03:34.319> it<00:03:34.410> is<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:35.459> it's<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.760> little

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
patterns there it is so it's a little

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.339 
patterns there it is so it's a little
bit<00:03:36.000> longer<00:03:36.299> than<00:03:36.599> what<00:03:36.750> we<00:03:36.840> built<00:03:37.019> on<00:03:37.110> today

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
bit longer than what we built on today

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.449 
bit longer than what we built on today
we'll<00:03:37.500> talk<00:03:37.650> more<00:03:37.799> about<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.010> more<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
we'll talk more about that more the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.920 
we'll talk more about that more the

darker the lines the heavier the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.949 
darker the lines the heavier the
concentration<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.769> oil<00:03:41.120> you<00:03:42.120> see<00:03:42.330> that<00:03:42.810> the

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
concentration of oil you see that the
