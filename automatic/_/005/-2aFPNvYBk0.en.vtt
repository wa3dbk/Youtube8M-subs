00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 the dom afonso henriques is probably 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.309
 I need a haircut more 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.410
 It's beautiful that I go at night and it's a good 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.490

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.650
 is not the old is not old is having 40 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.060
 years I would say is that people die 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.500
 around 60 65 of the average they turned is 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.430
 very big do not forget 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:34.550
 I have a dread point 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.550
 let's say say 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:47.960
 no, I'm going bravery maybe in two 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.229
 authorities does not prove that it is a 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.449
 great authoritarian father and has five 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:56.329
 religious points and nothing is going 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.159
 quite religious or theme 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.399
 besides the pieces that are among us in 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:07.580
 Portugal today where passing between 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:10.369
 to a church on your plants and we have the 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.069
 because it is the main source of 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.330
 win thomson this first but finally 

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:21.679
 this year can not be completely 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:23.990
 Prefect is not clever is in 4 points 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:28.369
 as a general affectionate and the father but not 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.929
 evil does not have any cavalry point 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.459
 to his sign but he is not a gentleman 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:38.270
 is not a knight and wahda is 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:39.080
 handicapped and is a man more or less 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.679
 with josue 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:48.289
 Okay, we have two good family members. 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:52.069
 two good nox's but it's not what we see 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:56.390
 all the generals that are there are 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:58.459
 that we have the rodrigo captain who 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.250
 truth is a captain is reminded this 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.390
 Army general antonio general's 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.200
 army 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.899
 yes and flags we do not know is bad 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.319
 We could have a general here and we believe 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.690
 We need to call only the gym. 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.849
 General joão com h fantastic 2 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.200
 disloyal command 5 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.040
 impressively has more loyalty 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.220
 himself thinks and is not very brave and 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.180
 bright ok this one today I do not think the 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.030
 people have to play 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.420
 and we have agents here we have a spy 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.030
 lopo peres has one more Spanish name or 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.670
 four points of espionage 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:49.420
 subterfuge is not bad at all 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:53.069
 the Spanish veríssimo ramires 7 in the middle 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:58.719
 now the marker in 3 finance points 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:00.159
 the markers basically serve to 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.340
 trading activity that you were 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.340
 wait 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.099
 Do you know how to trade? 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.620
 I do not really like what today. 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.579
 sincerely when he died I think 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.859
 I'll buy more 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:22.629
 In this campaign we have a Cardinal Manoel and 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:27.730
 So Portuguese is a cardinal only. 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:31.079
 with piety or organized 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:37.060
 one more train today closing date 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:46.329
 basically does not seem like milk for potatoes or 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:52.030
 can serve as or serve to 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:56.049
 convert regions to your region in this 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.310
 Catholicism without the three conditions of 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:04.389
 game to Christianity or Catholicism in 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.349
 portugal in this case is a one a faction 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.349
 catholic 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:19.989
 we have the islam and we got is that the toc toc and 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:22.810
 We have a princess Maria has three of 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.320
 charm is quite young 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.560
 the princesses she is 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.389
 the princesses serve to establish 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.460
 diplomatic relations and to be 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:37.030
 married as a bargaining chip I know it's 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.949
 cold but this is how it is functional as 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.150
 exchange currency to ensure alliances and 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.070
 things like that 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.000
 You can already see that this game is very 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.980
 interesting 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.840
 from the beginning and now has 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.910
 will make 800 more by making our 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.560
 first movements 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.270
 Okay, it 's the first thing I do in 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.520
 any shift is to make the first 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.520
 buildings and let's start with the good 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.410
 which is our capital and I think it is not 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.460
 concessions do not have enough money 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:10.960
 In this case we have nine my is and we have 126 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:14.410
 to spend is not very think I do not give 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.400
 to build anything 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.810
 sincerely because everything is very expensive 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:25.750
 We're going to build something just to 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.740
 experience who you think this is a 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.570
 championship 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:36.150
 I think the plan was never Portuguese. 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:36.150
 but finally confirm this 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:46.020
 ok in the city 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:51.040
 we can raise and lower taxes 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:54.670
 in this case as public order is 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.850
 high enough and I'm going to increase 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.680
 to very high 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:05.560
 This will give us something more to a cache is 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:07.540
 but what's great 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.400
 while public order is 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.180
 above 100 percent 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.980
 and it's good that you see seeing a way 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.130
 more practical how is the order 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:20.290
 public in your city through these 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.030
 here below do not see this 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.670
 if we have a green face means 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.970
 everything is fine and in the castles 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:32.320
 exactly the same thing but the castells 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.610
 we can not act and it 's the taxes 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.820
 It was one thing I want to do is 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.820
 ramp up 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.340
 Either way, let's see how much it is 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:45.060
 what do we have to spend? 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:48.840
 we have 532 is on the 11 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:51.210
 we have a buffer in our economy is 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.199
 so let's build something on 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:59.849
 Lisbon 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:07:04.669
 Ah and how lisboa is a city 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:08.699
 start building conditions 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:11.520
 public order economics 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:14.789
 but in this case as we both jackman 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:18.120
 with a Catholic faith is very 

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:19.349
 important we want in the graces of the pope 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.909
 so the first construction I 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:26.069
 I will do almost always a town is 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:26.759
 a church sincerely and this is what I 

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:30.210
 I will make 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:32.250
 costs one thousand are different but 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.580
 certainty that will compensate for a future 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.580
 next 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:41.520
 OK 

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:45.180
 we build a church here is always a 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:47.430
 thing that I want to show you is that 

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.120
 we got to see with ours also with the 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.969
 potato 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:54.080
 in this case the Pope of the states 

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:54.080
 dad is 40 years old 

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.830
 it is fitting there are enough Catholic factions
