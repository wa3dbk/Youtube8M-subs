00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:17.570
 Absolutely If you had got the wrong or not a little bit it a little two just to the item But thigh I continue to be 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:19.160
 Let's also take a look a little carried out Yes First This newspaper with the policy of useless 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.760
 Yomiuri Shimbun 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.010
 It is titled that 10% judgment is influential in the administration but it is assumed over the consumption tax 1% 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.820
 Be 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:35.310
 We also introduce the Ono political schedule 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:39.809
 Yes , this is also the horse there was a little consumption tax but 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:46.000
 That I should not be doing things that say sound like stepping on it brake and accelerator say that this 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:51.370
 You're that well is basically another this is that large I say that increasing the pie 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.350
 It is especially this kind of sound consumption tax unless it is in the form of raising the whole body from 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:59.109
 Choi z's is this 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:02.860
 Every time either Naa wide range of all millionaire also 8% 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:07.509
 I 'm over 8% in poverty, I 'm still not good 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:11.170
 Naturally I can't do something like that because it gives such a cake an awesome effect 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:13.340
 Then, speaking more, if it comes to public works or something, it will increase work 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.079
 Japan is expanding more than anything 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.109
 It is fundamentally wrong because it is the figure of the original economy of the sound of 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:26.450
 I Ano This is the Ministry of Finance Toka such Keikei ministry 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:31.909
 It is that Kedomo's why this do do not be this that cheated that I ne economy 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.330
 There are a lot of papers that are good in the moment, etc. I really do this in the Diet more 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.100
 Among the LDP, this should be 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:43.830
 I think I should discuss it, but I heard from one of the current members of the Diet 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:47.460
 State, such as appraisal and it Toka then Advisory Council rather than have like doing Re mother of the National Assembly 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:53.350
 If it is set to this is speaking more I from different anymore at all 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.010
 If you get bored, it will affect your business and business , for example. 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.030
 Sound is high 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:04.790
 The company also says in ui , but it is something that will be profitable 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.390
 His hearing dot If you wait too long and doing things a woman gather that kind of guys I Rakuten Toka it several times 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.050
 I will do it 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:14.220
 Even if we can get rid of the regulations, everyone's right 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.450
 That's why corporate tax cuts are that way too, so that law says that you can not lower 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.430
 I'm not too 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:26.380
 It is said from the old people people's surname in this problem from such a place 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:29.740
 A little more I that old progressive tax basis rather than sucking leave Anofundaku' 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.760
 I think I should still do something a little more and I 'm looking at the Communist Party so I'm saying 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.510
 I 'm calling but 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:39.379
 I really say so 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:44.390
 Cotton, linen, Re I'm is the figure of capitalism in our country because hot after and that after all this 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:49.489
 After all, if you don't look there, there's simply no money 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:52.500
 Problem 's not I think I do Do not think you or I opposed our consumption tax 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.890
 I think that I want to oppose this by 10% following tax increase 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.960
 And one more thing I'm concerned about is Sankei Shimbun 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:08.640
 Tomorrow in the form of utilizing foreign workers in the field of household chores and nursing care 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:12.490
 I guess that the government is doing it in such a thing Yes I am content that issue to consider recommendations 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:17.770
 A little Ushinohi Oh that per cent 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.610
 There are people who are mostly carers, but they all quit because they have low salaries 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.520
 I 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:27.160
 That's not to say that there is no human resources, so much labor, that is to say, physically 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:32.510
 It is also physically difficult 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.720
 Katsumata Another thing is that you retire mentally and then old man or something like that 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.650
 The biggest problem is loneliness 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.760
 Old old samurai fish with loneliness in rosy rosy problem 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.010
 Or it is a problem of the mind by doing people who need nursing care 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:52.230
 So and will do Japanese is important in terms of the sense 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:58.829
 Such a person who Agero have money and say here in pride and your gold fried speaking it more? 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:03.450
 If you ask me to double salary , I will increase that appearance-like worker 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:07.000
 The sound of Gorogoro is still my generation 65 sounds around 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:11.200
 Guy I Genki laden guys et al say anymore want this 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.880
 There will be a lot of people who want to receive this kind of sound pension, because these kind of people care 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.269
 Is the money was me 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:21.720
 You why and are unemployed Datte young people in the form of a collection is not the kind of form 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:26.400
 So in that sense before you enter that foreigner 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:29.590
 I kind of thing or To another ne ne that you must that watered and housework and 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.880
 I have no time to do it, so I'm going to go like this 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.490
 So neatly I Toka properly allowance to properly Dow parenting Toka such a place is done 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:41.800
 If you can follow what you say 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.000
 Kedomo do not even want to do the work but are women who want the original to do the work children likely in the wo 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.620
 Parenting and child care 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.580
 I want to take care of my family, but I have no money, so I'm sure the skin is beautiful 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.020
 I'm already there, please laugh at me 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.430
 Put from diplomatic Speaking If you have not enough not I wonder that fine granularity to those things 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:01.370
 I want to compensate 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:08.539
 Also this odious view is Olympic saltiness This is what people hold 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:09.600
 There Olympic Toka building industry is so-so got a What I do is more than it is a professional This is also the actual night 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:14.550

 If another absolutely I'm doing at the same time this will be but I will absolutely opposite 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:22.020

 Immigrants and monsters Something ridiculous Then one more daily Newspaper cross 30 days newspaper 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:29.590
 Though 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:33.790
 Re-entry Tsu small foreigners working in Japan regard immigration is luring a family from their home country 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.280
 I think that's not to say that the policy was put in place to speed up the procedure . 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:43.550
 Ne 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:43.550
 Well, one of the most hostile countries in Japan is China or Korea 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:01.210
