people the way that we incubate is

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.010 
people the way that we incubate is
essentially<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.460> actually<00:01:09.030> embrace<00:01:09.420> all<00:01:09.960> of

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
essentially to actually embrace all of

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.899 
essentially to actually embrace all of
these<00:01:10.350> different<00:01:10.500> work<00:01:10.860> styles<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.610> first

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
these different work styles the first

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.000 
these different work styles the first
time<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.170> discover<00:01:13.530> something<00:01:13.619> new

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
time that you discover something new

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.640 
time that you discover something new
that<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.369> love<00:01:14.960> that's<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.409> first

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that you love that's what the first

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.429 
that you love that's what the first
moment<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.729> when<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.330> walked<00:01:18.720> up<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
moment was like when I walked up to the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.429 
moment was like when I walked up to the
sensor<00:01:19.920> gesture<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.150> saw<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.600> come<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.259> life

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
sensor gesture and saw that come to life

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.940 
sensor gesture and saw that come to life
on<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.770> screen<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.490> knew<00:01:23.759> we<00:01:24.119> had<00:01:24.270> something

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
on the screen we knew we had something

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.399 
on the screen we knew we had something
when<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:25.979> took<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.150> first<00:01:27.450> demos<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.080> were

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
when we took the first demos that were

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.830 
when we took the first demos that were
using<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.920> skeletal<00:01:29.430> tracking<00:01:29.939> technology

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
using the skeletal tracking technology

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.649 
using the skeletal tracking technology
and<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.860> actually<00:01:32.310> had<00:01:32.460> people<00:01:32.729> using<00:01:33.360> every

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and we actually had people using every

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.359 
and we actually had people using every
part<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.020> their<00:01:34.200> body<00:01:34.409> not<00:01:34.920> only<00:01:34.950> were<00:01:35.220> they

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
part of their body not only were they

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.060 
part of their body not only were they
smiling<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.450> they<00:01:36.630> said<00:01:36.810> hey<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.140> was<00:01:37.409> actually

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
smiling but they said hey I was actually

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.590 
smiling but they said hey I was actually
there<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.759> brilliant<00:01:39.090> things<00:01:39.329> is

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
there one of the brilliant things is

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.440 
there one of the brilliant things is
that<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.619> 3d<00:01:41.040> camera<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.970> first<00:01:42.000> time

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
that the 3d camera for the first time

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.600 
that the 3d camera for the first time
it's<00:01:42.780> got<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.110> available<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.890> gives<00:01:44.430> you

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
it's got to be available that gives you

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
it's got to be available that gives you
the<00:01:44.640> three-dimensional<00:01:45.479> information<00:01:46.259> about

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the three-dimensional information about

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.319 
the three-dimensional information about
the<00:01:46.799> distance<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.430> every<00:01:47.670> point<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> body

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the distance to every point on the body

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.609 
the distance to every point on the body
but<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.869> doesn't<00:01:49.110> actually<00:01:49.140> give<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.530> an

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
but it doesn't actually give you an

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.710 
but it doesn't actually give you an
interpretation<00:01:50.250> where<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.820> limbs<00:01:51.000> are<00:01:51.270> what

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
interpretation where the limbs are what

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.510 
interpretation where the limbs are what
the<00:01:51.840> angles<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> joints<00:01:52.770> are<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.430> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
the angles of the joints are so for that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.609 
the angles of the joints are so for that
we<00:01:54.149> need<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.360> build<00:01:54.720> software<00:01:54.960> what<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
we need to build software what the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.480 
we need to build software what the
