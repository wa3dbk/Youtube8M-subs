00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
lips naturally so some lip colors just

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.159 
lips naturally so some lip colors just

someone<00:04:20.590> is<00:04:20.769> mowing<00:04:21.070> bill<00:04:21.669> on

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
someone is mowing bill on

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.160 
someone is mowing bill on
this<00:04:24.060> happens<00:04:24.420> all<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.690> time<00:04:26.600> so<00:04:27.600> some<00:04:28.140> of

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
this happens all the time so some of

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.770 
this happens all the time so some of
these<00:04:28.440> lip<00:04:28.710> colors<00:04:29.070> didn't<00:04:29.550> look<00:04:29.760> great<00:04:30.120> on<00:04:30.510> my

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
these lip colors didn't look great on my

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.180 
these lip colors didn't look great on my
lips<00:04:31.020> because<00:04:31.200> my<00:04:31.470> lips<00:04:31.620> are<00:04:31.710> really

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
lips because my lips are really

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.370 
lips because my lips are really
pigmented<00:04:32.490> naturally<00:04:33.210> royal<00:04:33.900> red<00:04:34.140> for

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
pigmented naturally royal red for

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.410 
pigmented naturally royal red for
example<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:34.950> did<00:04:35.130> not<00:04:35.310> like<00:04:35.580> on<00:04:35.790> my<00:04:35.910> lips<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.360> I

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
example I did not like on my lips and I

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.300 
example I did not like on my lips and I
you<00:04:36.480> could<00:04:36.780> probably<00:04:36.930> even<00:04:37.290> tell<00:04:37.650> just

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
you could probably even tell just

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.010 
you could probably even tell just
because<00:04:38.670> that<00:04:39.150> well<00:04:39.390> first<00:04:39.630> of<00:04:39.810> all<00:04:39.900> the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
because that well first of all the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.420 
because that well first of all the
darker<00:04:40.320> ones<00:04:40.500> I<00:04:40.650> do<00:04:40.710> think<00:04:41.010> you<00:04:41.100> need<00:04:41.190> a<00:04:41.250> lip

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
darker ones I do think you need a lip

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.560 
darker ones I do think you need a lip
liner<00:04:41.640> with<00:04:41.820> especially<00:04:42.240> if<00:04:42.330> you're<00:04:42.450> like

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
liner with especially if you're like

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.660 
liner with especially if you're like
mine<00:04:42.810> my<00:04:43.020> lips<00:04:43.290> I<00:04:43.500> feel<00:04:43.830> like<00:04:43.950> there's<00:04:44.130> no<00:04:44.370> like

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
mine my lips I feel like there's no like

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.660 
mine my lips I feel like there's no like
line<00:04:45.630> line<00:04:46.080> on<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.650> outside<00:04:46.830> of<00:04:47.040> my<00:04:47.070> lips<00:04:47.310> over

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
line line on the outside of my lips over

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.310 
line line on the outside of my lips over
here<00:04:47.940> so<00:04:48.390> that's<00:04:48.570> something<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:48.960> struggle<00:04:49.020> with

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
here so that's something I struggle with

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.960 
here so that's something I struggle with
so<00:04:49.530> if<00:04:49.620> it's<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.860> darker<00:04:50.160> color<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.490> really<00:04:50.550> do

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
so if it's a darker color I really do

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.880 
so if it's a darker color I really do
have<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.510> wear<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.690> lip<00:04:51.870> liner<00:04:52.050> with<00:04:52.320> them<00:04:52.530> so

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
have to wear a lip liner with them so

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.820 
have to wear a lip liner with them so
the<00:04:53.220> wear<00:04:53.490> time<00:04:53.790> on<00:04:54.030> this<00:04:54.210> is<00:04:54.480> not<00:04:54.810> I<00:04:55.200> mean

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
the wear time on this is not I mean

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.870 
the wear time on this is not I mean
fantastic

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
fantastic

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.340 
fantastic
I<00:04:57.000> would<00:04:57.240> say<00:04:57.420> I've<00:04:57.630> been<00:04:57.780> wearing<00:04:57.960> for<00:04:58.170> a<00:04:58.200> few

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
I would say I've been wearing for a few

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.990 
I would say I've been wearing for a few
hours<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.770> I've<00:04:58.890> only<00:04:59.100> reapplied<00:04:59.580> at<00:04:59.730> once

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
hours and I've only reapplied at once

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.910 
hours and I've only reapplied at once
but<00:05:00.600> of<00:05:00.720> course<00:05:00.930> this<00:05:01.080> is<00:05:01.200> a<00:05:01.230> lighter<00:05:01.500> color<00:05:01.620> so

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
but of course this is a lighter color so

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.650 
but of course this is a lighter color so
it's<00:05:02.160> not<00:05:02.250> going<00:05:02.400> to<00:05:02.460> be<00:05:02.550> as<00:05:02.700> obvious<00:05:03.000> if<00:05:03.480> it's

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
it's not going to be as obvious if it's

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.150 
it's not going to be as obvious if it's
wearing<00:05:04.050> off<00:05:04.170> because<00:05:04.500> it's<00:05:04.680> closer<00:05:04.950> to<00:05:05.070> my

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
wearing off because it's closer to my

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.640 
wearing off because it's closer to my
own<00:05:05.370> natural<00:05:05.850> lip<00:05:06.030> color<00:05:06.060> so<00:05:06.540> keep<00:05:07.260> that<00:05:07.470> in

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
own natural lip color so keep that in

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.350 
own natural lip color so keep that in
mind<00:05:07.860> because<00:05:08.130> they<00:05:08.490> are<00:05:08.580> moisturizing

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
mind because they are moisturizing

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.230 
mind because they are moisturizing
they're<00:05:09.990> not<00:05:10.260> crazy<00:05:11.130> long<00:05:11.430> wearing<00:05:11.700> however

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
they're not crazy long wearing however

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.210 
they're not crazy long wearing however
if<00:05:12.450> you've<00:05:12.600> got<00:05:12.780> a<00:05:12.810> problem<00:05:13.170> with<00:05:13.410> chapped

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
if you've got a problem with chapped

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.160 
if you've got a problem with chapped
lips<00:05:14.580> or<00:05:14.850> just<00:05:15.180> like<00:05:15.300> with<00:05:15.480> matte<00:05:15.690> lipsticks

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
lips or just like with matte lipsticks

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.950 
lips or just like with matte lipsticks
that<00:05:16.320> really<00:05:16.590> kind<00:05:16.830> of<00:05:16.950> look<00:05:17.690> just<00:05:18.690> that

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
that really kind of look just that

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.570 
that really kind of look just that
they're<00:05:19.170> really<00:05:19.350> drying<00:05:19.770> on<00:05:20.040> your<00:05:20.190> lips<00:05:20.370> and

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
they're really drying on your lips and

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.220 
they're really drying on your lips and
that's<00:05:20.640> a<00:05:20.760> problem<00:05:21.090> for<00:05:21.120> me<00:05:21.360> this<00:05:21.870> is<00:05:22.050> nice

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
that's a problem for me this is nice

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.200 
that's a problem for me this is nice
because<00:05:22.470> it<00:05:22.680> is<00:05:22.890> moisturizing<00:05:23.520> you<00:05:24.000> would

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
because it is moisturizing you would

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.610 
because it is moisturizing you would
have<00:05:24.420> to<00:05:24.570> reapply<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:25.020> throughout<00:05:25.230> the<00:05:25.410> day<00:05:25.560> so

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
have to reapply it throughout the day so

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.350 
have to reapply it throughout the day so
if<00:05:25.890> you<00:05:26.070> know<00:05:26.220> that's<00:05:26.460> not<00:05:26.670> an<00:05:26.820> option<00:05:26.970> you

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
if you know that's not an option you

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.670 
if you know that's not an option you
want<00:05:27.480> a<00:05:27.570> lipstick<00:05:27.870> that's<00:05:28.080> gonna<00:05:28.200> last<00:05:28.470> a<00:05:28.590> long

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
want a lipstick that's gonna last a long

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.350 
want a lipstick that's gonna last a long
time<00:05:28.920> these<00:05:29.370> aren't<00:05:29.580> the<00:05:29.730> lipsticks<00:05:30.090> for<00:05:30.240> you
