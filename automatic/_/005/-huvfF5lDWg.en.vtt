00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.470 
hello my name's dawn Butler of dinky
little<00:00:10.139> designs<00:00:10.759> and<00:00:11.759> I'm<00:00:11.880> going<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.090> do<00:00:12.269> some

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
little designs and I'm going to do some

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.770 
little designs and I'm going to do some
troubleshooting<00:00:12.719> with<00:00:13.710> your<00:00:13.860> airbrush<00:00:14.780> so

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
troubleshooting with your airbrush so

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.320 
troubleshooting with your airbrush so
you've<00:00:16.080> lost<00:00:16.350> all<00:00:16.740> traction<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.060> trigger

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
you've lost all traction in the trigger

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.900 
you've lost all traction in the trigger
can<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.750> see<00:00:18.930> how<00:00:19.140> floppy<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.039> shouldn't

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
can you see how floppy this is shouldn't

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.390 
can you see how floppy this is shouldn't
be<00:00:21.000> like<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.300> at<00:00:21.390> all<00:00:21.570> should<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.279> but<00:00:23.279> when

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
be like that at all should it but when

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.859 
be like that at all should it but when
this<00:00:23.550> happens<00:00:24.060> there's<00:00:24.600> nothing

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
this happens there's nothing

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.200 
this happens there's nothing
particularly<00:00:25.380> for<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.070> worry<00:00:26.310> about<00:00:26.400> but

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
particularly for you to worry about but

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.910 
particularly for you to worry about but
I'm<00:00:27.300> going<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.480> show<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.689> how<00:00:27.930> simple<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.859> is

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
I'm going to show you how simple it is

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.640 
I'm going to show you how simple it is
to<00:00:29.369> fix<00:00:29.689> now<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.750> first<00:00:31.080> thing<00:00:31.230> I'm<00:00:31.380> going<00:00:31.529> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
to fix now the first thing I'm going to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.490 
to fix now the first thing I'm going to
do<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:32.009> unscrew<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:34.200> airbrush<00:00:34.910> where<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.090> mat

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
do is unscrew the airbrush where the mat

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.680 
do is unscrew the airbrush where the mat
meets<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.739> shiny<00:00:38.070> parts<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.210> you'll<00:00:39.390> see

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
meets the shiny parts and you'll see

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.860 
meets the shiny parts and you'll see
that<00:00:39.840> we've<00:00:39.989> exposed<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.800> barrel<00:00:41.250> at<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> end

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
that we've exposed the barrel at the end

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.840 
that we've exposed the barrel at the end
now<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.110> thin<00:00:43.559> piece<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.920> metal<00:00:44.430> here<00:00:44.670> is

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
now this thin piece of metal here is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.330 
now this thin piece of metal here is
just<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> end<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.629> needle<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.340> this

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
just the end of your needle and this

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.779 
just the end of your needle and this
here<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.030> what<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.360> call<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> cone-shaped<00:00:49.410> nut

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
here is what I call the cone-shaped nut

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.100 
here is what I call the cone-shaped nut
in<00:00:50.789> here<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.809> another<00:00:52.649> barrel<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.520> that

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
in here is another barrel and that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.889 
in here is another barrel and that
screws<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.350> tight<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.129> squashes<00:00:57.120> against<00:00:57.660> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
screws in tight and squashes against a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.549 
screws in tight and squashes against a
small<00:00:58.469> spring<00:00:59.000> which<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.420> gives<00:01:00.719> traction

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
small spring which then gives traction

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.140 
small spring which then gives traction
to<00:01:02.309> our<00:01:02.460> needle<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.180> trigger<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.939> now<00:01:05.939> when

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
to our needle and trigger here now when

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.390 
to our needle and trigger here now when
you're<00:01:06.330> airbrushing<00:01:07.140> you're<00:01:07.950> actually

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
you're airbrushing you're actually

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.850 
you're airbrushing you're actually
vibrating<00:01:09.150> because<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> compressor<00:01:10.409> is

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
vibrating because the compressor is

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.660 
vibrating because the compressor is
moving<00:01:11.820> all<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.360> time<00:01:12.920> because<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.070> does<00:01:14.340> that

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
moving all the time because it does that

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.749 
moving all the time because it does that
mean<00:01:15.150> gently<00:01:15.720> works<00:01:16.049> everything<00:01:16.920> loose<00:01:17.220> and

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
mean gently works everything loose and

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.429 
mean gently works everything loose and
every<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.210> again<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.229> needs

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
every now and again it just needs

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.950 
every now and again it just needs
tightening<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.580> really<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.360> simple<00:01:21.420> as

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
tightening so it really is as simple as

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.380 
tightening so it really is as simple as
that<00:01:22.100> what<00:01:23.100> I'm<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.400> do<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:24.060> start

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that what I'm going to do is start

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.810 
that what I'm going to do is start
tightening

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
tightening

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.230 
tightening
this<00:01:26.030> larger<00:01:26.840> barrel<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.970> then<00:01:29.090> with<00:01:29.210> a

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
this larger barrel and then with a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.530 
this larger barrel and then with a
tight-knit<00:01:29.570> place<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.260> you'll<00:01:30.440> see<00:01:30.770> just

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
tight-knit place and you'll see just

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.810 
tight-knit place and you'll see just
here<00:01:32.540> on<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.840> airbrush<00:01:33.260> there<00:01:34.100> is<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.310> small

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
here on the airbrush there is a small

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.090 
here on the airbrush there is a small
piece<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.090> metal<00:01:35.300> that<00:01:35.720> I<00:01:35.990> call<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.590> tongue<00:01:36.920> of

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
piece of metal that I call the tongue of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.880 
piece of metal that I call the tongue of
a<00:01:37.190> shoe<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:37.940> that<00:01:38.780> basically<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.440> moment<00:01:39.770> is

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
a shoe and that basically the moment is

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.790 
a shoe and that basically the moment is
loose<00:01:40.190> you'll<00:01:41.120> see<00:01:41.480> it<00:01:41.630> gets<00:01:41.840> in<00:01:42.020> tighter<00:01:42.350> and

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
loose you'll see it gets in tighter and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.100 
loose you'll see it gets in tighter and
tighter<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.370> sitting<00:01:44.030> against<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.870> trigger

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
tighter and sitting against the trigger

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.910 
tighter and sitting against the trigger
just<00:01:45.440> here<00:01:46.180> so<00:01:47.180> go<00:01:47.750> with<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.110> barrel<00:01:48.500> keep

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
just here so go with the barrel keep

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.680 
just here so go with the barrel keep
screwing<00:01:49.310> as<00:01:50.210> long<00:01:50.780> as<00:01:51.050> you<00:01:51.200> can<00:01:52.300> keep<00:01:53.300> going

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
screwing as long as you can keep going

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.000 
screwing as long as you can keep going
keep<00:01:53.900> going<00:01:53.930> keep<00:01:54.380> going

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
keep going keep going

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.430 
keep going keep going
you<00:01:55.760> should<00:01:56.060> find<00:01:56.360> now<00:01:56.690> that<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:57.080> is<00:01:57.140> all

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
you should find now that that is all

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.740 
you should find now that that is all
nice<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.040> tightly<00:01:58.310> in<00:01:58.580> place<00:01:58.850> I'm<00:01:59.509> going<00:01:59.660> to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
nice and tightly in place I'm going to

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.420 
nice and tightly in place I'm going to
make<00:01:59.900> sure<00:01:59.930> that<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.410> cone<00:02:00.619> shape<00:02:00.920> nut<00:02:01.250> is

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
make sure that the cone shape nut is

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.130 
make sure that the cone shape nut is
also<00:02:01.759> tight<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:03.710> then<00:02:03.890> simply<00:02:04.580> take<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.210> back

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
also tight and then simply take the back

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.969 
also tight and then simply take the back
of<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.500> airbrush<00:02:07.000> pop<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.179> back<00:02:08.209> in<00:02:08.570> place<00:02:08.979> and

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
of the airbrush pop it back in place and

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.520 
of the airbrush pop it back in place and
now<00:02:10.190> look<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:11.180> see<00:02:11.360> how<00:02:11.540> my<00:02:11.690> trigger<00:02:12.020> springs

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
now look you see how my trigger springs

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.030 
now look you see how my trigger springs
back<00:02:12.860> into<00:02:13.250> place<00:02:14.020> so<00:02:15.020> it<00:02:15.170> was<00:02:15.290> as<00:02:15.440> simple<00:02:15.680> as

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
back into place so it was as simple as

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.330 
back into place so it was as simple as
that

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
that
