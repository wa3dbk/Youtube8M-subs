was<00:00:49.770> only<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.100> dollar<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> thought<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.000> I'd

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
was only a dollar so I thought that I'd

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.850

try<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.570> out<00:00:51.750> because<00:00:51.930> I've<00:00:52.140> never<00:00:52.320> tried<00:00:52.649> the

try it out because I've never tried the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.860

old<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.190> brand<00:00:53.399> before<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.360> thought<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.660> I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
old to brand before so I thought that I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.569 
old to brand before so I thought that I
might<00:00:55.170> as<00:00:55.350> well<00:00:55.500> buy<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.160> then<00:00:56.280> see<00:00:56.460> how

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
might as well buy this and then see how

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.939

stretchy because it does look really

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.600
