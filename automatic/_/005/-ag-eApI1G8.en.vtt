00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.199
 the title of the exhibition in Viersener 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.270
 stadtpark suggests this 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.460
 Advertising for the art is called

 della natura dedicated the boys once with 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.850
 the gallerist small together 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:12.320
 hosted the invitation cards 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:16.400
 posters a nearly four-meter-tall fabric 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.729
 edition the with me and in italy 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.509
 and 1982 we had 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:29.000
 the opening where I then in the bus 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:32.549
 rose wine opened and drunk 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.579
 and so we have there then 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:41.070
 also for the first time always makes do 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:44.270
 twelve times mister balzer small car 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.220
 Then it was only dozens of us 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.470
 Art equal capital is the name of this work 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.200
 a title that is often misunderstood 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.500
 the board member andreas boy 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.940
 us 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.010
 what we see here of course the 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.770
 confrontation with capitalism 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.010
 and capital understood a big one 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.500
 theory of beuys art equals capital 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.090
 He did not mean that he was there 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.040
 he earns a lot of money for his art 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.170
 meant that the creativity of the people 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.170
 The capital of society is 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.520
 nonetheless, the art of beuys 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.680
 You have always been good at money 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.380
 make like gallerist erhard small in 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.960
 one of his opening speeches is a pleasure to tell 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.420
 work him boys cheap for 500 mark 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.970
 left in the years later from the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.790
 clamp 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.190
 The stories added that these 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.210
 drawing at the present time already 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.100
 worth about 14,000 d mark and there I am 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.620
 just do not bring money for one 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.530
 needed the new car has and sooner 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.709
 it was ready to pay that amount 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.470
 there was a heavy heart from now on 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.110
 so he was happy and me again 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.190
 had the best percentage of business 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.190
 made of my life 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.290
 For Beuys money was only a means to an end 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.959
 Almost all revenue flowed into the 7000 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.610
 oak project and the free 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.270
 international university the boys 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.310
 founded 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.330
 after the art academy dÃ¼sseldorf 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.610
 celebrated 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:26.400
 because he accepts everyone as a student 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:29.320
 wanted there was great for me when he was the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.130
 claim of the worker for art 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.230
 after the first world war all influences 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.170
 State influences away from the 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.600
 The carriages did the academies said 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.780
 anyone can study with me everyone 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.950
 is an artist everyone is recorded 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.100
 and of course there is the state 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.769
 so can not beat back boys and 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.780
 if he is there he is his 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.980
 professors job here grew up but 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.980
 that was brave 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.890
 art weapon boys encompassing one 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.500
 life attitude and not on objects 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.510
 with signature limited to his ideas 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.980
 to bring under the people he used 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.680
 not just his trademark 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.319
 but brought some work with 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.870
 a very high circulation among the people for 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.690
 market expert is beuys today 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.829
 an example 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.639
 where is it still someone who still today 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.850
 Inspired and art is communication 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.350
 But communication is also an art 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.389
 and for me, the work of beuys 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.580
 not for many decades at all 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.570
 opened and suddenly gave such a 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.220
 initial ignition 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.600
 and then you started with it 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.340
 to deal with then also noted 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.190
 how much substance someone like beuys 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:46.199
 ultimately, and he also writes here 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:49.530
 Nicely do it yourself at Beuys 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:52.229
 always very marked he always wanted 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.350
 which also motivates the observer 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.669
 to do it yourself and one of his big ones 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.260
 Philosophy is also every human being 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.360
 an artist that often gets wrong 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:05.000
 understood what he means by everyone 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.000
 is creative in his own way 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.839
 myself said i have my whole life 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.459
 long recruited 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:12.759
 but you should go for it 

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:15.619
 interested in what I advertised 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:18.189
 The exhibition is in response to this 

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:18.189
