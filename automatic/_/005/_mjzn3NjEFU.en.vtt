00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.870 

once<00:01:54.439> you've<00:01:54.650> lined<00:01:54.860> up<00:01:55.040> your<00:01:55.189> cherry<00:01:55.400> glass<00:01:55.610> I

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
once you've lined up your cherry glass I

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.210 
once you've lined up your cherry glass I
like<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.750> use<00:01:56.930> some<00:01:57.140> sellotape<00:01:57.470> just<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:57.979> mark

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
like to use some sellotape just to mark

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.340 
like to use some sellotape just to mark
out<00:01:58.430> where<00:01:58.460> that's<00:01:58.820> going<00:01:59.150> to<00:01:59.299> need<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.479> be<00:01:59.780> so

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
out where that's going to need to be so

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.960 
out where that's going to need to be so
I<00:02:00.380> just<00:02:00.590> placed<00:02:00.860> this<00:02:01.040> around<00:02:01.430> the

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
I just placed this around the

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.270 
I just placed this around the
circumference<00:02:02.930> of<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.439> bottom<00:02:03.950> of<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.100> glass

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
circumference of the bottom of the glass

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.460 
circumference of the bottom of the glass
just<00:02:04.640> as<00:02:04.790> like<00:02:04.970> a<00:02:05.000> marker<00:02:05.330> but<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:06.170> can<00:02:06.290> also

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
just as like a marker but you can also

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.800 
just as like a marker but you can also
use<00:02:06.830> dry<00:02:07.130> white<00:02:07.369> markers<00:02:07.820> provided<00:02:08.390> anything

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
use dry white markers provided anything

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.210 
use dry white markers provided anything
that's<00:02:08.989> you<00:02:09.110> know<00:02:09.140> not<00:02:09.470> going<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.679> be<00:02:09.800> marking

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
that's you know not going to be marking

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:20.920 
that's you know not going to be marking
the<00:02:10.310> plate<00:02:10.489> permanently<00:02:19.569> then<00:02:20.569> you<00:02:20.660> want<00:02:20.840> to

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
the plate permanently then you want to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.290 
the plate permanently then you want to
take<00:02:21.080> your<00:02:21.319> superglue<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.130> just<00:02:22.489> turn<00:02:22.970> cherry

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
take your superglue and just turn cherry

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.990 
take your superglue and just turn cherry
glass<00:02:23.510> upside<00:02:23.720> down<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.580> apply<00:02:25.580> the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
glass upside down and apply the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.910 
glass upside down and apply the
superglue<00:02:26.450> all<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.930> way<00:02:27.080> across<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.769> bottom

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
superglue all the way across the bottom

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.820 
superglue all the way across the bottom
of<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:29.230> recommend<00:02:30.230> doing<00:02:30.350> this<00:02:30.560> step

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
of that I recommend doing this step

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.280 
of that I recommend doing this step
outside<00:02:31.130> just<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:32.299> that<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.600> don't<00:02:32.630> get<00:02:32.959> kind

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
outside just so that you don't get kind

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.090 
outside just so that you don't get kind
of<00:02:33.350> overwhelmed<00:02:33.860> by<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.069> fumes<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.860> then<00:02:36.980> you

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
of overwhelmed by the fumes and then you

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.470 
of overwhelmed by the fumes and then you
want<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.280> turn<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.580> Shari<00:02:37.790> glass<00:02:38.000> back<00:02:38.239> up<00:02:38.390> the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
want to turn the Shari glass back up the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.530 
want to turn the Shari glass back up the
right<00:02:38.600> way<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:38.930> place<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.709> your<00:02:40.540> guide

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
right way and place it in your guide

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.490 
right way and place it in your guide
lines<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.260> made<00:02:42.440> out<00:02:42.590> sellotape<00:02:43.160> and

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
lines that you made out sellotape and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.530 
lines that you made out sellotape and
then<00:02:45.500> press<00:02:46.010> down<00:02:46.280> firmly<00:02:46.670> on<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.060> glass<00:02:47.269> to

set<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.870> in<00:02:47.989> place<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.590> just<00:02:48.650> help<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.220> glue

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
set it in place and just help the glue

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:57.670 
set it in place and just help the glue
hold<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.269> bind<00:02:56.260> then<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.380> want<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.590> use

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
exactly the same method with the top of

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.030 
exactly the same method with the top of
