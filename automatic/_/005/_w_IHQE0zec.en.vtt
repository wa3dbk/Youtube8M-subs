here let me see if I can grab it a lot

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.059 
here let me see if I can grab it a lot
of<00:02:37.930> people<00:02:38.170> think<00:02:38.379> the<00:02:38.470> Ruby<00:02:38.739> eyed<00:02:38.829> whites

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
of people think the Ruby eyed whites

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.020 
of people think the Ruby eyed whites
actually<00:02:39.310> have<00:02:39.879> red<00:02:40.180> eyes<00:02:40.390> but<00:02:40.810> they<00:02:40.930> don't

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
actually have red eyes but they don't

actually have red eyes but they don't
see<00:02:43.030> if<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.180> can<00:02:43.269> get<00:02:43.359> the<00:02:43.480> right<00:02:43.599> light<00:02:43.840> here<00:02:45.120> it

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
see if I can get the right light here it

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.900 
see if I can get the right light here it
really<00:02:46.359> is<00:02:46.480> kind<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.989> pale<00:02:47.260> icy<00:02:47.859> blue<00:02:48.129> with

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
really is kind of a pale icy blue with

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.440 
really is kind of a pale icy blue with
kind<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.359> pink<00:02:49.690> cast<00:02:50.049> over<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.709> whole<00:02:50.859> thing

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
kind of a pink cast over the whole thing

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.300 
kind of a pink cast over the whole thing
so<00:02:52.450> it's<00:02:52.569> not<00:02:52.660> nearly<00:02:52.930> as<00:02:53.109> unattractive<00:02:53.859> as<00:02:54.160> a

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
so it's not nearly as unattractive as a

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.780 
so it's not nearly as unattractive as a
lot<00:02:54.519> of<00:02:54.609> people<00:02:54.879> think<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.680> lilac<00:02:57.250> torte<00:02:57.549> has

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790

blue grey eyes and the chocolate tortes

blue grey eyes and the chocolate tortes
have<00:03:00.250> brown<00:03:00.700> eyes<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.690> they're<00:03:05.349> all<00:03:05.530> growing

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.850 

and<00:03:24.160> eat

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.710 

it's<00:03:27.850> most<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.180> what<00:03:28.300> they<00:03:28.420> do<00:03:28.480> eat<00:03:29.140> sleep<00:03:30.720> but

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.480 
it's most of what they do eat sleep but
we<00:03:31.840> play<00:03:32.050> with<00:03:32.230> them<00:03:32.350> a<00:03:32.470> lot<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:33.160> they're

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
we play with them a lot so they're

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.770 
we play with them a lot so they're
really<00:03:33.670> getting<00:03:33.880> used<00:03:34.240> to<00:03:34.330> being<00:03:34.570> handled

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
really getting used to being handled

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.360 
really getting used to being handled
which<00:03:35.200> is<00:03:35.350> always<00:03:35.530> nice<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:38.070> as<00:03:39.070> you<00:03:39.190> can<00:03:39.310> see

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.060 
which is always nice and as you can see
Mama's<00:03:39.940> kind<00:03:40.210> of<00:03:40.270> tired<00:03:40.540> of<00:03:40.870> having<00:03:41.620> nine

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
Mama's kind of tired of having nine

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.300 
Mama's kind of tired of having nine
babies<00:03:42.640> sitting<00:03:42.910> in<00:03:43.120> with<00:03:43.300> her<00:03:43.420> all<00:03:43.600> day<00:03:43.810> long

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:57.570 

but<00:03:48.310> they're<00:03:48.460> all<00:03:48.610> very<00:03:48.640> sweet<00:03:49.300> rabbits

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.790 

so<00:03:58.150> if<00:03:58.270> you've<00:03:58.420> been<00:03:58.480> following<00:03:58.600> our<00:03:59.230> website

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
so if you've been following our website

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.460 
so if you've been following our website
or<00:03:59.980> our<00:04:00.010> blog<00:04:00.400> at<00:04:00.580> all<00:04:00.700> you'll<00:04:00.910> know<00:04:01.120> that<00:04:01.470> this

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
or our blog at all you'll know that this

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.850 
or our blog at all you'll know that this
is<00:04:02.680> clementines<00:04:03.250> very<00:04:03.550> first<00:04:03.850> litter<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:05.680> we

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
is clementines very first litter and we

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.680 
is clementines very first litter and we
certainly<00:04:06.250> did<00:04:06.460> not<00:04:06.490> expect<00:04:06.810> eleven<00:04:07.810> of<00:04:07.990> them

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.480 

so<00:04:13.690> we're<00:04:13.990> lucky<00:04:14.140> that<00:04:14.350> nine<00:04:14.740> made<00:04:15.040> it<00:04:15.190> through

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
so we're lucky that nine made it through

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.160 
so we're lucky that nine made it through
really<00:04:15.870> just<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.019> tube<00:04:17.290> runs<00:04:17.590> past<00:04:19.170> but

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
really just the tube runs past but

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.750 
really just the tube runs past but
that's<00:04:20.410> kind<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.860> be<00:04:20.890> expected<00:04:21.010> because

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
that's kind of to be expected because

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.400 
that's kind of to be expected because
you<00:04:21.970> have<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.150> remember<00:04:22.420> these<00:04:22.720> are<00:04:22.780> prey

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
you have to remember these are prey

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.960 
you have to remember these are prey
animals<00:04:23.440> so<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:26.020> more<00:04:26.230> they<00:04:26.410> have<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:27.760> more

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
animals so the more they have the more

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.530 
animals so the more they have the more
likely<00:04:28.330> they<00:04:28.510> are<00:04:28.540> to<00:04:28.660> be<00:04:28.990> eaten<00:04:29.140> anyway<00:04:29.590> so<00:04:30.540> if

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
likely they are to be eaten anyway so if

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.320 
likely they are to be eaten anyway so if
you<00:04:31.930> have<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.080> whole<00:04:32.290> bunch<00:04:32.320> of<00:04:32.590> babies<00:04:33.330> it's

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
you have a whole bunch of babies it's

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.820 
you have a whole bunch of babies it's
much<00:04:34.540> more<00:04:34.750> likely<00:04:35.140> that<00:04:35.170> some<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.590> them<00:04:35.710> will

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
much more likely that some of them will

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:43.590 
much more likely that some of them will
survive<00:04:40.260> but<00:04:41.260> they're<00:04:41.440> doing<00:04:41.680> just<00:04:41.710> fine<00:04:42.600> so

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
survive but they're doing just fine so

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.020 
survive but they're doing just fine so
they're<00:04:43.780> old<00:04:43.960> enough<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.290> that<00:04:44.820> in<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:46.000> next

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
they're old enough to that in the next

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.550 
they're old enough to that in the next
week<00:04:46.330> I'll<00:04:46.600> start<00:04:46.720> giving<00:04:46.930> them<00:04:47.230> out<00:04:47.380> some

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
week I'll start giving them out some

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.970 
week I'll start giving them out some
outside<00:04:47.980> time<00:04:48.280> in<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.580> play<00:04:48.790> area<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:50.680> see

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
outside time in the play area and see

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.640 
outside time in the play area and see
how<00:04:51.130> they<00:04:51.280> do<00:04:54.810> as<00:04:55.810> you<00:04:55.990> can<00:04:56.080> see<00:04:56.290> everyone<00:04:56.500> is

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
how they do as you can see everyone is

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.390 
how they do as you can see everyone is
doing<00:04:56.860> really<00:04:57.040> well<00:04:59.040> everyone's<00:05:00.040> happy

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
doing really well everyone's happy

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.280 
doing really well everyone's happy

interesting<00:05:22.750> I've<00:05:23.230> been<00:05:23.380> trying<00:05:23.710> to<00:05:23.919> keep

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
interesting I've been trying to keep

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.100 
interesting I've been trying to keep
track<00:05:24.370> of<00:05:24.490> what<00:05:24.940> I<00:05:24.970> think<00:05:25.390> they<00:05:25.600> are<00:05:25.630> by

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
track of what I think they are by

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.170 
track of what I think they are by
marking<00:05:26.560> their<00:05:26.710> ear<00:05:27.040> with<00:05:27.400> just<00:05:27.610> some<00:05:27.760> sharpie

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
marking their ear with just some sharpie

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.540 
marking their ear with just some sharpie
and<00:05:28.419> it<00:05:29.260> wears<00:05:29.410> off<00:05:29.560> pretty<00:05:29.620> fast<00:05:30.040> so<00:05:30.190> I<00:05:30.310> have

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
and it wears off pretty fast so I have

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.870 
and it wears off pretty fast so I have
to<00:05:30.669> kind<00:05:30.850> of<00:05:30.880> check<00:05:31.090> it<00:05:31.180> over<00:05:31.330> a<00:05:31.419> few<00:05:31.600> days<00:05:32.880> just

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
to kind of check it over a few days just

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.240 
to kind of check it over a few days just
to<00:05:34.090> make<00:05:34.300> sure<00:05:34.330> that<00:05:34.960> I'm<00:05:35.290> kind<00:05:35.919> of<00:05:36.010> on<00:05:36.130> the

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
to make sure that I'm kind of on the

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.070 
to make sure that I'm kind of on the
right<00:05:36.280> track<00:05:36.430> if<00:05:36.970> I<00:05:37.060> think<00:05:37.120> it's<00:05:37.390> a<00:05:37.510> doe<00:05:37.690> last

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
right track if I think it's a doe last

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.630 
right track if I think it's a doe last
week<00:05:38.440> and<00:05:38.820> I<00:05:39.820> think<00:05:40.150> it's<00:05:40.270> a<00:05:40.330> Jo<00:05:40.480> this<00:05:40.690> week

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
week and I think it's a Jo this week

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.480 
week and I think it's a Jo this week
then<00:05:42.640> I<00:05:42.760> know<00:05:42.820> I'm<00:05:43.560> I'm<00:05:44.560> sexing<00:05:45.100> them<00:05:45.220> fairly

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
then I know I'm I'm sexing them fairly

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.360 
then I know I'm I'm sexing them fairly
well<00:05:46.260> but<00:05:47.260> if<00:05:47.320> it<00:05:47.380> changes<00:05:47.740> back<00:05:47.890> and<00:05:48.130> forth

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
well but if it changes back and forth

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.790 
well but if it changes back and forth
which<00:05:48.580> actually<00:05:49.090> all<00:05:49.570> of<00:05:49.630> these<00:05:50.080> rabbits<00:05:50.710> have

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
which actually all of these rabbits have

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.610 
which actually all of these rabbits have
been<00:05:50.919> pretty<00:05:51.130> obvious<00:05:51.310> so<00:05:52.050> but<00:05:53.050> if<00:05:53.140> it<00:05:53.290> were<00:05:53.440> to

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
been pretty obvious so but if it were to

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.260 
been pretty obvious so but if it were to
change<00:05:53.890> back<00:05:54.100> and<00:05:54.130> forth<00:05:54.550> then<00:05:54.760> I<00:05:54.850> would<00:05:55.060> know

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
change back and forth then I would know

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.570 
change back and forth then I would know
that<00:05:55.300> I<00:05:56.080> need<00:05:56.530> to<00:05:56.590> be<00:05:56.680> extra<00:05:57.070> careful<00:05:57.220> when
