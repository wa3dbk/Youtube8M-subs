hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.420
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.350
I'm going to show you one of the
speciality Andhra Pradesh breakfast that

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.730
is Pesarattu.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.800
we call it pesarattu because green moong
we call it pesaralu and the dosa

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.029
kind of thing what we make with it is
Pesarattu. To make this pesarattu,

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.070
first we need to soak one cup of moong
dal whole that is with the skin and

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.200
half cup of rice you can reduce or
increase the amount of rice you need to

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.399
add based on the consistency you want if
you want a crispy pesarattu to you can

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.840
increase the amount of rice we add. Soak it at least for six hours

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.340
I usually soak it over night after that
put this rice and moong dal

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.760
into a blender, when you're blending this
moong dal and rice

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.379
make sure you add two pieces of green
chilli, little bit of cumin seeds and

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:03.070
ginger

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.680
but if you want your pesarattu to be
soft add a piece of onion too. When you

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.729
make this paste make sure you make it  little bit finer not too coarse and here

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:16.570
is the batter

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.180
see because there is a skin on the
lentil when you make a paste it will

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.560
automatically aerate that is the reason
why pesarattu doesn't need any

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.970
fermentation. This non fermented dough
makes excellent pesarattus.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.470
but if you want dark brown color you can
let it ferment for one or two hours but

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.850
you don't need to ferment it a lot. In
the hotel's when we make pesarattu we use

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.509
a cup to make pesarattu specially a steel one. Here I've got a glass

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:50.950
one but just pour the batter and then
spread the pesarattu to just as you do

00:01:50.950 --> 00:02:00.129
any dosai and then add oil

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:06.190
you know if you're using a nonstick you
don't need to add much oil and we also

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.720
use a technique of just; we clean the,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.879
any if there is any thick lumps we just
use a spoon and just even it out so that

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.500
your pesarattu come evenly cooked even when the pesarattu is still wet

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.670
not fully done

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.489
that's when you add a little bit of a
chopped green chilli, chopped ginger and

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.900
chopped onion, coriander you can actually mix all these ingredients and keep and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.390
then you can sprinkle at one time.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.569
Restaurants give a name to a lot of
dishes. Even this pesarattu has become

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.319
very popular with another name which we
call it MLA Pesarattu or Chairman

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.810
pesarattu, in which we add upma and
then serve the pesarattu with it,

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:03.460
so here I've got upma here, so just put upma in this and then i will;  pesarattu

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.030
ok here is your pesarattu.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.560
traditionally we serve pesarattu with ginger chutney that is alum chutney

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.540
and then with coconut chutney

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.470
here I've got the sweet ginger chutney
which i'm going to show in the next few

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:33.940
sessions and also have got coconut chutney and haha..you know this is  any

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.600
Andhraite

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.680
if you give this Alum chutney and pesarattu, they'll go bonkers

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.350
