is a water regulator now I know what
you're<00:01:00.930> saying<00:01:00.960> when<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.620> use<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> water

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
you're saying when I use a water

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.009 
you're saying when I use a water
regulator<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.969> don't<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.510> enough<00:01:03.780> pressure

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
for a good shower but there are lots of

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.270 
for a good shower but there are lots of
different<00:01:07.020> types<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.380> water<00:01:07.619> regulators<00:01:08.250> to
