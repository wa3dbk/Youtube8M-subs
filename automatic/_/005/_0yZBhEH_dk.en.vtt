took it out before and it seemed like it

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.009 
took it out before and it seemed like it
was<00:02:56.620> doing<00:02:56.980> all<00:02:57.130> right<00:02:57.160> but<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.900> don't<00:02:58.900> know

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.830 
handle this
maybe<00:03:12.620> handle<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:13.070> from<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.370> edges<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.690> other

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
maybe handle it from the edges the other

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.570 
maybe handle it from the edges the other
one<00:03:14.960> fell<00:03:15.140> on<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.320> ground<00:03:15.820> but<00:03:16.820> anyway<00:03:18.580> try

not<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.910> touch<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.330> LEDs<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:21.080> don't<00:03:21.230> know<00:03:21.290> if

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
not to touch the LEDs I don't know if

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:29.710 
not to touch the LEDs I don't know if
you<00:03:21.500> can<00:03:21.680> or<00:03:21.890> not<00:03:28.030> just<00:03:29.030> gonna<00:03:29.210> snap<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.540> back

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
you can or not just gonna snap it back

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:38.850 
you can or not just gonna snap it back
in<00:03:29.900> there<00:03:34.270> see<00:03:35.270> what<00:03:35.300> looks<00:03:35.540> like<00:03:35.600> hold<00:03:36.350> on

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.690 

there<00:03:39.860> it<00:03:40.070> is<00:03:40.570> pretty<00:03:41.570> easy<00:03:41.890> now<00:03:43.750> in<00:03:45.460> real<00:03:46.460> life

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
there it is pretty easy now in real life

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.430 
there it is pretty easy now in real life
that<00:03:47.210> is<00:03:47.420> like<00:03:47.870> white<00:03:48.230> bright<00:03:49.040> white<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:50.440> the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
that is like white bright white and the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.830 
that is like white bright white and the
original<00:03:52.280> light<00:03:52.520> is<00:03:52.880> yellow<00:03:53.150> yeah<00:03:53.570> I<00:03:53.600> guess

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
original light is yellow yeah I guess

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.860 
original light is yellow yeah I guess
you<00:03:53.960> can<00:03:54.110> see<00:03:54.230> that<00:03:54.410> from<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.740> camera<00:03:55.100> so<00:03:56.090> back

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
you can see that from the camera so back

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.060 
you can see that from the camera so back
up<00:03:57.080> a<00:03:57.170> little<00:03:57.320> bit<00:03:57.880> get<00:03:58.880> a<00:04:00.070> side-by-side

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
up a little bit get a side-by-side

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.220 
up a little bit get a side-by-side
comparison<00:04:01.520> so<00:04:02.330> this<00:04:03.230> one<00:04:03.440> is<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:04.160> LED<00:04:04.820> and

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
comparison so this one is the LED and

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.920 
comparison so this one is the LED and
that<00:04:06.230> one<00:04:06.470> is<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:07.010> old<00:04:07.160> incandescent<00:04:07.520> I<00:04:08.150> think

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
that one is the old incandescent I think

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.810 
that one is the old incandescent I think
I'll<00:04:09.050> be<00:04:09.170> changing<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.680> other<00:04:09.830> side<00:04:10.130> to<00:04:10.400> LED

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
I'll be changing the other side to LED

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.790 
I'll be changing the other side to LED
because<00:04:11.120> it's<00:04:11.270> it's<00:04:11.600> much<00:04:12.170> brighter

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
because it's it's much brighter

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.100 
because it's it's much brighter
you<00:04:13.670> can<00:04:13.880> tell<00:04:14.090> it's<00:04:14.300> noticeably<00:04:14.990> brighter

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
you can tell it's noticeably brighter

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.330 
you can tell it's noticeably brighter
you<00:04:15.470> look<00:04:15.650> at<00:04:15.770> the<00:04:15.860> ARRA<00:04:16.090> in<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.630> in<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:19.040> video

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
you look at the ARRA in the in the video

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.390 
you look at the ARRA in the in the video
there<00:04:19.670> and<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:20.239> R<00:04:20.450> and<00:04:20.960> this<00:04:21.799> one<00:04:22.010> is<00:04:22.130> a<00:04:22.160> lot

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
there and the R and this one is a lot

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.520 
there and the R and this one is a lot
smaller<00:04:22.820> so<00:04:25.720> yeah<00:04:26.720> I'll<00:04:26.840> be<00:04:26.960> changing<00:04:27.200> both

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
smaller so yeah I'll be changing both

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.470 
smaller so yeah I'll be changing both
sides<00:04:27.830> I'm<00:04:28.580> gonna<00:04:28.790> change<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.090> other<00:04:29.210> side

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
sides I'm gonna change the other side

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.860 
sides I'm gonna change the other side
too<00:04:30.220> now<00:04:31.220> one<00:04:31.430> thing<00:04:31.460> to<00:04:31.670> keep<00:04:31.880> in<00:04:32.030> mind<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.540> did

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
too now one thing to keep in mind I did

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.430 
too now one thing to keep in mind I did
this<00:04:32.990> on<00:04:33.140> purpose<00:04:33.200> since<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.370> is<00:04:34.700> a<00:04:35.440> light

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
this on purpose since it is a light

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.700 
this on purpose since it is a light
emitting<00:04:36.830> diode<00:04:37.900> diodes<00:04:38.900> only<00:04:39.410> flow

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
emitting diode diodes only flow

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.030 
emitting diode diodes only flow
electricity<00:04:40.400> in<00:04:40.610> one<00:04:41.180> direction<00:04:41.360> so<00:04:41.930> if<00:04:42.920> you

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
electricity in one direction so if you

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.030 
electricity in one direction so if you
put<00:04:43.250> it<00:04:43.370> in<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:45.080> wrong<00:04:45.260> way<00:04:45.500> it<00:04:45.740> won't<00:04:45.890> light

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
put it in the wrong way it won't light

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.920 
put it in the wrong way it won't light
up<00:04:46.100> but<00:04:47.020> just<00:04:48.100> take<00:04:49.100> it<00:04:49.190> out<00:04:50.260> turn<00:04:51.260> it<00:04:51.410> 180

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
up but just take it out turn it 180

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.730 
up but just take it out turn it 180
polarity<00:04:53.930> and

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
polarity and

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.410 
polarity and
as<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:56.920> am<00:04:59.310> so<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:00.460> can<00:05:00.640> put<00:05:00.820> one<00:05:01.000> in<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.360> it

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
as I am so you can put one in and it

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.280 
as I am so you can put one in and it
don't<00:05:01.570> work<00:05:02.040> an<00:05:03.040> LED<00:05:03.520> like<00:05:04.090> it<00:05:04.720> doesn't<00:05:05.020> mean

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
don't work an LED like it doesn't mean

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.320 
don't work an LED like it doesn't mean
that<00:05:05.470> it's<00:05:05.950> a<00:05:06.040> bad<00:05:06.220> light<00:05:06.460> it<00:05:06.700> just<00:05:06.910> means<00:05:07.120> she

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
that it's a bad light it just means she

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.520 
that it's a bad light it just means she
probably<00:05:07.480> got<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:07.900> connections<00:05:08.350> backwards

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.030 

back<00:05:14.530> up<00:05:16.080> look<00:05:17.080> at<00:05:17.170> the<00:05:17.260> light<00:05:17.440> show

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
back up look at the light show

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:26.430 
back up look at the light show
let<00:05:18.490> me<00:05:18.580> turn<00:05:18.760> mine<00:05:18.940> only<00:05:19.060> in<00:05:19.180> her<00:05:19.270> huh<00:05:25.440> mo

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
let me turn mine only in her huh mo

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:37.010 
let me turn mine only in her huh mo
bettah<00:05:27.840> that's<00:05:28.840> some<00:05:29.080> old<00:05:29.440> better<00:05:29.740> lighting

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.080 

there<00:05:38.020> little<00:05:38.200> steep<00:05:38.500> 14<00:05:39.400> bucks<00:05:39.640> for<00:05:39.940> two

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
there little steep 14 bucks for two

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.570 
there little steep 14 bucks for two
lights

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
lights

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.950 
lights
hopefully<00:05:42.580> they'll<00:05:42.790> last<00:05:43.060> long<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:43.660> and

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
hopefully they'll last long and and

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.240 
hopefully they'll last long and and
they're<00:05:44.800> a<00:05:44.830> lot

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
they're a lot

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.000 
they're a lot
they're<00:05:45.550> already<00:05:45.940> brighter<00:05:46.660> than<00:05:46.990> than<00:05:47.830> the

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
they're already brighter than than the

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.550 
they're already brighter than than the
old<00:05:48.190> light<00:05:48.430> so<00:05:48.960> we'll<00:05:49.960> give<00:05:50.200> it<00:05:50.230> a<00:05:50.410> whirl

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
old light so we'll give it a whirl

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.270 
old light so we'll give it a whirl
it's<00:05:53.560> all<00:05:53.710> I<00:05:53.740> got

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
it's all I got

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.760 
it's all I got
later
