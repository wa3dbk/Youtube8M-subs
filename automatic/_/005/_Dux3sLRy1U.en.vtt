00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
could set these two zeros to defaults

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.770 
could set these two zeros to defaults
and<00:02:01.040> take<00:02:02.040> some<00:02:02.280> time<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.790> look<00:02:03.479> at<00:02:03.689> your

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340

framing<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.000> viewfinder<00:02:52.160> but<00:02:53.160> I'll<00:02:53.280> go

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
framing in the viewfinder but I'll go

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.370 
framing in the viewfinder but I'll go
back<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.880> that<00:02:54.030> because<00:02:54.270> my<00:02:54.540> normal<00:02:55.230> image

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
back to that because my normal image

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.240 
back to that because my normal image
aspect<00:02:56.540> ratio<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.570> would<00:02:57.810> operate<00:02:58.800> on<00:02:58.980> four

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
aspect ratio I would operate on four

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.550 
aspect ratio I would operate on four
thirds
