00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.599
 free 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.609
 Augst goes today shows you put on is the oldest kind and 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:19.020
 wise 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.020
 his albums of the Fab make Muntwiler 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.269
 40 40 very relaxed and easy a new hole Count erläuter makes it yes 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.269
 March shows the video 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.579
 Mine now seriously 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.850
 I recommend Polzer because pull 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.870
 To buy the benefits it is very cheap drugstore 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.130
 that for example it cost 61 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.790
 It is very good for getting stubborn dirt from your party 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.120
 for example 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.120
 or on the remains 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.320
 it evaporates after a short time why that of Rutesheim lot 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.650
 and holds up long 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.650
 because you do not need that much 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.390
 first come off over 1 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.570
 So BMW has the stuff between Lenka's why so quickly the handle so a 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.940
 bit off the handlebar 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.940
 so that there is a small cavity 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.490
 Here I took my child to better illustrate how it works 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.940
 just let go of gasoline so the outer edge of the grippier one 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.460
 Handlebars and slept 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.010
 and thus the liquid remains in it 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.980
 if you let go of the gas is already distributed 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.980
 and we help turn to India 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.840
 Kurt next helping 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.000
 now the handle is easier to buy you get the gas 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.490
 fight under control 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.490
 Let go of Volkmar a bit further down 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.470
 You can do that until the whole club turns and so easy 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.469
 pull off 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:27.719
 next step Handlebar Clean or degrease 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.719
 Stäbe clean 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.360
 The gasoline is super suitable for it especially in combination with one 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.079
 clean rag 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.979
 now comes some pace in the matter 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:45.729
 Since the stuff quickly flies you have to do a little more around the 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:48.069
 To be able to use sliding properties 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.529
 quietly a little more generously run the gasoline in the handle 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:53.139
 while turning the handle 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.139
 if she spreads nicely 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.829
 Bernd supply fast handlebars and Pak Tok pulled the handle on the handlebars 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.359
 until he moves in the right position 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:09.229
 on the second page, of course, too 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:21.099
 provided handles and handlebars are clean or 9 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.019
 Namborn Hofer wait a maximum of five minutes 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.129
 and the handle is rock solid 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.679
 because the gas for 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:31.769
 unbelievable or 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:32.849
 important 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.849
 Handlebars still stuck on it 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:40.489
 because that protects the handlebars and protects your body from injury violations 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.699
 the Wars go to the next 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.390
 dollar 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.040
 that's for sure
