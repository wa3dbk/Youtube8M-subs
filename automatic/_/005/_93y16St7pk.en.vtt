00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.560
 the 6 series indeed exists a high coupe 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.270
 of range and 2004 a convertible in 2012 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.510
 well decided to add a third 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.860
 body variant this great coupe 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.560
 it is a coupe 4 doors way 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.810
 mercedes cls or audi a7 sportback see 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.759
 porsche panamera a normal service on 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.020
 great age which cut two doors without 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.120
 coaching to stay in the 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.770
 philosophy cut a few cm in 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.079
 wheelbase and in total length that 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.670
 exceeds here the 5 meters the appellation 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.670
 ransacking the rear doors 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.500
 a little zoom on the logos on 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.420
 the car indicates a novelty xdrive 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.890
 the integral transmission of bmw is 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.480
 present on our car is actually 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.850
 that a big part of the range series 6 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.380
 including coupes and convertibles not 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.430
 of doubt audi and his quattro are in 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.600
 line 2000 continued with the 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.730
 technical novelties this time under the 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.280
 hood of 50 me still means a v8 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.860
 4400 this double turbo but he passed 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.690
 from 407 to 450 horses 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.840
 our test model claims as well 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.220
 4.4 seconds to go from 0 to 100 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.619
 only two tenths more than 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.320
 m6 cut a large cut m6 is 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.300
 planned for 2013 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.310
 good then you already know the v8 4 4 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.340
 double turbo to gain power 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.140
 he is now 450 horses despite that 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.270
 he is very discreet he does a really 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.740
 sportsman but then anyway 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.940
 potatoes 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.070
 indeed for the sound it will take 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.600
 ironing you can barely hear the v8 c'en 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.280
 is almost frustrating especially beside 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.610
 panamera gts or engine noise 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.740
 is a feast to him alone bones continue 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.780
 so this series 6 gran cut by 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.710
 report to syria if this normal alain 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.409
 long wheelbase 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.700
 it gives him more stability say 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.380
 that it sagi a little bit compared 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.180
 at the coupe or cabriolet 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.979
 despite this for a car over 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.570
 five meters long she seems 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.740
 extremely dynamic it's a little 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.510
 little the same effect as in a panamera 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.460
 if you want so she is very 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.710
 pleasant to drive even better 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.720
 balanced that the coupe because we 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.610
 keep a very biting front train here in 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.630
 the more we have the four wheel drive and 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.040
 you have seen we are on small 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.910
 mountain roads has a little fat 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.360
 wet and we can move quickly 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.710
 800 problem is pretty bluffing 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.480
 bluffing indeed of efficiency and 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.620
 facility for the more athletic he 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.450
 lacks the equivalent of a differential 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.100
 quattro sport that sends more torque 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.650
 on the outer wheels turning this 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.090
 which further increases agility in 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.170
 the other meaning that of comfort our 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.570
 large coupe have the option 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.370
 adaptive drive that allows the choice of 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.140
 more comfort in driving modes 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.330
 influence in particular the suspension 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.710
 driven in this comfort mode plus the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.540
 car becomes less two at wish 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.950
 depending on the mode chosen you can 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.690
 turn your car into a sedan 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.530
 comfortable or in section and dynamic 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.530
 a delight 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.200
 needless to say that in all 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.430
 case the passengers are pampered start 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.140
 by those from the back since this is the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.360
 specificity of our car compared 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.800
 at the coupe in the big coupe they are 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.210
 much better treat both for 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.820
 accessibility of course thanks to 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.930
 doors but also in habitability she 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.280
 can detail them would do same time 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.950
 that they are in a limo like his 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.390
 sport commands elec curiosity ago 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.240
 a fifth place but the passenger in 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.740
 question will be very poorly installed at 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.360
 forward our shark version is entitled to 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.590
 leather up or the dashboard and 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.330
 white ash inserts 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.620
 story to demonstrate that you can to 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.580
 just about all asked as soon as you 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.400
 ask for the program 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.660
 individual bmw customization for 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.280
 equipment there is just about everything there 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.630
 including night vision fires 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.030
 Fully led headlamp display 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.110
 and do not know where to turn in from the top of 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.490
 range both by the quality of 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.230
 finishing presentation by 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.280
 the equipment even if a certain part 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.750
 remains optional 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.060
 that's enough to justify in part the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.770
 price the 6 50 x trail this big coupe 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.350
 starts at 99 thousand euros 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.640
 our model revolves around 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.040
 120 thousand euros once every 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.630
 options add two ways to see the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.260
 things are out of price 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.360
 delirious elitist or if you have 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.400
 means an alternative to the m600 to 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.470
 hardly less successful or even 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.180
 a very serious competitor ds is or 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.180
 panamera it's according to
