00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.210 
and it will be about the same size and a
little<00:02:42.430> bit<00:02:42.489> stronger<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:44.590> we're<00:02:44.769> going<00:02:44.980> with

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
little bit stronger but we're going with

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.430 
little bit stronger but we're going with
gamma<00:02:45.549> got<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.329> right<00:02:46.569> now<00:02:46.599> so<00:02:46.989> I'm<00:02:47.170> going

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
gamma got to you right now so I'm going

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:56.819 
gamma got to you right now so I'm going
to<00:02:47.470> attach<00:02:47.769> my<00:02:48.010> thread<00:02:48.280> at<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.489> eye<00:02:48.519> I<00:02:55.829> smeared

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
to attach my thread at the eye I smeared

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.860 
to attach my thread at the eye I smeared
over<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.489> little<00:02:57.640> bit<00:02:57.819> so<00:02:58.120> I'm<00:02:58.180> gonna<00:02:58.299> go<00:02:58.420> back

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.830 

you<00:03:01.870> just<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.680> know<00:03:02.829> I've<00:03:02.920> got<00:03:03.099> this<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:04.060> polar

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
you just you know I've got this a polar

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.670 
you just you know I've got this a polar
driver<00:03:06.299> comes<00:03:07.299> in<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.540> patches<00:03:08.109> like<00:03:08.140> this

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
driver comes in this patches like this

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.339 
driver comes in this patches like this
and<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:11.709> real<00:03:12.099> velvety<00:03:13.019> material<00:03:14.019> kind<00:03:14.260> of

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
and it's real velvety material kind of

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.900 
and it's real velvety material kind of
just<00:03:14.500> feels<00:03:14.680> like<00:03:14.799> what<00:03:15.010> stuff<00:03:15.129> animals<00:03:15.760> are

this excess stuff okay so now I got the

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.810 
this excess stuff okay so now I got the
polar<00:04:20.500> fiber<00:04:20.799> tied<00:04:21.160> in<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.830> hardest<00:04:24.550> part<00:04:24.729> of

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
polar fiber tied in the hardest part of

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.939 
polar fiber tied in the hardest part of
this<00:04:24.910> fly<00:04:25.180> is<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.570> epoxy<00:04:26.139> making<00:04:26.470> this<00:04:26.560> epoxy

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
this fly is the epoxy making this epoxy

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.580 
this fly is the epoxy making this epoxy
body<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:28.300> we<00:04:28.389> got<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.600> prepare<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:29.169> in<00:04:29.320> a<00:04:29.410> way

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
body so we got to prepare it in a way

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.500 
body so we got to prepare it in a way
that<00:04:30.210> we<00:04:31.210> put<00:04:31.389> that<00:04:31.539> epoxy<00:04:31.870> on<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:32.440> will<00:04:33.510> be

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
that we put that epoxy on it will be

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.140 
that we put that epoxy on it will be
perfectly<00:04:34.930> round<00:04:35.260> it'll<00:04:35.710> be<00:04:38.639> symmetrical<00:04:39.639> if

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
perfectly round it'll be symmetrical if

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.610 
perfectly round it'll be symmetrical if
you<00:04:40.270> have<00:04:40.389> too<00:04:40.570> much<00:04:40.660> epoxy<00:04:41.139> on<00:04:41.169> one<00:04:41.380> side<00:04:41.590> and

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
you have too much epoxy on one side and

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.850 
you have too much epoxy on one side and
won't<00:04:41.860> rock<00:04:42.070> ride<00:04:42.400> straight<00:04:43.360> in<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.600> water<00:04:43.860> so

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
won't rock ride straight in the water so

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.980 
won't rock ride straight in the water so
now<00:04:45.039> i'm<00:04:45.850> going<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:46.060> use<00:04:46.210> some<00:04:46.419> tinsel<00:04:46.690> this

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
now i'm going to use some tinsel this

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.640 
now i'm going to use some tinsel this
comes<00:04:47.500> on<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.680> school<00:04:48.930> gold<00:04:49.930> on<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.139> side<00:04:50.470> and

on my side and tie it in the same place

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.990 
on my side and tie it in the same place
up<00:05:02.260> front<00:05:05.099> and<00:05:06.099> i'm<00:05:06.220> going<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.430> make<00:05:06.610> it<00:05:06.760> run

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
up front and i'm going to make it run

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.719 
up front and i'm going to make it run
like<00:05:07.300> just<00:05:07.960> right<00:05:08.770> down<00:05:08.979> the<00:05:09.190> side<00:05:09.370> of<00:05:09.430> the

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
like just right down the side of the

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.420 
like just right down the side of the
hook<00:05:12.729> shank<00:05:13.680> i'll<00:05:14.680> be<00:05:14.800> able<00:05:14.860> to<00:05:15.099> see<00:05:15.220> when<00:05:15.400> i

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
hook shank i'll be able to see when i

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:23.189 
hook shank i'll be able to see when i
put<00:05:15.639> this<00:05:15.760> next<00:05:15.970> piece<00:05:16.240> on<00:05:16.510> I<00:05:20.699> kind<00:05:21.699> of<00:05:22.169> roll<00:05:23.169> it

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
put this next piece on I kind of roll it

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.320 
put this next piece on I kind of roll it
over<00:05:23.470> here<00:05:23.949> so<00:05:24.160> I<00:05:24.220> can<00:05:24.280> see<00:05:24.580> what<00:05:24.729> I'm<00:05:24.820> doing<00:05:24.849> on

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
over here so I can see what I'm doing on

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:32.339 
over here so I can see what I'm doing on
the<00:05:25.419> other<00:05:25.539> side<00:05:30.690> and<00:05:31.690> you<00:05:31.750> don't<00:05:32.080> have<00:05:32.199> to

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
the other side and you don't have to

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:37.650 
the other side and you don't have to
worry<00:05:32.560> about<00:05:35.160> everything<00:05:36.160> being<00:05:36.970> tied<00:05:37.449> in

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
worry about everything being tied in

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.100 
worry about everything being tied in
real<00:05:37.960> tight<00:05:38.260> because<00:05:38.590> this<00:05:38.740> is<00:05:38.889> going<00:05:39.039> to<00:05:39.340> be

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
real tight because this is going to be

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.920 
real tight because this is going to be
all<00:05:42.030> epoxy<00:05:43.030> do<00:05:43.270> it's<00:05:43.539> all<00:05:43.659> going<00:05:43.840> to<00:05:43.870> be

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
all epoxy do it's all going to be

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.920 
all epoxy do it's all going to be
cemented<00:05:44.409> together<00:05:44.710> up<00:05:45.159> front<00:05:46.349> okay<00:05:47.349> so<00:05:48.930> what

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
cemented together up front okay so what

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.990 
cemented together up front okay so what
you<00:05:50.020> can<00:05:50.139> see<00:05:50.199> here<00:05:50.349> is<00:05:50.889> you<00:05:51.490> can<00:05:51.639> see<00:05:51.849> how

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
you can see here is you can see how

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.250 
you can see here is you can see how
these<00:05:53.340> I'm<00:05:54.340> difficulty<00:05:55.300> seeing<00:05:55.510> but<00:05:55.900> you<00:05:56.139> can

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
these I'm difficulty seeing but you can

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.649 
these I'm difficulty seeing but you can
see<00:05:56.409> how<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:56.590> tinsel<00:05:57.340> is<00:05:57.550> flaring<00:05:57.940> away<00:05:58.330> from

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
see how the tinsel is flaring away from

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:03.260 
see how the tinsel is flaring away from
the<00:05:58.840> polar<00:05:59.020> fiber<00:06:00.210> I'm<00:06:01.210> going<00:06:01.360> to<00:06:01.449> clip<00:06:01.690> the

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
the polar fiber I'm going to clip the

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.860 
the polar fiber I'm going to clip the
the<00:06:04.979> tinsel<00:06:05.979> off<00:06:06.190> right<00:06:07.150> about<00:06:07.419> where<00:06:07.690> the

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
the tinsel off right about where the

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.900 
the tinsel off right about where the
shank<00:06:09.450> ends<00:06:10.450> and<00:06:10.599> start

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
shank ends and start

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:25.980 
shank ends and start
the<00:06:11.000> bend<00:06:12.580> straighten<00:06:13.580> that<00:06:13.670> out<00:06:20.110> and<00:06:21.110> then

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:38.350 

this<00:06:26.990> side<00:06:27.260> needs<00:06:27.530> to<00:06:27.770> come<00:06:28.040> down

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.749 

so<00:06:39.020> I<00:06:39.080> kind<00:06:39.409> of<00:06:39.469> leave<00:06:39.680> these<00:06:39.889> long<00:06:40.159> so<00:06:40.490> i<00:06:40.520> can

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 
so I kind of leave these long so i can

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:52.320 
so I kind of leave these long so i can
adjust<00:06:41.919> it's<00:06:42.919> not<00:06:43.159> a<00:06:43.189> perfect<00:06:43.520> angle<00:06:49.810> down

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
adjust it's not a perfect angle down

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.270 
adjust it's not a perfect angle down
here<00:06:53.330> we<00:06:53.419> go<00:06:53.599> I'm<00:06:54.409> going<00:06:54.710> to<00:06:54.770> clip<00:06:54.979> it<00:06:55.129> off

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
here we go I'm going to clip it off

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:02.700 
here we go I'm going to clip it off
right<00:06:55.939> on<00:06:56.300> same<00:06:56.810> length<00:06:57.110> as<00:06:57.259> the<00:06:57.289> other<00:06:57.500> side

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.710 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:13.209 

and<00:07:06.009> there<00:07:07.009> you<00:07:07.129> go<00:07:11.379> next<00:07:12.379> step<00:07:12.560> idea<00:07:12.889> is<00:07:13.069> I've

00:07:13.209 --> 00:07:13.219 
and there you go next step idea is I've

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:17.830 
and there you go next step idea is I've
got<00:07:13.400> a<00:07:13.430> little<00:07:13.639> puddle<00:07:13.969> of<00:07:14.389> zappy<00:07:15.080> gap<00:07:15.409> glue
