mess that heats up that'll run down

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.750 
mess that heats up that'll run down

through the ham and it takes longer to

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.000 
through the ham and it takes longer to
bake<00:03:19.939> this<00:03:20.299> because<00:03:20.840> it's<00:03:21.200> not<00:03:21.409> that<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.799> ham

needs<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.489> be<00:03:22.579> baked<00:03:22.849> because<00:03:23.269> it's<00:03:23.480> already

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
needs to be baked because it's already

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.270 
needs to be baked because it's already
fully<00:03:24.170> cooked<00:03:24.349> but<00:03:26.500> when<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:27.680> put<00:03:27.980> it<00:03:28.099> in
