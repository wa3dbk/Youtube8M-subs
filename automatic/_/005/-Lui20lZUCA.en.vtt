00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.240 
pillar and then when he walks up to the
couch<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.140> leans<00:02:01.290> forward<00:02:01.380> he<00:02:01.799> could<00:02:01.979> subdue

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
couch and leans forward he could subdue

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.690 
couch and leans forward he could subdue
him<00:02:02.640> but<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.990> only<00:02:04.350> worked<00:02:04.770> sometimes<00:02:05.219> and

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
him but that only worked sometimes and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.119 
him but that only worked sometimes and
sometimes<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.420> didn't<00:02:06.719> work<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:06.960> I'm<00:02:07.439> hesitant

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
sometimes it didn't work so I'm hesitant

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.699 
sometimes it didn't work so I'm hesitant
to<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.879> don't<00:02:09.209> want<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.509> recommend<00:02:10.410> doing

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
something that

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.310 
something that
isn't<00:02:12.860> guaranteed<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.580> work<00:02:13.760> every<00:02:14.180> time<00:02:14.450> so

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
used to have to wait for another sort of

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.289 
used to have to wait for another sort of
cycle<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.440> as<00:03:42.860> you<00:03:42.950> can<00:03:43.100> see<00:03:43.340> there<00:03:43.549> was<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.730> god

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
cycle and as you can see there was a god

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.810 
cycle and as you can see there was a god
far<00:03:45.260> right<00:03:45.530> there<00:03:45.799> if<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:46.370> were<00:03:46.519> to<00:03:46.670> walk

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
far right there if you were to walk

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.509 
far right there if you were to walk
across<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.510> corridor<00:03:47.870> now<00:03:48.370> he<00:03:49.370> would<00:03:49.489> be

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
across the corridor now he would be

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.039 
across the corridor now he would be
lesser<00:03:49.880> so<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.120> just<00:03:50.239> have<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.510> wait<00:03:50.690> for<00:03:50.930> him

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
lesser so you just have to wait for him

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.020 
lesser so you just have to wait for him
