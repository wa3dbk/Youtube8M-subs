can you can you give what you would what

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.120 
can you can you give what you would what
you<00:05:32.420> feel<00:05:32.810> would<00:05:33.020> be<00:05:33.200> some<00:05:33.440> of<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.620> reasons

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
you feel would be some of the reasons

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.040 
you feel would be some of the reasons
for<00:05:34.220> them<00:05:34.550> to<00:05:34.670> come<00:05:34.880> here<00:05:35.300> and<00:05:35.420> do<00:05:35.570> that<00:05:35.810> rather

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
for them to come here and do that rather

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.590 
for them to come here and do that rather
than<00:05:36.260> just<00:05:36.620> continuing<00:05:37.280> in<00:05:37.430> Israel<00:05:37.880> why<00:05:38.270> why

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
than just continuing in Israel why why

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.020 
than just continuing in Israel why why
why<00:05:39.020> would<00:05:39.080> they<00:05:39.350> seek<00:05:39.680> a<00:05:39.860> partnership<00:05:40.580> here

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
why would they seek a partnership here

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.780 
why would they seek a partnership here
in<00:05:41.180> Canada<00:05:41.690> in<00:05:41.870> Europe<00:05:42.470> well<00:05:43.430> I<00:05:43.460> think<00:05:43.610> the

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
in Canada in Europe well I think the

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.430 
in Canada in Europe well I think the
first<00:05:44.000> issue<00:05:44.210> obviously<00:05:44.510> has<00:05:45.020> to<00:05:45.050> be<00:05:45.290> the

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
first issue obviously has to be the

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.190 
first issue obviously has to be the
technological<00:05:46.220> capacity<00:05:46.850> of<00:05:47.030> its<00:05:47.780> partner

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
technological capacity of its partner

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.050 
technological capacity of its partner
institutions<00:05:48.950> here<00:05:49.990> clearly<00:05:50.990> there<00:05:51.350> is<00:05:51.380> a

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
institutions here clearly there is a

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.080 
institutions here clearly there is a
scientific<00:05:53.080> foundation<00:05:54.080> for<00:05:54.890> work<00:05:55.190> in<00:05:55.460> drone

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090

scientific foundation for work in drone
related<00:05:56.600> activity<00:05:57.169> which<00:05:58.130> they<00:05:58.370> find<00:05:58.669> useful

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
related activity which they find useful

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.170 
related activity which they find useful
and<00:05:59.540> in<00:05:59.930> some<00:06:00.200> measure<00:06:00.610> you're<00:06:01.610> also<00:06:01.820> dealing

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
and in some measure you're also dealing

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.230 
and in some measure you're also dealing
with<00:06:02.540> a<00:06:02.570> fairly<00:06:03.050> vast<00:06:03.650> area<00:06:04.220> where<00:06:04.910> they<00:06:05.060> can

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
with a fairly vast area where they can

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.500 
with a fairly vast area where they can
do<00:06:05.330> a<00:06:05.360> great<00:06:05.660> deal<00:06:05.870> of<00:06:05.900> flying<00:06:06.320> unmonitored

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
do a great deal of flying unmonitored

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.300 
do a great deal of flying unmonitored
which<00:06:08.510> it<00:06:08.870> would<00:06:09.230> not<00:06:09.410> be<00:06:09.590> the<00:06:09.710> case<00:06:09.890> if<00:06:10.160> they

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
which it would not be the case if they

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.460 
which it would not be the case if they
attempted<00:06:10.820> it<00:06:11.000> over<00:06:11.390> the<00:06:11.510> Sinai<00:06:11.750> desert<00:06:11.960> for

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
attempted it over the Sinai desert for

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.080 
attempted it over the Sinai desert for
example<00:06:13.010> so<00:06:13.790> there<00:06:14.750> are<00:06:15.340> fundamental<00:06:16.340> reasons

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
example so there are fundamental reasons

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.150 
example so there are fundamental reasons
why<00:06:17.360> this<00:06:17.419> is<00:06:17.810> extremely<00:06:18.350> useful<00:06:18.380> for<00:06:18.950> them

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
why this is extremely useful for them

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.400 
why this is extremely useful for them
the<00:06:19.970> other<00:06:20.150> question<00:06:20.660> that<00:06:20.690> comes<00:06:20.990> to<00:06:21.140> my<00:06:21.380> mind

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
the other question that comes to my mind

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.940 
the other question that comes to my mind
immediately<00:06:21.830> is<00:06:22.780> is<00:06:23.780> this<00:06:24.050> a<00:06:24.080> technological

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
immediately is is this a technological

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.700 
immediately is is this a technological
trade<00:06:25.310> or<00:06:25.580> the<00:06:26.330> Israelis<00:06:26.870> trading<00:06:27.320> their

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
trade or the Israelis trading their

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.640 
trade or the Israelis trading their
technology<00:06:28.430> for<00:06:29.390> what<00:06:29.570> they<00:06:29.720> can<00:06:29.930> squeeze<00:06:30.380> out

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
technology for what they can squeeze out

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.340 
technology for what they can squeeze out
of<00:06:30.710> their<00:06:31.220> partners<00:06:31.669> in<00:06:32.300> northern<00:06:32.810> Quebec<00:06:33.140> and

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
of their partners in northern Quebec and

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.620 
of their partners in northern Quebec and
the<00:06:34.100> answer<00:06:34.430> seems<00:06:34.640> to<00:06:34.820> be<00:06:34.910> at<00:06:35.150> least<00:06:35.330> in<00:06:35.480> their

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
the answer seems to be at least in their

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.070 
the answer seems to be at least in their
judgment<00:06:36.110> that<00:06:36.230> they<00:06:36.410> kept<00:06:36.620> they<00:06:36.830> can<00:06:37.840> if<00:06:38.840> you

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
judgment that they kept they can if you

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.050 
judgment that they kept they can if you
look<00:06:39.290> at<00:06:39.440> the<00:06:39.500> strategy<00:06:40.190> of<00:06:40.220> most<00:06:40.730> third<00:06:41.030> world

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
look at the strategy of most third world

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.710 
look at the strategy of most third world
countries<00:06:41.720> which<00:06:42.710> Israel<00:06:43.130> is<00:06:43.250> not<00:06:43.460> one<00:06:43.760> they

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
countries which Israel is not one they

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.200 
countries which Israel is not one they
tend<00:06:45.080> to<00:06:45.200> start<00:06:45.740> with<00:06:46.070> a<00:06:46.100> foreign<00:06:46.580> investment

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
tend to start with a foreign investment

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.409

move<00:06:47.900> to<00:06:48.110> joint<00:06:48.380> ventures<00:06:49.419> then

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
move to joint ventures then

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.690 
move to joint ventures then
co-production<00:06:51.230> agreements<00:06:51.830> and<00:06:51.980> then<00:06:52.550> they

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:52.700 
co-production agreements and then they

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.219 
co-production agreements and then they
spin<00:06:53.030> that<00:06:53.210> off<00:06:53.450> and<00:06:53.660> develop<00:06:54.020> their<00:06:54.080> own

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
you reverse that process which is what I

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.369 
you reverse that process which is what I
see<00:07:04.689> in<00:07:04.840> this<00:07:04.960> case<00:07:05.520> is<00:07:06.520> where<00:07:06.969> the<00:07:07.839> Israelis

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:08.379 
see in this case is where the Israelis

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:10.170 
see in this case is where the Israelis
are<00:07:08.529> going<00:07:08.740> abroad<00:07:09.009> with<00:07:09.339> a<00:07:09.370> certain<00:07:09.759> level<00:07:09.999> of
