if<00:01:28.570> it<00:01:28.689> gets<00:01:28.810> stuck<00:01:29.049> just<00:01:29.350> get<00:01:29.500> on<00:01:29.619> in<00:01:29.799> there

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
if it gets stuck just get on in there

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.609 
if it gets stuck just get on in there
and<00:01:30.009> mix<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:30.460> around<00:01:30.549> a<00:01:30.790> little

if<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:33.070> bananas<00:01:33.520> are<00:01:33.640> really<00:01:33.670> hard<00:01:34.270> and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
if the bananas are really hard and

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.370 
if the bananas are really hard and
frozen<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:37.299> a<00:01:37.420> little<00:01:37.630> harder<00:01:37.900> to<00:01:38.049> blend<00:01:38.140> up

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
frozen it's a little harder to blend up

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.539 
frozen it's a little harder to blend up
so<00:01:38.590> if<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:38.830> can<00:01:39.009> take<00:01:39.159> them<00:01:39.280> out<00:01:39.369> of<00:01:39.430> the
