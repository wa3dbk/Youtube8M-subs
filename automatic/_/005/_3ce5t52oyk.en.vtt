00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
and it will animate the piece back so

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.170 
and it will animate the piece back so
like<00:00:53.980> this<00:00:54.160> you<00:00:54.399> know<00:00:54.520> we<00:00:54.609> can<00:00:54.730> animate<00:00:55.059> the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
piece back with the undo so it's really

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.229 
piece back with the undo so it's really
a<00:00:57.129> hybrid<00:00:57.640> now<00:00:57.850> between<00:00:58.320> click<00:00:59.320> and<00:00:59.530> click<00:00:59.739> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
a hybrid now between click and click and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.560 
a hybrid now between click and click and
drag<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.480> drop<00:01:01.690> so<00:01:02.500> this<00:01:03.180> interface<00:01:04.180> option

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570

is available from the my stuff white
interface<00:01:07.150> page<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:08.369> if<00:01:09.369> you<00:01:09.580> go<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:11.200> above

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
interface page and if you go just above

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.830 
interface page and if you go just above
just<00:01:11.860> below<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:13.180> meet<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.390> boards<00:01:13.840> here

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
