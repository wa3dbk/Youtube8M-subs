00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.840
 of the game where I had downloaded it 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.210
 for example me here in the my folder 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.870

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.610
 what you have to do is extract 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.190
 only the first and expected 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.470
 This is the first and you wait for the one 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.020
 I just extracted what is to bring everyone 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.410

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.160
 jce 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.090

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.250
 and here choose where you have the game worth 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.000

 install and wait for this to end 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.030
 what is going to do is going to install 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.109
 the servers that currently work 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.459

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.190
 servers that currently work 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.470
 then it will update the servers if 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.419

 I know 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.110
 a moment that what you want to teach 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.820
 so you can see it so you can see that 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.529
 it works 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.849
 ok no 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.849
 and now I have to go 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.780
 you have always seen the message that 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.400
 they have put to me it is worth so always that 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.190
 leave that message of alea not because if 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.460
 you do not see yourself with less quality and what 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.930
 you will have to adjust always 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.930
 and good to see if it starts now 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.320
 ok as you see now we have started to 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.510
 this is a multiplayer mode like you see 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.700
 it works ok here are the mods that I 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.660
 I have some with the one in the previous 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.890
 video then this is the one of the arraigo vale 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.530
 also tell you that I'm going to upload a 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.270
 compilation of mods of weapons as 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.760
 the cripple in multiplayer and everything 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.790
 that you would have the video later that 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.070
 I'm preparing and good to leave also 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.400
 the download link of the mods is worth 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.080
 Well, here you give the play server and 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.510
 here you have all the servers these 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.870
 ok for example I'm going to get in here 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.020
 to play 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.250
 because in these servers you raise the level 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.040
 in a second it's worth because they 're 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.650
 hacked all and well let's see 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.880
 now I'm going to take a little bit of 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:06.320
 departure 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:09.110

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.410
 said you can leave your like because 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.870
 this deserves a lot of likes because 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:18.020
 There are many people who are looking for it 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.030
 and the servers do not work 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.639
 how it works, you can leave your 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:26.379
 light and good here we take the caixa 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:29.409
 and well here I am playing with the 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:31.500
 command to the play that figured to be able 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:35.430
 play games with the command of play 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:37.080
 that's very easy since the tutorial of how 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.170
 configure it to play with the command of 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.120
 play or you are looking for them is in a 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.760
 good moment as you see now is 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.040
 been in the multiplayer with guiris and 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.050
 Well, let's finish the game if 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.889
 we can 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.889
 They are allies 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.680
 to a little side but why am I 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:02.550
 recording more than anything 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.550
 180 pink they say 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.660
 here 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:13.759
 one 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.930
 then the goal of the villa or the game 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.270
 with whom not 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:32.980
 norton fruit 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:35.129
 good for the game, then it's worth 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.770
 I'm going to finish the tutorial 

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:40.169
 tell you that this works 100% worth and 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:43.559
 well I hope you are this game to 

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:45.199
 play because for me it is one of the 

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:50.910
 better, it works for me again 

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:54.390
 today we are going to kill the last one and that's it 

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.390
 we left the server 

00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:01.070
 and well, that's to burst the button 

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:03.290

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.900
 favorites and pass it on to your friends 

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:08.210
