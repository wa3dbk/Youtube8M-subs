00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.300
 welcome to this new video on 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.910
 windows 8 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.849
 this focus will be on research 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.210
 regard to research because I already have it 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.990
 made to see but after the presentation of 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.240
 balmer 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.060
 let's say on the first day of the conference 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.949
 build of the retreat because I saw one 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.789
 which I really liked and that is 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.609
 the type of search implemented in 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.189
 windows 8 then connected to all the others 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.880
 applications and it's something that already 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.030
 we have seen but had not paid attention to 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.739
 how bing research works and how 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.200
 perfectly integrated into the system 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.469
 especially with regards to the 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.940
 Tablet 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.430
 in the end because always of that 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.930
 Now let's talk away even only 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.059
 windows 8 on a fixed system and let's see 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.020
 the time to trigger the search is done for 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.300
 windows button 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.309
 q as we have already seen and being in 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.189
 in the homescreen we say in the start menu 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.140
 we do research in applications ourselves 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.299
 of course we can do a search in 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.060
 any application we then have 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.610
 installed and see a little bit like 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.729
 it works mostly as a very thing 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.490
 touch friendly and above all how it is 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.960
 very fast and integrated every thing 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.860
 developer can integrate this type 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.250
 about in your application 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.840
 so it is something that then will go 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.020
 improve 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.020
 if we do a search we see a 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.869
 what we can look for now not 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.920
 I can think of a lot but oh well 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.170
 let's try then let's try 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.420
 looking for troll face we have no app 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.630
 corresponding no settings 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.200
 no file of course we follow on 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.670
 store 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.710
 we don't need to open the store 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.229
 do the research and just click 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.500
 simply on the application and there 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.619
 the search result will appear in 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.870
 a moment if we go to the contacts for 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.510
 example we see that I have no one 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.700
 contact with the name troll face se 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.650
 let's go to ebay as you see the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.750
 what some results perhaps find us 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.080
 we come a little bit then obviously here 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.820
 the connection is the host and we find 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.650
 sweatshirts with the troll face 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.630
 as you can see I didn't look for I don't have 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.610
 had to open the app look up sto 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.810
 doing everything directly from the 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.790
 start menu 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.520
 we see it if between some face 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.980
 result in finance no 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.740
 if we look in the fire I believe that not 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.150
 will find nothing caramia collected images 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.010
 we can do the same research on 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.740
 google search and this is the example of 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.450
 an application that integrates research 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.030
 perfectly 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.870
 we can search for interpar weather maps 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.670
 etc. etc. 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.260
 we can also look for others 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.850
 applications name ready to go 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.030
 this is the first time really that 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.850
 in fact they open this application but 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.690
 removed the small page and finds things 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.360
 with prof 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.910
 face we search on skydrive less in the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.740
 our files on filter etcetera 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.120
 what I liked most though is 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.830
 search on bing looking for suding 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.610
 we have this this interface 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.500
 truly exceptional there really is 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.050
 optimized for tablets 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.940
 then in the end is the possibility of 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.300
 search both on the web and in images 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.750
 directly with a click and we have 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:34.620
 a whole series of ad groups 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.570
 genre but a cool thing about the idea 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.900
 I said but it's then if we look up 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:43.230
 noncyclopedia for example trans ci 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.209
 open by clicking ccf internet explorer e 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.100
 we end up looking for 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.720
 internet out this i don't know if it's one 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.370
 which also does to you when I say on 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.690
 link should open schoolchildren 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.160
 it takes a bit of white to open it 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.740
 I am always a home of mine 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.960
 the moment we take bing and it 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.660
 move you see there is the search again 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.640
 inside left or right 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.110
 look what happens we all have 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:12.910
 so we can stacked results 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.620
 see if maybe our first of a 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.780
 result we didn't like we can go 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.549
 to see the other results 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.380
 simply by pressing c above 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.320
 I repeat, I have this weight problem 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.180
 of which by clicking on a link on 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.890
 internet and now it takes ten 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.050
 second type to open it 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.690
 but absolutely not a thing happens 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.490
 to others because also in the 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.460
 I present this problem not 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.560
 I saw it I think it's something 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.260
 I don't know why you can anyway 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.260
 seeing beauty is a site I don't know 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.490
 because it doesn't open it I'm looking for among the 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:51.630
 various results and I can browse on 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.040
 right and still have the 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.650
 possibility of having the results of 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.970
 research that we continue to fill up man 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:04.150
 hand flowing smoothly that 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:07.780
 she was pretty without problems and without 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.400
 no other amendment aside I repeat 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.490
 this problem that I or with the internet 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.840
 spider then search if we that 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.840
 we reopen the search bar we have 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.840
 those pebbles or covered just something 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.210
 that I do n't know what we give so we have vi 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.610
 I repeat, an integrated search is really 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.810
 extended to the whole system for all 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.090
 applications that support and that 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:35.700
 obviously they will become more and more 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.700
 truly an excellent integrated system
