pop that's when you know that it's ready

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.270 
pop that's when you know that it's ready
to<00:02:56.090> move<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.350> can<00:02:57.500> see<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.890> cumin<00:02:58.250> seeds

has bound the mustard seeds which is

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.130 
has bound the mustard seeds which is
beginning<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.400> pop<00:03:04.640> this<00:03:05.300> point<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.780> can<00:03:05.930> add

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
beginning to pop this point you can add

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.850 
beginning to pop this point you can add
the<00:03:06.489> ginger<00:03:10.660> when<00:03:11.660> you<00:03:11.810> can<00:03:11.989> add<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.410> carrots

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
the ginger when you can add the carrots

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:49.520 
the ginger when you can add the carrots
to<00:03:13.070> it

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.119 

also<00:03:50.530> it'll<00:03:50.709> cover<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.340> pot<00:03:52.860> so<00:03:53.860> that<00:03:53.890> the

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
also it'll cover the pot so that the

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.990 
also it'll cover the pot so that the
process<00:03:54.610> is<00:03:54.790> passing<00:03:56.310> so<00:03:57.310> as<00:03:57.430> you<00:03:57.519> can<00:03:57.640> see<00:03:57.700> the

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
process is passing so as you can see the

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.349 
process is passing so as you can see the
lentils<00:03:58.480> have<00:03:58.810> cooked<00:03:59.769> at<00:04:00.700> this<00:04:00.879> stage<00:04:01.150> you

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
lentils have cooked at this stage you

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:09.809 
lentils have cooked at this stage you
can<00:04:01.390> go<00:04:01.780> ahead<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.079> add<00:04:02.319> the<00:04:02.590> salt<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:08.819> and

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
can go ahead and add the salt to it and

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:23.040 
can go ahead and add the salt to it and
you<00:04:09.940> can<00:04:10.090> add<00:04:10.269> some<00:04:10.629> cumin<00:04:11.140> powder

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.439 

some<00:04:24.050> black<00:04:24.350> pepper<00:04:24.710> powder<00:04:25.070> this<00:04:26.000> ghostly

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
some black pepper powder this ghostly

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:33.400 
some black pepper powder this ghostly
ground<00:04:26.810> black<00:04:27.050> pepper<00:04:31.750> so<00:04:32.750> all<00:04:33.020> of<00:04:33.229> these

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
ground black pepper so all of these

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.400 
ground black pepper so all of these
spices<00:04:33.889> that<00:04:34.310> we<00:04:34.490> used<00:04:34.729> today<00:04:35.030> they<00:04:35.419> have

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.870 

qualities<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.680> them<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.220> they<00:04:40.639> have<00:04:40.850> a

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
qualities to them and they have a

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.110 
qualities to them and they have a
specific<00:04:41.600> taste<00:04:42.199> to<00:04:42.590> them<00:04:42.770> so<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.460> taste<00:04:43.850> of

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
specific taste to them so the taste of

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.050 
specific taste to them so the taste of
these<00:04:44.270> spices<00:04:44.540> have<00:04:44.960> our<00:04:45.199> bitter<00:04:45.530> pungent<00:04:46.130> and

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
these spices have our bitter pungent and

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.500 
these spices have our bitter pungent and
astringent<00:04:47.930> taste

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
astringent taste

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.850 
astringent taste
so<00:04:50.510> these<00:04:50.780> teas<00:04:51.199> are<00:04:51.680> especially<00:04:52.250> good<00:04:52.970> for

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
so these teas are especially good for

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.740 
so these teas are especially good for
winter<00:04:54.860> you<00:04:55.400> normally<00:04:55.910> like<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.180> add<00:04:56.510> the

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
winter you normally like to add the

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.260 
winter you normally like to add the
spinach<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.650> baby<00:04:57.830> spinach<00:04:58.190> and<00:04:58.460> at<00:04:58.850> the<00:04:59.060> very

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
spinach the baby spinach and at the very

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.409 
spinach the baby spinach and at the very
end<00:04:59.660> of<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.080> cooking<00:05:00.440> because<00:05:01.430> I<00:05:01.460> like<00:05:02.150> the

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
end of the cooking because I like the

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.480 
end of the cooking because I like the
texture<00:05:02.870> of<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.530> spinach<00:05:03.979> that's<00:05:04.160> not

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
texture of the spinach that's not

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.129 
texture of the spinach that's not
overcooked<00:05:05.289> so<00:05:06.289> we'll<00:05:06.560> add<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:07.160> baby<00:05:07.940> spinach

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.240 

so<00:05:12.139> the<00:05:12.410> lemon<00:05:13.070> juice<00:05:13.520> I<00:05:13.940> had<00:05:14.180> it<00:05:14.330> at<00:05:14.479> the<00:05:14.630> end

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
so the lemon juice I had it at the end

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.010 
so the lemon juice I had it at the end
otherwise<00:05:16.250> it<00:05:16.490> slows<00:05:16.789> down<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:17.510> cooking

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
otherwise it slows down the cooking

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.850 
otherwise it slows down the cooking
process

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
process

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.850 
process
so<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.520> lemon<00:05:20.120> juice<00:05:20.449> goes<00:05:20.780> in<00:05:20.960> at<00:05:21.320> the<00:05:21.470> very

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
so the lemon juice goes in at the very

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:29.879 
so the lemon juice goes in at the very
end<00:05:23.349> at<00:05:24.349> this<00:05:24.560> stage<00:05:24.800> you<00:05:25.010> can<00:05:25.160> just<00:05:25.340> mix<00:05:25.580> it<00:05:25.880> up

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.800 

so<00:05:30.889> don't<00:05:31.160> over<00:05:31.580> cook<00:05:31.760> the<00:05:32.000> spinach<00:05:32.300> you<00:05:32.510> can

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
so don't over cook the spinach you can

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.020 
so don't over cook the spinach you can
offer<00:05:33.289> it<00:05:33.530> and<00:05:33.710> it<00:05:33.770> cooks<00:05:34.039> in<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.400> heat<00:05:35.289> and

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
offer it and it cooks in the heat and

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.690 
offer it and it cooks in the heat and
then<00:05:38.030> I<00:05:38.060> add<00:05:38.419> the<00:05:38.780> cilantro<00:05:39.740> the<00:05:40.250> sisters

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
then I add the cilantro the sisters

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.460 
then I add the cilantro the sisters
natural<00:05:41.240> it<00:05:41.360> has<00:05:41.389> been<00:05:41.840> chopped

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
natural it has been chopped

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:51.870 
natural it has been chopped
you<00:05:43.220> can<00:05:43.400> add<00:05:43.580> additives<00:05:44.150> for<00:05:44.389> garnishing<00:05:45.050> and

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.530 

the<00:05:52.880> soup<00:05:53.120> is<00:05:53.360> ready<00:05:53.389> to<00:05:53.720> be<00:05:54.229> served
