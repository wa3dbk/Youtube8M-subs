00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 or what grace in the city â€‹â€‹today with one 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.870
 transporters again and that are yesterday 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.719
 or today the new xbox controllers and 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.580
 the new xbox in transport almost all 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.340
 come out 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.470
 and since it is still unclear what the third 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.720
 Mode in the weapon is therefore there 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.580
 multiplayer campaign and there is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.330
 a third mode is still there 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.460
 not known 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.179
 and if you look at the controller exactly 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.180
 then you can see 8 like that 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.370
 strokes in the form of rounds like 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.309
 it in zombies like her in black ops 2 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.700
 or black ops 1 2 and if you are now 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.860
 next to it the black ops as cover so that 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.050
 cover have a counter from black ops 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.000
 on the measures are the city â€‹â€‹guard 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.030
 You can see on the sally 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.300
 tesch cdu is also getting eight animated 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.160
 that is, 18 white strokes that is round 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.600
 actually there should be one 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.399
 give context 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.710
 I already have several youtube ago 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.719
 who are also of opinion 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.990
 the third mode will be a zombie mode 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.420
 but I do not suppose that it is the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.060
 same zombie mode is like in black 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.159
 ops 2 so perhaps other zombies 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.020
 come and maybe the story 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.479
 We all still know that differently 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.330
 not and of course I am happy if 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.600
 we get new information about it and 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.090
 everything and what is still a big indication 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.250
 that we have come a zombie mode 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.680
 simply that we are in the multiplayer of 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.900
 adtranz threw a pick 13 system 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.360
 we called in 13 places are free 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.820
 The towers weapons perks equipment 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.829
 killstreaks vary everything we have 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.530
 maximum 13 points without black ops 2 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.810
 we had pecking system so we have 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.380
 had ten places free and that's exactly what 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.479
 same 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.970
 So really with essays weapons all the same 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.530
 further you could vary everything and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.240
 if it really is that we are one 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.299
 have tommy mode from third mode 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.670
 Of course, I could subscribe because I have 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.159
 two buddies and that has the and david 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.380
 and with those, by the way, like 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.570
 zombies they are still bad and we 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.300
 that will surely raushauen many videos 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.290
 from easter eggs so far and bit 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.420
 which is not the first game and so 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.800
 absolutely subscribe and yes if it is 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.110
 I would like to talk about video 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.060
 a thumbs upwards and me 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.210
 see us in the next video hard 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.210
 ran
