of the things that that he did last year

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.380 
of the things that that he did last year
but<00:01:43.070> as<00:01:43.189> he<00:01:43.310> developed<00:01:43.640> as<00:01:43.729> a<00:01:43.759> quarterback<00:01:44.119> we

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
but as he developed as a quarterback we

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.910 
but as he developed as a quarterback we
discovered<00:01:44.869> you<00:01:45.079> know<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:45.409> he<00:01:45.530> had<00:01:45.650> certain

abilities<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.490> know<00:01:46.520> we<00:01:46.729> knew<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:47.000> he<00:01:47.090> was

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
abilities you know we knew that he was

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.999 
abilities you know we knew that he was
going<00:01:47.329> to<00:01:47.390> run<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.659> ball<00:01:47.810> he<00:01:48.439> became<00:01:48.740> very

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
going to run the ball he became very

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.410 
going to run the ball he became very
very<00:01:49.070> good<00:01:49.430> with<00:01:49.670> understanding<00:01:50.299> his

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
very good with understanding his

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.760 
very good with understanding his
receivers<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.020> understanding<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.530> entire

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
receivers and understanding the entire

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.740 
receivers and understanding the entire
scope<00:01:52.040> of<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.250> offense<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.210> phil<00:01:53.420> was<00:01:53.570> really

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
scope of the offense so phil was really

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.999 
scope of the offense so phil was really
like<00:01:53.899> having<00:01:54.049> another<00:01:54.200> coach<00:01:54.530> on<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.799> field

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
like having another coach on the field

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.100 
like having another coach on the field
so<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:56.090> could<00:01:56.210> put<00:01:56.360> him<00:01:56.479> out<00:01:56.570> there<00:01:56.600> he<00:01:56.990> could

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
so you could put him out there he could

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.600 
so you could put him out there he could
make<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.380> good<00:01:57.500> decisions<00:01:57.950> any<00:01:58.280> had<00:01:58.520> the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
make the good decisions any had the

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.490 
make the good decisions any had the
ability<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:59.000> make<00:01:59.060> all<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.299> throws<00:01:59.500> sometimes

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
ability to make all the throws sometimes

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.719 
ability to make all the throws sometimes
quarterbacks<00:02:00.920> have<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.159> ability<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.549> make

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
quarterbacks have the ability to make

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.010 
quarterbacks have the ability to make
the<00:02:01.850> throws<00:02:02.119> but<00:02:02.479> they<00:02:02.570> can't<00:02:02.780> make<00:02:02.899> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
the throws but they can't make the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.480 
the throws but they can't make the
decision<00:02:03.469> so<00:02:03.590> it's<00:02:03.710> that<00:02:03.829> disconnect<00:02:04.369> that

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
decision so it's that disconnect that

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.120 
decision so it's that disconnect that
separates<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.360> good<00:02:05.570> ones<00:02:06.409> from<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.799> great

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
separates the good ones from the great

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.969 
separates the good ones from the great
ones<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:08.420> phil<00:02:08.630> was<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.780> great<00:02:09.019> one<00:02:09.259> but<00:02:09.860> he

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
ones so phil was a great one but he

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.430 
ones so phil was a great one but he
worked<00:02:10.399> hard<00:02:10.579> at<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:10.850> whole<00:02:11.209> time<00:02:11.480> he<00:02:12.319> also

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
worked hard at that whole time he also

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.290 
worked hard at that whole time he also
had<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.650> benefit<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:12.980> time<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.970> kind<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.180> work

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
had the benefit of time to kind of work

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.520 
had the benefit of time to kind of work
into<00:02:14.540> some<00:02:14.750> of<00:02:14.870> those<00:02:14.930> things<00:02:15.110> he<00:02:15.290> was<00:02:15.410> also

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
into some of those things he was also

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.430 
into some of those things he was also
surrounded<00:02:16.010> by<00:02:16.129> any

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.050 
impact of losing him is how can we get
our<00:02:22.560> offense<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.100> structure<00:02:23.550> around<00:02:23.730> who<00:02:23.940> the
