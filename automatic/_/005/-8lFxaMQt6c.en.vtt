00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.000
 The truth is that they are the best sellers in 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:23.820
 united states in mexico with brazil and 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.860
 well I have to tell you girls 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.800
 There are people who ask me daily 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.539
 how can I protect myself better and yes there is 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.150
 the sunscreens that from 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.860
 30 is for people who have more 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.360
 skin problems or want to be very 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.180
 well protected but there are also people 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.040
 what do they tell me 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.690
 is that I want to pronounce myself is that not 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.150
 I want more protection because I want 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.160
 organize and I want to be beautiful I want to 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.620
 get a brunette and I want to put on 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.810
 Brunette well sometimes there are people who 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.210
 is not adequately protected or exposed 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.650
 in the sun without any protection and 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.230
 well at the end we finish a number 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.809
 wanted a little bit cloudy there are areas 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.250
 where this hair this you recognize not what 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.900
 what happens to you because it has happened to me that 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.550
 many times when, above all, it was very 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.979
 young lady and I had no awareness of the sun 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.400
 put the pod at the end and then it 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.880
 had had skin problems 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.369
 so 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.170
 what happens to avoid so that we 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.810
 we have to fight the skin well 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.680
 protected and well hydrated if you want 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.270
 expose to the sun 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:27.150
 you want to show off a nice tan 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.640
 There are many types of sunscreens that 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.090
 well there's the tan accelerator that 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.579
 is this 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.039
 and well then there are specifics for 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.500
 ray cabins but I'm going to 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.939
 focus more on these because because you 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.740
 you can expose the sun and you are very 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.750
 protected and now I explain you have some 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.399
 components that for me are pretty 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.009
 good ones that mainly carry aloe 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.630
 You will see that they take it maximum amount and we 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.659
 moisturizes and opens up keeps us skin 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.209
 is protected protected and regenerating 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.799
 is worth and also something very interesting 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.810
 for me that carries the oil of tree of 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.790
 tea 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.060
 you remember these granites that come out 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.000
 in summer they are a bit of a roller that 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.520
 They are also anti aesthetic or girls 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.440
 when we have shaved we have the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.330
 legs so a bit with a brunette that 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.790
 is not quite ready because these 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.140
 bronzers carry the oil this 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.150
 tea tree that makes these 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.099
 organisms also go between 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.959
 disinfectant quotes carry others 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.060
 types of oils are worth enough 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.890
 Take it, I have to write it down guys 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.840
 because I can not remember all 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.700
 the components but I'll take carrot 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.010
 hemp oil banana extract 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.630
 olive oil and good so the 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.150
 pronounced is even more beautiful than you 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.069
 take a pretty golden pigmentation in 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.769
 the normals that are in textures is very 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.810
 gel and there are others that are a bronze or 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.060
 means that when you already put it 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.340
 you are helping tans or whether 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.410
 nothing more than you have a small amount of 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.569
 sun in this yes that I am like yours 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.349
 protective please not yet six of the sun 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.580
 the sun to a certain extent is 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.170
 extraordinary but people are exposed 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.100
 many hours and that's what I come to 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.130
 give you a little bit of awareness 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.750
 take care you do not have to exaggerate 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.840
 you have to exaggerate and badly care 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.090
 skin then with this what you get 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.880
 is that with a little time of sun you have 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.740
 a much more beautiful tan is worth a 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.630
 little bit what I am going to inform you also 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.430
 important the clear smell of 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.070
 sunscreens that are common 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.520
 those that are from 30 to 50 and those that are more 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.750
 elevated have no odors but these are 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.520
 fantastic so they also teach us 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.680
 a little bit the texture they have besides 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.830
 is very cool good here the best with the 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.160
 camera you do not see it because it is not defined 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.650
 very well but it has a kind of 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.550
 capita that is removed is very easy to take 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.550
 Y 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.830
 hydrate a lot you can see a lot 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.560
 quantity of the skin quality of 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.420
 when you have put the product or not 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.740
 because you have a lot of brightness and 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.270
 it means that he is treating you 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.010
 very much they are very very very light very 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.700
 light is something that this asks me 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.550
 a lot of people 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.590
 I do not know if it looks with the camera are very 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.629
 light 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.810
 and they also absorb very quickly and the 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:15.830
 smells that we're going 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.360
 or he looks at her between dolls ballads of 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:24.510
 Christmas 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:28.020
 pineapple and coconut candies and clear no 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.670
 it's fantastic it 's very nice 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.350
 is for all those who want to look 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.240
 a very nice tan you want to be 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.340
 handsome you want to be well protected 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.290
 also not as protected as the 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.240
 protections 3050 this I want it 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.160
 emphasize because the people who have 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.420
 skin problems I would guide you already 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:48.030
 directly to a 50 or a 50 more that are 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.550
 the most adequate protections for 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.230
 you but people who are phototypes 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.400
 more tanned solar more Caucasian 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.040
 you can put them without any kind of 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.890
 problem that yes protection protection 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.090

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.370
 feed them very well take lots of fruit 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.919
