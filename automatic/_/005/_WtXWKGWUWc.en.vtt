tries<00:01:15.750> or<00:01:16.140> unless<00:01:16.439> you're<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:16.950> lucky

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
tries or unless you're really lucky

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.609 
tries or unless you're really lucky

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
you're just insane you'll get in about

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.350 
you're just insane you'll get in about
one<00:01:23.130> try<00:01:23.750> but<00:01:25.460> probably<00:01:26.460> two<00:01:26.640> tries<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.180> is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
one try but probably two tries this is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.359 
one try but probably two tries this is
really<00:01:27.570> hard<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.560> took<00:01:28.710> me<00:01:28.829> about<00:01:29.009> 30

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
really hard this just took me about 30

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.969 
really hard this just took me about 30
tribes<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.939> second<00:01:30.270> ago<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.750> got<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.680> my<00:01:31.770> first

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
tribes a second ago I got on my first

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.649 
tribes a second ago I got on my first
try<00:01:32.310> video<00:01:32.939> recording<00:01:33.600> messed<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:35.000> I<00:01:36.000> had

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
try video recording messed up and I had

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.270 
try video recording messed up and I had
to<00:01:36.810> go<00:01:36.930> forward<00:01:37.290> again<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.829> took<00:01:37.950> me<00:01:38.070> about

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
to go forward again and it took me about

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.649 
to go forward again and it took me about
30<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.720> completely<00:01:39.930> random<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.390> I<00:01:42.390> would

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
30 so it's completely random and I would

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.389 
30 so it's completely random and I would
say<00:01:42.930> if<00:01:43.259> you're<00:01:43.619> watching<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.040> take

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
say if you're watching this take

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.330 
say if you're watching this take
advantage<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.000> now<00:01:45.180> they<00:01:45.479> might<00:01:45.750> patch<00:01:45.960> it

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
advantage of it now they might patch it

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.590 
advantage of it now they might patch it
since<00:01:47.340> i'm<00:01:47.490> posting<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> video<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.450> never

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.810 
know they might find it and they my
patch<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:52.560> does<00:01:53.189> work<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.490> other

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
patch it it does work for other

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.929
