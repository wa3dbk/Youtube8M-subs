 in the old in the old series we say 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.850
 the one I'm using before and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.200
 however, putting it in a new world does not exist 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.940

 the old house so guys I leave you 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:50.140
 intro beautiful hello the march is stained 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.140
 joker 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.920
 now he says welcome to this new video 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.800
 of the minecraft survival 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.229
 then guys there is only one problem 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.229
 on my second instance of multi mc 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.520
 because I said I open the I know how 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.810
 many mc works 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.290
 there are various rooms where you 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.610
 crush it is like from yours 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.960
 mike nelson date launcher on the menu 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.890
 drop down and choose what you want 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.470
 I chose you survival I went to the 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.320
 my survival on my world and have 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.050
 found the writing minecraft 1.8 march 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.290
 I said ok, I'll have wrong stans but 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.509
 I was sure it was on survival one 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.680
 show from survival two the one closed for 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:47.259
 kraft made on single player and I see missing 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.440
 they observed 1.8 march though he said 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.680
 I used this eagle in creative time 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.050
 to redo the house I open and find myself 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.270
 this unpleasant surprise 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.720
 open open sesame 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.180
 I open and I find the box still to be 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.479
 do because precisely the survival 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.069
 one was created precisely to have 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.709
 a sin of the world 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.270
 the world backs up though there is I have 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.870
 played in the backup in a nutshell 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.580
 this went on doing the house there 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.790
 the problem that arises now which ai 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.840
 guys is that I no longer have a home or not 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.900
 I have nothing more of the things I did up 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.090
 to the episode speech therefore what has 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.580
 decided to do then I opened a 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.700
 server or tum the quiet server 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.440
 lesser known things from the beginning though each time 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.270
 boys unfortunately we will have to start from 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.130
 head 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.980
 I don't start from scratch obviously 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.410
 because this episode we say let's give a 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.560
 settling episode 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.430
 I looked for a nice big nice house 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.349
 on planet minecraft and loaded it up 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.870
 map and what I mean a real schematic 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.450
 a house I only put the house too 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.520
 inside the server I will show you now and 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.739
 you will tell me if it will be ok to keep ok 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.349
 guys here we are then industry 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.920
 let's put a day because I fixed a 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:14.530
 little crap but this is it 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.670
 lavezzi is a real single server 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.069
 what does that mean a real one 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.900
 server that in theory could enter it 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.250
 you too, however, will explain to you later 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.159
 how to enter from here then I have 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.239
 taken a schematic yes I know it is 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.610
 very great though as we are 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.049
 taking a lot of time in the 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.060
 survival 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:39.370
 I think it's not bad and keep a thing 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.439
 so big because in the end it's one 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.200
 just home is not that we will do so much yes 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:46.750
 this is i will use it as a compartment 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.239
 for the baskets that pretty cool it is 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:55.390
 you get nothing done 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:57.069
 there are only some torches and 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.049
 enough because the upstairs again 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.459
 it was not opened looked at a while 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.629
 I think there will also be many mobs 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.579
 in fact, fortunately there are none 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.650
 there is a bit of here that is pretty nice 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.080
 if not, I didn't do it practically 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.090
 nothing here 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.769
 naked and raw we say as raf e would say 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.810
 now guys I'm here to ask you if 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.890
 this could be good for you 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.860
 situation I created for the reason 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.830
 that at least we can bring us a little bit 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:33.270
 later I put them with the vanilla 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:36.920
 on the server because why guys why 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.260
 does the first or less mess with backups 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.440
 having less mess with backups if type 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.500
 for example something happens I can 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.660
 quietly stay on the server for 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.370
 the sky map and that remains that 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.610
 patient and what else can I hope for 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.550
 guys that you may like the idea of 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.040
 keep this map to me personally 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.600
 I really like it so much I just put one 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.690
 home that I could have easily 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:12.570
 in short, we needed a lot to redo 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:14.840
 time, however, before we start we begin 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.030
 really the series 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.730
 I would like your opinion more than anything else 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.430
 write it in the comments and if I succeed 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.669
 guys at 7 i'll get you a video 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.460
 but I'm not sure why I should 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:32.430
 record etc. it takes time and then 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.900
 the worst thing is that today I have to today 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.580
 when I was there for you 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.919
 I have to register a lot of serious ones 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.940
 even new with gaby remember the 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:44.770
 good cats and nothing 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.510
 just a little bit embarrassed because of me 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.370
 sorry very much not being able to continue 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.870
 my series because I was fond of it 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.180
 now we're doing with the kind of 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.970
 thing of the automatic grain and it was 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.670
 really cool I would say guys 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:02.200
 that being in a server we could also 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:05.530
 think of turning this vanilla into 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.510
 an alert bild practically where we create 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.190
 the new our village when 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.140
 some schematics you can pass me 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.670
 quietly you for example one me 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.040
 he makes a map in his hand in a world 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.830
 super flat apple sends me luck 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.700
 from our series obviously does not know one 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.230
 thing 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.210
 which I will always carry in the sense that everyone 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.710
 the episodes are the thing 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.640
 this is I will use it only and uniquely as 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.680
 home I'll use it to sleep to put on 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.360
 just the baskets because for example for 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.390
 the furnaces and part we could use 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.460
 this here for the baskets the furnaces though 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.480
 I thought I was doing something cooler 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.560
 sincerely because I don't feel like 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.480
 to remain everything here also called 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.690

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.690
 I have to be honest, guys 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:58.020
 sorry if a crossroads didn't come out today 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.970
 who knows but I sincerely hope that in 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.910
 comments write me if you like it 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:05.490
