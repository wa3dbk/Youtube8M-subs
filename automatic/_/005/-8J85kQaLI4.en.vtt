00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Good afternoon friends, I'm Maria , 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.140
 previous behind camera and psalm he's going 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.820
 to be the one in charge of showing us 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.429
 wait for the next version of 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.990
 cyanogenmod 10 for our samsung 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.990
 galaxy with him 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.520
 welcome to call them 10 then 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.010
 in our galaxy with the first thing you 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.970
 let's warn and this is a subject 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.550
 important so pay attention 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.640
 and what 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.129
 this is in the development stage and there 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.530
 two or three things that do not work 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.750
 fundamentally we work the relay is 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.730
 tell the radio what it is that makes 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.670
 operate the telephony part of 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.030
 telephony of the device if you 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.839
 they fix says baseband unknown and without 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.120
 would like us to see the state of 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.809
 phone notice that we do not have 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.239
 network time and roaming or email is to say 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.920
 that we do not recommend that you use this 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.710
 rom unless they know what they are 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.630
 doing because for gmail it 's something 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.640
 serious does not work the bluetooth and not 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.530
 some other things that work 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.240
 they may not be as important as 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.920
 they just said recently 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.509
 Regarding the camera, no 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.220
 It works is what I said but good 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.070
 Photo camera not for everyone is so 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.130
 important that what is then what 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.619
 important thing that we want to highlight is that 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:36.439
 this is a rhombus esp for a device 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.630
 that has a proprietary interface 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.539
 pretty heavy if you notice 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.670
 really walks very very fluid and in the 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:48.140
 Insofar as this further development 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.060
 the promising to have a rhombus to usp it 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.930
 what are we going to find then is a 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:58.140
 typical rum to usp android pure past 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.230
 the base code and look android 4.1.2 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.340
 version 11 is not yet available 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.590
 or in development 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.429
 but at least those who like it 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:13.440
 this type of halong will be able to use 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:16.350
 at least for the moment version 10 yes 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.400
 that we find novel the truth is 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.990
 Nothing to notice that we do not have big 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.950
 configurations but we have the 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.370
 own configurations of a round to 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.370
 usp 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.500
 but what is worth rescuing is 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.110
 the fluidity with which it works if 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.910
 you explain really works of 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.420
 very fluid way and the fact that it is 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:48.709
 break that around 150 200 megabytes 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.980
 compared to 600 that company the previous 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.160
 official with touchwiz interface is a 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.040
 notion of how light is this oak and 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.540
 how customizable are these types of 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.700
 rounds about what in the 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.030
 while the owner is so 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.590
 simply in a small sample of the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.629
 state of social development we are not 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.340
 for the samsung galaxy core we hope 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.170
 that you liked as always leave 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.390
 a like if it was like that 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.739
 the questions doubts and the suggestions to 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.349
 through consultation 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.720
