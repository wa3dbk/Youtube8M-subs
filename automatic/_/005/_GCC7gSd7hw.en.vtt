00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
from your scripts leaves or circles or

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.970 
from your scripts leaves or circles or

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
squares whatever you like for a more

formal<00:02:16.550> approach<00:02:16.910> i<00:02:17.180> would<00:02:17.420> suggest<00:02:17.630> using<00:02:18.110> a

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
formal approach i would suggest using a

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.560 
formal approach i would suggest using a
stencil<00:02:18.650> or<00:02:19.070> outline<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.820> then<00:02:20.090> cut<00:02:20.420> out<00:02:20.450> the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
stencil or outline and then cut out the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.440 
stencil or outline and then cut out the
shapes<00:02:21.070> once<00:02:22.070> you've<00:02:22.250> got<00:02:22.489> those<00:02:22.640> ready<00:02:22.970> punch
