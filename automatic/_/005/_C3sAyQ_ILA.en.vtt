00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.110 
back again with another clock this is a

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.970 
back again with another clock this is a
1930<00:00:04.370> sessions<00:00:08.059> never<00:00:09.059> get<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.300> name<00:00:09.420> right

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
1930 sessions never get the name right

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.200 
1930 sessions never get the name right
and<00:00:10.980> say<00:00:11.219> Dulce<00:00:11.790> Anna<00:00:12.049> mantel<00:00:13.049> clock<00:00:14.030> this<00:00:15.030> is

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
and say Dulce Anna mantel clock this is

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.300 
and say Dulce Anna mantel clock this is
one<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.480> later<00:00:15.719> session<00:00:16.260> clocks<00:00:16.619> before

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
one of the later session clocks before

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.779 
one of the later session clocks before
the<00:00:17.609> company<00:00:17.970> sold<00:00:18.600> off<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:20.000> ceased<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.180> exist

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
the company sold off and ceased to exist

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.550 
the company sold off and ceased to exist
this<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> most<00:00:24.359> accurate<00:00:24.689> clock<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.529> of

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
this is the most accurate clock out of

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.820 
this is the most accurate clock out of
the<00:00:25.710> bunch<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.340> got<00:00:26.689> it<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.900> dead<00:00:28.289> accurate

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
the bunch that I got it is dead accurate

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.250 
the bunch that I got it is dead accurate
and<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.580> still<00:00:29.880> has<00:00:30.029> adjustments<00:00:30.750> either<00:00:30.929> way

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
and it still has adjustments either way

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.930 
and it still has adjustments either way
slow<00:00:31.679> or<00:00:31.830> fast<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.550> that's<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.630> good<00:00:33.780> thing<00:00:34.940> it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
slow or fast so that's a good thing it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.150 
slow or fast so that's a good thing it
probably<00:00:36.540> should<00:00:36.780> be<00:00:36.809> serviced<00:00:37.350> relatively

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
probably should be serviced relatively

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.860 
probably should be serviced relatively
soon<00:00:38.460> because<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.969> know<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.360> hasn't<00:00:39.540> been<00:00:39.780> done

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
soon because I know it hasn't been done
