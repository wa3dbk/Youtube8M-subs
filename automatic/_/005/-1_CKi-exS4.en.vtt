00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.439
 Hi everyone, guys, welcome to this 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.270
 first tutorial with the upcoming release at 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.710
 euro cinema while finally decided 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.509
 to do this tutorial you have 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.330
 almost everyone is required 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.140
 on youtube and on facebook or the helmet 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.789
 by iron man 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.130
 it must be said first that to do 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.260
 these types of helmets are two methods the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.700
 first is what we will see today than later 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.780
 a little more complicated but that will give i 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.700
 better results 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.840
 the second is the one using them on the subject 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.640
 sine who were at the decathlon 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.800
 yoga collection that I will make you can see 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.450
 maybe in a future video, let's start 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.170
 right away with the list of materials 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.430
 serve 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.020
 the first one we need in 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.520
 program peers care and designers who do 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.079
 easily recovers on the internet 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.430
 subsequently we need the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.750
 failed of or of helmets we want 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.280
 make these discoveries 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.350
 quietly google search in the name 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.360
 helmet rather than fear or more pd o 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.739
 we need the cardboard that 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.320
 I recommend replacing the card 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.970
 because heavier and more resistant 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.619
 polyester resin with catalyst that 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.009
 you can safely find the self 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.479
 the lobby of glass fiber sheets e 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.770
 also called polyester filler 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.750
 stucco for metals that you also find 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.579
 this quietly to self and finally 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.310
 the metallic colors we want 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.869
 therefore, open our helmet 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.549
 our program that precisely for 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.530
 fear designer who is recoverable 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.049
 especially in the internet and making files 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.060
 open we import helmet project that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.950
 we want to realize in our case is the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.229
 lamarque marcotto button 42 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.819
 directly from euro while opening it 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.340
 get immediately that on the left is 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.259
 present the 3d model of the helmet 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.109
 while on the right there are singles 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.249
 small pieces of compose precisely lemmo 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.310
 among the various options I recommend 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:49.319
 enable are vadese Hodgers texture on 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.640
 off that enables texture disabilities 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.140
 colored by this then it depends 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.479
 but those who have realized by texture will be 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.460
 inserted or not fundamental thing 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.979
 before printing all these are 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.659
 various steps going on two of mail 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.670
 you have to check that it is checked 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.500
 the option show club section claps come 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.750
 you can see apita disabilities of the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.369
 tabs of the various pieces what 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.190
 fundamental if we then want to unite them 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.810
 adequately always went under two of 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.100
 the less I strongly recommend you 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.950
 enable george lady show and ai b 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.050
 add the numbers in the various pieces 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.959
 this is to make you understand more immediately 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.520
 will quickly be joined together in 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.720
 what points to avoid getting stung 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.400
 sma tare 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.870
 at this point go to the setting 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.220
 current emperor setting and going 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.810
 supersize selected card type on 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.820
 where you want to print it 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.950
 I usually always use the card a 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.380
 four then select at 4 let's go 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.840
 okay and as you can see resize 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.820
 the rectangles outlined by this 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.670
 point we just have to center the various 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.930
 pieces so they stay inside 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.870
 this work long and then you have to do 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.530
 once you have centered you can see 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.180
 whether to send it to the press or if there 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.000
 size is not good then go on 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.060
 scherl centers go on sky factor a 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.310
 you can enter your three dimensions 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.530
 precise of mm and change le 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.510
 sky file size 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.150
 going up in crisis rode xscale 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.910
 you can increase it to make it smaller by 10 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.260
 percent once even 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.060
 another central point all the pieces 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.420
 you can send in print then gone 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.680
 on the plater file at the press office a 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.810
 all the various individual pieces 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.400
 at this point we should have all the 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.780
 individual pieces printed on our sheets 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.250
 in cardboard and there remains only that 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.170
 start cutting them out following the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.850
 car guidelines cut out all the 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.680
 we sell the following nile numbers 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.630
 specifically the advice to use the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.920
 super attak as it dries a lot more 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.500
 cold and is much cleaner than 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.120
 normal with stick 18 of all 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.800
 small pieces of paper to have more or 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.420
 less a thing like this however it is 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.530
 already been said thus born a passage 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.700
 what to see corn 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.110
 we can therefore begin the phase of 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.910
 daisy nature and I recommend boys 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.070
 whenever you treat stuck resins 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.780
 chemical materials used in well environments 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.270
 ventilated with a mask and gloves 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.950
 in latex and we start by passing a first 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.890
 layer outside the helmet we leave them 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.090
 dry for 24 hours 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.650
 at this point we take out of 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.640
 fiberglass and the Italian of many 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.800
 small pieces 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.570
 then we see the hand of injured internally 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.250
 in helmet and with the reggina still wet 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.959
 we support the pieces of fibers that 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.299
 we will cover again with a layer of 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.680
 resin pass 24 hours at this point the 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.200
 helmet will be hard and we can start 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.640
 that phase of blur as far as 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.410
 the stucco regards the council always 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.970
 to catalyze then once because there 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.740
 puts very little to dry or not 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.510
 I wish you threw it ste helping us with 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.070
 we support an asphalt under the helmet 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.540
 in the phase you are seeing I am 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.220
 spending under the magneto helmet 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.350
 because they have time problems 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.110
 could finish lamarque 42 however the 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.730
 one process remains almost identical 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.530
 Once it has dried and if you have catalyzed it 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.340
 well it will take more or less an hour an hour 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.480
 and a half 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.370
 you can start with the phase of 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.020
 then bend it with chin 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.490
 of the glass partenone card to give a 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.990
 coarser grain up to the 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.520
 finer grain started shooting 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.169
 helmet thread up to make yours 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.980
 possible judge's wife 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.360
 once this phase is over 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.590
 good that paint them that our colors 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.060
 acrylics and this is the finished helmet for 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.030
 reasons of time I could not finish 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.440
 unfortunately that of the last film then 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.860
 go on to do in these were 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.940
 almost identical here I added the 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.200
 eye lights 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.090
 I of electronics state that not 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.480
 therefore I understand nothing or simply 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.510
 united of age a switch and one 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:27.180
 battery but I don't know if yes when I know if yes 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.160
 see there is a lever that moving the 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.900
 turning it off do not turn on yes 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.640
 they shut their eyes and I did not 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.950
 motorized opening for simple 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.540
 fact that it is very very complicated 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.010
 we need to add some Serbian engines 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.560
 you need to create a circuit with arduino 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.670
 etcetera etc. etc. 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.590
 with the same method you have seen 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.390
 you can do all kinds of helmets enough 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.250
 find the pd file or relative to the 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.730
 peep to care and then you can do what 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.190
 want 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.290
 this is the dovahkiin's helmet of 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.070
 skyrim is that I built exactly 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.660
 alike 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.580
 let me know if you enjoyed the video 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.200
 with a comment below let me down 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.730
 I like it and for everyone who does 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.360
 will subscribe to the channel will share the 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.800
 video on facebook as a gift a helmet dr 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.480
 no it is not true it would be impossible to do 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.810
 the casting for everyone just the do it 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.530
 same 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.530
 Hello 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.040
 to someone it is bad
