00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.070
 this is your manifestation of istanbul 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.470
 the olive tree because nn perfectly aligned on the subject of nature a lot 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.549
 beautiful 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.139
 from the point of view of recovery at startup after this is me 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.859
 according to this exhibition the world is my culture of movement and then this 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.150
 speech of the vicar president I know how to waste time 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.179
 regarding the era of the valley 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.989
 everything is born the valley is very beautiful and very impressed 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.019
 I tell you yes 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.630
 I know very well in other places 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.630
 I think a live sport 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.960
 even in my opinion they won't have to make dust 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.180
 receiver 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.590
 noble discount of 8% summit of all the rest of the valley of time + converse 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.949
 to the nth degree 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.970
 it's very dry 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.220
 we say that the beauty it has does not coincide with the u 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.670
 that many would dislike videos 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.150
 makes you think about 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.870
 precisely the dissolution therefore an anti-aesthetic concept railings 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.840
 this admirable rock like a madman to dissect because it is said that 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.840
 should collapse thought that I thought but tonight 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.930
 therefore as a Neapolitan symphonic concert recipe of the little mountain 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.740
 enhanced 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.230
 should be valued free 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.230
 and in my opinion it has not been valued 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.860
 I'm doing now 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.610
 birth what the law on dry cedular is 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.810
 Lavagnese 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.070
 I'm doing 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.020
 it is called the great illusion 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.810
 when it came out in london online 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.510
 where were made of 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.510
 story association 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 of the territory 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.230
 what it makes 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.300
 simple territory 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300
 on this so 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.620
 I like you antonacci 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.020
 certainly not because the cervino on this side 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.770
 list of people
