00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
onto the mixing paddle and the way will

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.850 
onto the mixing paddle and the way will
separate<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.939> start<00:02:06.810> spraying<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.680> you've

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
separate and start spraying so you've

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.140 
separate and start spraying so you've
got<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.340> be

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.150 
got to be
