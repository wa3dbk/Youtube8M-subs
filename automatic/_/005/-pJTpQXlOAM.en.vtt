00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.380
 the road tourism arrived at Comodoro 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.360
 rivadavia after a long parenthesis 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.389
 the category arrived in southern Argentina 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.480
 with a qualifying test that will have 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.250
 one of the many shows of the end 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.300
 of the week the overturning of the chevrolet of 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.770
 Javier Balza not how many laps he gave 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.230
 awesome is mounted on the piano and 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.130
 the car starts spinning like a spin 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.260
 we will see it in a stopped image 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.320
 we have the first round see how 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.839
 the car is disintegrating and without 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.859
 However, as it resists the cage five 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:38.829
 turns 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:42.719
 6 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:47.289
 7 and we reached the last round and a half 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.120
 so that it is finally overturned 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.449
 auto de javier balza no and now in this 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.489
 detail we will begin to observe parts 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.100
 of the auto parts of the pilot the arm 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.439
 of the pilot that is loose in this 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.899
 enlarged image can be observed there 

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:06.449
 is how disintegrate and the 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.449
 wheels is practically 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.870
 in jest is much in oil for the tc 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.500
 track and good me when I opened the lap 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.500
 the car crosses me and today from side to 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.760
 the tip of the piano that was a bit 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.910
 well well then the author gets hooked 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.140
 with the car socket on the tip of the 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.690
 piano and there it gets stuck starts to give 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.980
 turns that I thought at first 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.990
 I was going to break the floor of the car and nothing else 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.270
 but hey then I realized that the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.950
 another had stuck and well we started 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.230
 to release has a few turns a 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.330
 little bad and given at the beginning now and 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.630
 recovering all the blows I have a 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.130
 roscÃ³n here in the hand and another here in the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.310
 knee but we do not have or be 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.050
 physically I'm perfect the car already what 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.540
 check but I speak up to 300 dad said 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.740
 that are new car 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.170
 structurally the car is the truth 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.810
 that in that I take off my hat with 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.000
 little green dots because it was endured 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.049
 spectacular all the hits 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.970
 apparently and the car structure does not 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.340
 He has nothing but good after all 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.080
 acro matchstick peripherals and whatnot 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.510
 you have to change it because it is not justified 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.160
 nor prepare anything because we are going to take 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.420
 much more so 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.510
 We are in the middle of decisions of 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.860
 how to face all this and good all 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.880
 world told me because it is very 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.880
 spectacular the truth 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.380
 the truth that sheen and a lot of 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.230
 return 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.060
 it's amazing how the author grabbed so much 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.700
 inertia so much speed to dump 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.080
 and good luckily the truth that both 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.860
 the comedian died as well so 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.860
 that the most important thing
