00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.770 
and leads to be attractive bet here
until<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.890> remember<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.939> USA<00:01:24.360> really

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
until you remember that the USA really

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.480 
until you remember that the USA really
want<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.080> win<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.259> group<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.830> improves<00:01:26.250> their

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
want to win this group it improves their

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.520 
want to win this group it improves their
savings<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.330> actual<00:01:27.689> world<00:01:27.840> cup<00:01:28.080> finals

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
savings for the actual world cup finals

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.960 
savings for the actual world cup finals
they<00:01:28.890> don't<00:01:29.100> want<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.280> end<00:01:29.400> up<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.670> boss

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
they don't want to end up in that boss

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.210 
they don't want to end up in that boss
and<00:01:30.150> positive<00:01:30.450> fourth<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.930> group<00:01:31.140> stages<00:01:31.439> so

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
and positive fourth of a group stages so

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.640 
and positive fourth of a group stages so
I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> USA<00:01:33.930> win<00:01:34.200> but

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
I think it is going to be a USA win but
