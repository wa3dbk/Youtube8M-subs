00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:09.240
 sometimes knitted detail ends 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.940
 gum one for one for example when 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.969
 cross knitting start knitting with 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.470
 gum on one sleeve and finish 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.439
 elastic on the second sleeve 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.230
 to the edges of the gum was neat 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.510
 elastic and did not differ from the initial 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.400
 rows on the other sleeve can be closed 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.910
 loops of the last row of gum 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.239
 special knit stitch thread 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.180
 leave about triple length 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.100
 if this sleeve edge if it's a shelf 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.230
 or back of course there will have to thread 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.079
 additionally apply 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.809
 but I'll take the contrast thread now 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.780
 colors so that you can clearly see how 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.199
 performed this suture auxiliary 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.160
 thread finish knitting slightly from 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.379
 fucking they do not press iron because 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.469
 this gum it should remain 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.780
 elastic only steaming for 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.650
 so that the extreme loops we do not have 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.040
 escaped in the process of work we fly 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.040
 auxiliary thread 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.290
 end of thread threaded into needle 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:32.780
 but I will take now in a contrasting color 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:32.780
 thread we fix the extreme loops and 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:45.560
 starting to close open hinges 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:50.220
 last row extreme loop 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.260
 pierce the corner outside and inside 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.180
 cling to the second loop 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.180
 the needle goes out again 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.000
 go to the wrong side of us 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.510
 now we cling to the loop which is already 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.130
 a needle stuck in it by thread 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.650
 enters from the outside 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.080
 on the inside we catch the next 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.080
 eyelet and out and eyes goes 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.900
 go to the front side exactly 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:34.890
 the loop is already stuck thread 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:38.570
 we catch 1 and 2 free loop too 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.570
 we catch on the needle 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.400
 turn the wrong side again to 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:51.030
 and we repeat the needle in the same way 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:57.769
 enters the seized loop and clings 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:01.769
 free from the front the same 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:05.130
 repeat again the two loops on our needle 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.910
 needle entered from the outside and exits 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.910
 out again 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:21.710
 so on one loop we continue 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:26.380
 fasten alternately with the front from 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.380
 us sides ace the back 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.980
 the thread we lay down zigzag repeating 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:04:00.510
 the zigzag of the initial series is fulfilled and 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:04:04.670
 the car is not too slow to 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.670
 the edge remained elastic 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:46.520
 and catch the last loop and 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:53.520
 we fasten it with a double stitch 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:58.430
 previous loop on the other hand here 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:01.950
 so we have a wonderful edge 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:07.130
 exactly the same as started on 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:10.130
 car elastic enough and 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.130
 neat
