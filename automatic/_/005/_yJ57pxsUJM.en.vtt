00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.600 
be run when they guess the right thing
basically<00:01:37.740> what<00:01:38.070> they're<00:01:38.220> doing<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.579> they're

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
basically what they're doing is they're

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.760 
basically what they're doing is they're
entering<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> computer<00:01:39.600> they're<00:01:40.170> typing<00:01:40.439> in

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
entering the computer they're typing in

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.190 
entering the computer they're typing in
after<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.579> prints<00:01:42.090> enter<00:01:42.329> password<00:01:42.570> they're

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
after it prints enter password they're

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.929 
after it prints enter password they're
typing<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.649> program<00:01:44.070> name<00:01:44.310> which<00:01:44.820> will

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
typing in the program name which will

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.639 
typing in the program name which will
then<00:01:45.060> run<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.479> program<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:46.200> saying<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
then run this program just saying that

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.280 
then run this program just saying that
the<00:01:46.740> password<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.250> correct<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.049> it<00:01:49.049> will<00:01:49.140> run

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the password is correct and it will run

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.620 
the password is correct and it will run
that<00:01:49.500> then<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.420> redstone<00:01:51.420> dot<00:01:51.960> set<00:01:52.619> output

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
that then you do redstone dot set output

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:01.140 
that then you do redstone dot set output
hope<00:01:54.630> capitulo<00:01:55.380> out<00:01:56.240> dang<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.270> out<00:01:58.140> put

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.950 

hmm<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.330> mean<00:02:02.720> or<00:02:03.140> hospital<00:02:03.500> output<00:02:03.830> output

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
hmm I mean or hospital output output

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.870 
hmm I mean or hospital output output
okay<00:02:05.960> you're<00:02:06.620> going<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:06.800> do<00:02:06.860> brackets<00:02:07.370> then

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
okay you're going to do brackets then

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.460 
okay you're going to do brackets then
right<00:02:08.240> or<00:02:08.539> left<00:02:08.780> depending<00:02:08.929> on<00:02:09.319> which

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
right or left depending on which

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.740 
right or left depending on which
direction<00:02:09.500> your<00:02:09.979> door<00:02:10.190> is<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.970> comma<00:02:11.180> true

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
direction your door is and comma true

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.330 
direction your door is and comma true
and<00:02:12.020> this<00:02:12.230> will<00:02:12.410> turn<00:02:12.560> on<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.950> redstone

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
and this will turn on the redstone

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.010 
and this will turn on the redstone
current<00:02:13.670> there<00:02:13.819> you<00:02:14.360> want<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.569> do<00:02:14.750> sleep<00:02:15.880> three

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
current there you want to do sleep three

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.330 
current there you want to do sleep three
that<00:02:18.020> make<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.290> computer<00:02:18.590> sleep<00:02:18.950> for<00:02:19.190> three

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
that make the computer sleep for three

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.370 
that make the computer sleep for three
seconds<00:02:19.930> you're<00:02:20.930> going<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.140> do<00:02:21.260> redstone<00:02:23.380> dot

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
seconds you're going to do redstone dot

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.640 
seconds you're going to do redstone dot
set<00:02:24.950> output<00:02:26.920> right<00:02:28.900> false<00:02:29.900> which<00:02:30.380> will<00:02:30.530> turn

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
set output right false which will turn

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.320 
set output right false which will turn
off<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.010> redstone<00:02:31.400> current<00:02:31.940> going<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.239> the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
off the redstone current going to the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.130 
off the redstone current going to the
door<00:02:32.570> they're<00:02:33.170> going<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.470> do<00:02:33.620> Oh<00:02:33.860> s<00:02:34.400> dot<00:02:35.209> reboot
