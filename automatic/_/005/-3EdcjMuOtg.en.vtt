this<00:00:04.960> is<00:00:05.109> my<00:00:05.259> version<00:00:05.770> of<00:00:06.069> a<00:00:06.220> Lord<00:00:06.670> Kelvin

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:07.359 
this is my version of a Lord Kelvin

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:09.390 
this is my version of a Lord Kelvin
generator<00:00:07.840> which<00:00:08.410> is<00:00:08.590> a<00:00:08.620> really<00:00:08.860> cool<00:00:08.920> device

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
generator which is a really cool device

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.090 
generator which is a really cool device
that<00:00:09.570> generates<00:00:10.570> electricity<00:00:11.440> just<00:00:11.860> from

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100 
that generates electricity just from

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.940 
that generates electricity just from
dripping<00:00:12.460> water<00:00:12.640> and<00:00:13.440> what<00:00:14.440> I'd<00:00:14.530> like<00:00:14.620> to<00:00:14.680> tell

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
dripping water and what I'd like to tell

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.769 
dripping water and what I'd like to tell
you<00:00:15.040> about<00:00:15.070> is<00:00:15.370> some<00:00:15.550> of<00:00:15.580> the<00:00:15.820> tips<00:00:16.150> that<00:00:16.299> I

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:16.779 
you about is some of the tips that I

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.230 
you about is some of the tips that I
figured<00:00:17.140> out<00:00:17.260> in<00:00:17.529> making<00:00:18.340> mine<00:00:18.519> work<00:00:18.789> you<00:00:19.119> can

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
figured out in making mine work you can

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.640 
figured out in making mine work you can
go<00:00:19.330> on<00:00:19.449> the<00:00:19.570> web<00:00:19.689> and<00:00:19.720> find<00:00:20.109> out<00:00:20.259> lots<00:00:20.470> about

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
go on the web and find out lots about

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.189 
go on the web and find out lots about
the<00:00:20.829> physics<00:00:21.159> and<00:00:21.429> some<00:00:22.029> design<00:00:22.480> features<00:00:23.019> of

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
the physics and some design features of

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.019 
the physics and some design features of
them<00:00:23.380> but<00:00:23.919> when<00:00:24.070> I<00:00:24.099> first<00:00:24.339> made<00:00:24.579> mine<00:00:24.849> it

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
them but when I first made mine it

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.429 
them but when I first made mine it
wasn't<00:00:25.329> working<00:00:25.599> and<00:00:25.810> I<00:00:25.839> had<00:00:25.989> to<00:00:26.079> change<00:00:26.289> it

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
wasn't working and I had to change it

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.649 
wasn't working and I had to change it
some<00:00:26.650> and<00:00:26.829> now<00:00:27.220> it's<00:00:27.400> working<00:00:27.550> so<00:00:27.909> I<00:00:27.939> thought

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:28.659 
some and now it's working so I thought

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:30.630 
some and now it's working so I thought
you<00:00:28.749> might<00:00:28.900> find<00:00:29.050> that<00:00:29.199> useful<00:00:29.380> so<00:00:30.069> one<00:00:30.519> of<00:00:30.550> the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
you might find that useful so one of the

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.040 
you might find that useful so one of the
things<00:00:30.789> I<00:00:30.880> think<00:00:30.939> is<00:00:31.089> really<00:00:31.149> important<00:00:31.779> is<00:00:32.020> to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
things I think is really important is to

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.069 
things I think is really important is to
have<00:00:32.259> the<00:00:32.950> right<00:00:33.190> kind<00:00:33.460> of<00:00:33.700> water<00:00:34.000> flow<00:00:34.420> so

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
have the right kind of water flow so

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.209 
have the right kind of water flow so
here's<00:00:35.769> an<00:00:35.949> adjustable<00:00:36.640> tap<00:00:36.910> on<00:00:37.780> my<00:00:38.109> 2<00:00:38.469> gallon

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
here's an adjustable tap on my 2 gallon

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.910 
here's an adjustable tap on my 2 gallon
water<00:00:39.969> bucket<00:00:40.359> and<00:00:40.780> it<00:00:40.899> goes<00:00:41.079> to<00:00:41.410> a<00:00:41.440> tea

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
water bucket and it goes to a tea

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.849 
water bucket and it goes to a tea
coupler<00:00:42.370> and<00:00:42.550> then<00:00:43.090> this<00:00:43.539> is<00:00:43.750> a<00:00:43.929> five

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
coupler and then this is a five

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:46.770 
coupler and then this is a five
millimeter<00:00:45.160> inside<00:00:45.940> diameter<00:00:46.239> plastic

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
millimeter inside diameter plastic

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.209 
millimeter inside diameter plastic
tubing<00:00:47.440> that<00:00:47.980> goes<00:00:48.519> to<00:00:49.359> little<00:00:49.750> nozzles<00:00:50.620> that

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
tubing that goes to little nozzles that

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.910 
tubing that goes to little nozzles that
adjust<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.940> water<00:00:52.120> flow<00:00:52.539> so<00:00:53.469> these<00:00:53.649> nozzles

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
adjust the water flow so these nozzles

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.220 
adjust the water flow so these nozzles
are<00:00:54.339> just<00:00:54.609> a<00:00:55.199> quarter<00:00:56.199> inch<00:00:56.379> copper<00:00:57.190> tubing

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
are just a quarter inch copper tubing

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.319 
are just a quarter inch copper tubing
but<00:00:59.230> I<00:00:59.289> soldered<00:00:59.980> on<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.429> end<00:01:00.640> of<00:01:00.969> the<00:01:01.120> nozzle

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
but I soldered on the end of the nozzle

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.490 
but I soldered on the end of the nozzle
a<00:01:02.159> little<00:01:03.159> cap<00:01:03.489> and<00:01:03.940> then<00:01:04.239> drilled<00:01:04.720> into<00:01:05.110> the

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
a little cap and then drilled into the

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.090 
a little cap and then drilled into the
cap<00:01:05.770> of<00:01:06.190> 1.5<00:01:07.000> millimeter<00:01:07.690> hole<00:01:07.960> so<00:01:08.650> that<00:01:08.680> way

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
cap of 1.5 millimeter hole so that way

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.940 
cap of 1.5 millimeter hole so that way
it<00:01:09.490> forms<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:09.970> nice<00:01:10.240> fine<00:01:10.840> stream<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.680> water

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
it forms a nice fine stream of water

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.260 
it forms a nice fine stream of water
that<00:01:12.640> goes<00:01:12.820> down<00:01:13.150> through<00:01:13.480> the<00:01:14.260> metal<00:01:14.530> tube

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
that goes down through the metal tube

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.940 
that goes down through the metal tube
and<00:01:16.270> somewhere<00:01:16.750> down<00:01:16.930> inside<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.500> metal<00:01:17.740> tube

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
and somewhere down inside the metal tube

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.730 
and somewhere down inside the metal tube
it<00:01:18.490> goes<00:01:18.730> from<00:01:18.940> a<00:01:19.090> continuous<00:01:19.630> stream<00:01:20.020> into

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
it goes from a continuous stream into

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.850 
it goes from a continuous stream into
individual<00:01:21.400> drips<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.840> right<00:01:23.470> now<00:01:23.620> you<00:01:23.680> can

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
individual drips and right now you can

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.040 
individual drips and right now you can
see<00:01:24.220> it's<00:01:24.430> developed<00:01:24.910> a<00:01:24.970> lot<00:01:25.150> of<00:01:25.180> charge<00:01:25.660> and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
see it's developed a lot of charge and

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.980 
see it's developed a lot of charge and
that<00:01:26.770> gives<00:01:27.070> you<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.790> situation<00:01:28.360> where<00:01:28.960> a

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
that gives you a situation where a

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.710 
that gives you a situation where a
little<00:01:29.260> water<00:01:29.620> droplets<00:01:30.250> are<00:01:30.430> just<00:01:30.720> flying

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
little water droplets are just flying

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.720 
little water droplets are just flying
off<00:01:32.080> in<00:01:32.350> different<00:01:32.500> directions<00:01:32.710> it's<00:01:33.550> no

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
off in different directions it's no

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.300 
off in different directions it's no
longer<00:01:34.090> making<00:01:34.300> a<00:01:34.510> continuous<00:01:35.140> stream<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:35.830> if

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
longer making a continuous stream and if

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.650 
longer making a continuous stream and if
that's<00:01:36.520> happening<00:01:37.000> then<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.240> know<00:01:37.480> you're

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
that's happening then you know you're

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.870 
that's happening then you know you're
getting<00:01:37.930> you<00:01:38.140> know<00:01:38.500> good<00:01:38.830> charge<00:01:39.190> out<00:01:39.520> of<00:01:39.550> this

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
getting you know good charge out of this

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.040 
getting you know good charge out of this
this<00:01:40.720> is<00:01:40.960> without<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:42.060> port<00:01:43.060> get<00:01:43.270> connected<00:01:43.660> and

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
this is without a port get connected and

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.780 
this is without a port get connected and
we'll<00:01:44.530> just<00:01:44.710> go<00:01:44.830> ahead<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.220> connect<00:01:45.610> the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
we'll just go ahead and connect the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.880 
we'll just go ahead and connect the
spark<00:01:46.180> gap<00:01:46.390> here<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:46.870> show<00:01:47.440> you<00:01:47.500> that<00:01:47.710> it's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
spark gap here and show you that it's

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.500 
spark gap here and show you that it's
actually<00:01:48.420> making<00:01:49.420> its<00:01:49.780> spark<00:01:50.140> connection<00:01:51.510> so

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
actually making its spark connection so

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.720 
actually making its spark connection so
for<00:01:53.260> spark<00:01:53.590> gap<00:01:53.800> you<00:01:53.980> can<00:01:54.040> really<00:01:54.370> just<00:01:54.550> use

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
for spark gap you can really just use

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.850 
for spark gap you can really just use
bare<00:01:55.000> wires<00:01:55.300> but<00:01:55.960> I<00:01:55.990> made<00:01:56.230> this<00:01:56.410> one<00:01:56.470> with

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
bare wires but I made this one with

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.090 
bare wires but I made this one with
single<00:01:57.250> copper<00:01:57.550> balls<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:59.590> just<00:01:59.860> kind<00:02:00.040> of

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
single copper balls that is just kind of

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.720 
single copper balls that is just kind of
pretty<00:02:00.370> and<00:02:01.530> changes<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.710> shape<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:03.340> your

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
pretty and changes the shape of your

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.039 
pretty and changes the shape of your
hand<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.240> little<00:02:04.270> bit

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
hand a little bit

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.440 
hand a little bit
and<00:02:06.970> get<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.000> nice<00:02:08.209> leg<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.599> Picasa<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.819> spark

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
and get a nice leg a Picasa so the spark

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.620 
and get a nice leg a Picasa so the spark
um<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:12.560> can<00:02:12.830> kind<00:02:13.550> of<00:02:13.610> calculate<00:02:13.819> what<00:02:14.480> the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
um you can kind of calculate what the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.449 
um you can kind of calculate what the
voltage<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:15.290> according<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.069> distance

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
voltage is according to the distance

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.309 
voltage is according to the distance
between<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.510> two<00:02:17.720> ends<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:19.580> wire<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:21.230> I

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
between the two ends of the wire and I

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.540 
between the two ends of the wire and I
can<00:02:21.470> get<00:02:21.590> this<00:02:21.680> one<00:02:21.860> up<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.099> about<00:02:22.280> four

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
can get this one up to about four

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.430 
can get this one up to about four
millimeters<00:02:23.090> which<00:02:23.330> is<00:02:23.360> something<00:02:24.200> in<00:02:24.349> the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
millimeters which is something in the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.360 
millimeters which is something in the
neighborhood<00:02:24.590> of<00:02:24.920> ten<00:02:25.310> thousand<00:02:25.819> volts<00:02:26.209> so

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
neighborhood of ten thousand volts so

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.440 
neighborhood of ten thousand volts so
another<00:02:28.370> feature<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:28.970> think<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:29.269> really

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
another feature that I think is really

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.710 
another feature that I think is really
important<00:02:30.019> is<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:31.010> make<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.370> all<00:02:31.519> make<00:02:32.390> all<00:02:32.690> of

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
important is to make it all make all of

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.140 
important is to make it all make all of
your<00:02:32.989> scaffolding<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:33.830> forth<00:02:34.130> out<00:02:34.519> of<00:02:34.849> a

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
your scaffolding and so forth out of a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.140 
your scaffolding and so forth out of a
good<00:02:35.599> insulator<00:02:36.080> this<00:02:36.980> one's<00:02:37.190> made<00:02:37.430> from<00:02:37.819> PVC

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
good insulator this one's made from PVC

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.910 
good insulator this one's made from PVC
pipe<00:02:38.660> which<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.260> convenient<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.040> cheap<00:02:40.690> but

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
pipe which is convenient and cheap but

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.380 
pipe which is convenient and cheap but
previously<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:43.010> had<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.400> buckets<00:02:43.790> sitting

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
previously I had the buckets sitting

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.660 
previously I had the buckets sitting
directly<00:02:44.690> on<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.230> living<00:02:45.590> base<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.190> it

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
directly on the living base and it

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.120 
directly on the living base and it
didn't<00:02:46.940> work<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.319> raised<00:02:48.739> them<00:02:48.950> up<00:02:49.100> a

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
didn't work and so I raised them up a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.740 
didn't work and so I raised them up a
little<00:02:49.280> bit<00:02:49.580> but<00:02:49.970> particularly<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:50.540> raised

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
little bit but particularly I raised

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.080 
little bit but particularly I raised
enough<00:02:51.049> with<00:02:51.230> plastic<00:02:51.799> boxes<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.880> think

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
enough with plastic boxes and I think

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.410 
enough with plastic boxes and I think
that<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.440> provided<00:02:54.440> some<00:02:54.470> insulation<00:02:55.420> and

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
that that provided some insulation and

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.660 
that that provided some insulation and
it<00:02:57.110> may<00:02:57.290> have<00:02:57.380> been<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.860> buckets<00:02:58.430> were

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
it may have been that the buckets were

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.090 
it may have been that the buckets were
were<00:02:59.120> actually<00:02:59.510> conducting<00:03:00.230> some<00:03:00.590> amount<00:03:00.950> of

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
were actually conducting some amount of

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.759 
were actually conducting some amount of
electricity<00:03:01.610> through<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.660> wooden<00:03:02.959> base<00:03:03.170> so

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
electricity through the wooden base so

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.150 
electricity through the wooden base so
wouldn't<00:03:04.190> we<00:03:04.880> would<00:03:05.299> not<00:03:06.290> as<00:03:06.410> good<00:03:06.590> insulators

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
wouldn't we would not as good insulators

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.339 
wouldn't we would not as good insulators
which<00:03:07.459> is<00:03:07.640> expect<00:03:08.180> suspect<00:03:08.690> so<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.230> think

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
which is expect suspect so I think

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.400 
which is expect suspect so I think
adding<00:03:09.830> plastic<00:03:10.790> underneath<00:03:11.720> your<00:03:11.959> boxes

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
adding plastic underneath your boxes

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.400 
adding plastic underneath your boxes
underneath<00:03:13.160> your<00:03:13.540> your<00:03:14.540> your<00:03:14.900> buckets<00:03:15.260> will

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
underneath your your your buckets will

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.910 
underneath your your your buckets will
work<00:03:15.590> better<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:17.420> water<00:03:18.019> what<00:03:18.500> kind<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.739> water

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
work better so water what kind of water

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.130 
work better so water what kind of water
so<00:03:19.250> this<00:03:19.400> is<00:03:19.519> just<00:03:19.730> city<00:03:19.940> tap<00:03:20.239> water<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:20.840> it

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
so this is just city tap water and it

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.770 
so this is just city tap water and it
works<00:03:21.380> fine<00:03:21.739> so<00:03:22.370> there's<00:03:22.640> some<00:03:22.820> websites<00:03:23.480> that

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
works fine so there's some websites that

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.340 
works fine so there's some websites that
say<00:03:24.019> you<00:03:24.850> get<00:03:25.850> rain<00:03:26.180> water<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.690> stort<00:03:27.230> and

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
say you get rain water and stort and

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.110 
say you get rain water and stort and
dark<00:03:27.530> conditions<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:28.489> all<00:03:28.579> this<00:03:28.700> kind<00:03:29.090> of

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
dark conditions and all this kind of

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.880 
dark conditions and all this kind of
stuff<00:03:29.180> well<00:03:29.510> that's<00:03:29.660> just<00:03:29.870> ridiculous

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
stuff well that's just ridiculous

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.520 
stuff well that's just ridiculous
just<00:03:31.280> City<00:03:31.489> tap<00:03:31.730> water<00:03:31.760> is<00:03:32.150> fine<00:03:32.410> when<00:03:33.410> you're

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
just City tap water is fine when you're

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.590 
just City tap water is fine when you're
testing<00:03:33.769> it<00:03:34.130> you<00:03:34.549> know<00:03:34.640> it's<00:03:34.819> a<00:03:34.970> test<00:03:35.269> it<00:03:35.480> with

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
testing it you know it's a test it with

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.050 
testing it you know it's a test it with
the<00:03:35.810> spark<00:03:36.410> gap<00:03:36.620> disconnected<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.609> wait

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
the spark gap disconnected and wait

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.759 
the spark gap disconnected and wait
until<00:03:38.329> you<00:03:38.420> get<00:03:38.600> those<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:39.079> know<00:03:39.350> flying

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
until you get those you know flying

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.590 
until you get those you know flying
little<00:03:40.130> droplets<00:03:40.549> of<00:03:40.670> water<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:41.239> you<00:03:41.359> know

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
little droplets of water and you know

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.740 
little droplets of water and you know
it's<00:03:41.780> it's<00:03:42.109> working<00:03:42.350> well<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:43.400> that's<00:03:44.000> my<00:03:44.269> Lord

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
it's it's working well so that's my Lord

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.309 
it's it's working well so that's my Lord
Kelvin<00:03:45.200> generator<00:03:45.590> so<00:03:46.900> hope<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.049> can<00:03:48.200> get
