00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.170 

all<00:00:00.659> right<00:00:00.930> so<00:00:01.800> now<00:00:02.190> I'm<00:00:03.120> pretty<00:00:03.899> much<00:00:04.140> done<00:00:05.180> or

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
all right so now I'm pretty much done or

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.250 
all right so now I'm pretty much done or
as<00:00:06.600> good<00:00:06.930> as<00:00:07.049> done<00:00:07.200> with<00:00:07.259> Atomics<00:00:08.929> so<00:00:09.929> perhaps

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
as good as done with Atomics so perhaps

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.900 
as good as done with Atomics so perhaps
I<00:00:10.530> could<00:00:10.740> give<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.130> Tom's<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.490> bit<00:00:11.639> more<00:00:11.820> of

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
I could give the Tom's a bit more of

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.350 
I could give the Tom's a bit more of
parallel<00:00:12.509> compression<00:00:12.840> but<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:14.210> kind<00:00:15.210> of

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
parallel compression but I kind of

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.849 
parallel compression but I kind of
satisfied<00:00:15.900> with<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.170> way<00:00:16.289> they<00:00:16.440> are<00:00:16.650> right

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
satisfied with the way they are right

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:17.240 
satisfied with the way they are right
now

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
now

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.150 
now
so<00:00:18.060> let's<00:00:18.390> top<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:18.869> all<00:00:19.289> off<00:00:19.670> with<00:00:20.930> compression

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
so let's top it all off with compression

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.220 
so let's top it all off with compression
again<00:00:25.189> so<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.460> want<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.330> use<00:00:27.480> compression<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.109> my

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
again so I want to use compression on my

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.540 
again so I want to use compression on my
whole<00:00:28.439> drum<00:00:28.830> buss<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:30.859> we<00:00:31.859> could<00:00:32.099> use<00:00:32.340> some

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
whole drum buss and we could use some

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.350 
whole drum buss and we could use some
parallel<00:00:33.030> compression<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.649> use<00:00:34.860> some

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
parallel compression and we can use some

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.170 
parallel compression and we can use some
direct<00:00:36.360> compression<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:38.040> let's<00:00:38.399> see<00:00:38.760> what<00:00:38.969> we

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
direct compression so let's see what we

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:49.520 
direct compression so let's see what we
can<00:00:39.450> do<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:44.840> know<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:46.200> I'm<00:00:46.289> gonna<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:48.530> first

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
can do I know what I'm gonna do so first

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.040 
can do I know what I'm gonna do so first
let<00:00:50.430> me<00:00:50.460> take<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.199> supercharger<00:00:52.199> again<00:00:54.050> first

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
let me take the supercharger again first

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.650 
let me take the supercharger again first
thing<00:00:55.199> I'm<00:00:55.500> gonna<00:00:55.649> do<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.039> little<00:00:56.340> bit<00:00:56.460> of

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
thing I'm gonna do is a little bit of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.790 
thing I'm gonna do is a little bit of
parallel<00:00:57.660> compression<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.680> again

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
parallel compression with this one again

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.250 
parallel compression with this one again
oh<00:00:59.129> they're<00:00:59.940> gonna<00:01:00.180> do<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.600> differently<00:01:01.050> than

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
oh they're gonna do it differently than

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.020 
oh they're gonna do it differently than
before<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.260> will<00:01:04.530> not<00:01:04.680> use<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> punch<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.760> will

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
before so I will not use a punch I will

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.940 
before so I will not use a punch I will
just<00:01:06.330> turn<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.960> third<00:01:09.500> it's<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
just turn on the third it's just the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.590 
just turn on the third it's just the
volume<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.580> doesn't<00:01:11.850> sound<00:01:12.000> too<00:01:12.210> squashed

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
volume so it doesn't sound too squashed

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:23.539 
volume so it doesn't sound too squashed
and<00:01:12.900> distorted<00:01:20.659> okay<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.020> now<00:01:22.259> I'm<00:01:22.590> gonna<00:01:22.799> put

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
and distorted okay and now I'm gonna put

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.570 
and distorted okay and now I'm gonna put
the<00:01:23.729> wet<00:01:23.909> dry<00:01:24.060> mix<00:01:24.450> around<00:01:25.549> 30<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.820> 70

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.130 

I<00:01:34.200> totally<00:01:35.200> love<00:01:35.440> this<00:01:35.650> setting<00:01:36.100> on<00:01:36.220> drums<00:01:36.490> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
I totally love this setting on drums and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.130 
I totally love this setting on drums and
on<00:01:38.140> mastering<00:01:39.450> because<00:01:40.450> it<00:01:40.600> gives<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:40.900> nice

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
on mastering because it gives a nice

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.660 
on mastering because it gives a nice
leash<00:01:41.590> on<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:42.040> peaks

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
leash on the peaks

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.460 
leash on the peaks
it<00:01:43.180> adds<00:01:44.010> warmth<00:01:45.010> and<00:01:45.190> a<00:01:45.850> bit<00:01:46.090> more<00:01:46.360> power<00:01:47.260> to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
it adds warmth and a bit more power to

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.580 
it adds warmth and a bit more power to
your<00:01:47.830> home<00:01:48.010> makes<00:01:48.280> hand<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:49.720> just<00:01:50.170> sounds

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
awesome this way so and then afterwards

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.070 
awesome this way so and then afterwards
another<00:01:56.910> compressor<00:01:57.910> let's<00:01:58.360> take<00:01:58.810> each

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
another compressor let's take each

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.570 
another compressor let's take each
compressor<00:01:59.800> again<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:01.980> just<00:02:02.980> some<00:02:03.160> slight

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
compressor again and just some slight

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.669 
compressor again and just some slight
settings<00:02:04.180> so<00:02:04.540> bass<00:02:05.230> you<00:02:05.380> about<00:02:05.560> three<00:02:06.010> two<00:02:06.160> one

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
settings so bass you about three two one

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.650 
settings so bass you about three two one
punch<00:02:08.679> keep<00:02:09.250> down<00:02:09.780> tech<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:12.250> this<00:02:12.490> area<00:02:12.730> yeah

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
punch keep down tech on this area yeah

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.350 
punch keep down tech on this area yeah
so<00:02:14.260> with<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:14.620> one<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:14.860> just<00:02:14.980> want<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.550> give<00:02:16.000> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
so with this one I just want to give the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:03:21.860 
so with this one I just want to give the
drums<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.990> final<00:02:17.470> glue

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.660 

and<00:03:22.870> of<00:03:23.080> course<00:03:23.320> I<00:03:23.440> just<00:03:23.680> know<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.280> forgot

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
and of course I just know this I forgot

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.670 
and of course I just know this I forgot
the<00:03:24.790> snare<00:03:25.150> were<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:28.750> course<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.440> snare

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
the snare were of course the snare

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.760 
the snare were of course the snare
reverb<00:03:29.860> is<00:03:30.220> kind<00:03:31.090> of<00:03:31.150> important<00:03:31.600> so<00:03:34.770> yeah

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
reverb is kind of important so yeah

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.230 
reverb is kind of important so yeah
let's<00:03:36.040> just<00:03:36.160> do<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.430> let's<00:03:36.670> get<00:03:36.940> rid<00:03:37.270> of<00:03:37.420> our

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
let's just do it let's get rid of our

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
let's just do it let's get rid of our
compressors<00:03:40.240> here<00:03:40.450> now<00:03:40.690> drum<00:03:40.990> buss<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:43.260> of

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
compressors here now drum buss and of

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.920 
compressors here now drum buss and of
course<00:03:44.470> what<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.620> also<00:03:44.830> forgot<00:03:45.460> to<00:03:45.520> do<00:03:45.880> is<00:03:46.300> sent

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
course what I also forgot to do is sent

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.220 
course what I also forgot to do is sent
the<00:03:47.140> kick<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.830> come<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.490> our<00:03:48.670> drums<00:03:49.180> bus<00:03:51.930> has<00:03:52.930> to

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
the kick I come to our drums bus has to

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.570 
the kick I come to our drums bus has to
be<00:03:53.410> there<00:03:54.270> okay<00:03:55.300> and<00:03:55.570> now<00:03:57.630> snare<00:03:58.630> reverb<00:03:58.840> so

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
be there okay and now snare reverb so

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:06.500 
be there okay and now snare reverb so
reverb<00:04:02.010> let's<00:04:03.010> check<00:04:03.190> this<00:04:03.310> one<00:04:03.370> out

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.560 

drums<00:04:07.510> and<00:04:07.960> then<00:04:08.640> mix<00:04:09.640> in<00:04:09.880> until<00:04:10.210> it<00:04:10.270> sounds

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
drums and then mix in until it sounds

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.240 
drums and then mix in until it sounds
good

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
good

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:26.420 
good
preferably<00:04:12.250> in<00:04:12.550> context

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:39.339 

okay

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.289 

okay<00:04:40.349> so<00:04:40.409> I<00:04:40.769> put<00:04:40.859> this<00:04:41.189> one<00:04:41.369> bit<00:04:41.549> shorter

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:42.299 
okay so I put this one bit shorter

00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:44.989 
okay so I put this one bit shorter
again<00:04:43.109> this<00:04:43.289> is<00:04:43.469> depending<00:04:44.159> also<00:04:44.369> on<00:04:44.669> the

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:44.999 
again this is depending also on the

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:48.709 
again this is depending also on the
style<00:04:45.359> of<00:04:45.449> the<00:04:45.509> music<00:04:45.959> you're<00:04:46.169> doing<00:04:47.179> or<00:04:48.179> your

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
style of the music you're doing or your

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:54.439 
style of the music you're doing or your
mixing<00:04:49.199> and<00:04:51.649> now<00:04:52.649> let's<00:04:52.949> put<00:04:53.219> an<00:04:53.339> EQ<00:04:53.969> behind

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
mixing and now let's put an EQ behind

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:03.759 
mixing and now let's put an EQ behind
the<00:04:56.449> reverb<00:04:57.919> to<00:04:58.919> shape<00:04:59.309> it<00:04:59.489> a<00:04:59.549> little<00:04:59.759> bit<00:04:59.909> more

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:03.769 

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:23.659 

so<00:05:04.769> let's<00:05:05.099> put<00:05:05.399> on<00:05:05.579> some<00:05:05.610> low-end<00:05:22.429> yeah

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
so let's put on some low-end yeah

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.429 
so let's put on some low-end yeah
and<00:05:23.849> now<00:05:24.479> lately<00:05:24.839> what<00:05:25.139> I<00:05:25.169> like<00:05:25.409> to<00:05:25.529> do<00:05:25.679> is<00:05:25.979> also

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:27.439 
and now lately what I like to do is also

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:30.349 
and now lately what I like to do is also
gates<00:05:28.439> the<00:05:28.829> reverb<00:05:29.189> just<00:05:29.519> to<00:05:29.699> cut<00:05:29.999> up<00:05:30.179> this

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:30.359 
gates the reverb just to cut up this

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:33.439 
gates the reverb just to cut up this
last<00:05:31.079> bit<00:05:31.289> of<00:05:31.349> the<00:05:31.559> tail<00:05:31.799> and<00:05:32.039> then<00:05:32.969> compress

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
last bit of the tail and then compress

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:48.150 
last bit of the tail and then compress
it<00:05:33.659> so<00:05:34.579> dynamics<00:05:36.379> one<00:05:39.319> gate

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.710 

yeah<00:05:49.160> something<00:05:49.820> like<00:05:49.850> this<00:05:50.120> and<00:05:50.479> then

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
yeah something like this and then

00:05:50.720 --> 00:06:33.809 
yeah something like this and then
compress<00:05:52.570> one<00:05:53.570> compressor<00:06:03.340> yeah

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:33.819 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.700 

yes<00:06:34.850> this<00:06:35.270> helps<00:06:35.750> fatten<00:06:36.259> up<00:06:36.380> the<00:06:36.470> snail<00:06:36.680> a

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
yes this helps fatten up the snail a

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.930 
yes this helps fatten up the snail a
little<00:06:36.949> bit<00:06:37.069> and<00:06:37.840> then<00:06:38.840> we<00:06:39.440> can<00:06:39.590> turn<00:06:39.949> on<00:06:40.460> our

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
little bit and then we can turn on our

00:06:40.940 --> 00:07:08.110 
little bit and then we can turn on our
compresses<00:06:41.750> again

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.230 

all<00:07:08.810> righty<00:07:09.139> and<00:07:09.620> now<00:07:09.889> our<00:07:10.190> tommix<00:07:10.669> is<00:07:10.910> pretty

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
all righty and now our tommix is pretty

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.920 
all righty and now our tommix is pretty
much<00:07:11.419> done

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
much done

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.530 
much done
and<00:07:12.139> this<00:07:12.919> concludes<00:07:13.130> my<00:07:13.520> life<00:07:13.940> drum<00:07:14.180> mixing

and this concludes my life drum mixing

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.140 
and this concludes my life drum mixing
