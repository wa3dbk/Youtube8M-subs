 Well, we welcome you

 want you to meet today we are going to 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.689
 share a resource that has to do 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:22.180
 with passing the text to voice an application 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.580
 that comes free with windows and 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.680
 especially we are doing it as 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.800
 such in Spanish because it comes in English 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.529
 but but what we want is to see 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.690
 done in this in this tutorial is how 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.670
 pass it to Spanish properly for the 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.070
 they are in English then without problems 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.900
 they will be able to make use of it and here 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.019
 are you going to find her with the 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.690
 narrator word here in on the line 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:50.920
 of searches and appears in this part 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.049
 I'm going to click on it but it's going 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.879
 to start listening in English the 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.129
 activity that I will have on screen 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.700
 with my mouse is going to start 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.220
 play by voice 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.290
 there is a little discomfort to be 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.570
 using frequently but with the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.390
 practice you will be able to listen 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.730
 comfortably your texts to voice or pass them 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.560
 from text to speech the purpose is that 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.260
 those who may have difficulties 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.780
 visuals because of tired eyes because they use or 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.060
 no glasses or because they are doing 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.979
 some other activity and want to listen 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.800
 a good text because this is the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.690
 alternative are going to the I'm going to start and the 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.479
 I'm going to remove because it's going to start this 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.610
 the sound and it's a bit uncomfortable in what 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.140
 that is not properly configured and 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.700
 that's what we're going to do the day of 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.700
 today configure it noten 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.460
 with his illusion he plays a lot 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.430
 with some 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.440
 there is how they could see it started the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.840
 application but it was started in English and not 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.659
 you understand absolutely nothing good 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.360
 I'm going to leave the league for you 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.909
 download this that says narrator in 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.180
 Castilian is to say that application that 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.270
 I executed a moment ago that already 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.800
 reproduce but now in Spanish so 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.239
 I 'm going to leave the league in the part 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.090
 bottom of the video in the information 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.610
 to download this cip and its 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.010
 interior is so simple that the only 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.900
 what they have to do is install the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.780
 program that comes inside of that 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.700
 site in the narrator folder to put 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:31.260
 is to run the voice application in Spanish 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.040
 it's that simple, you execute that 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.230
 installation of the voice 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.939
 and it is in fact a voice of what is not a 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.060
 program that is well known to many 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:43.579
 and that has that peculiarity of reading 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.010
 the text and pass it to voice once 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:50.629
 have installed that voice open go be 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.780
 it makes two points here on the disk 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.730
 program files and here in what 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.180
 do not press the l key to go to 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.810
 oquendo 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.230
 in l ts and copy this file we are going to 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.520
 copy it copy and paste it here 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.290
 this side paste 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.810
 ok and replace what you copy and replace 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.599
 continue and that's it 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.090
 with this the same application that 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:22.630
 we executed a little while ago and it started 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.700
 in English now will start in Spanish 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.470
 but in case you do not start in Spanish 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.220
 now they will see from where you can 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.900
 set up let's try 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.750
 narrator let's execute it is going to 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.340
 start the sound of the narrator himself goes 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.560
 to be a little uncomfortable but right now 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.990
 let's see this how to correct 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.050
 correctly initial hoisting the narrator 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.900

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.940
 Narrator focused on button close as 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.550
 I was telling you it's a bit uncomfortable but let's go 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.280
 to go see how to use it we are going to 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.240
 now the next step is to configure 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:03.140
 the voice series references with 7 button 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:07.130

 he effectively clicks the menu there 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.790
 and Jorge is going to appear and he's going to 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.799
 appear the voice of Jorge 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.680
 when we started for the first time in 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.770
 our narrator started with the voice of 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.360
 microsoft anna in english but now 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.729
 you are going to have the opportunity to 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.310
 that from there I set it up and put it 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:32.100

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.470

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.940
 what to do to set up your narrator in 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.919
 effectively in Spanish now we are going to 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.110
 do a test of how to use it 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.759
 I already told you that for example this 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.099
 storyteller 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:53.160
 has the peculiarity of passing the 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.139
 text to the voice 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.530
 I'm going to select here a portion of 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.530
 text 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.880
 what is it from 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.550
 your browser me for example here between 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.980
 I'll quickly go to a page that 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.650
 says short stories and stories is nothing 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.440
 more to do the example and the story or 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.990
 the document or text whatever it is that I 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.030
 I want to play the voice I stick it on my 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.310
 blog notes because my notebook 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.770
 good because the notebook does not have 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.890
 many buttons so the narrator does not go 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.890
 to be wasting time reading all the 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:30.860
 content of the buttons once 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:34.940
 have this select your text that is going to 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.340
 be read and activate your initial narrator 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.620

 select all your text when that 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.610
 Later he arrived at the old station 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.950
 they reported that the train in which she 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.560
 travel would be delayed approximately 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:00.320
 one hour the elegant lady a little 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.300
 annoyed bought a magazine a package 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.740
 of cookies and a bottle of water for 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.139
 spend time 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.569
 I look for a bank in the central platform and 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.669
 I feel ready for the wait as 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:13.550
 you can see is already playing my 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:17.270
 text in Spanish does not need then 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:20.360
 more sophisticated things simply that 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:23.150
 the narrator 's own windows and how 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.069
 as we always mention here we put 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.590
 the resource you use your imagination 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:29.900
 to know where you are going to use that 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.340
 resource that's all for today the 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.199
 we send a greeting to all 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.729

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.530
