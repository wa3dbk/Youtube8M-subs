this<00:05:58.850> seems<00:05:59.090> the<00:05:59.390> 2013<00:06:00.020> -<00:06:00.530> seems<00:06:00.860> different

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
this seems the 2013 - seems different

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.439 
empty bang which is annoying
I<00:06:11.400> thought<00:06:11.730> they<00:06:11.880> would<00:06:11.970> have<00:06:12.000> been<00:06:12.180> exactly

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
I thought they would have been exactly

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:13.970 
I thought they would have been exactly
the<00:06:12.660> same<00:06:12.840> -<00:06:13.110> but<00:06:13.410> now<00:06:13.530> they<00:06:13.680> must<00:06:13.860> have

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
the same - but now they must have

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.820 
the same - but now they must have
improved<00:06:14.340> it<00:06:14.580> for<00:06:14.669> the<00:06:14.730> 2014<00:06:15.389> model<00:06:15.620> hey<00:06:16.620> well
