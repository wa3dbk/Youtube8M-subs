00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.119
 hello friends again I bring you a 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.949
 very father hairstyle that I saw in Taylor Swift 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.830
 you can use for some day at night 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.630
 and well let's start what we're going to 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.439
 need is a brush more or less like this 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.330
 to make a crepe and partings and we're going 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.410
 to need our fixing spray 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.870
 average that in this case is choco 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.420
 and we are going to have some baby pets and 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.890
 our one-quarter-inch clamp 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.620
 we always have to look at where they are going 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.510
 scores and where we favor 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.630
 we ourselves because not because the 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.940
 artist I bring a score in the part 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.550
 from here we will not see well 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.800
 we then have to see what 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.020
 way we look good 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.030

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.940
 swat lotaip on the side part 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.270
 as I always tell you that they are guided by 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.640
 the eyebrows so that they catch your line and you 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.150
 I think it's more natural for them not to see 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.909
 very low or very high then more or 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.900
 less to the area of ​​the eyebrow we are going to do 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.900
 our parting 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.150
 we remain more or less derechita 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.000
 let's brush it to the side that to 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.890
 you favor 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.659
 let's brush all our hair 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.850
 and what we are going to do is divide 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.549
 our hair in 2 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.220
 and these laughs that I have here I made them 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.670
 with my life I will show you how it will be 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.920
 with those curls we are going to grab our 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.670
 clamp let's grab our first 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.090
 tuft and we will start from 2 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:58.210
 let's take our pint and we're going to 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.360
 place the clamp straight from the root 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.670
 where we do not burn about 5 or 10 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.420
 seconds in each loop and we will continue 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.420
 with the other 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.560
 5 or 10 seconds and we continue with that 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.450
 and so we 're going to go with the last one to 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.750
 the last part I recommend that the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.629
 do in one we're going to do it from 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.489
 the root and we're going to roll all our 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.690
 hair to the tip we're going to 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.860
 deliver it 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.750
 about 510 seconds and let's go 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.250
 go through with this part let's do what 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.060
 same as we did with our hair 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.450
 let's grab thick parts 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.390
 let's mess up our hair 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.110
 and from 15 to 10 seconds training is what 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.110
 that we are going to adore 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.330
 let's continue with this part of our 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.300
 hair and we're going to grab a lot more 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.730
 means and let's pray with our clamp 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.340
 look carefully how I have the clamp I have it 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.200
 in a vertical way 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.090
 ok we have our curl let's go with 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.830
 our next meter and so 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.830

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.379
 and let's move our fingers 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.770
 to ruffle all the curls that 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.770
 we did 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.860
 If you do not have the pompadour as you have it 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.519
 she who in this case is seen as a 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.519
 fringe well 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.530
 that she has it up to there she 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.780
 yes it does have the crest but if 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.690

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.019
