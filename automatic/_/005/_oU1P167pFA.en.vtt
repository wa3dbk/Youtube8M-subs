take a look at this unique machine
called<00:00:07.939> a<00:00:08.029> radius<00:00:08.450> break<00:00:08.719> many<00:00:09.469> people<00:00:09.770> ask

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
called a radius break many people ask

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.620 
called a radius break many people ask
the<00:00:10.100> question<00:00:10.129> why<00:00:11.059> does<00:00:11.180> it<00:00:11.299> look<00:00:11.420> the<00:00:11.450> way

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
the question why does it look the way

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.180 
the question why does it look the way
that<00:00:11.809> it<00:00:11.900> looks<00:00:12.049> how<00:00:12.200> do<00:00:12.259> those<00:00:12.410> rollers<00:00:12.950> work

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
that it looks how do those rollers work

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.310 
that it looks how do those rollers work
what<00:00:13.759> will<00:00:13.880> it<00:00:14.030> do<00:00:14.179> that<00:00:14.389> a<00:00:14.450> regular<00:00:14.990> sheet

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
what will it do that a regular sheet

what will it do that a regular sheet
metal<00:00:15.559> break<00:00:15.769> won't<00:00:15.950> do<00:00:16.250> because<00:00:16.820> it<00:00:16.910> is<00:00:17.029> a

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
metal break won't do because it is a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.909 
metal break won't do because it is a
unique<00:00:17.300> design<00:00:17.450> we're<00:00:18.230> gonna<00:00:18.380> take<00:00:18.529> a<00:00:18.560> look<00:00:18.830> at

wrap the material around these tubes and

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.619 
wrap the material around these tubes and
create<00:00:39.469> much<00:00:39.679> larger<00:00:40.219> radiuses<00:00:40.760> so<00:00:41.449> for
