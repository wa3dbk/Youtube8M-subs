again it's been going around it's

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.720 
again it's been going around it's
happening<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.740> a<00:02:37.770> bunch<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.190> channels<00:02:38.550> on

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
happening to a bunch of channels on

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.690 
happening to a bunch of channels on
YouTube<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:40.190> hopefully<00:02:41.190> we'll<00:02:41.340> see<00:02:41.520> what

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
ends up happening now I think what

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.140 
ends up happening now I think what
happens<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.290> if<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.680> if<00:02:44.520> they<00:02:44.790> are<00:02:44.910> found

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
happens is if that if they are found

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.000 
happens is if that if they are found
this<00:02:45.690> particular<00:02:46.230> person<00:02:46.380> finds<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.890> they

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
this particular person finds that they
