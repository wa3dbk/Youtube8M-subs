00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.770
 psv.nl has been chosen as the website of the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 year in the sport category by it 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.790
 research agency metrixlab 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.889
 the official club site became the winner 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.019
 the best and most popular sport category 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.750
 site and showed him among other things 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.350
 nl football sites like freddy can behind 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.350
 himself 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.460
 talk about a trilingual website with 4 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.609
 a 5 million page views per month 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.390
 that is around 400,000 more than 400,000 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.730
 unique visitors it is not just psv.nl 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.080
 PC TV is also included 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.700
 with 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.610
 75,000 unique visitors per month 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.200
 for half a million films 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.200
 so there is demand for it, there is much demand for it 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.180
 and i think it is because psv 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.350
 it is therefore an official club site 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.330
 reliable, fully up-to-date and yes there 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.800
 people can always go for that 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.390
 the information they are looking for 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.940
 it is also the fastest way to everything 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.680
 find out about psv i don't think 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.840
 the fastest way because we are like me 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.760
 said officially reliable 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.860
 but we are therefore also officially out 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.050
 the moment it is so no 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.750
 site for rumors there is no place 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.850
 for pronounced 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.610
 certain opinions from a certain angle 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.470
 we are not a stage for the for the 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.730
 for the press but we are official and 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.470
 so it may be that there is a certain 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.960
 rumor in the media around sums were only 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.310
 Be the last to report that is now 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.229
 once the fate of official club site 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.680
 other opportunity we have often 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.740
 first as a news and what else 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.940
 has not leaked is yes 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.979
 officially it is always a new trap 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.450
 if you read with us it is true and therefore 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.220
 prevails in the last few days 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.050
 party mood on the stadium 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.090
 the editors are busy with this on a daily basis 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.649
 informing its supporters 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.630
 to keep everyone informed of 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.060
 all the troubles around my favorite 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.690
 club with a small team we are working on 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.670
 this site 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.020
 sometimes you think who is behind it 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.910
 sons are parents are not like that at all 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.899
 many people 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.060
 Of course I also have to do our partners 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.800
 and gx company for our content 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.360
 management system the system behind the 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.160
 site and kpn both our hosts since 2001 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.860
 but pc media makes and their this site 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.970
 self yes completely in-house 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.840
 where you voted the best thing 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.200
 there is still something to be desired 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.670
 well indeed with nice that we 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.540
 indeed by the public that is it 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.670
 an audience award 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.140
 we have received many votes in 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.120
 two categories the best site 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.830
 content and the most popular because of the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.820
 most votes 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.700
 well that is an encouragement 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.430
 entrepreneur to continue and be there 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.019
 a lot of athletes who like nice things there 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.980
 you can say clichÃ©s about that 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.630
 say about it 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.850
 we are not proud of it and we are going 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.850
 just push it through to even more visitors 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.860
 even more offer of news and even more 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.760
