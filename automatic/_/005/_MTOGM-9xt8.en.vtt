actually<00:01:14.520> kind<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.729> simple<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.210> think

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
actually kind of simple if you think

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.219 
actually kind of simple if you think
about<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.040> 1.7<00:01:17.700> snapshots<00:01:18.229> um

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
about it so this is the 1.7 snapshots um

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.420 
about it so this is the 1.7 snapshots um
it<00:01:19.770> tests<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.900> scoreboard<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.409> jump<00:01:22.650> since

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
it tests for a scoreboard for jump since

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.039 
it tests for a scoreboard for jump since
you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.729> detect<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.360> player<00:01:24.600> jumps<00:01:24.900> now

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
you can detect when a player jumps now

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.370 
you can detect when a player jumps now
and<00:01:25.610> then<00:01:26.610> it'll<00:01:26.970> add<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> score<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
and then it'll add a score to the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.660 
and then it'll add a score to the
scoreboard<00:01:28.829> shout<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:31.229> output<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> jump<00:01:32.130> goes

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
scoreboard shout the output of jump goes

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.580 
scoreboard shout the output of jump goes
over<00:01:32.909> here<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.360> if<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.840> jump<00:01:34.079> three<00:01:34.290> times

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
over here and if you jump three times

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.010 
over here and if you jump three times
that<00:01:34.799> that's<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.460> timing<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.780> will

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
that that's what this timing is it will

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.969 
that that's what this timing is it will
activate<00:01:37.439> here<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:39.320> do<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.710> these

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
to go through the commands with you so

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.340
