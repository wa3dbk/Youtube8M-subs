00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
games would go into and I believe this

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.920 
games would go into and I believe this
is<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:30.680> charge<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.099> up<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:32.630> battery

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
is the to charge it up and the battery

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.839 
is the to charge it up and the battery
right<00:02:33.200> here<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.860> this<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.400> outside<00:02:34.549> of

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
right here so this is the outside of

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.819 
right here so this is the outside of
device<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.900> does<00:02:36.019> have<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> camera<00:02:36.680> on<00:02:36.769> the

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
device and it does have a camera on the

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:37.930 
device and it does have a camera on the
outside<00:02:36.890> just<00:02:37.370> like<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.579> previous<00:02:37.730> version

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
outside just like the previous version

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.920 
outside just like the previous version
of<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.480> DSi<00:02:39.069> so<00:02:40.069> I'm<00:02:40.130> going<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.400> open<00:02:40.579> it<00:02:40.700> up
