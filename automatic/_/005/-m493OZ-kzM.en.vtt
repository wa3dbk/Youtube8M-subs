keyboard shortcuts to an action so let

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.940 
keyboard shortcuts to an action so let
me<00:02:19.680> talk<00:02:20.040> about<00:02:21.319> different<00:02:22.319> types<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.680> actions

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
me talk about different types of actions

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.300 
me talk about different types of actions
that<00:02:23.219> I<00:02:23.310> created<00:02:23.730> here<00:02:24.379> here's<00:02:25.379> a<00:02:25.650> blur<00:02:26.099> filter

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
that I created here here's a blur filter

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.170 
that I created here here's a blur filter
action<00:02:27.019> applies<00:02:28.040> gaseum<00:02:29.040> blur<00:02:29.280> incrementally

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.479 
action applies gaseum blur incrementally
at<00:02:30.390> point<00:02:30.689> three<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:31.200> found<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.280> works

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
at point three I found that this works

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.479 
at point three I found that this works
really<00:02:32.640> great<00:02:32.939> because<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.689> know<00:02:34.260> how<00:02:34.980> these

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
really great because I know how these

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.240 
really great because I know how these
filters<00:02:35.909> work<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.390> what<00:02:36.510> they<00:02:36.629> do<00:02:36.689> and<00:02:37.250> what

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
filters work and what they do and what

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.490 
filters work and what they do and what
the<00:02:38.370> ideal<00:02:38.609> settings<00:02:39.060> are<00:02:39.239> so<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.750> set<00:02:40.200> them<00:02:40.379> up

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
the ideal settings are so I set them up

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.050 
the ideal settings are so I set them up
at<00:02:40.680> those<00:02:40.859> settings<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.489> every<00:02:41.670> time<00:02:41.849> I<00:02:41.879> hit

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
at those settings and every time I hit

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.050 
at those settings and every time I hit
this<00:02:42.209> button<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.659> will<00:02:42.750> incrementally<00:02:43.530> blur

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
this button it will incrementally blur

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.059 
this button it will incrementally blur

your rendering and blend them into your

rendering which works really great and

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.140 
rendering which works really great and
to<00:04:53.960> do<00:04:54.080> that<00:04:54.200> you<00:04:54.740> could<00:04:54.920> do<00:04:55.070> window<00:04:55.400> arrange

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
to do that you could do window arrange

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.340

is<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:00.590> set<00:05:00.770> up<00:05:00.800> a<00:05:00.920> keyboard<00:05:01.310> shortcut<00:05:02.030> for<00:05:02.330> this

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
is I set up a keyboard shortcut for this

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.170 
is I set up a keyboard shortcut for this
and<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.970> keyboard<00:05:05.300> shortcut<00:05:05.690> is<00:05:05.800> ctrl<00:05:06.800> D<00:05:07.190> you

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
and the keyboard shortcut is ctrl D you

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.690 
and the keyboard shortcut is ctrl D you
can<00:05:08.330> setup<00:05:08.510> keyboard<00:05:08.900> shortcuts<00:05:09.260> for<00:05:09.380> any<00:05:09.700> any
