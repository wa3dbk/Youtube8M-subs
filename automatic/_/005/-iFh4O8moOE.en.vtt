00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.719
 today we are going to do a demonstration with 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.900
 the hard milk the seminal builder 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:17.510
 we have cleaned the nail we have passed the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:21.220
 puree to remove everything that is dust 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.220
 let's have the mold 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.700
 let's do as if it were a 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.150
 building 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.800
 do not leave Me 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.800
 already clinical but in 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.120
 semi-permanent constructor 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.120
 with we put the mold 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.660
 and first what we are going to do we are going to 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.660
 put a base a final base layer 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.750
 and 30 seconds 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.670
 we wait for 30 seconds 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.670
 dry 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.200
 is leave has a pink color is ideal 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.200
 for French 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.430
 acquires a cent and 45 cents 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:11.179
 but we can give it the shape we want 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.179
 we dry 30 seconds 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.970
 let's proceed with another layer 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.000
 we can start to establish the nexus of 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.000
 boy, we give him the thickness we need 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.280
 and we passed 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.790
 all over the square 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.269
 and we come back more 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.540
 well once we've finished with the 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.540
 drying we remove the mold 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.499
 and we said 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.560
 we clean the sticky layer 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.050
 Y 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.959
 ah 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.959
 and a little bit above 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.930
 with the cue with we take 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.260
 the reason is not no 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.040
 very wide 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.489
 and in this month we could move to 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.210
 enameled or simply if we want to 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.350
 we passed the top 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:17.170
 in the next video we are going to 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.310
 the whole process of 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.310
 to dismantle 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.199
 french 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.210
 and we clean the layer of segments or 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.690
 an elongated child with jasmine we can 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.690
 make it that is quite thick 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.749
 good until the next
