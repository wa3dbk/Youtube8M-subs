off<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.040> big<00:01:05.159> way<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.640> think<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.180> went

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
off in a big way but I think as we went

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.480 
off in a big way but I think as we went
along<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.780> realize<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.220> very

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
along we realize that it's very

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.420 
along we realize that it's very
important<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.119> work<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.369> infrastructure<00:01:11.369> as

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
important to work on infrastructure as

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.300 
important to work on infrastructure as
well<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.150> branding<00:01:12.659> was<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.080> lot<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.650> backward

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
well so branding was a lot of backward

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.770 
well so branding was a lot of backward
forward<00:01:14.549> integration<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.479> we're<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
forward integration and we're going to

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.480 
forward integration and we're going to
flesh<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.470> video<00:01:16.740> detail<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
flesh that out in video detail but the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.210
