00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.919
 i 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:13.810
 welcome friends of minecraft this is 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.090
 my second video 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.240
 and today I 'm going to show you what it's for 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.119
 the ball is light and as you will know 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.340
 killing those bugs those who are 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.610
 find 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.520
 on the banks of the water and those things 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.150
 stretch this ball and you will say to 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.450
 what serves 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.570
 good is good for two things one is for 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.150
 make sticky pistons 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.370
 and they put on the table after all the python and 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.520
 the ball of the line and they have a piston 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.410
 sticky 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.340
 I in the previous video I do not know if what 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.900
 they saw I explained how to make pistons and 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.420
 what is the sticky piston used for? 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.150
 Anyway, I'll leave the video link 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.990
 in the description and for the other that 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:05.460
 It serves is to make exhibitions like this 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.380
 as exhibitions serves to make 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.760
 exposure to fire resistance but 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.390
 it's not that you are going 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.390
 the distiller 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.950
 now and put 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.130
 does not even receive it does not have to 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.830
 get this rod what are you 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.950
 having here this way that I have here 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.250
 they get it by killing a bug called 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.180
 blake 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.350
 He speaks and is not called double 'and that this 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.270
 is in the underworld 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.659
 this bug 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.409
 it's yellow turns and throws ball of 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.679
 fire for you to have an idea 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.249
 already having that rod returns to the table 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.249
 of the crafter 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.780
 and they will appear on the web, after that 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.390
 already having these two things go the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.729
 storage rooms do this 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.179
 you fly line I come back from blaze and I 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.030
 mango cream will come out and now if this 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.060
 is ready to make a position 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.569
 position of resistance to fire let's 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:23.310
 the magma cream distiller 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.520
 and loading is done 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.709
 a position of fire resistance 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.150
 what's the use now I'm going to show you 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.000
 obviously you already the name already 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.020
 They will know but now I am going to show them 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.020
 we hope it is 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.900
 and since we already have a position of 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.770
 fire resistance and that's one of 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.930
 both 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.930
 to serve the classroom 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.110
 what's the last thing in things alone I 'm going 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.680
 to show how he resists 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.520
 we go outside 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.180
 we grab a lighter 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.180
 ah 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.209
 it's full burning 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.730
 well let's go back 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.470
 we take the position 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.870
 and as you will see, it resists three 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.500
 minutes we go to the fire and as you will see 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.010
 nothing happens 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.470
 It's great and good that's all friends 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.890
 I hope you liked to give a 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.610
 brother sign up and be good and 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.150
 until next time 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.150
 bye Bye
