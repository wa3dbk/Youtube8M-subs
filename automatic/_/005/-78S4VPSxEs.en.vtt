on<00:01:42.360> both<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> handle<00:01:43.049> or<00:01:43.560> with<00:01:43.770> adapters<00:01:44.280> I

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
on both the handle or with adapters I

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.469 
on both the handle or with adapters I
can<00:01:44.579> use<00:01:44.700> Canon<00:01:45.149> EF<00:01:45.470> use<00:01:46.470> Yale<00:01:46.680> Mouse<00:01:47.060> PL<00:01:48.060> and

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
can use Canon EF use Yale Mouse PL and

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.499 
can use Canon EF use Yale Mouse PL and
Nikon<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.649> Nikon<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.270> this

Nikon and Nikon so really this this
camera<00:01:52.369> works<00:01:53.369> with<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:53.670> about<00:01:53.909> every<00:01:54.329> lens

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
camera works with just about every lens

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.020 
camera works with just about every lens
out<00:01:54.869> there<00:01:55.110> exactly<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:56.430> beautiful<00:01:56.790> but

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
out there exactly it's beautiful but

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.819 
out there exactly it's beautiful but
what's<00:01:57.600> even<00:01:57.719> more<00:01:57.930> special<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.619> were

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
telling me about the variable scan

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.100 
telling me about the variable scan
mapping<00:02:01.710> that's<00:02:01.979> right<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.329> with<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.780> camera

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
mapping that's right so with this camera

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.770 
mapping that's right so with this camera
when<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.619> put<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> lens<00:02:05.390> right<00:02:06.390> now<00:02:06.570> it's

can actually keeper
down<00:02:13.370> all<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.550> way<00:02:14.700> that's<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.390> quite<00:02:15.870> super

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
down all the way that's not quite super

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.670 
down all the way that's not quite super
35<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:18.090> can<00:02:18.270> adjust<00:02:18.660> for<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.020> but<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.290> don't

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
35 you can adjust for it but I don't

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.270 
35 you can adjust for it but I don't
have<00:02:19.890> only<00:02:20.190> two<00:02:20.460> choices<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:22.080> know<00:02:22.230> one<00:02:23.040> and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
have only two choices you know one and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.830 
have only two choices you know one and
wit<00:02:23.520> in<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.790> smaller<00:02:24.090> window<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.780> can

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
wit in a smaller window I can

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.120 
wit in a smaller window I can
incrementally

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
incrementally

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.790 
incrementally
yes<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.330> can<00:02:27.600> get<00:02:27.750> three<00:02:27.990> percent<00:02:28.380> increment

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
yes so I can get three percent increment

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.650 
yes so I can get three percent increment
you<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:29.010> bring<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.340> down<00:02:29.370> that's<00:02:29.970> really<00:02:30.390> very

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
you can bring it down that's really very

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.750 
you can bring it down that's really very
exciting<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.830> those<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.370> us<00:02:32.520> who<00:02:32.610> have<00:02:32.730> a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
exciting and so those of us who have a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.420 
exciting and so those of us who have a
lot<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.060> old<00:02:33.240> class<00:02:33.510> 16<00:02:34.230> millimeter<00:02:34.740> glass<00:02:35.010> we

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
lot of old class 16 millimeter glass we

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.370 
lot of old class 16 millimeter glass we
can<00:02:35.460> still<00:02:35.820> use<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.210> on<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.720> camera<00:02:37.170> that's

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
can still use this on this camera that's

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.430 
can still use this on this camera that's
great<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:38.550> sounds<00:02:38.880> like<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.330> don't<00:02:40.110> want<00:02:40.380> to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
great that sounds like I don't want to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.080 
great that sounds like I don't want to
say<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:40.890> tool<00:02:41.130> for<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.430> all<00:02:41.640> camera

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
say a one tool for it's all camera

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.840 
say a one tool for it's all camera
because<00:02:42.390> obviously<00:02:42.960> it's<00:02:43.650> very<00:02:43.770> complex<00:02:44.550> but

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
because obviously it's very complex but

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.790 
because obviously it's very complex but
it<00:02:45.210> seems<00:02:45.450> like<00:02:45.690> something<00:02:46.110> that's<00:02:46.260> going<00:02:46.710> to

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
it seems like something that's going to

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.770 
it seems like something that's going to
be<00:02:46.920> very<00:02:47.160> useful<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.790> lot<00:02:47.850> of<00:02:48.120> people<00:02:48.420> it's
