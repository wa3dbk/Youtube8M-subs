00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
find that four inches of straw helps

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.780 
find that four inches of straw helps
retain<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.840> tremendous<00:04:00.650> amount<00:04:00.950> of<00:04:01.099> water<00:04:01.459> in

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790

these<00:04:02.769> verses<00:04:03.769> I<00:04:03.950> just<00:04:04.159> had<00:04:04.310> like<00:04:04.489> a<00:04:04.549> half<00:04:04.879> inch

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
these verses I just had like a half inch

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.410 
these verses I just had like a half inch
but<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:06.739> more<00:04:06.950> straw<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.670> better<00:04:07.849> this<00:04:08.120> does

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
but the more straw the better this does

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.210 
but the more straw the better this does
and<00:04:09.400> every<00:04:10.400> time<00:04:10.609> it<00:04:10.790> rains<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:12.680> water<00:04:12.709> of

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
plants from the top down when I first

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.610 
plants from the top down when I first
get<00:04:52.280> a<00:04:52.340> system<00:04:52.849> like<00:04:53.060> this<00:04:53.389> or<00:04:53.780> even<00:04:53.810> if<00:04:54.229> I<00:04:54.409> got

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620

get a system like this or even if I got
this<00:04:54.889> the<00:04:55.099> small<00:04:55.430> plants<00:04:56.000> need<00:04:56.240> some<00:04:56.419> extra

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
this the small plants need some extra

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.290 
this the small plants need some extra
love<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.020> care<00:04:57.560> until<00:04:58.400> they<00:04:58.520> can<00:04:58.699> establish

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
love and care until they can establish

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.439 
love and care until they can establish
their<00:04:59.900> own<00:04:59.930> root<00:05:00.349> system<00:05:00.889> these<00:05:01.789> plants<00:05:02.270> here

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
their own root system these plants here

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.140 
their own root system these plants here
took<00:05:02.720> an<00:05:02.840> extra<00:05:03.169> long<00:05:03.409> time<00:05:03.770> but<00:05:04.610> I'm<00:05:04.760> sure

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
took an extra long time but I'm sure

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.350 
took an extra long time but I'm sure
that<00:05:05.180> was<00:05:05.630> mainly<00:05:06.020> due<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:07.330> not<00:05:08.330> having

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
that was mainly due to not having

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.360 
that was mainly due to not having
established<00:05:08.870> root<00:05:09.500> system<00:05:09.979> that<00:05:10.010> could<00:05:10.250> get

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
established root system that could get

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.580 
established root system that could get
down<00:05:10.580> there<00:05:10.849> to<00:05:11.090> where<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.389> water<00:05:11.630> is<00:05:11.810> wicking

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
down there to where the water is wicking

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.020 
down there to where the water is wicking
up<00:05:12.800> and<00:05:13.789> it<00:05:14.300> was<00:05:14.389> a<00:05:14.419> brand<00:05:14.599> new<00:05:14.750> system<00:05:15.320> so

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
up and it was a brand new system so

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.129 
up and it was a brand new system so
overall<00:05:17.030> very<00:05:18.039> pleased<00:05:19.039> with<00:05:19.780> what<00:05:20.780> I<00:05:20.810> have

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
overall very pleased with what I have

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.640 
overall very pleased with what I have
gone<00:05:21.409> on<00:05:21.469> here<00:05:21.740> with<00:05:22.729> the<00:05:22.909> tomatoes

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
gone on here with the tomatoes

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.610 
gone on here with the tomatoes
these<00:05:25.130> are<00:05:25.400> some<00:05:25.850> of<00:05:25.880> the<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.780> best<00:05:26.990> tomatoes

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
these are some of the the best tomatoes

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.080 
these are some of the the best tomatoes
I've<00:05:27.860> I've<00:05:28.220> had<00:05:28.669> down<00:05:29.180> here<00:05:29.210> in<00:05:29.720> terms<00:05:30.560> of

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
I've I've had down here in terms of

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.260 
I've I've had down here in terms of
their<00:05:32.090> health<00:05:32.360> and<00:05:32.660> vitality<00:05:33.790> and<00:05:34.790> I<00:05:34.940> think

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
their health and vitality and I think

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.200 
their health and vitality and I think
part<00:05:35.630> of<00:05:35.750> that<00:05:35.810> is<00:05:35.960> to<00:05:36.350> also<00:05:36.830> do<00:05:37.100> -<00:05:37.760> coming<00:05:38.060> down

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
part of that is to also do - coming down

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.129

I've<00:07:18.650> also<00:07:18.889> found<00:07:19.250> these<00:07:19.570> cattle<00:07:20.570> panels<00:07:20.990> very

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:21.889 
I've also found these cattle panels very

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:24.670 
I've also found these cattle panels very
effective<00:07:22.700> and<00:07:22.970> I<00:07:23.510> think<00:07:23.930> probably<00:07:24.260> if<00:07:24.500> I<00:07:24.650> had

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 
effective and I think probably if I had

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.010 
effective and I think probably if I had
some<00:07:25.070> post<00:07:25.490> here<00:07:25.880> I<00:07:25.910> could<00:07:26.180> probably<00:07:26.419> lift

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.020 
some post here I could probably lift

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.500 
some post here I could probably lift
this<00:07:27.200> up<00:07:27.380> a<00:07:27.530> little<00:07:27.710> higher<00:07:28.010> with<00:07:28.820> steel<00:07:29.060> posts

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:29.510 
this up a little higher with steel posts

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.409 
this up a little higher with steel posts
but<00:07:29.830> for<00:07:30.830> just<00:07:31.190> down<00:07:31.760> and<00:07:31.970> dirty

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:32.419 
but for just down and dirty

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.529 
but for just down and dirty
this<00:07:33.080> has<00:07:33.320> really<00:07:33.890> worked<00:07:34.039> well<00:07:34.310> for<00:07:34.539> tomato

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:35.539 
this has really worked well for tomato

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:36.790 
this has really worked well for tomato
cages<00:07:35.870> so

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 
cages so

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.869 
cages so
just<00:07:37.520> some<00:07:37.729> some<00:07:38.090> more<00:07:38.599> ideas<00:07:39.379> that<00:07:39.710> I've<00:07:40.159> run

00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:40.879 
just some some more ideas that I've run

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:44.920 
just some some more ideas that I've run
across<00:07:41.060> guys<00:07:41.509> so<00:07:42.379> catch<00:07:43.310> you<00:07:43.340> later<00:07:43.819> later<00:07:44.569> and
