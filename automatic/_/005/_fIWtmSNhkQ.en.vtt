because<00:00:39.160> of<00:00:39.280> this<00:00:39.399> and<00:00:39.670> because<00:00:39.880> it's<00:00:40.060> got<00:00:40.180> one

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
because of this and because it's got one

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.340 
because of this and because it's got one
cable<00:00:40.630> and<00:00:40.780> you<00:00:40.899> don't<00:00:41.020> have<00:00:41.079> to<00:00:41.170> worry<00:00:41.320> about

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
cable and you don't have to worry about

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.889 
cable and you don't have to worry about
power<00:00:41.680> from<00:00:41.950> anything<00:00:42.250> else<00:00:42.399> but<00:00:42.610> USB<00:00:43.180> it<00:00:43.750> has

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
power from anything else but USB it has

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.690 
power from anything else but USB it has
a<00:00:43.930> lot<00:00:44.200> of<00:00:44.230> great<00:00:44.500> implications<00:00:45.160> for<00:00:45.370> not<00:00:45.610> only

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
a lot of great implications for not only

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.340 
a lot of great implications for not only
the<00:00:45.880> home<00:00:46.090> and<00:00:46.360> the<00:00:46.420> car<00:00:46.600> but<00:00:46.899> everywhere<00:00:47.290> else

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
the home and the car but everywhere else

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.860

that has four USB ports you could have

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.210 
that has four USB ports you could have
four<00:01:25.420> separate<00:01:25.900> touch<00:01:26.110> monitors<00:01:26.590> that<00:01:27.010> all

flight simulator so you can have all
your<00:01:33.850> gauges<00:01:34.060> you<00:01:34.510> can<00:01:34.960> almost<00:01:35.140> make<00:01:35.290> your<00:01:35.530> own

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
your gauges you can almost make your own

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.230 
your gauges you can almost make your own
virtual<00:01:36.100> cockpit<00:01:36.369> if<00:01:36.640> you<00:01:36.729> bought<00:01:36.880> enough<00:01:37.119> of

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
put a car computer in there what you had

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.780 
put a car computer in there what you had
before<00:02:00.970> though<00:02:01.329> was<00:02:01.540> one<00:02:01.689> of<00:02:01.780> these<00:02:01.840> 7<00:02:02.200> inch

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
before though was one of these 7 inch

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.190 
before though was one of these 7 inch
monitors<00:02:03.790> that<00:02:04.000> aren't<00:02:04.360> necessarily<00:02:04.750> as

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
monitors that aren't necessarily as

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.109 
monitors that aren't necessarily as
good-looking<00:02:05.470> as<00:02:05.799> this<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.250> they<00:02:06.850> don't<00:02:06.970> have

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
good-looking as this and they don't have

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.109 
good-looking as this and they don't have
a<00:02:07.149> stand<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:08.560> need<00:02:08.799> filtered<00:02:09.489> input<00:02:10.000> in

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
a stand and you need filtered input in

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.339 
a stand and you need filtered input in
order<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.360> power<00:02:10.479> them<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:10.869> it's<00:02:11.049> actually

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
order to power them so it's actually

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.869 
order to power them so it's actually
quite<00:02:11.709> difficult<00:02:11.829> but<00:02:12.280> with<00:02:12.430> something<00:02:12.670> like

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
quite difficult but with something like

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.720 
quite difficult but with something like
this<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.329> becomes<00:02:13.989> really<00:02:14.230> easy<00:02:14.349> and<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.579> can

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
this it becomes really easy and you can

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.489 
this it becomes really easy and you can
use<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:16.029> in<00:02:16.269> so<00:02:16.540> many<00:02:16.569> ways<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.139> extend<00:02:17.379> your

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:17.499 
use it in so many ways to extend your

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:21.209 
use it in so many ways to extend your
desktop<00:02:17.819> thanks<00:02:18.819> for<00:02:18.939> watching
