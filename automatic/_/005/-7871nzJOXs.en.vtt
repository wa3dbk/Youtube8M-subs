00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:29.629 
this is I wouldn't really consider this

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.740 
this is I wouldn't really consider this
traffic<00:05:30.020> with<00:05:30.169> it

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
traffic with it

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.250 
traffic with it
enough<00:05:31.990> for<00:05:32.230> me<00:05:32.320> to<00:05:32.410> not<00:05:32.620> be<00:05:32.650> happy<00:05:33.130> with<00:05:33.160> it

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
enough for me to not be happy with it

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.870 
enough for me to not be happy with it
they're<00:05:34.770> going<00:05:34.950> just<00:05:35.280> over<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.670> speed<00:05:35.850> limit

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
they're going just over the speed limit

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.230 
they're going just over the speed limit
on<00:05:36.210> ago<00:05:36.450> like<00:05:36.600> 70

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.450 

probably<00:05:41.750> going<00:05:41.870> to<00:05:41.960> hit<00:05:42.080> their<00:05:42.199> brakes

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
probably going to hit their brakes

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.640 
probably going to hit their brakes
because<00:05:43.460> that's<00:05:43.669> what<00:05:43.819> cars<00:05:44.270> do

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.980 

the<00:05:48.740> corner<00:05:49.100> yep<00:05:49.340> breaks<00:05:49.699> called<00:05:50.330> it<00:05:50.479> the<00:05:50.870> hit

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
the corner yep breaks called it the hit

00:05:50.990 --> 00:06:00.060 
the corner yep breaks called it the hit
the<00:05:51.080> brakes

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.440 

so<00:06:00.370> basically<00:06:00.790> I'm<00:06:00.940> just<00:06:00.970> getting<00:06:01.300> myself
