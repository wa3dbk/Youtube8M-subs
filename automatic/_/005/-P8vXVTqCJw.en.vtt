mostly<00:00:54.930> information<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:55.530> already<00:00:55.800> know<00:00:55.980> is

only<00:01:02.820> puts<00:01:03.090> emphasis<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> bright<00:01:03.989> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
only puts emphasis on the bright and

only puts emphasis on the bright and
hopeful<00:01:04.439> aspect<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.549> think<00:01:05.729> that's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
hopeful aspect and I think that's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.070 
hopeful aspect and I think that's
definitely<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.390> good<00:01:06.600> thing<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.840> they're

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
definitely a good thing that they're

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.810 
definitely a good thing that they're
going<00:01:07.260> into<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.619> dark<00:01:07.890> hunting<00:01:08.369> side<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.729> it

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
going into that dark hunting side of it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.880 
going into that dark hunting side of it
a<00:01:08.850> bit<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.240> mean<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.750> want<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> world<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.500> Destiny

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
a bit I mean I want the world of Destiny

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.679 
a bit I mean I want the world of Destiny
to<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> sort<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.490> pretty<00:01:11.760> bright<00:01:12.240> hopeful

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
to be a sort of pretty bright hopeful

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.270 
to be a sort of pretty bright hopeful
place<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.140> want<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.409> explore<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.920> protect

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
place that I want to explore and protect

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.890 
place that I want to explore and protect
but<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.030> important<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.600> that

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
but I think it's important to have that

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.170 
but I think it's important to have that
dark<00:01:16.140> dangerous<00:01:16.740> side<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.280> well<00:01:17.310> moving

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
dark dangerous side of it as well moving

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.999 
dark dangerous side of it as well moving
on<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.630> talks<00:01:18.840> about<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.200> various<00:01:19.439> enemies<00:01:19.680> in

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
on it talks about the various enemies in

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.100 
on it talks about the various enemies in
destiny<00:01:20.460> most<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.240> already<00:01:21.600> know<00:01:21.780> but

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
destiny most of this we already know but

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.230 
destiny most of this we already know but
it<00:01:22.229> does<00:01:22.439> mention<00:01:22.710> planet-crushing<00:01:23.670> war

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
it does mention planet-crushing war

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.450 
it does mention planet-crushing war
beasts<00:01:24.780> whether<00:01:25.380> that's<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.710> new<00:01:25.860> enemy<00:01:26.100> or

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
beasts whether that's a new enemy or

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.010 
beasts whether that's a new enemy or
just<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.759> nickname<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.720> currently

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
just a nickname for one of the currently

just a nickname for one of the currently

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
known ones I'm really not sure although

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.460 
known ones I'm really not sure although
I<00:01:29.970> probably<00:01:30.180> lean<00:01:30.600> more<00:01:30.780> towards<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.409> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
I probably lean more towards just a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.649 
I probably lean more towards just a
nickname<00:01:31.680> they<00:01:32.520> also<00:01:32.700> mentioned<00:01:33.150> Charlemagne

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
nickname they also mentioned Charlemagne

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.450 
nickname they also mentioned Charlemagne
again<00:01:33.990> which<00:01:34.200> we've<00:01:34.380> heard<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.650> before<00:01:34.770> but

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
again which we've heard of before but

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.920 
again which we've heard of before but
this<00:01:35.579> time<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.909> says<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.240> Charlemagne<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.900> a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
this time it says that Charlemagne is a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.499 
this time it says that Charlemagne is a
vast<00:01:37.320> machine<00:01:37.680> intelligence<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.150> basically

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
vast machine intelligence so basically

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.289 
vast machine intelligence so basically
an<00:01:39.689> AI<00:01:39.869> which<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.470> don't<00:01:40.530> think<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:40.950> knew<00:01:41.070> before

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
an AI which I don't think we knew before

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.580 
an AI which I don't think we knew before
next<00:01:42.299> up<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> little<00:01:42.930> story<00:01:43.170> we've<00:01:43.380> heard<00:01:43.530> a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
next up is a little story we've heard a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.380 
next up is a little story we've heard a
million<00:01:43.799> times<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.490> one<00:01:44.640> where<00:01:44.790> Jason<00:01:45.180> Jones

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
million times the one where Jason Jones

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.969 
million times the one where Jason Jones
and<00:01:45.689> Joseph<00:01:45.990> Staton<00:01:46.170> go<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> mission<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
and Joseph Staton go on a mission to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.010 
and Joseph Staton go on a mission to
Mars<00:01:47.189> together<00:01:47.549> but<00:01:48.000> somehow<00:01:48.240> every<00:01:48.689> time<00:01:48.840> we

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
Mars together but somehow every time we

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.389 
Mars together but somehow every time we
hear<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.560> new<00:01:49.740> piece<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.340> we

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
hear it we get a new piece of it that we

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.429 
hear it we get a new piece of it that we
didn't<00:01:50.670> previously<00:01:50.909> know<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.540> swear<00:01:52.110> these<00:01:52.229> big

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
media outlets just can't get it right

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.569

anyways<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:54.990> says<00:01:55.229> staton<00:01:55.950> describes<00:01:56.369> how<00:01:56.549> a

backed up by a Centurion it's not

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.480 
backed up by a Centurion it's not
looking<00:02:16.080> good<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.740> second<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.160> wonder

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
looking good and for a second I wonder

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.920 
looking good and for a second I wonder
if<00:02:17.640> we're<00:02:17.820> even<00:02:17.850> going<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.300> live<00:02:18.540> long<00:02:18.780> enough

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
if we're even going to live long enough

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.870 
if we're even going to live long enough
to<00:02:19.080> make<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.410> through<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.620> front<00:02:19.800> door<00:02:20.070> now

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
to make it through the front door now

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.950 
to make it through the front door now
there's<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.120> whole<00:02:21.300> bunch<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.570> stuff<00:02:21.630> in<00:02:21.930> that

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
there's a whole bunch of stuff in that

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.480 
there's a whole bunch of stuff in that
first<00:02:22.260> paragraph<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.860> let's<00:02:23.040> take<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.220> closer

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
first paragraph so let's take a closer

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.670 
first paragraph so let's take a closer
look<00:02:23.610> first<00:02:24.510> they<00:02:24.810> mentioned<00:02:25.200> venturing<00:02:25.560> into

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
look first they mentioned venturing into

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.290 
look first they mentioned venturing into
the<00:02:25.770> ruins<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.310> daytime<00:02:26.670> because<00:02:26.940> there<00:02:27.210> would

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
the ruins in daytime because there would

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.270 
the ruins in daytime because there would
be<00:02:27.330> less<00:02:27.540> cabal<00:02:27.930> than<00:02:28.170> there<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.320> at<00:02:28.410> night<00:02:28.710> so

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
be less cabal than there is at night so

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.710 
be less cabal than there is at night so
that<00:02:29.310> means<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.700> time<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.120> day<00:02:30.270> has<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> much

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
that means that time of day has a much

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.120 
that means that time of day has a much
bigger<00:02:30.900> role<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.200> destiny<00:02:31.770> than<00:02:31.920> just

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
bigger role in destiny than just

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.950 
bigger role in destiny than just
aesthetics<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:33.060> actually<00:02:33.270> affects<00:02:33.540> how

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
aesthetics it actually affects how

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.480 
aesthetics it actually affects how
missions<00:02:34.290> will<00:02:34.410> play<00:02:34.620> out<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:35.040> might<00:02:35.160> make<00:02:35.340> you

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
missions will play out it might make you

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.950 
missions will play out it might make you
want<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.700> be<00:02:35.820> more<00:02:36.000> careful<00:02:36.240> about<00:02:36.600> when<00:02:36.840> you

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
want to be more careful about when you

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.020 
want to be more careful about when you
attempt<00:02:37.290> certain<00:02:37.620> missions<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.610> also<00:02:38.760> makes

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
attempt certain missions it also makes

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.340 
attempt certain missions it also makes
it<00:02:39.150> sound<00:02:39.270> like<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.570> Cabal<00:02:39.840> might<00:02:40.080> be<00:02:40.200> more

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
it sound like the Cabal might be more

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.080 
it sound like the Cabal might be more
nocturnal<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:41.160> not<00:02:41.280> like<00:02:41.460> coming<00:02:41.730> out<00:02:41.820> during

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
nocturnal and not like coming out during

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.300 
nocturnal and not like coming out during
the<00:02:42.210> day<00:02:42.240> now<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.020> big<00:02:43.260> question<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.770> have<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.010> how

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
the day now a big question I have is how

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.260 
the day now a big question I have is how
this<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.550> going<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.820> work<00:02:44.940> on<00:02:45.120> different

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
this is going to work on different

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.240 
this is going to work on different
planets<00:02:45.660> because<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.500> different<00:02:46.800> planets<00:02:47.130> in

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
planets because the different planets in

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.980 
planets because the different planets in
our<00:02:47.310> solar<00:02:47.370> system<00:02:48.000> have<00:02:48.150> vastly<00:02:48.540> different

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
our solar system have vastly different

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.020 
our solar system have vastly different
day-night<00:02:49.350> cycles<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:50.070> imagine<00:02:50.820> we'll<00:02:50.940> have

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
day-night cycles I imagine we'll have

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.640 
day-night cycles I imagine we'll have
some<00:02:51.270> sort<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.570> system<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.110> informs<00:02:52.470> us<00:02:52.590> of

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
some sort of system that informs us of

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.230 
some sort of system that informs us of
the<00:02:52.800> time<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.190> other<00:02:53.340> planets<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.940> helps<00:02:54.120> us

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
the time on other planets and helps us

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.390 
the time on other planets and helps us
calculate<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.810> out<00:02:55.040> second<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.160> says<00:02:56.370> a

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
calculate that out second it says a

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.100 
calculate that out second it says a

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
position with rockets so that means the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.440 
position with rockets so that means the
Cabal<00:03:02.010> have<00:03:02.220> some<00:03:02.430> form<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.730> dropship<00:03:03.210> and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
Cabal have some form of dropship and

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.910 
Cabal have some form of dropship and
that<00:03:03.570> will<00:03:03.690> probably<00:03:04.080> be<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> common<00:03:04.650> form<00:03:04.830> of

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
that will probably be a common form of

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.010 
that will probably be a common form of
transportation<00:03:05.280> for<00:03:05.610> them<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.090> guess<00:03:06.780> then

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
transportation for them I guess then

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.390 
transportation for them I guess then
being<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.320> space-going<00:03:07.560> race<00:03:07.980> means<00:03:08.310> you

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
being a space-going race means you

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.980 
being a space-going race means you
should<00:03:08.580> probably<00:03:08.910> take<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> flying<00:03:09.480> dropship

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
should probably take a flying dropship

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.930 
should probably take a flying dropship
for<00:03:10.020> granted<00:03:10.590> but<00:03:10.950> for<00:03:11.130> some<00:03:11.280> reason<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.670> never

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
for granted but for some reason I never

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.370 
for granted but for some reason I never
would<00:03:12.120> have<00:03:12.150> thought<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.570> Cabal<00:03:12.900> would<00:03:13.140> fly

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
would have thought the Cabal would fly

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.230 
would have thought the Cabal would fly
in<00:03:13.560> with<00:03:13.740> a<00:03:13.770> dropship<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.700> just<00:03:14.910> seems<00:03:15.090> so

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
in with a dropship it just seems so

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.880 
in with a dropship it just seems so
monstrous<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.900> always<00:03:16.140> imagined<00:03:16.560> them<00:03:16.680> staying

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
monstrous I always imagined them staying

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.250 
monstrous I always imagined them staying
on<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.160> ground<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.790> then<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.540> final<00:03:18.690> one<00:03:18.900> it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
on the ground and then the final one it

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.210 
on the ground and then the final one it
says<00:03:19.440> they<00:03:19.590> dropped<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.920> squad<00:03:20.190> of

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
says they dropped a squad of

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.340 
says they dropped a squad of
Legionnaires<00:03:20.850> backed<00:03:21.240> up<00:03:21.450> by<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.660> Centurion

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
Legionnaires backed up by a Centurion

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.110 
Legionnaires backed up by a Centurion
that<00:03:22.860> makes<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.130> sound<00:03:23.190> like<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.550> Centurion

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
that makes it sound like the Centurion

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.700 
that makes it sound like the Centurion
is<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.360> higher-ranked<00:03:24.930> more<00:03:25.110> powerful<00:03:25.560> one

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
is the higher-ranked more powerful one

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.250 
is the higher-ranked more powerful one
of<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.950> two<00:03:26.100> classes<00:03:26.310> we<00:03:26.640> know<00:03:26.820> of<00:03:27.050> anyways<00:03:28.050> on

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
stranger stepped in to save them it says

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.840 
stranger stepped in to save them it says
she<00:03:34.320> showed<00:03:34.560> up<00:03:34.680> out<00:03:34.800> of<00:03:34.830> nowhere<00:03:34.920> carving

she showed up out of nowhere carving

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.120 
she showed up out of nowhere carving
sand<00:03:36.120> on<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.360> stolen<00:03:36.660> Pike<00:03:37.020> strafing<00:03:37.710> Cabal

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
with her dual shock cannons so that

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.870 
with her dual shock cannons so that
sounds<00:03:40.770> like<00:03:40.860> confirmation<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.700> pike

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
sounds like confirmation that the pike

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.790 
sounds like confirmation that the pike
will<00:03:42.150> have<00:03:42.330> guns<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.990> I<00:03:43.200> mean<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.500> already

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
more solid proof going on it says after

more solid proof going on it says after
they<00:03:48.060> made<00:03:48.210> pork<00:03:48.510> chops<00:03:48.540> out<00:03:48.900> of<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:49.110> Cabal

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
and then went separate ways so that

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.770 
and then went separate ways so that
brings<00:03:53.340> up<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.670> common<00:03:53.970> question<00:03:54.390> well

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780

up<00:04:11.310> about<00:04:11.490> the<00:04:11.640> Warlocks<00:04:12.030> powers<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:13.050> says

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
up about the Warlocks powers it says

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.080 
up about the Warlocks powers it says
when<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.740> Warlock<00:04:14.160> uses<00:04:14.550> their<00:04:14.700> magical

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
when the Warlock uses their magical

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.910 
when the Warlock uses their magical
ability<00:04:15.540> it<00:04:15.750> feels<00:04:16.080> like<00:04:16.200> punching<00:04:16.680> someone

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
ability it feels like punching someone

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.130 
ability it feels like punching someone
in<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.130> face<00:04:17.220> with<00:04:17.640> a<00:04:17.670> piece<00:04:17.910> of<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.180> Sun<00:04:18.450> so

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
in the face with a piece of the Sun so

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.240 
in the face with a piece of the Sun so
I'm<00:04:19.230> really<00:04:19.410> not<00:04:19.620> sure<00:04:19.680> what<00:04:19.950> that's<00:04:20.100> supposed

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
I'm really not sure what that's supposed

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.590 
I'm really not sure what that's supposed
to<00:04:20.520> mean<00:04:20.609> but<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.000> certainly<00:04:21.180> sounds

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
to mean but it certainly sounds

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.990 
to mean but it certainly sounds
interesting<00:04:22.020> it<00:04:22.530> then<00:04:22.770> says<00:04:23.040> everyone<00:04:23.580> starts

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
interesting it then says everyone starts

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.790 
interesting it then says everyone starts
as<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.180> human<00:04:24.600> guardian<00:04:24.960> blessed<00:04:25.590> with<00:04:25.770> a

the<00:05:53.960> quotes<00:05:54.229> are<00:05:54.409> accurate<00:05:54.800> but<00:05:55.099> a<00:05:55.130> lot<00:05:55.310> of<00:05:55.340> the

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
the quotes are accurate but a lot of the

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.740 
the quotes are accurate but a lot of the
other<00:05:55.639> stuff<00:05:55.940> is<00:05:56.090> just<00:05:56.240> the<00:05:56.360> way<00:05:56.479> the<00:05:56.599> author

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
other stuff is just the way the author

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.330 
other stuff is just the way the author
perceived<00:05:57.289> it<00:05:57.469> and<00:05:57.620> may<00:05:57.770> not<00:05:57.800> really<00:05:58.159> mean

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
perceived it and may not really mean

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.189 
perceived it and may not really mean
much<00:05:58.599> honestly<00:05:59.599> whether<00:05:59.780> or<00:05:59.960> not<00:06:00.050> it<00:06:00.169> really

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
much honestly whether or not it really

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.020 
much honestly whether or not it really
is<00:06:00.560> an<00:06:00.710> MMO<00:06:01.039> is<00:06:01.190> probably<00:06:01.669> my<00:06:01.849> biggest

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.580 
is an MMO is probably my biggest
question<00:06:02.330> right<00:06:02.750> now<00:06:02.870> and<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:03.110> kind<00:06:03.409> of<00:06:03.440> wish

they'd stop toying with us just tell me

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.969 
they'd stop toying with us just tell me
how<00:06:05.539> many<00:06:05.719> players<00:06:05.960> that<00:06:06.169> supports<00:06:06.469> on<00:06:06.620> screen

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
how many players that supports on screen

e3<00:06:09.400> now<00:06:10.400> one<00:06:10.580> thing<00:06:10.610> I<00:06:10.789> just<00:06:11.030> noticed<00:06:11.330> here<00:06:11.509> is

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659 
e3 now one thing I just noticed here is

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:13.360 
e3 now one thing I just noticed here is
that<00:06:11.780> Eric<00:06:12.080> Hirshberg<00:06:12.289> specifically<00:06:13.099> says

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
that Eric Hirshberg specifically says

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.029 
that Eric Hirshberg specifically says
that<00:06:13.580> it's<00:06:13.699> a<00:06:13.789> box<00:06:14.060> copy<00:06:14.389> console<00:06:15.080> release<00:06:15.440> now

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
that it's a box copy console release now

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.620 
that it's a box copy console release now
that<00:06:16.190> sounds<00:06:16.370> kind<00:06:16.669> of<00:06:16.699> bad<00:06:16.849> for<00:06:16.909> the<00:06:17.210> chances

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
that sounds kind of bad for the chances

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.689 
that sounds kind of bad for the chances
of<00:06:17.659> a<00:06:17.810> PC<00:06:18.199> release<00:06:18.380> which<00:06:18.830> is<00:06:18.979> both<00:06:19.190> sad<00:06:19.669> and

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
of a PC release which is both sad and

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.700 
of a PC release which is both sad and
really<00:06:20.210> really<00:06:20.690> stupid<00:06:20.990> on<00:06:21.259> their<00:06:21.440> part

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
really really stupid on their part

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.350 
really really stupid on their part
there's<00:06:22.159> no<00:06:22.310> valid<00:06:22.639> reason<00:06:22.789> why<00:06:23.090> destiny

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
there's no valid reason why destiny

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.240 
there's no valid reason why destiny
shouldn't<00:06:23.870> come<00:06:24.020> to<00:06:24.050> PC<00:06:24.469> and<00:06:24.710> I<00:06:24.770> hope<00:06:24.979> it's<00:06:25.159> not

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
shouldn't come to PC and I hope it's not

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.950 
shouldn't come to PC and I hope it's not
true<00:06:25.460> we<00:06:25.639> don't<00:06:25.729> know<00:06:25.969> for<00:06:26.150> sure<00:06:26.210> yet<00:06:26.360> but<00:06:26.599> it

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.260 
true we don't know for sure yet but it
