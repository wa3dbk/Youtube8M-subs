oh<00:00:14.100> I<00:00:15.100> think<00:00:15.760> we<00:00:16.209> need<00:00:16.450> to<00:00:16.630> keep<00:00:16.810> in<00:00:17.020> mind<00:00:17.290> is

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
oh I think we need to keep in mind is

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.050 
oh I think we need to keep in mind is
that<00:00:18.640> there<00:00:19.210> is<00:00:19.450> no<00:00:19.619> one<00:00:20.619> thing<00:00:21.369> I'm<00:00:21.700> talking

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
that there is no one thing I'm talking

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.190 
that there is no one thing I'm talking
about<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:23.800> proves<00:00:24.310> anything<00:00:24.730> it's<00:00:25.200> the

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
about that proves anything it's the

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.280 
about that proves anything it's the
preponderance<00:00:26.740> of<00:00:27.160> evidence<00:00:27.630> okay<00:00:28.630> it's

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
preponderance of evidence okay it's

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.170 
preponderance of evidence okay it's
looking<00:00:29.680> at<00:00:30.010> everything<00:00:30.369> if<00:00:30.699> they<00:00:30.850> were<00:00:31.000> just

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
looking at everything if they were just

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.439 
looking at everything if they were just
one<00:00:31.539> footprint<00:00:32.140> if<00:00:32.410> there<00:00:32.650> were<00:00:32.800> just<00:00:32.830> one

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
one footprint if there were just one

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.170 
one footprint if there were just one
example<00:00:34.449> of<00:00:35.199> anything<00:00:35.770> i'm<00:00:35.890> giving<00:00:36.280> you<00:00:36.309> then

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
example of anything i'm giving you then

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.939 
example of anything i'm giving you then
you<00:00:37.390> can<00:00:37.570> say<00:00:37.750> well<00:00:37.989> that's<00:00:38.290> kind<00:00:38.559> of<00:00:38.620> stretch

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
you can say well that's kind of stretch

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.310 
you can say well that's kind of stretch
there<00:00:39.250> or<00:00:39.430> maybe<00:00:39.640> it<00:00:40.300> was<00:00:40.420> fake<00:00:40.809> or<00:00:41.050> whatever

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
there or maybe it was fake or whatever

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.920 
there or maybe it was fake or whatever
but<00:00:41.530> there<00:00:42.100> are<00:00:42.220> so<00:00:42.580> many<00:00:42.970> of<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.420> things<00:00:43.629> i'm

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
but there are so many of the things i'm

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.200 
but there are so many of the things i'm
showing<00:00:44.290> me<00:00:44.559> and<00:00:44.800> I<00:00:45.430> again<00:00:46.000> just<00:00:46.449> touching<00:00:46.720> the

something and she goes that's
interesting<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.750> piece<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.890> clock

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
interesting this is a piece of a clock

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.240 
interesting this is a piece of a clock
and<00:01:11.729> clock<00:01:12.390> parts<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:14.270> solid<00:01:15.270> stone<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.440> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
and clock parts in solid stone and the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.120 
and clock parts in solid stone and the
stone<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.790> created<00:01:18.240> around<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.720> clock<00:01:19.130> well

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
stone that created around the clock well

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.100 
stone that created around the clock well
now<00:01:20.280> what<00:01:20.670> are<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.820> seeing<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.659> look<00:01:21.930> at

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
now what are you seeing you can look at

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.230 
now what are you seeing you can look at
the<00:01:22.259> stone<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:22.979> knock<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.190> off<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.909> you

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the stone you can knock it off and you

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.540 
the stone you can knock it off and you
can<00:01:24.450> see<00:01:24.690> that<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.289> clock<00:01:25.649> part<00:01:26.039> came<00:01:26.340> from

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
can see that this clock part came from

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.260 
can see that this clock part came from
someplace<00:01:26.850> around<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.810> think<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:28.619> some

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
someplace around I think there was some

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.120 
someplace around I think there was some
here<00:01:30.270> Tacoma<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> matter<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.860> fact

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
here Tacoma it's a matter of fact

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.340 
here Tacoma it's a matter of fact
somebody<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.030> manufactured<00:01:33.960> these<00:01:34.110> with

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
somebody that manufactured these with

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.230 
somebody that manufactured these with
the<00:01:34.500> grandfather<00:01:35.039> type<00:01:35.280> clocks<00:01:35.610> yourself<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the grandfather type clocks yourself and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.960 
the grandfather type clocks yourself and
here<00:01:36.899> there's<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.319> but<00:01:38.250> you've<00:01:38.429> got<00:01:38.640> stolen

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
here there's this but you've got stolen

Peter omnia the illusionist says that it

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.660 
Peter omnia the illusionist says that it

doorsteps<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.539> environment<00:02:10.259> but<00:02:10.800> you're<00:02:11.069> just

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
doorsteps of environment but you're just

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.690 
doorsteps of environment but you're just
for<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.260> fact<00:02:12.500> we<00:02:12.709> know<00:02:12.920> this<00:02:13.190> is<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.430> lot<00:02:13.670> of

talk peace but if you didn't know that

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.880 
talk peace but if you didn't know that

you would think that this was something

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.240 
you would think that this was something
