00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 Mr. Lee Lewis today I show you 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.030
 These wonderful knot bracelets 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.500
 I think they are great for many 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.200
 other bracelets I mean in my 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.880
 have already done and are 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.320
 really fast and above all 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.930
 things were also very easy 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.920
 yes and if you are interested in this 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.199
 it can stay in it 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.720
 he first heads the usa once needed 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.779
 Of course you bender there you can 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.200
 so thin year cotton bender take on 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:38.280
 best grown or eg the DhÃ¼nn 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.770
 variants of leather straps then needs 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.200
 her a scissors and again 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.390
 superglue 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.559
 and that's it first of all 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.199
 I'll explain the technique to you now 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.610
 I have two ropes here 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.780
 taken to explain this to you 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:02.489
 So it needs two different or two 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:07.860
 parts of ropes or bands after 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.689
 the Irish so sleep puts in the left 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.780
 Sleep is over in the upper part 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:19.110
 the lower one over it that way 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.610
 Crossed is, so to speak, and the right one 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.060
 is the same way so the ends 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.680
 then and take the end and put it 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.270
 so over the bend we see that you 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.270
 may have to lie afterwards too 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.229
 then you take the end it is 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:46.829
 under the upper part of the first 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:46.829
 loop and over the bottom 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.200
 and then you take the end again 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.790
 and takes it under the lower part of the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:05.410
 Auges the loop so to speak about the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:08.550
 bend the right one yourself and again 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.420
 under the left bend 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.250
 that looks a bit like 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.400
 such a crooked pretzel 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.020
 that's natural with too thick bender 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.700
 not so nice but with thinner looks 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.140
 the better and who of you 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.130
 sails will perhaps know 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.410
 we that is a sailor's knot then 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.740
 Do you take the band you use 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:40.830
 wanted and of it you cut then 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:46.660
 about 65 to 70 cm too and the whole 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:49.090
 make her four times she has 4 70 afterwards 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.000
 cm long strings and it takes the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.380
 always two in pairs and together 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.530
 then put them over each other again 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.220
 that she then strands four 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.070
 next to each other you have this here 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.390
 that can really be seen in the 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.370
 Of course, you guys can always 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.900
 take less 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.280
 depending on I link again 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.390
 everything in the infobox so you know 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:14.400
 which bender I've used exactly 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.950
 then it is both in so loops back 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.880
 just so you can work well 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.709
 and it 's so natural a bit 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.940
 more difficult because that is a colored her 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.610
 Of course you can also use two colors 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.610
 use is also very nice 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.110
 so and now we will start with 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.310
 the right loop through the left 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.350
 to be missed 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.570
 But to make it easier you can 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.210
 the left just with so adhesive film 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.050
 stick firmly 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:45.580
 then not everything moves back and forth 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.810
 yes and now you will find it just like you 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.050
 that has just been seen in technology 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.050
 have the two loops together 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:06.400
 just so that again a pretzel 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.690
 knot is created here you can do it now 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.580
 already see the optics is of course a lot 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.860
 more beautiful with too many thin little ones 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.090
 countries 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.650
 they are now all side by side 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.600
 that a bit frieze work 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.310
 But the result is really worth it 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.410
 So make sure that the ribbons 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.520
 all are neatly next to each other and 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.190
 also in the rounding of all things 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:28.480
 do not knot and then you pull 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:35.320
 the knot together that they end up 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:36.460
 then as all meet solve that and then 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.200
 of course, there is still a need for a closure 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.190
 ran 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.720
 I'll put it that way once 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.760
 Innkreis made that again with this 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:50.800
 then we firmly take about 40 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.960
 centimeter tape again and made 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.010
 so that its cross knot closes the 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.480
 do you already know from my knot 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.810
 bracelet you can also do that 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.810
 check 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.170
 it's just like that 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.530
 cross over the rest over 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:11.590
 always knotted on the side where the 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.950
 Knot is laying her the bend looks 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:18.750
 once back through and through 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.750
 the bend out front again 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.369
 and you always do it like that 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:25.749
 I prefer to take four knots 

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:27.189
 I just think that holds best 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:29.909
 is you have to try himself as 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:29.909
 he wanted to do a lot 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.199
 then seconds glue on it or too 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.180
 other types of glue 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.169
 depending on what else I used to 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.500
 Of course, make sure that they are the 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:50.449
 tapes inside not stuck with it 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:51.740
 Of course the rest will be cut off 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.400
 solve this again if you do that then 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.169
 had made 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.289
 cover once to watch the 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.389
 long served and then there 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:02.150
 where they have to end up knot in 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.259
 or if you have big volumes 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.000
 like me, these were really pretty 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.819
 thick you can also easy the bands 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.590
 glue together at the ends 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:10.699
 they will not slip through because then 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.460
 Just put this glue on it 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.629
 to hang out 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.729
 the need to try out their order is still 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:18.319
 look what she was that kind of 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.270
 Arman of course offers it too 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:22.009
 to make such a velcro 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.490
 simple metal clasp to stick to it 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:27.169
 and then close it but for nickel 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.960
 allergy or so of course that 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:32.779
 better variant yes it looks like that then 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.289
 circuit and here you see the 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:37.520
 close again and you can do that 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.650
 of course with crowns like me 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.940
 that made it here has one 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.180
 a bit thicker but I think so too 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.180
 in order 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.940
 These are the two finished products 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.140
 Variations a little bit autumnal in color 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.720
 and that 's it again 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.180
 I hope you like these bracelets 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.190
 fallen and that you are yours 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.600
 You can combine it well with others 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.520
 bands on a lot of colors too 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.690
 small fine and with that you can do that 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.220
 Doing really well is very possible 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.130
 fast and I like it very much 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.930
 said to combine and if you are now 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.640
 Lust have got even more to yourself 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.400
