to attack the pregnant mother unless

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.330 
to attack the pregnant mother unless
see<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:24.490> then<00:04:24.610> no<00:04:24.850> they<00:04:25.120> can't<00:04:25.890> it<00:04:26.890> can't<00:04:27.100> be

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
see and then no they can't it can't be

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.300 
see and then no they can't it can't be
reconned<00:04:27.880> skate<00:04:28.240> because<00:04:28.560> I'm<00:04:29.560> guessing<00:04:30.220> they

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
reconned skate because I'm guessing they

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.760 
reconned skate because I'm guessing they
didn't<00:04:30.580> have<00:04:30.670> sex<00:04:30.940> yet<00:04:31.240> so<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:32.290> does<00:04:32.560> that

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
didn't have sex yet so that does that

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.890 
didn't have sex yet so that does that
other<00:04:32.950> windows<00:04:33.340> so<00:04:33.460> it's<00:04:33.610> something<00:04:33.720> kind<00:04:34.720> of

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
other windows so it's something kind of

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.590 
other windows so it's something kind of
entirely<00:04:35.440> different<00:04:35.970> but<00:04:36.970> still<00:04:37.180> i'm

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
entirely different but still i'm

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.060 
entirely different but still i'm
guessing<00:04:37.930> along<00:04:38.170> the<00:04:38.320> same<00:04:38.500> lines<00:04:38.530> is

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
guessing along the same lines is

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.190 
guessing along the same lines is
fullbring<00:04:39.580> i'm<00:04:39.850> just<00:04:40.420> not<00:04:40.570> explicitly

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
fullbring i'm just not explicitly

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.290 
fullbring i'm just not explicitly
fullbring<00:04:41.680> with<00:04:41.950> her<00:04:42.370> being<00:04:42.640> at<00:04:42.910> you<00:04:43.180> know

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
fullbring with her being at you know

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.170 
fullbring with her being at you know
bitten<00:04:43.720> by<00:04:43.900> this<00:04:44.140> hollow<00:04:44.940> she's<00:04:45.940> going<00:04:46.120> to

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
bitten by this hollow she's going to

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.890 
bitten by this hollow she's going to
have<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.570> residue<00:04:47.460> or<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.700> residual<00:04:49.240> hollow

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
have the residue or the residual hollow

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.110 
have the residue or the residual hollow
energy<00:04:50.470> within<00:04:50.920> their<00:04:51.160> like<00:04:51.370> fullbring<00:04:51.880> and

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
energy within their like fullbring and

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.730 
energy within their like fullbring and
then<00:04:52.240> i'm<00:04:52.360> guessing<00:04:52.750> her<00:04:52.870> ischemic<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:53.530> hook

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
then i'm guessing her ischemic and hook

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.860 
then i'm guessing her ischemic and hook
up<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:54.310> that<00:04:54.550> is<00:04:54.760> how<00:04:54.970> ichigo's<00:04:55.390> going<00:04:55.600> to<00:04:55.750> be

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
up and that is how ichigo's going to be

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.730 
up and that is how ichigo's going to be
born<00:04:56.110> so<00:04:56.970> maybe<00:04:57.970> it's<00:04:58.210> like<00:04:58.390> a<00:04:58.450> weird<00:04:59.200> kind<00:04:59.560> of

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
born so maybe it's like a weird kind of

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.330 
born so maybe it's like a weird kind of
quality<00:05:00.130> mix<00:05:00.370> of<00:05:00.580> all<00:05:00.940> these<00:05:01.600> different

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
quality mix of all these different

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.920 
quality mix of all these different
rituals<00:05:03.340> to<00:05:03.790> make<00:05:03.970> a<00:05:04.000> baby<00:05:04.300> with<00:05:04.450> these

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
rituals to make a baby with these

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.570 
rituals to make a baby with these
different<00:05:05.350> bloodlines<00:05:06.010> and<00:05:06.250> things<00:05:06.400> like

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
different bloodlines and things like

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.550 
different bloodlines and things like
that<00:05:06.640> but<00:05:07.080> that<00:05:08.080> is<00:05:08.260> pretty<00:05:08.500> much<00:05:08.800> the

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
that but that is pretty much the

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.590 
that but that is pretty much the
defining<00:05:11.560> moments<00:05:12.160> that<00:05:12.400> be<00:05:12.880> so<00:05:13.060> z<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.330> go<00:05:13.450> with

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
defining moments that be so z to go with

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.670 
defining moments that be so z to go with
these<00:05:13.720> all<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:13.930> time<00:05:13.960> so<00:05:14.260> that's<00:05:14.410> pretty<00:05:14.590> cool

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
these all the time so that's pretty cool

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.160 
these all the time so that's pretty cool
and<00:05:15.670> it<00:05:15.820> is<00:05:15.970> because<00:05:17.520> we<00:05:18.520> didn't<00:05:18.790> really<00:05:18.940> see

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
and it is because we didn't really see

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.400 
and it is because we didn't really see
the<00:05:20.170> full<00:05:20.470> bring<00:05:21.210> an<00:05:22.210> execution<00:05:23.200> didn't

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
the full bring an execution didn't

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.470 
the full bring an execution didn't
really<00:05:23.590> have<00:05:23.770> any<00:05:24.400> kind<00:05:24.730> of<00:05:24.910> hollow<00:05:25.150> based

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
really have any kind of hollow based

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.710 
really have any kind of hollow based
powers<00:05:26.310> they<00:05:27.310> just<00:05:27.550> had<00:05:27.700> kind<00:05:27.970> of<00:05:28.150> powers

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
powers they just had kind of powers

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.470 
powers they just had kind of powers
whereas<00:05:30.180> i'm<00:05:31.180> guessing<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:31.930> fact<00:05:32.230> that

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
whereas i'm guessing the fact that

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.360 
whereas i'm guessing the fact that
ginkgo<00:05:36.270> went<00:05:37.270> all<00:05:37.420> hollow<00:05:37.750> bankai<00:05:38.320> is

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
ginkgo went all hollow bankai is

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.760 
ginkgo went all hollow bankai is
probably<00:05:39.370> because<00:05:39.610> of<00:05:40.230> i'm<00:05:41.230> not<00:05:41.440> going<00:05:41.590> to<00:05:41.620> get

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
probably because of i'm not going to get

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.200 
probably because of i'm not going to get
into<00:05:41.920> all<00:05:42.070> that<00:05:42.190> that's<00:05:42.610> a<00:05:42.730> whole<00:05:42.880> different

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
into all that that's a whole different

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.730 
into all that that's a whole different
video<00:05:43.570> this<00:05:43.840> is<00:05:43.960> supposed<00:05:44.200> to<00:05:44.230> be<00:05:44.470> on<00:05:44.620> this

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
video this is supposed to be on this

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.710 
video this is supposed to be on this
chapter<00:05:45.100> but<00:05:45.280> that's<00:05:45.850> the<00:05:46.060> moment<00:05:46.390> that's

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
chapter but that's the moment that's

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.820 
chapter but that's the moment that's
going<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.020> give<00:05:47.110> me<00:05:47.200> cheer<00:05:47.380> the<00:05:47.500> hollow<00:05:47.620> power

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
going to give me cheer the hollow power

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.560 
going to give me cheer the hollow power
so<00:05:48.040> that<00:05:48.070> was<00:05:48.280> cool<00:05:48.510> other<00:05:49.510> than<00:05:49.810> that<00:05:51.570> can't

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
so that was cool other than that can't

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.880 
so that was cool other than that can't
really<00:05:52.720> say<00:05:52.960> anything<00:05:52.990> else<00:05:53.410> about<00:05:53.590> the

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
really say anything else about the

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.150 
really say anything else about the
chapter<00:05:54.900> moving<00:05:55.900> on<00:05:56.020> to<00:05:56.140> the<00:05:56.170> bad<00:05:56.410> nothing

really bad typical battle chapter bell

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.670 
really bad typical battle chapter bell
chapters<00:06:00.280> go<00:06:00.400> like<00:06:00.580> that<00:06:01.080> even<00:06:02.080> still<00:06:02.320> it<00:06:02.590> was

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
chapters go like that even still it was

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.830
