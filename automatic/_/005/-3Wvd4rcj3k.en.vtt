Punisher<00:00:15.740> or<00:00:15.949> figure<00:00:16.309> I<00:00:16.460> believe<00:00:16.670> this<00:00:16.789> is<00:00:16.850> the

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
Punisher or figure I believe this is the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.060 
Punisher or figure I believe this is the
very<00:00:17.300> first<00:00:17.510> Punisher<00:00:17.960> that<00:00:18.140> ever<00:00:18.380> came<00:00:18.860> out

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
very first Punisher that ever came out

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.410 
very first Punisher that ever came out
in<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:19.340> Marvel<00:00:19.640> Legends<00:00:19.940> line<00:00:20.090> he's<00:00:20.270> one<00:00:20.390> of

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
in the Marvel Legends line he's one of

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.180 
in the Marvel Legends line he's one of
the<00:00:20.570> very<00:00:20.600> early<00:00:21.109> figures<00:00:21.320> so<00:00:21.619> he<00:00:21.710> has<00:00:21.920> some

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
the very early figures so he has some

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.509 
the very early figures so he has some
kind<00:00:22.400> of<00:00:22.520> unique<00:00:23.050> features<00:00:24.050> I<00:00:24.349> think<00:00:24.830> this<00:00:25.339> is

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
kind of unique features I think this is

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.460 
kind of unique features I think this is
my<00:00:25.699> favorite<00:00:26.179> Marvel<00:00:26.509> Legends<00:00:26.960> Punisher

my favorite Marvel Legends Punisher

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.679 
my favorite Marvel Legends Punisher
despite<00:00:28.220> some<00:00:28.460> of<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:28.609> weirdness<00:00:28.999> like<00:00:29.150> these

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
despite some of the weirdness like these

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.630 
despite some of the weirdness like these
strange<00:00:30.410> wrists<00:00:30.980> that<00:00:31.480> are<00:00:32.829> oddly<00:00:33.829> shaped<00:00:34.310> and

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
strange wrists that are oddly shaped and

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.970 
strange wrists that are oddly shaped and
oddly<00:00:34.730> sculpted<00:00:35.329> and<00:00:35.480> hinged<00:00:35.840> I<00:00:36.050> still<00:00:36.800> think

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
oddly sculpted and hinged I still think

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.010

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
is mostly the same figure except he

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.900 
is mostly the same figure except he
comes<00:00:44.300> with<00:00:44.480> a<00:00:44.510> cloth<00:00:44.870> coat<00:00:45.580> the<00:00:46.580> head<00:00:46.760> is

white and then same thing for the boots

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.910 
white and then same thing for the boots
there's<00:01:11.479> nice<00:01:11.689> paint<00:01:11.990> work<00:01:12.140> on<00:01:12.350> those<00:01:12.560> silver

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
there's nice paint work on those silver

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.489 
there's nice paint work on those silver
buckles<00:01:13.429> but<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.390> boots<00:01:14.689> are<00:01:14.990> gloss<00:01:15.289> black

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499 
buckles but the boots are gloss black

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:17.200 
buckles but the boots are gloss black
instead<00:01:16.009> of<00:01:16.130> white<00:01:16.399> so<00:01:16.609> that's<00:01:16.789> kind<00:01:17.030> of<00:01:17.119> a

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
instead of white so that's kind of a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.599 
instead of white so that's kind of a
cool<00:01:17.359> feature<00:01:17.740> pretty<00:01:18.740> much<00:01:18.920> otherwise<00:01:19.219> the

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
cool feature pretty much otherwise the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.870 
cool feature pretty much otherwise the
same<00:01:19.909> I<00:01:20.560> think<00:01:21.560> this<00:01:21.770> guy<00:01:21.950> came<00:01:22.219> with<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.399> rocket

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
same I think this guy came with a rocket

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.179 
same I think this guy came with a rocket
launcher<00:01:22.909> or<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.450> bazooka<00:01:23.869> this<00:01:24.649> might<00:01:24.890> have

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
launcher or a bazooka this might have

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.039 
launcher or a bazooka this might have
just<00:01:25.399> been<00:01:25.609> with<00:01:25.789> the<00:01:25.909> Thomas<00:01:26.240> Jane<00:01:26.569> figure

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
just been with the Thomas Jane figure

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.899 
just been with the Thomas Jane figure
though<00:01:27.259> I<00:01:27.289> don't<00:01:27.530> remember<00:01:27.850> I've<00:01:28.850> had

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
though I don't remember I've had

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.609 
though I don't remember I've had
different<00:01:29.600> ones<00:01:29.689> throughout<00:01:30.109> the<00:01:30.259> years<00:01:30.439> and

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
different ones throughout the years and

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.830 
different ones throughout the years and
sometimes<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.670> accessories<00:01:32.179> get<00:01:32.420> kind<00:01:32.719> of

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
sometimes the accessories get kind of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.559 
sometimes the accessories get kind of
lost<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:34.249> swapped<00:01:34.670> out<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:35.090> stuff<00:01:35.299> but<00:01:35.509> it

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
lost and swapped out and stuff but it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:36.730 
lost and swapped out and stuff but it
looks<00:01:35.749> kind<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.020> cool<00:01:36.170> it's<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.439> little

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
looks kind of cool it's a little

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.069 
looks kind of cool it's a little
cartoonish<00:01:37.340> but<00:01:37.490> still<00:01:37.759> fairly<00:01:38.659> realistic

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
cartoonish but still fairly realistic

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.590 
cartoonish but still fairly realistic
and<00:01:39.439> I<00:01:39.530> like<00:01:39.679> the<00:01:39.859> way<00:01:39.979> it's<00:01:40.189> done<00:01:40.939> it's<00:01:41.539> a

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
and I like the way it's done it's a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.999 
and I like the way it's done it's a
little<00:01:41.840> sloppy<00:01:42.049> but<00:01:42.409> still<00:01:42.649> has<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:42.829> nice

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
little sloppy but still has a nice

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.950 
little sloppy but still has a nice
appeal<00:01:43.429> to<00:01:43.609> it<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:44.179> that's<00:01:44.329> the<00:01:44.539> one<00:01:44.689> from<00:01:44.840> the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
appeal to it so that's the one from the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.510 
appeal to it so that's the one from the
box<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:45.469> we're<00:01:45.770> gonna<00:01:45.859> look<00:01:46.009> at<00:01:46.189> this<00:01:46.310> one

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
box that we're gonna look at this one

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.149 
box that we're gonna look at this one
though<00:01:46.729> this<00:01:47.299> guy<00:01:47.509> came<00:01:47.569> with<00:01:48.139> a<00:01:48.439> gun<00:01:48.679> like

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
though this guy came with a gun like

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.849 
though this guy came with a gun like
this<00:01:49.460> or<00:01:49.729> this<00:01:50.539> one<00:01:50.749> in<00:01:50.959> particular<00:01:51.439> I'm<00:01:51.590> not<00:01:51.829> a

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
this or this one in particular I'm not a

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.399 
this or this one in particular I'm not a
hundred<00:01:52.130> percent<00:01:52.280> sure<00:01:52.819> I<00:01:53.060> know<00:01:53.719> it<00:01:54.079> was<00:01:54.259> this

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
hundred percent sure I know it was this

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.020 
hundred percent sure I know it was this
sort<00:01:54.709> of<00:01:54.859> gun<00:01:55.039> and<00:01:55.159> I<00:01:55.219> think<00:01:55.459> it<00:01:55.549> was<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:55.819> one

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
sort of gun and I think it was this one

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.910 
sort of gun and I think it was this one
but<00:01:56.299> I'm<00:01:56.420> not<00:01:56.450> positive<00:01:56.810> anymore<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.619> think

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
but I'm not positive anymore and I think

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.260 
but I'm not positive anymore and I think
he<00:01:58.039> came<00:01:58.219> with<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.369> pistol<00:01:58.789> but<00:01:58.819> I<00:01:58.939> couldn't

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
he came with a pistol but I couldn't

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.879 
he came with a pistol but I couldn't
find<00:01:59.420> it

00:01:59.879 --> 00:01:59.889 
find it

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:02.980 
find it

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.800 
sorry this face I do prefer this one
over<00:02:03.499> the<00:02:03.859> other<00:02:04.039> one<00:02:04.310> it's<00:02:05.209> just<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.539> little

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
over the other one it's just a little

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.260 
over the other one it's just a little
less<00:02:06.020> cartoonish<00:02:06.740> still<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.700> little<00:02:07.880> bit<00:02:08.090> but

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
less cartoonish still a little bit but

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.910 
less cartoonish still a little bit but
has<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.420> nice<00:02:08.660> look<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.080> as<00:02:09.560> far<00:02:09.649> as<00:02:09.770> the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
has a nice look to it as far as the

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.370 
has a nice look to it as far as the
articulation<00:02:10.610> goes<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.569> head<00:02:11.750> can<00:02:11.959> lean<00:02:12.170> from

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
articulation goes the head can lean from

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.690 
articulation goes the head can lean from
side<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.620> side<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.220> can<00:02:13.310> give<00:02:13.430> them<00:02:13.490> some

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
side to side so you can give them some

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.070 
side to side so you can give them some
attitude<00:02:14.150> when<00:02:14.420> you're<00:02:14.540> posing<00:02:14.720> him<00:02:14.930> so

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
attitude when you're posing him so

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.729 
attitude when you're posing him so
that's<00:02:15.200> cool

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
that's cool

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.009 
that's cool
the<00:02:15.860> full<00:02:16.069> swivel<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.519> course<00:02:16.790> doesn't<00:02:17.780> look

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
the full swivel of course doesn't look

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.839 
the full swivel of course doesn't look
up<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.349> down<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.560> whole<00:02:18.920> lot<00:02:19.189> just<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.580> little

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
up and down a whole lot just a little

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:20.440 
up and down a whole lot just a little
bit

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
bit

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.199 
bit
enough<00:02:21.220> but<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.310> could<00:02:22.520> be<00:02:22.670> better<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:23.030> think

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
enough but it could be better I think

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.259 
enough but it could be better I think
that<00:02:23.629> neck<00:02:23.870> rotates<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.709> does<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.150> see<00:02:26.150> how<00:02:26.209> the

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
that neck rotates to does it see how the

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.000 
that neck rotates to does it see how the
neck<00:02:26.510> is<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.690> separate<00:02:27.080> piece<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.500> think

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
neck is a separate piece I think

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.850 
neck is a separate piece I think
yeah<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.120> neck<00:02:29.269> actually<00:02:29.480> rotates<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:30.650> that's

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
yeah the neck actually rotates so that's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.410 
yeah the neck actually rotates so that's
gonna<00:02:30.980> make<00:02:31.069> posing<00:02:31.700> him<00:02:31.879> a<00:02:31.910> little<00:02:32.269> more

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
gonna make posing him a little more

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.180 
gonna make posing him a little more
natural<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:33.349> that's<00:02:33.680> really<00:02:33.890> cool<00:02:34.160> I

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
natural so that's really cool I

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.800 
natural so that's really cool I
appreciate<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.300> way<00:02:35.390> doesn't<00:02:35.569> look

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
appreciate that that way doesn't look

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.300 
appreciate that that way doesn't look
like<00:02:35.959> his<00:02:36.110> head's<00:02:36.349> turning<00:02:36.739> on<00:02:36.830> top<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.220> the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
like his head's turning on top of the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.470 
like his head's turning on top of the
neck<00:02:37.489> only<00:02:38.050> that's<00:02:39.050> I<00:02:39.319> like<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.830> lot

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
neck only that's I like that a lot

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.110 
neck only that's I like that a lot
shoulders<00:02:41.480> are<00:02:41.510> standard<00:02:42.019> ball<00:02:42.230> hinge<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:43.550> no

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
shoulders are standard ball hinge so no

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.089 
shoulders are standard ball hinge so no
big<00:02:44.330> deal<00:02:44.540> there<00:02:44.810> let's<00:02:45.290> turn<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.709> around<00:02:45.860> to

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
big deal there let's turn that around to

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.580 
big deal there let's turn that around to
the<00:02:46.250> way<00:02:46.340> it's<00:02:46.459> supposed<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.849> be<00:02:47.110> bicep<00:02:48.110> swivel

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
the way it's supposed to be bicep swivel

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.289 
the way it's supposed to be bicep swivel
double<00:02:49.250> jointed<00:02:49.489> elbow<00:02:49.790> doesn't<00:02:50.000> give<00:02:50.209> you

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
double jointed elbow doesn't give you

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.699 
double jointed elbow doesn't give you
the<00:02:50.420> greatest<00:02:50.599> range<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:51.019> motion<00:02:51.319> like<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.530> said

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
the greatest range of motion like I said

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.830 
the greatest range of motion like I said
this<00:02:51.860> is<00:02:51.980> an<00:02:52.099> early<00:02:52.400> figure<00:02:52.730> not<00:02:53.269> bad<00:02:53.599> though

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
this is an early figure not bad though

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.320 
this is an early figure not bad though
we<00:02:54.530> have<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.680> wrist<00:02:54.950> swivel<00:02:55.400> there<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.120> wrist

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
we have a wrist swivel there and a wrist

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.420 
we have a wrist swivel there and a wrist
hinge<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:57.470> it's<00:02:57.650> just<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.920> little<00:02:58.099> awkward

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
hinge and it's just a little awkward

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.430 
hinge and it's just a little awkward
it's<00:02:59.360> not<00:02:59.480> horrible<00:02:59.900> especially<00:03:00.049> once<00:03:00.380> you

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
it's not horrible especially once you

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.680 
it's not horrible especially once you
get<00:03:00.560> imposed<00:03:00.950> but<00:03:01.549> it's<00:03:01.700> not<00:03:01.849> great<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:02.239> we<00:03:02.540> do

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
get imposed but it's not great and we do

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.900 
get imposed but it's not great and we do
have<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:02.930> finger<00:03:03.380> hinge<00:03:03.650> also<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:04.459> if<00:03:04.549> you<00:03:04.640> want

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
have a finger hinge also so if you want

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.059 
have a finger hinge also so if you want
to<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:06.200> can<00:03:06.349> have<00:03:06.530> him<00:03:06.620> hold<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:06.860> gun<00:03:07.040> in

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
to you can have him hold the gun in

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.250 
to you can have him hold the gun in
either<00:03:07.310> hand<00:03:07.610> or<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.540> can<00:03:08.690> have<00:03:08.870> him<00:03:09.019> hold<00:03:09.200> the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
either hand or you can have him hold the

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.339 
either hand or you can have him hold the
gun<00:03:09.349> in<00:03:09.709> both<00:03:10.190> hands<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:11.720> it's<00:03:11.989> gonna<00:03:12.170> look

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
gun in both hands and it's gonna look

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.229 
gun in both hands and it's gonna look
pretty<00:03:12.560> good<00:03:12.920> they<00:03:13.099> did<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.310> decent<00:03:13.610> job<00:03:13.880> with

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
pretty good they did a decent job with

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.089 
pretty good they did a decent job with
this<00:03:14.360> figure<00:03:14.690> I<00:03:14.720> think<00:03:15.140> definitely<00:03:15.440> for<00:03:15.860> being

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
this figure I think definitely for being

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.030 
this figure I think definitely for being
so<00:03:16.280> early<00:03:16.810> very<00:03:17.810> nice<00:03:18.079> sculpt<00:03:18.590> work<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:18.980> it

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
so early very nice sculpt work and it

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.339 
so early very nice sculpt work and it
looks<00:03:19.220> good<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:20.690> logo<00:03:21.019> is<00:03:21.049> actually

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
looks good that logo is actually

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.839 
looks good that logo is actually
sculpted<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.370> they<00:03:22.459> have<00:03:22.640> some<00:03:22.819> really

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
sculpted in and they have some really

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
definitely not great it ends up with

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.770 
definitely not great it ends up with
kind<00:03:38.780> of<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.930> big<00:03:39.109> weird<00:03:39.980> gaping<00:03:40.639> hole<00:03:40.880> once
