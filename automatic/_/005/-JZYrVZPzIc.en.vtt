00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.410 
could have just done that oh well that
was<00:02:50.270> that<00:02:50.960> bad<00:02:51.560> considering<00:02:52.400> it's<00:02:52.820> basically

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
was that bad considering it's basically

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.470 
was that bad considering it's basically
