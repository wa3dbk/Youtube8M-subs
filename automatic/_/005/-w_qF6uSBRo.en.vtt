what<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.980> math<00:00:38.219> right<00:00:38.550> here<00:00:38.760> that's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
what is this math right here that's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.670 
what is this math right here that's
about<00:00:41.270> 656<00:00:42.270> attack<00:00:42.899> without<00:00:43.440> setup<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:45.559> in<00:00:46.559> a

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
that around too so yeah ice punch is

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.060 
that around too so yeah ice punch is
great<00:05:58.520> this<00:05:59.240> set<00:05:59.539> cannot<00:06:00.020> touch<00:06:00.380> aigis<00:06:00.830> lash

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
great this set cannot touch aigis lash

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.580 
great this set cannot touch aigis lash
that<00:06:01.340> really<00:06:01.760> cannot<00:06:02.150> agus<00:06:02.630> lash<00:06:02.840> resists<00:06:03.470> or

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
that really cannot agus lash resists or

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.830 
that really cannot agus lash resists or
is<00:06:03.710> immune<00:06:04.070> to<00:06:04.250> all<00:06:04.490> the<00:06:04.729> moves<00:06:04.970> on<00:06:05.270> this<00:06:05.510> set

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
is immune to all the moves on this set

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.420 
is immune to all the moves on this set
so<00:06:06.680> you<00:06:07.310> could<00:06:07.849> in<00:06:08.150> theory<00:06:08.990> run<00:06:09.740> fire<00:06:10.099> punch

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
so you could in theory run fire punch

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.060 
so you could in theory run fire punch
fire<00:06:11.180> punch<00:06:11.479> is<00:06:11.750> something<00:06:12.320> that<00:06:12.650> you<00:06:12.830> could

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
fire punch is something that you could

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.279 
fire punch is something that you could
totally<00:06:13.520> do<00:06:13.700> I<00:06:13.729> know<00:06:14.180> it<00:06:14.389> gets<00:06:14.599> it<00:06:14.870> where<00:06:15.050> is<00:06:15.260> it

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
totally do I know it gets it where is it

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.400 
totally do I know it gets it where is it
there<00:06:16.160> it<00:06:16.190> is<00:06:16.430> but<00:06:17.240> you<00:06:17.450> may<00:06:17.660> have<00:06:17.690> to<00:06:17.900> predict

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
there it is but you may have to predict

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.589 
there it is but you may have to predict
around<00:06:18.979> its<00:06:19.220> keen<00:06:19.460> shield<00:06:19.849> and<00:06:20.180> that's

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 
around its keen shield and that's

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.630 
around its keen shield and that's
something<00:06:20.930> I<00:06:21.380> wouldn't<00:06:21.770> do<00:06:22.010> I<00:06:22.039> would<00:06:22.490> just

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
something I wouldn't do I would just

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.420 
something I wouldn't do I would just
probably<00:06:23.090> switch<00:06:23.360> out<00:06:23.570> into<00:06:23.810> your<00:06:23.930> age

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
probably switch out into your age

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.520 
probably switch out into your age
check<00:06:24.880> that's<00:06:25.630> something<00:06:25.960> you<00:06:26.050> really<00:06:26.080> want

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
check that's something you really want

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.980 
check that's something you really want

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
on this team if you run mega medicham is

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.100 
on this team if you run mega medicham is
probably<00:06:29.470> an<00:06:29.620> egg<00:06:29.770> is<00:06:29.950> slash<00:06:30.190> check

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
probably an egg is slash check

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.350 
probably an egg is slash check
talonflame<00:06:32.110> and<00:06:32.680> a<00:06:33.310> Zoomer<00:06:33.610> Aldo<00:06:33.940> will<00:06:34.180> have<00:06:34.330> a

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
field day after mega medicham like

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.860 
field day after mega medicham like
breaks<00:06:38.830> some<00:06:39.070> walls<00:06:39.310> down<00:06:39.610> and<00:06:39.670> to<00:06:40.090> a<00:06:40.120> KO

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 
and just hurts enough to where they

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.840 
and just hurts enough to where they
can<00:06:43.030> sweep<00:06:43.330> so<00:06:44.140> yeah<00:06:45.010> I<00:06:45.040> would<00:06:45.580> highly

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:45.850 
can sweep so yeah I would highly

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.670 
can sweep so yeah I would highly
recommend<00:06:45.880> learning<00:06:46.300> those<00:06:46.600> things<00:06:46.630> with<00:06:47.110> it

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
recommend learning those things with it

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.430 
recommend learning those things with it
it's<00:06:48.040> a<00:06:48.220> incredibly<00:06:49.210> dangerous<00:06:49.480> threat<00:06:50.200> I

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
it's a incredibly dangerous threat I

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.140 
it's a incredibly dangerous threat I
haven't<00:06:51.010> seen<00:06:51.130> it<00:06:51.220> that<00:06:51.400> often<00:06:51.730> I<00:06:51.970> know<00:06:52.090> you

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
haven't seen it that often I know you

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.530 
haven't seen it that often I know you
but<00:06:52.900> it's<00:06:53.140> so<00:06:53.500> scary<00:06:54.100> that<00:06:54.400> you<00:06:55.030> have<00:06:55.240> to<00:06:55.390> take

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
but it's so scary that you have to take

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.020 
but it's so scary that you have to take
it<00:06:55.720> into<00:06:56.080> account<00:06:56.110> as<00:06:56.590> a<00:06:56.650> dangerous<00:06:57.640> thing

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030 
it into account as a dangerous thing

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.030 
it into account as a dangerous thing
because<00:06:58.090> this<00:06:59.050> thing<00:06:59.260> like<00:06:59.410> I<00:06:59.530> said<00:06:59.560> has<00:06:59.890> the

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.040 
because this thing like I said has the

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.880 
because this thing like I said has the
power<00:07:00.280> of<00:07:00.670> a<00:07:00.760> choice<00:07:01.000> band<00:07:01.390> with<00:07:02.200> the<00:07:02.530> ability

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:02.890 
power of a choice band with the ability

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.710 
power of a choice band with the ability
to<00:07:03.010> switch<00:07:03.220> moves<00:07:03.520> and<00:07:03.850> that<00:07:04.120> in<00:07:04.390> and<00:07:04.660> of

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 
to switch moves and that in and of

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.840 
to switch moves and that in and of
itself<00:07:05.110> is<00:07:05.490> horrifying<00:07:07.290> just<00:07:08.850> incredibly

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:09.850 
itself is horrifying just incredibly

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.390 
itself is horrifying just incredibly
powerful<00:07:10.420> like<00:07:11.080> I<00:07:11.380> think<00:07:11.590> this<00:07:11.860> actually<00:07:12.070> out

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 
powerful like I think this actually out

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.930 
powerful like I think this actually out
