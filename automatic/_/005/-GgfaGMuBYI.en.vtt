00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
thing about this design that I've

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.150 
thing about this design that I've
noticed<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.109> i<00:00:25.230> like<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.920> rear

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
noticed that i like is that the rear

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.540 
noticed that i like is that the rear
rotor<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:27.000> smaller<00:00:27.859> that's<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.160> very

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
rotor is smaller that's a very

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.510 
rotor is smaller that's a very
interesting<00:00:30.029> fort<00:00:30.539> i<00:00:30.810> farm<00:00:31.170> honest<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
interesting fort i farm honest and the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.420 
interesting fort i farm honest and the
frost<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.940> kind<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.510> those<00:00:33.980> four<00:00:34.980> plasmas

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
frost is kind of like those four plasmas

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.830 
frost is kind of like those four plasmas
as<00:00:35.550> opposed<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.940> six<00:00:36.210> that's<00:00:36.570> also

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
as opposed to six that's also

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.569 
as opposed to six that's also
interesting<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.500> very<00:00:37.710> cheap<00:00:38.010> helicopter

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
interesting it's a very cheap helicopter

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.290 
interesting it's a very cheap helicopter
it's<00:00:38.700> only<00:00:39.030> 260<00:00:39.930> blocks<00:00:40.170> if<00:00:40.320> i'm<00:00:40.410> not<00:00:40.530> mistaken

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
it's only 260 blocks if i'm not mistaken

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.830 
it's only 260 blocks if i'm not mistaken
so<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.660> could<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.350> really<00:00:43.890> fancy<00:00:44.610> let's<00:00:45.510> see

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
so it could be really fancy let's see

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.860 
so it could be really fancy let's see
how<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.110> do<00:00:46.410> happy<00:00:46.950> honest<00:00:47.250> i<00:00:47.719> believe<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
how we do happy honest i believe is

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.209 
how we do happy honest i believe is
really<00:00:49.050> well<00:00:50.449> for<00:00:51.449> two<00:00:51.629> rotors<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:53.039> maybe

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
really well for two rotors so maybe

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.490 
really well for two rotors so maybe
there's<00:00:53.430> something<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.079> okay<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.140> see
