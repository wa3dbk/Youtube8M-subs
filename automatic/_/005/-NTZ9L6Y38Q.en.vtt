00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.280

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
but it's just the same octave as the

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.080

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.230 

okay<00:07:15.660> the<00:07:15.780> first<00:07:15.960> cause<00:07:16.260> is<00:07:16.440> this<00:07:16.910> the<00:07:17.910> second

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240
