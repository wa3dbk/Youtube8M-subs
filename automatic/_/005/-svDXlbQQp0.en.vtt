the<00:02:22.610> controls<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:24.140> way<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.620> interface

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
the controls and the way the interface

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.320 
the controls and the way the interface
was<00:02:25.250> done<00:02:25.459> from<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.700> last<00:02:25.940> few<00:02:26.180> games

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
was done from the last few games

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.059 
was done from the last few games
especially<00:02:26.629> basing<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.349> off<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.500> oblivion

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
especially basing it off of oblivion

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.280

they<00:02:28.940> completely<00:02:29.269> changed<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:29.870> i<00:02:29.989> think<00:02:30.200> they

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
they completely changed it i think they

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.440

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
people you can definitely see that they

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.009 
people you can definitely see that they
put<00:02:55.610> a<00:02:55.640> lot<00:02:55.819> of<00:02:55.849> time<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.180> effort<00:02:56.299> into<00:02:56.690> making

put a lot of time and effort into making
a<00:02:57.260> big<00:02:57.709> change<00:02:57.739> in<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.430> animations<00:02:59.329> of<00:02:59.450> your

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
a big change in the animations of your

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.740 
a big change in the animations of your
character<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.760> controls<00:03:02.180> are<00:03:02.329> completely

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
character the controls are completely

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.690 
character the controls are completely
different<00:03:03.079> to<00:03:03.230> that<00:03:03.260> actually<00:03:03.950> feels<00:03:04.430> like

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
different to that actually feels like

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.910 
different to that actually feels like
it's<00:03:04.849> built<00:03:05.120> around<00:03:05.299> a<00:03:05.930> game<00:03:06.200> controller<00:03:06.470> and

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
it's built around a game controller and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.530 
it's built around a game controller and
not<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.220> mouse<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.700> keyboard<00:03:07.849> so<00:03:08.209> i<00:03:08.269> bought<00:03:08.450> it

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
not a mouse and keyboard so i bought it

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.830 
not a mouse and keyboard so i bought it
for<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.720> pc<00:03:09.069> but<00:03:10.069> it<00:03:10.310> in<00:03:10.609> the<00:03:10.879> options<00:03:11.510> one<00:03:11.750> of

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
for the pc but it in the options one of

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.530 
for the pc but it in the options one of
the<00:03:11.900> options<00:03:12.140> for<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.709> is<00:03:12.829> 360<00:03:13.519> controller<00:03:13.819> so

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
the options for it is 360 controller so

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.780 
the options for it is 360 controller so
and<00:03:14.900> when<00:03:15.769> you're<00:03:15.859> going<00:03:16.040> through<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.459> you're

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
and when you're going through it you're

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.920 
and when you're going through it you're
not<00:03:16.879> really<00:03:17.090> using<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.569> mouse<00:03:17.690> in<00:03:17.870> the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
not really using the mouse in the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.330 
not really using the mouse in the
keyboard<00:03:18.349> to<00:03:18.379> navigate<00:03:18.500> through<00:03:19.160> all<00:03:19.220> the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
keyboard to navigate through all the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.770 
keyboard to navigate through all the
menu<00:03:19.579> tabs<00:03:19.819> which<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.209> would<00:03:20.299> be<00:03:20.390> great<00:03:20.629> for

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
menu tabs which it would be great for

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.680 
menu tabs which it would be great for
the<00:03:20.840> console<00:03:21.290> guys<00:03:21.470> who<00:03:21.920> got<00:03:22.849> oblivion<00:03:23.510> but

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
the console guys who got oblivion but

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.930 
the console guys who got oblivion but
didn't<00:03:23.989> really<00:03:24.079> get<00:03:24.440> oblivion<00:03:24.859> yeah<00:03:25.579> it<00:03:25.790> was

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
didn't really get oblivion yeah it was

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.490 
didn't really get oblivion yeah it was
really<00:03:26.180> hard<00:03:26.540> when<00:03:26.750> you<00:03:26.870> kind<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:27.079> port<00:03:27.319> that

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
really hard when you kind of port that

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.349 
really hard when you kind of port that
game<00:03:27.739> when<00:03:27.980> every<00:03:28.370> key<00:03:28.639> on<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:28.910> keyboard<00:03:29.090> is

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
game when every key on the keyboard is

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.319 
game when every key on the keyboard is
used<00:03:29.660> so<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.950> was<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.459> really<00:03:31.669> big<00:03:31.849> step<00:03:32.150> for

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
used so that was a really big step for

used so that was a really big step for
me<00:03:32.359> and<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.569> think<00:03:32.780> that's<00:03:32.959> going<00:03:33.109> to<00:03:33.169> open<00:03:33.380> it
