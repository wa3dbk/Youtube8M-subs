00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.039
 football manager 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.930
 very rarely does such a game come out 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.060
 genre and this game is very high quality 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.160

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.009

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.570
 chips chips game bands in English 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.110
 language require constant access to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.260
 the Internet 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.420
 there are a lot of different menus to give 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.969
 quickly disassemble them so well here 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.640
 there are children and one here we will come 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.610
 we can edit our commands so 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.800
 we want to force players and a lot 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.739
 another and let's do it 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.960
 let's forecast now for others not 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.940
 Ears further, as you can see constantly 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.100

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.129
 updated exact means with motor 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.199
 There is also a shop in which 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.000
 we can pro buy extra 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.710
 buns well i understand our increases 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.170
 speed there endurance and much 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.340
 As you can see, the game supports 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.770
 Donat so that someone else can do with you 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.729
 but here these menus are a combination we are closed 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.439
 we can also develop our players 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.890
 train them if we want it with 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.430

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.680
 speed them up but a lot of them 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.479

 see enough on the schedule very 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.010
 well made 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.500
 data here these players are all so 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.240
 but at least qualitatively made glasses 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.940
 football manager too 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.280
 we just become our orders 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.840
 teams play to train a lot 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.010
 another diode and here it is still done 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.650
 very quality fit 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.980
 and here the game itself was here and the match went 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.620
 in the process of dragging and now this match we 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.880
 I can change the view from above is possible 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.900
 itâ€™s more convenient to look there 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.500
 3d or a sister then the computer itself 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.930
 chooses how the mother will appear 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.570
 ok let's see what we can 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.790
 change something we can say 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.230
 order our team leaders and 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.590
 here there is a check mark we give 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.080
 move and in what style we should 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.730
 what strong teams should our play 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.769
 attacking there in defensive and for example 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.879
 sit down exactly as we can here 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.920
 different too aggressive attack method 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.299
 there in front and behind well in short here it is necessary 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.030
 Watch the video in English even 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:02.709
 I was not around for the short height of the magicians 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:05.650
 pass long pass here counterattack what else 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.769
 can we do with you we can by the way here 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.239
 here in this we can see cheeks 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.540
 additionally cues can increase 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.060
 speed of the game here in this way yes 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.859
 in addition, we can see the condition 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.989
 our longing players can see 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.820
 change some player if he 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.699
 will get tired and various strategic 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.889
 moments are shorter, everything is very detailed here 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.960
 done very very comes in detail 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.810
 I did like everything 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.229
 realized although I myself am not a fan of football 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.660
 now you too would play but 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.840
 In such games, I basically just do not 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.729
 granite seems to me boring need to be drained 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.830
 everyday life as a game floor team and give 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.350
 certain team i'm here is the first ska 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.330
 I run the game my team scored a goal I 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.349
 was very very happy and shown 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.450
 various replays 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.070
 such an interesting one 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.169
 interesting football manager simulator 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.210
