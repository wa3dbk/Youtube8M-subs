actually a lot wider now we need to have

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.890 
actually a lot wider now we need to have
it<00:01:23.470> said<00:01:23.800> if<00:01:23.950> we<00:01:24.040> got<00:01:24.190> a<00:01:24.220> transform<00:01:24.910> here<00:01:25.150> it

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
it said if we got a transform here it

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.670 
it said if we got a transform here it
needs<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.350> be<00:01:26.470> set<00:01:26.770> at<00:01:26.980> 16<00:01:27.760> 70<00:01:28.480> pixels<00:01:28.720> across
