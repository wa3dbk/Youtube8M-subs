about<00:01:20.970> five<00:01:21.270> sets<00:01:23.840> cansado<00:01:24.840> time<00:01:25.080> finishing

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
about five sets cansado time finishing

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.950 
about five sets cansado time finishing
to<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> last<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:25.979> being<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.159> strip<00:01:26.430> set

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
to the last one being a strip set

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.170 
to the last one being a strip set
usually<00:01:27.960> 15<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.590> 20<00:01:28.890> reps<00:01:29.130> something<00:01:30.030> about

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
usually 15 to 20 reps something about

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.640 
usually 15 to 20 reps something about
the<00:01:30.329> angle<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.810> machine<00:01:31.200> actually<00:01:31.380> looks

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the angle this machine actually looks

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.600 
the angle this machine actually looks
like<00:01:31.770> we're<00:01:31.890> not<00:01:31.920> even<00:01:32.040> getting<00:01:32.250> full

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
like we're not even getting full

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.740 
like we're not even getting full
extension<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.060> think<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.509> fact

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
extension I think it's just the fact

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.899 
extension I think it's just the fact
that<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.200> seed<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.280> slightly<00:01:35.520> angled

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
that the seed is slightly angled

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.280 
that the seed is slightly angled
backward<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.140> we're<00:01:37.259> both

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
backward but as you can see we're both

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.660

getting full extension you can see

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.130 
getting full extension you can see
jealously<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.240> getting<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.570> kind<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.869> short

right up to the top p contraction like I

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.429 
right up to the top p contraction like I
say<00:01:49.500> 15<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.040> 20<00:01:50.280> repetitions<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:52.380> you

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
say 15 to 20 repetitions so so you

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.469

so<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.810> see<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.200> rhythm<00:02:22.590> strip<00:02:22.950> says<00:02:23.160> here<00:02:23.370> is

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
so you see a rhythm strip says here is

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.010 
so you see a rhythm strip says here is
having<00:02:23.790> get<00:02:23.940> enough<00:02:24.120> repetitions<00:02:24.690> if<00:02:24.780> I'm<00:02:24.900> not
