00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello everyone again that such good 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:06.990
 days here I am greeting you again 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.429
 from the beautiful city of victoria in 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.890
 the province of British Columbia in the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.950
 west of canada and put I am here 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.870
 in front of a Japanese garden very 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.119
 typical that we have here in victory that 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.039
 was created by Japanese immigrants to 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.749
 early 1900s in a 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.369
 early 20th century to get there 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:25.919
 they came from japan asia asia they made 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.980
 this garden this and well as we are already 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.359
 in June it's already summer almost this one put them 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.040
 I want to talk a little about a garment 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.219
 Japanese for summer that is called 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.010
 jean veil this I do not know if you know 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.809
 but in Japan the summers can be very 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.370
 very hot the temperatures themselves 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.030
 tells me that in Japan the temperatures of 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.010
 35 40 degrees Celsius are not uncommon 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.500
 this and also like all the cities of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.140
 Japanese are along the east coast 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.269
 it is very humid this then my wife 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.399
 says that high humidity and temperatures 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.039
 high summer in japan is unbearable 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.420
 then, over the years, 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.159
 Japanese have developed various 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.830
 techniques to withstand these heats so 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.490
 hellish and one such technique is the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.040
 use of this jean veil 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.720
 and as you can see is a light garment is a 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.670
 kind of kimono but unlike 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.140
 the normal kimonos takes two pieces 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.240
 he wears a pair of shorts and he wears 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.240
 This is like this shirt or shirt 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.390
 Sack is normally made of cotton and 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.860
 as you can see there is this one 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.900
 as holes are below the arm 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.700
 so that the armpits can breathe 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.770
 to give a little breeze the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.890
 underarms and that the sweat evaporates and is 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.760
 for one does not smell bad and for another it is more 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.700
 it feels one as cooler 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.010
 The gym bay can normally be used with 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.650
 or without underwear depending on the 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.320
 heat of the Japanese underwear is 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.640
 called esteban but at this moment I 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.650
 I'm wearing clothes underwear 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.080
 western people in this I do not have 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.030
 no yubÃ¡n then well that's how the 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.520
 things besides that here in victory the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.770
 Summer is not so hot this 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.360
 as you see, like the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.180
 Normal kimonos had already told them in 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.310
 some other occasion this one takes with the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.930
 left side over right because 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.260
 I had already told them when it is 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.260
 reverse is nothing more for the deceased and apart 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.410
 see what I'm using 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.080
 see that I'm wearing some shoes that 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.440
 they call gettas which are shoes of 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.030
 wood that is used with the bare foot 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.980
 normally when one walks they are made 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.690
 sounds when he is hitting against 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.160
 base against asphalt or against 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.110
 wood 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.230
 another thing that would make them talk is that 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.000
 the jean veil as it is known in the summer and 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.800
 in the month of June the Japanese 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.380
 celebrate father's day because it is a 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.880
 very typical gift for parents of 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.180
 father to everyone they give him a jean 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.470
 20 so be it I have mine and for 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.510
 I just want to show off, I hope that 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.340
 and like this because that's all they 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.460
 I wanted to say see you later until 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.460
 then
