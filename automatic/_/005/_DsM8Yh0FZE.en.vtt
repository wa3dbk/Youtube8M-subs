this<00:02:47.430> right<00:02:47.700> here<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.180> where<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.110> hooked<00:02:49.440> up

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
this right here is where it is hooked up

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.229 
this right here is where it is hooked up
into<00:02:50.100> for<00:02:50.820> that<00:02:52.040> crap<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.340> think<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.850> can<00:02:53.970> see

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
into for that crap I think you can see

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.699 
into for that crap I think you can see
that<00:02:54.420> hopefully<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.930> can<00:02:54.989> see<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.470> don't

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
that hopefully you can see that I don't

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.360 
that hopefully you can see that I don't
know

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
know

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.930 
know
I<00:02:59.250> meet<00:03:00.480> getting<00:03:01.480> blurry<00:03:02.280> okay<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.580> can<00:03:03.730> see

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
I meet getting blurry okay you can see

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.990 
I meet getting blurry okay you can see
that<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.150> think<00:03:04.890> yeah<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:05.920> right<00:03:06.459> there<00:03:06.760> is

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
that I think yeah that right there is

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.290 
that I think yeah that right there is
the<00:03:07.209> mic<00:03:07.420> cable<00:03:07.840> see<00:03:08.349> how<00:03:08.590> it's<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.940> see<00:03:10.150> that

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
the mic cable see how it's you see that

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.140 
the mic cable see how it's you see that
little<00:03:10.540> tiny<00:03:10.810> bit<00:03:10.900> of<00:03:11.019> red<00:03:11.379> right<00:03:11.680> there<00:03:12.150> that

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
little tiny bit of red right there that

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.949 
little tiny bit of red right there that
red<00:03:13.510> means<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.290> mic<00:03:15.330> position<00:03:16.330> but

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
red means that it's the mic position but

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.860 
red means that it's the mic position but
yeah<00:03:17.140> that<00:03:17.560> runs<00:03:17.920> all<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.340> way<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.580> there<00:03:18.879> but

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
yeah that runs all the way to there but

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.589 
yeah that runs all the way to there but

if you have this let me show you
something<00:03:23.049> we<00:03:23.590> had<00:03:23.769> this<00:03:23.980> like<00:03:24.599> connected

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
something we had this like connected

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:31.680 
something we had this like connected
without<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:30.180> hooked<00:03:31.180> up<00:03:31.360> with<00:03:31.480> its

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
without this and hooked up with its

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.569 
without this and hooked up with its
actual<00:03:32.200> like<00:03:32.700> PSP<00:03:34.260> cable<00:03:35.260> port<00:03:35.560> as<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.459> was

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
actual like PSP cable port as I was

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:44.520 
actual like PSP cable port as I was
saying<00:03:36.819> in<00:03:36.940> another<00:03:37.180> comment<00:03:42.599> it's<00:03:43.599> a<00:03:43.900> lot<00:03:44.230> the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
saying in another comment it's a lot the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.530 
saying in another comment it's a lot the
noise<00:03:45.220> is<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.430> lot<00:03:45.670> lighter<00:03:45.910> because<00:03:46.299> it's

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
noise is a lot lighter because it's

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.229 
noise is a lot lighter because it's
actually<00:03:46.840> blaring<00:03:47.530> from<00:03:48.129> the<00:03:48.250> stand<00:03:48.730> that's

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
actually blaring from the stand that's

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.660 
actually blaring from the stand that's
right<00:03:49.660> here<00:03:49.989> I<00:03:50.170> don't<00:03:50.349> know<00:03:50.500> why<00:03:50.769> but<00:03:51.280> yeah<00:03:51.549> it

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
right here I don't know why but yeah it

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.289 
right here I don't know why but yeah it
blares<00:03:52.060> from<00:03:52.329> the<00:03:52.450> stand<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:54.790> actually

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
blares from the stand and it actually

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.270 
blares from the stand and it actually
sounds<00:03:55.629> a<00:03:55.690> lot<00:03:55.870> clearer<00:03:56.200> from<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:56.860> I<00:03:56.890> can't

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
sounds a lot clearer from it so I can't

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.850 
sounds a lot clearer from it so I can't
really<00:03:57.459> help<00:03:57.730> if<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.660> doesn't<00:03:59.140> sound<00:03:59.319> clear<00:03:59.739> or

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
really help if it doesn't sound clear or

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.150 
really help if it doesn't sound clear or
not<00:03:59.920> but<00:04:00.840> if<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.959> does<00:04:02.139> sound<00:04:02.410> clear<00:04:02.680> to

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
not but if it does sound clear to

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.949 
not but if it does sound clear to
everyone<00:04:03.639> that's<00:04:03.880> on<00:04:04.000> YouTube<00:04:04.389> because<00:04:04.630> of<00:04:04.810> my

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
everyone that's on YouTube because of my

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.590 
everyone that's on YouTube because of my
settings<00:04:05.769> for<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.040> sound<00:04:06.400> coming<00:04:07.269> from<00:04:07.480> the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
settings for the sound coming from the

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:18.449 
settings for the sound coming from the
computer<00:04:07.870> that's<00:04:08.230> fine<00:04:08.560> but<00:04:13.620> but<00:04:14.620> yeah<00:04:17.459> that

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
computer that's fine but but yeah that

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.990 
computer that's fine but but yeah that
is<00:04:18.700> basically<00:04:19.060> how<00:04:19.150> I<00:04:19.299> have<00:04:19.630> it<00:04:19.930> set<00:04:20.470> up<00:04:20.889> and<00:04:21.549> ah

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
is basically how I have it set up and ah

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.370 
is basically how I have it set up and ah
yeah<00:04:25.000> that's<00:04:25.210> how<00:04:25.419> I<00:04:25.450> have<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.720> set<00:04:25.840> up<00:04:26.110> and

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
yeah that's how I have it set up and

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.839 
yeah that's how I have it set up and
that's<00:04:26.500> why<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:26.800> said<00:04:27.160> it's<00:04:27.280> so<00:04:27.430> complicated

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
that's why I said it's so complicated

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:29.790 
that's why I said it's so complicated
that's<00:04:28.510> why<00:04:28.720> if<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.139> have<00:04:29.320> something<00:04:29.770> that

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
that's why if you have something that

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.719 
that's why if you have something that
would<00:04:30.099> like<00:04:30.460> make<00:04:30.700> it<00:04:31.180> like<00:04:31.539> instead<00:04:32.410> of<00:04:32.470> like

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
would like make it like instead of like

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.779 
would like make it like instead of like
straight<00:04:33.729> have<00:04:34.360> it<00:04:34.510> like<00:04:34.660> kind<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:34.990> like<00:04:35.250> in<00:04:36.250> an

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
straight have it like kind of like in an

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.690 
straight have it like kind of like in an
angle<00:04:37.180> so<00:04:37.419> that<00:04:37.570> it<00:04:37.720> actually<00:04:38.110> stands

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
angle so that it actually stands

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.890 
angle so that it actually stands
straight<00:04:39.700> for<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.030> camera<00:04:40.539> if<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:40.750> have<00:04:40.870> a

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
straight for the camera if you have a

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.810 
straight for the camera if you have a
video<00:04:41.200> camera<00:04:41.229> that<00:04:41.590> can<00:04:41.919> hook<00:04:42.370> it<00:04:42.490> up<00:04:42.550> but

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
video camera that can hook it up but

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.719 
video camera that can hook it up but
otherwise<00:04:43.090> yeah<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.690> don't<00:04:43.960> know<00:04:44.110> if<00:04:44.650> it<00:04:45.280> if<00:04:45.490> you

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
otherwise yeah I don't know if it if you

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.320 
otherwise yeah I don't know if it if you
can<00:04:45.940> like<00:04:46.750> it<00:04:47.370> might<00:04:48.370> be<00:04:48.520> a<00:04:48.550> stand<00:04:48.880> that<00:04:48.970> makes

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
can like it might be a stand that makes

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.409 
can like it might be a stand that makes
it<00:04:49.479> stand<00:04:49.720> straight<00:04:50.169> like<00:04:50.940> this<00:04:51.940> stand<00:04:52.240> for

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
it stand straight like this stand for

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.379 
it stand straight like this stand for
the<00:04:52.479> 3ds<00:04:52.810> if<00:04:53.200> it<00:04:53.380> wasn't<00:04:53.770> for<00:04:53.950> the<00:04:54.070> screen<00:04:55.000> that

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
the 3ds if it wasn't for the screen that

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.010 
the 3ds if it wasn't for the screen that
like<00:04:55.810> flipped<00:04:56.910> kind<00:04:57.910> of<00:04:58.030> like<00:04:58.210> you<00:04:58.690> see<00:04:58.870> how

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
like flipped kind of like you see how

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.110 
like flipped kind of like you see how
this<00:04:59.200> is<00:04:59.440> if<00:04:59.800> it<00:05:00.099> wasn't<00:05:00.400> for<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:00.849> screen

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
this is if it wasn't for the screen

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.790 
this is if it wasn't for the screen
where<00:05:01.330> you<00:05:01.419> could<00:05:01.570> adjust<00:05:01.930> it<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.320> where<00:05:02.620> you

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
where you could adjust it to where you

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.290 
where you could adjust it to where you
had<00:05:03.010> it<00:05:03.039> in<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.280> perfect<00:05:03.729> angle<00:05:03.910> or<00:05:04.150> something

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
had it in the perfect angle or something

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.330 
had it in the perfect angle or something
like<00:05:04.510> that<00:05:04.740> then<00:05:06.120> yeah<00:05:07.120> because<00:05:07.510> I<00:05:07.840> mean

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
like that then yeah because I mean

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.590 
like that then yeah because I mean
having<00:05:09.340> it<00:05:09.460> adjust<00:05:09.969> like

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
having it adjust like

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.350 
having it adjust like
this<00:05:10.890> would<00:05:11.890> be<00:05:12.040> perfect<00:05:12.580> since<00:05:13.090> it's

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
this would be perfect since it's

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.800 
this would be perfect since it's
basically<00:05:13.750> like<00:05:14.340> it's<00:05:15.340> basically<00:05:15.550> like<00:05:16.030> it's

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
basically like it's basically like it's

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.960 
basically like it's basically like it's
angled<00:05:17.440> like<00:05:17.560> this<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:18.100> just<00:05:18.580> got<00:05:18.730> to<00:05:18.820> keep

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
angled like this and just got to keep

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.580 
angled like this and just got to keep
going<00:05:19.300> and<00:05:19.570> going<00:05:19.870> until<00:05:20.020> it's<00:05:20.410> actually

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
going and going until it's actually

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.650 
going and going until it's actually
straight<00:05:21.510> but<00:05:22.510> um<00:05:22.930> yeah<00:05:23.910> that<00:05:24.910> is<00:05:25.060> how<00:05:25.240> I<00:05:25.270> hook

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660
