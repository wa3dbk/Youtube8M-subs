high intensity heavy training constant

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.460 
high intensity heavy training constant
but<00:00:15.880> what<00:00:16.059> is<00:00:16.240> your<00:00:16.450> answer<00:00:16.869> to<00:00:17.230> all<00:00:17.320> these

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
you know when you go into the gym in

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:27.990 
you know when you go into the gym in
order<00:00:26.800> to<00:00:26.919> get<00:00:27.070> a<00:00:27.099> response<00:00:27.369> from<00:00:27.700> your

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
order to get a response from your

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.639 
order to get a response from your
training<00:00:28.239> you're<00:00:29.020> looking<00:00:29.290> to<00:00:29.410> give<00:00:29.529> your

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
training you're looking to give your

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.620 
training you're looking to give your
body<00:00:29.770> stress<00:00:30.189> stress<00:00:30.730> that<00:00:30.849> it's<00:00:31.000> not<00:00:31.149> used<00:00:31.360> to

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
body stress stress that it's not used to

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.270 
body stress stress that it's not used to
and<00:00:31.899> then<00:00:32.230> it's<00:00:32.380> going<00:00:32.500> to<00:00:32.559> react<00:00:32.770> by<00:00:32.950> you<00:00:33.010> know

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
and then it's going to react by you know

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.030 
and then it's going to react by you know
building<00:00:33.640> bigger<00:00:33.880> stronger<00:00:34.270> muscles<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:36.010> you

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
building bigger stronger muscles but you

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.530 
building bigger stronger muscles but you
can<00:00:36.250> definitely<00:00:36.370> be<00:00:36.700> in<00:00:36.790> the<00:00:36.880> gym<00:00:37.090> too<00:00:37.300> long

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
can definitely be in the gym too long

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.840 
can definitely be in the gym too long
this<00:00:38.200> is<00:00:38.379> not<00:00:38.530> an<00:00:38.710> endurance<00:00:39.339> sport<00:00:39.640> you<00:00:39.760> know

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
this is not an endurance sport you know

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.849 
this is not an endurance sport you know
it's<00:00:40.000> about<00:00:40.210> training<00:00:40.539> hard<00:00:40.929> heavy<00:00:41.589> and

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
it's about training hard heavy and

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:43.500 
it's about training hard heavy and
intense<00:00:42.039> that's<00:00:42.519> how<00:00:42.640> you<00:00:42.699> stimulate<00:00:43.179> muscle

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
intense that's how you stimulate muscle

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.970 
intense that's how you stimulate muscle
growth<00:00:43.539> and<00:00:44.050> don't<00:00:44.320> need<00:00:44.469> to<00:00:44.559> be<00:00:44.620> in<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.769> gym<00:00:44.920> a

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
growth and don't need to be in the gym a

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.310 
growth and don't need to be in the gym a
long<00:00:45.160> time<00:00:45.429> and<00:00:45.730> definitely<00:00:46.300> if<00:00:46.719> you<00:00:46.870> overdo

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
long time and definitely if you overdo

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.959 
long time and definitely if you overdo
it<00:00:47.469> if<00:00:47.620> you<00:00:47.710> do<00:00:47.859> too<00:00:48.070> much<00:00:48.219> training<00:00:48.760> your

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
it if you do too much training your

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:50.459 
it if you do too much training your
progress<00:00:49.329> is<00:00:49.449> going<00:00:49.570> to<00:00:49.690> come<00:00:49.870> to<00:00:50.019> a<00:00:50.050> halt<00:00:50.320> I

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
progress is going to come to a halt I

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.560 
progress is going to come to a halt I
mean<00:00:50.710> this<00:00:50.829> is<00:00:51.039> a<00:00:51.070> this<00:00:51.909> is<00:00:52.089> a<00:00:52.120> fact<00:00:52.390> I<00:00:52.480> mean

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
mean this is a this is a fact I mean

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.669 
mean this is a this is a fact I mean
it's<00:00:52.690> going<00:00:52.809> to<00:00:52.870> vary<00:00:53.019> from<00:00:53.109> one<00:00:53.320> person<00:00:53.649> to

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
it's going to vary from one person to

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.290 
it's going to vary from one person to
another<00:00:53.800> but<00:00:54.609> definitely<00:00:54.999> it's<00:00:55.149> very

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
another but definitely it's very

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.970 
another but definitely it's very
possible<00:00:55.510> to<00:00:55.870> over<00:00:56.079> train<00:00:56.230> in<00:00:56.499> terms<00:00:56.769> of

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
possible to over train in terms of

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.479 
possible to over train in terms of
training<00:00:57.190> too<00:00:57.429> often<00:00:57.819> and<00:00:58.140> training<00:00:59.219> too<00:01:00.219> long

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
training too often and training too long

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.430 
training too often and training too long
it's<00:01:01.120> not<00:01:01.329> really<00:01:01.569> possible<00:01:01.780> to<00:01:02.050> train<00:01:02.260> too

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
it's not really possible to train too

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.110 
it's not really possible to train too
hard<00:01:02.679> but<00:01:03.219> you<00:01:03.309> have<00:01:03.399> to<00:01:03.519> train<00:01:03.699> for<00:01:03.850> brief

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
hard but you have to train for brief

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.270 
hard but you have to train for brief
periods<00:01:04.150> of<00:01:04.570> time<00:01:04.780> all<00:01:05.260> right<00:01:05.409> 45<00:01:05.650> minutes<00:01:06.190> in

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
periods of time all right 45 minutes in

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.550 
periods of time all right 45 minutes in
the<00:01:06.370> gym<00:01:06.550> is<00:01:06.820> enough<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.420> sometimes<00:01:08.200> people

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
the gym is enough and sometimes people

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.130 
the gym is enough and sometimes people
struggle<00:01:08.890> this<00:01:08.979> concept<00:01:09.460> well<00:01:09.840> 45<00:01:10.840> minutes

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
struggle this concept well 45 minutes

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.750 
struggle this concept well 45 minutes
that<00:01:11.290> surely<00:01:11.710> that's<00:01:11.860> not<00:01:11.980> difficult<00:01:12.580> maybe

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
that surely that's not difficult maybe

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.190 
that surely that's not difficult maybe
two<00:01:13.030> hours<00:01:13.180> or<00:01:13.420> three<00:01:13.450> hours<00:01:13.630> would<00:01:13.930> be<00:01:14.020> more

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
two hours or three hours would be more

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.890 
two hours or three hours would be more
difficult<00:01:14.350> but<00:01:15.100> it's<00:01:15.280> not<00:01:15.460> it's<00:01:15.970> very<00:01:16.390> intense

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
difficult but it's not it's very intense

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.780 
difficult but it's not it's very intense
training<00:01:17.260> and<00:01:17.560> 45<00:01:17.950> minutes<00:01:18.250> that's<00:01:18.400> the<00:01:18.520> idea

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
training and 45 minutes that's the idea

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.850 
training and 45 minutes that's the idea
go<00:01:19.060> in<00:01:19.240> your<00:01:19.390> train<00:01:19.690> and<00:01:19.930> you<00:01:20.350> get<00:01:20.500> out<00:01:20.530> that's

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
go in your train and you get out that's

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.110 
go in your train and you get out that's
what<00:01:20.980> body<00:01:21.160> bones<00:01:21.340> are<00:01:21.580> about<00:01:21.790> it's<00:01:21.940> not<00:01:22.030> an

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
what body bones are about it's not an

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.060 
what body bones are about it's not an
