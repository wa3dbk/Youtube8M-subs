if<00:02:24.599> you<00:02:24.720> really<00:02:25.260> think<00:02:25.409> about<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.709> could<00:02:26.489> be

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
if you really think about it could be

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.309 
if you really think about it could be
reflecting<00:02:27.920> whatever<00:02:28.920> just<00:02:29.870> don't<00:02:30.870> don't

reflecting whatever just don't don't
don't<00:02:31.590> don't<00:02:31.799> don't<00:02:32.099> do<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.579> judging<00:02:32.790> thing

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
don't don't don't do the judging thing

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.449 
don't don't don't do the judging thing
and<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:36.720> now<00:02:37.140> if<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.379> press<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:37.860> will<00:02:38.129> see

and so now if we press this will see

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.949 
and so now if we press this will see
there's<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.760> little<00:02:38.790> thing<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.299> resembles

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
there's a little thing that resembles

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.580

the watch thing you stop watch thing

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.119 
the watch thing you stop watch thing
that<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:44.190> what<00:02:44.430> we<00:02:44.849> call<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.420> keyframe

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
that is what we call the keyframe

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.020 
that is what we call the keyframe
representation<00:02:47.129> release<00:02:47.370> what<00:02:47.579> I<00:02:47.609> call<00:02:47.910> you

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
press that put it put in the keyframes

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.740 
press that put it put in the keyframes
it<00:02:50.730> enables<00:02:51.629> the<00:02:51.780> keyframes<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:53.420> if<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.569> do

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
it enables the keyframes and if you do

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.039 
it enables the keyframes and if you do
that<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:56.340> can<00:02:56.519> drag<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:57.090> flare<00:02:57.390> center<00:02:57.840> over

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
that you can drag the flare center over

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.300 
that you can drag the flare center over
here<00:02:58.319> or<00:02:58.560> enter<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.989> let's<00:03:00.989> just<00:03:01.079> call<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.470> 900

about<00:03:34.200> here<00:03:34.440> just<00:03:35.280> for<00:03:35.579> fanciness<00:03:36.180> now<00:03:38.180> hmm

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
about here just for fanciness now hmm

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.809 
about here just for fanciness now hmm
interesting<00:03:39.569> where's<00:03:40.109> that<00:03:40.349> little<00:03:40.819> cutout

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
interesting where's that little cutout

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.759 
interesting where's that little cutout
bit<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.239> think<00:03:42.690> we'd<00:03:42.810> got<00:03:43.109> rid<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.379> that<00:03:43.440> I'll

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
bit I think we'd got rid of that I'll

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.259 
bit I think we'd got rid of that I'll
know<00:03:44.160> so<00:03:44.459> it's<00:03:44.609> going<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.790> go<00:03:44.940> through<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
know so it's going to go through the

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.729 
know so it's going to go through the
whole<00:03:45.389> thing<00:03:47.480> so<00:03:48.480> if<00:03:48.629> we<00:03:48.840> get<00:03:49.049> a<00:03:49.109> bit<00:03:49.379> and<00:03:49.560> we

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
whole thing so if we get a bit and we

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.880 
whole thing so if we get a bit and we
cut

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.860 

you<00:03:56.890> can<00:03:57.070> see<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.550> player<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.060> traveling

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
you can see that the player is traveling

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.720 
you can see that the player is traveling
across<00:03:59.230> their<00:03:59.800> very<00:04:01.590> making<00:04:02.590> not<00:04:02.770> sense<00:04:03.190> ish

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
across their very making not sense ish

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.470 
across their very making not sense ish
like<00:04:04.800> totally<00:04:05.800> a<00:04:06.010> word<00:04:06.250> bro<00:04:06.550> and<00:04:08.280> yeah<00:04:09.480> you

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
like totally a word bro and yeah you

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.530 
like totally a word bro and yeah you
have<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:10.960> and<00:04:11.200> it<00:04:11.320> see<00:04:11.800> gradual<00:04:12.280> increases<00:04:12.700> in

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
have it and it see gradual increases in

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.680 
have it and it see gradual increases in
brightness<00:04:14.410> so<00:04:15.390> now<00:04:16.390> that<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:16.959> know<00:04:16.989> the

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
brightness so now that you know the

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.530 
brightness so now that you know the
basics<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.930> keyframe<00:04:21.060> next<00:04:22.060> tutorial

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
basics of the keyframe next tutorial

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.150 
basics of the keyframe next tutorial
we're<00:04:22.780> going<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:23.050> get<00:04:23.140> into<00:04:23.440> more<00:04:23.620> depth<00:04:23.920> with

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
we're going to get into more depth with

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.490 
we're going to get into more depth with
exploring<00:04:25.120> some<00:04:25.420> certain<00:04:25.960> effects<00:04:26.740> such<00:04:27.310> as

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
exploring some certain effects such as

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.140 
exploring some certain effects such as
well<00:04:29.500> I'm<00:04:29.620> not<00:04:29.740> gonna<00:04:29.890> give<00:04:30.100> away<00:04:30.280> anything<00:04:30.550> no

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
well I'm not gonna give away anything no

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.730 
well I'm not gonna give away anything no
that<00:04:31.390> would<00:04:31.510> get<00:04:31.690> rid<00:04:31.720> of<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.050> fun<00:04:32.320> gonna

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
that would get rid of the fun gonna

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.190 
that would get rid of the fun gonna
probably<00:04:33.190> expand<00:04:33.790> I<00:04:34.120> will<00:04:34.330> do<00:04:34.780> a<00:04:34.810> separate

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
probably expand I will do a separate

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.770 
probably expand I will do a separate
thing<00:04:35.350> for<00:04:35.560> transitions<00:04:36.130> and<00:04:36.540> I'm<00:04:37.540> not<00:04:37.660> gonna

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
thing for transitions and I'm not gonna

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.940 
thing for transitions and I'm not gonna
get<00:04:38.020> in<00:04:38.140> 20<00:04:38.470> of<00:04:38.590> this<00:04:38.710> so<00:04:39.400> uh<00:04:39.430> yeah<00:04:40.740> hope<00:04:41.740> you
