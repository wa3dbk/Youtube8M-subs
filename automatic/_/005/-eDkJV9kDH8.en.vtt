single player i know that some mods

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.770 
single player i know that some mods
don't<00:03:06.770> like<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.250> crack<00:03:07.459> version<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.660> they

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
don't like the crack version so they

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.270 
don't like the crack version so they
don't<00:03:08.989> work<00:03:09.170> very<00:03:09.200> well<00:03:09.500> on<00:03:09.770> a<00:03:11.110> crack<00:03:12.110> version

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
don't work very well on a crack version

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.660 
don't work very well on a crack version
also<00:03:13.390> some<00:03:14.390> servers<00:03:14.980> don't<00:03:15.980> like<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.400> cracked

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
also some servers don't like the cracked

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.440 
also some servers don't like the cracked
version<00:03:16.819> as<00:03:17.360> well<00:03:17.890> so<00:03:18.890> they<00:03:19.310> are<00:03:19.610> very<00:03:19.640> picky

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
version as well so they are very picky

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.360 
version as well so they are very picky
about<00:03:22.930> who<00:03:23.930> connects<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.709> their<00:03:24.890> servers<00:03:25.250> as

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
about who connects to their servers as

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.690 
about who connects to their servers as
well<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:28.489> think<00:03:28.730> that's<00:03:29.180> about<00:03:29.330> it<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.980> would
