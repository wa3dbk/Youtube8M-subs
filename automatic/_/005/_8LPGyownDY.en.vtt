00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.670 
closet and I'm hoping that by having a
separate<00:03:10.060> basket<00:03:10.540> for<00:03:11.080> all<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.350> different

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
sizes that it will kind of make things

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.190 
sizes that it will kind of make things
more<00:03:13.660> accessible<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.830> this<00:03:15.100> is<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.640> before

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
more accessible so this is the before

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.550 
more accessible so this is the before
and<00:03:18.150> I'm<00:03:19.150> really<00:03:19.600> really<00:03:19.810> hoping<00:03:20.050> that<00:03:20.440> you

it<00:03:33.490> was<00:03:33.580> fairly<00:03:33.850> easy<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.240> put<00:03:34.420> together<00:03:34.510> I<00:03:34.780> did

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
it was fairly easy to put together I did

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.920 
it was fairly easy to put together I did
have<00:03:35.350> my<00:03:35.500> husband<00:03:35.890> put<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.130> together<00:03:36.280> for<00:03:36.820> me

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
have my husband put it together for me

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.270 
have my husband put it together for me
because<00:03:37.930> I'm<00:03:38.050> not<00:03:38.200> exactly<00:03:38.500> good<00:03:38.890> with<00:03:39.100> this

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
because I'm not exactly good with this

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.360 
because I'm not exactly good with this
kind<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.730> like<00:03:40.470> prestwood<00:03:41.470> word<00:03:41.980> stuff

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
kind of like prestwood word stuff

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.800 
kind of like prestwood word stuff
because<00:03:42.640> I<00:03:42.670> usually<00:03:43.090> ripped<00:03:43.420> through<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:43.690> with

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
because I usually ripped through it with

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.110 
because I usually ripped through it with
the<00:03:43.900> screw<00:03:44.200> but<00:03:44.860> anyhow<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.820> came<00:03:45.970> together

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
the screw but anyhow it came together

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.780 
the screw but anyhow it came together
quite<00:03:46.480> nicely<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:47.080> you<00:03:47.140> can<00:03:47.260> see<00:03:47.410> that<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.650> has

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
quite nicely and you can see that it has

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.790 
quite nicely and you can see that it has
six<00:03:48.790> cubes<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.420> I'm<00:03:49.540> going<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:49.930> go<00:03:50.140> ahead<00:03:50.170> and

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.200 

alright<00:04:58.590> so<00:04:58.830> this<00:04:58.980> is<00:04:59.160> my<00:04:59.280> finished<00:04:59.550> project

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
alright so this is my finished project

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.520 
alright so this is my finished project
and<00:05:00.420> some<00:05:00.570> of<00:05:00.660> these<00:05:00.750> cones<00:05:01.020> will<00:05:01.200> thin<00:05:01.380> out<00:05:01.470> a

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
and some of these cones will thin out a

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.570 
and some of these cones will thin out a
little<00:05:01.740> bit<00:05:01.920> some<00:05:02.190> of<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.340> motorcycle

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
little bit some of the motorcycle

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.770 
little bit some of the motorcycle
jackets<00:05:03.150> don't<00:05:03.300> need<00:05:03.420> to<00:05:03.510> be<00:05:03.630> in<00:05:03.750> there

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
jackets don't need to be in there

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.120 
jackets don't need to be in there
because<00:05:04.140> they<00:05:04.230> won't<00:05:04.410> be<00:05:04.500> used<00:05:04.680> in<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:04.950> fall

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
because they won't be used in the fall

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.490 
because they won't be used in the fall
and<00:05:05.160> winter<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.700> also<00:05:06.420> some<00:05:06.660> of<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.810> size<00:05:07.140> of

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
and winter and also some of the size of

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.260 
and winter and also some of the size of
kids<00:05:07.800> jackets<00:05:08.250> won't<00:05:08.460> be<00:05:08.580> used<00:05:08.760> this<00:05:08.910> fall<00:05:09.150> and

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
kids jackets won't be used this fall and

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.400 
kids jackets won't be used this fall and
winter<00:05:09.390> so<00:05:09.630> those<00:05:09.780> would<00:05:09.930> get<00:05:10.050> thinned<00:05:10.260> out<00:05:10.350> a

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
winter so those would get thinned out a

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.680 
winter so those would get thinned out a
little<00:05:10.590> bit<00:05:10.770> I<00:05:11.010> was<00:05:11.640> able<00:05:11.760> to<00:05:12.030> reduce<00:05:12.390> the

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
little bit I was able to reduce the

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.570 
little bit I was able to reduce the
amount<00:05:12.900> of<00:05:13.020> things<00:05:13.290> up<00:05:13.500> here<00:05:13.740> quite<00:05:14.070> a<00:05:14.100> bit<00:05:14.250> and

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
amount of things up here quite a bit and

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.100 
amount of things up here quite a bit and
all<00:05:14.730> the<00:05:14.850> cleaning<00:05:15.060> supplies<00:05:15.330> fit<00:05:15.870> in<00:05:16.050> that

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
all the cleaning supplies fit in that

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.130 
all the cleaning supplies fit in that
old<00:05:16.410> basket<00:05:16.950> then<00:05:17.460> I<00:05:17.490> was<00:05:17.670> using<00:05:17.990> right<00:05:18.990> up

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
old basket then I was using right up

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.160 
old basket then I was using right up
here<00:05:19.560> and<00:05:19.820> then<00:05:20.820> this<00:05:21.540> is<00:05:21.720> kind<00:05:21.930> of<00:05:22.020> like<00:05:22.110> the

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
here and then this is kind of like the

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.870 
here and then this is kind of like the
biggest<00:05:22.500> part<00:05:22.800> of<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:22.920> project<00:05:23.160> down<00:05:23.580> here<00:05:23.850> I

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
biggest part of the project down here I

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.360 
biggest part of the project down here I
was<00:05:24.030> able<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.360> get<00:05:24.480> our<00:05:24.690> upright<00:05:25.470> Dyson<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:26.220> go

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
was able to get our upright Dyson to go

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.620 
was able to get our upright Dyson to go
in<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.580> closet<00:05:26.730> which<00:05:27.060> was<00:05:27.210> a<00:05:27.240> big<00:05:27.450> deal

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
in the closet which was a big deal

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.690 
in the closet which was a big deal
because<00:05:27.900> we<00:05:28.770> didn't<00:05:28.980> have<00:05:29.010> a<00:05:29.160> spot<00:05:29.400> that<00:05:29.430> it

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
because we didn't have a spot that it

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.800 
because we didn't have a spot that it
fit<00:05:29.850> in<00:05:29.970> the<00:05:30.030> house<00:05:30.150> before<00:05:30.420> and<00:05:31.290> then<00:05:31.880> we<00:05:32.880> put

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
fit in the house before and then we put

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.650 
fit in the house before and then we put
the<00:05:34.080> container<00:05:35.010> organizer<00:05:35.520> up<00:05:35.910> right<00:05:36.180> here

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
it which could also go here at the top

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.810 
it which could also go here at the top
and<00:05:57.990> then<00:05:58.140> this<00:05:58.290> is<00:05:58.500> also<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:58.920> kids<00:05:59.340> gym<00:05:59.640> bag

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
for going to childcare at the gym so we

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.790 
for going to childcare at the gym so we
each<00:06:03.120> have<00:06:03.300> our<00:06:03.330> own<00:06:03.480> spot<00:06:03.900> to<00:06:04.140> put<00:06:04.320> our<00:06:04.500> winter

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800

scarves and gloves here down inside and

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.560 
scarves and gloves here down inside and
it<00:06:08.460> should<00:06:08.730> hopefully<00:06:08.910> make<00:06:09.270> everything

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
it should hopefully make everything

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.650 
it should hopefully make everything
accessible<00:06:10.310> for<00:06:11.310> our<00:06:11.400> most<00:06:11.610> used<00:06:11.970> hat<00:06:12.450> and

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
accessible for our most used hat and

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.780 
accessible for our most used hat and
gloves<00:06:12.900> can<00:06:13.110> go<00:06:13.260> on<00:06:13.380> the<00:06:13.470> top<00:06:13.710> and<00:06:14.160> all<00:06:14.520> the

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
gloves can go on the top and all the

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.030

extras<00:06:15.120> in<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.330> bottom<00:06:15.720> so<00:06:16.290> that<00:06:16.320> way<00:06:16.620> it<00:06:16.830> is

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
extras in the bottom so that way it is

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.120 
extras in the bottom so that way it is
easily<00:06:17.900> recognizable<00:06:18.900> whose<00:06:19.350> is<00:06:19.620> what<00:06:19.860> and

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
easily recognizable whose is what and

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.980 
easily recognizable whose is what and
hopefully<00:06:21.060> everything<00:06:21.420> can<00:06:21.540> go<00:06:21.570> back<00:06:21.690> in

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
hopefully everything can go back in

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.110 
hopefully everything can go back in
there<00:06:22.140> so<00:06:23.040> hopefully<00:06:23.340> this<00:06:23.670> has<00:06:23.790> given<00:06:23.880> you
