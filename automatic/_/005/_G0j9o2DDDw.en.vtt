pursue these real life lessons take them

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.039 
pursue these real life lessons take them
beyond<00:01:39.579> what<00:01:39.939> they<00:01:40.090> learned<00:01:40.359> at<00:01:40.630> Earth<00:01:40.749> Day

returned inside because the Northeast

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.740 
returned inside because the Northeast
water<00:02:37.980> purification<00:02:38.490> plant<00:02:39.090> wasn't<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.600> only

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
water purification plant wasn't the only

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.040 
water purification plant wasn't the only
thing<00:02:40.140> producing<00:02:40.650> water<00:02:40.830> on<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.430> day<00:02:42.050> we

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
thing producing water on this day we

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.990 
thing producing water on this day we
know<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.620> water<00:02:43.830> comes<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.340> us<00:02:44.460> when<00:02:44.670> we<00:02:44.790> turn

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
know that water comes to us when we turn

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.150 
know that water comes to us when we turn
the<00:02:45.150> tap<00:02:45.360> on<00:02:45.570> but<00:02:46.200> most<00:02:46.470> people<00:02:46.830> don't<00:02:46.860> have

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
the tap on but most people don't have

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160 
the tap on but most people don't have
any<00:02:47.460> clue<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.850> where<00:02:48.240> it<00:02:48.420> comes<00:02:48.660> from<00:02:48.780> but

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
any clue of where it comes from but

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.870 
any clue of where it comes from but
these<00:02:49.410> Bailey<00:02:49.800> middle<00:02:50.100> school<00:02:50.310> students<00:02:50.700> know

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
these Bailey middle school students know

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.670 
these Bailey middle school students know
just<00:02:51.180> where<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.510> comes<00:02:51.720> from<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.140> they

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
just where it comes from and they

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.590 
just where it comes from and they
understand<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.460> process<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.120> cleaning<00:02:54.330> it

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
understand the process of cleaning it

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.720 
understand the process of cleaning it
all<00:02:54.720> because<00:02:55.440> they<00:02:55.650> told<00:02:55.710> their<00:02:56.100> principal

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
all because they told their principal

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.190 
all because they told their principal
that<00:02:56.850> they<00:02:57.030> wanted<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.390> learn<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.720> little<00:02:58.080> bit

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
that they wanted to learn a little bit

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.320 
that they wanted to learn a little bit
more<00:02:58.500> about<00:02:58.950> these<00:02:59.130> environmental<00:02:59.760> sciences

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
more about these environmental sciences

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.260 
more about these environmental sciences
and<00:03:00.540> we're<00:03:00.900> just<00:03:01.020> trying<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.560> expand<00:03:02.550> whatever

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
and we're just trying to expand whatever

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.900 
and we're just trying to expand whatever
lessons<00:03:03.750> we<00:03:03.960> can<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.650> make<00:03:04.800> them<00:03:04.980> real<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:05.640> that

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
lessons we can to make them real so that

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.060 
lessons we can to make them real so that
they<00:03:06.330> see<00:03:06.390> if<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.410> really<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.680> direction

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
they see if this is really the direction

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.860 
they see if this is really the direction
that<00:03:08.220> they<00:03:08.430> want<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.730> go<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.300> present<00:03:09.510> them

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
that they want to go and so present them

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.760 
that they want to go and so present them
with<00:03:09.900> real<00:03:10.200> life<00:03:10.380> lessons<00:03:10.860> so<00:03:11.130> it's<00:03:11.280> wonderful
