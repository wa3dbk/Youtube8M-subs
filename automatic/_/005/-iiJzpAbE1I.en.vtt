with two games at home two games to win
its<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.049> position<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:16.650> we<00:00:16.949> ideally<00:00:17.400> want<00:00:17.550> it

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
its the position that we ideally want it

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.189 
its the position that we ideally want it
to<00:00:17.730> be<00:00:17.880> when<00:00:18.119> we<00:00:18.210> came<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.570> come<00:00:18.930> probably

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
to be when we came to come probably

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.950 
to be when we came to come probably
ideally<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> suppose<00:00:20.279> she<00:00:20.460> might<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.330> had<00:00:21.480> 24

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
ideally I suppose she might have had 24

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.050 
ideally I suppose she might have had 24
points<00:00:22.199> from<00:00:22.380> eight<00:00:22.560> games<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.130> had<00:00:23.850> no

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
points from eight games and had no

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.759 
points from eight games and had no
concern<00:00:24.510> about<00:00:24.539> these<00:00:24.990> two<00:00:25.230> but<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.650> know

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
concern about these two but you know

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.410 
concern about these two but you know
realistically<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.670> was<00:00:26.880> always<00:00:27.180> going<00:00:27.330> to

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
realistically that was always going to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.480 
realistically that was always going to
be<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.599> tough<00:00:28.260> ask<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:28.769> us<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.980> go<00:00:29.099> down<00:00:29.250> those

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
be a tough ask for us to go down those

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.849 
be a tough ask for us to go down those

that<00:00:59.609> was<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> important<00:01:00.180> thing<00:01:00.329> coming<00:01:00.600> out

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
that was the important thing coming out

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.410 
that was the important thing coming out
I<00:01:00.719> think<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.050> don't<00:01:01.230> plan<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.649> village<00:01:01.949> that

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
I think I don't plan to village that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.939 
I think I don't plan to village that
people<00:01:03.420> were<00:01:03.600> disappointed<00:01:04.229> with<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> result

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
people were disappointed with the result

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.469 
people were disappointed with the result
fee<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.820> criticism<00:01:06.390> came<00:01:07.850> as<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.909> result<00:01:09.180> of

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
fee the criticism came as a result of

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.170 
fee the criticism came as a result of
what<00:01:09.689> people<00:01:10.049> saw<00:01:10.260> as<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.520> negative<00:01:11.520> style<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
what people saw as a negative style of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.609 
what people saw as a negative style of
play<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.390> don't<00:01:12.689> agree<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.140> at<00:01:13.260> all<00:01:13.560> I

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
play I don't agree with that at all I

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.910 
play I don't agree with that at all I
mean<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.189> think<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.000> when<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.810> lose<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.290> your

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
mean I think that when you lose you your

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.190 
mean I think that when you lose you your
three<00:01:17.189> top<00:01:17.729> strikers<00:01:18.270> before<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> game<00:01:19.020> you

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
three top strikers before the game you

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.840 
three top strikers before the game you
was<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.860> somewhat<00:01:20.280> limited<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.820> that

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
was going to be somewhat limited in that

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.550 
was going to be somewhat limited in that
respect<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.540> furthermore<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.080> don't<00:01:22.320> think

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
respect and furthermore I don't think

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.460 
respect and furthermore I don't think
that<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> nature<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> game<00:01:24.470> both

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
that with the nature of the game both

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.670 
that with the nature of the game both
teams<00:01:25.740> perhaps<00:01:26.189> were<00:01:26.790> slightly<00:01:27.119> more

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
teams perhaps were slightly more

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.350 
teams perhaps were slightly more
cautious<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.860> think<00:01:29.400> had<00:01:29.549> Ukraine<00:01:30.000> open

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
cautious I think had Ukraine open

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.450 
cautious I think had Ukraine open
themselves<00:01:30.509> up<00:01:30.930> more<00:01:31.200> we'd<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.619> had<00:01:31.770> even

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
themselves up more we'd have had even

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.100 
themselves up more we'd have had even
better<00:01:32.640> attacking<00:01:33.390> opportunities<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.020> we

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
better attacking opportunities and we

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.410 
better attacking opportunities and we
had<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:34.470> they<00:01:34.619> they<00:01:35.340> seem<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.850> content

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
had but they they seem to be content

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.120 
had but they they seem to be content
with<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.810> draw<00:01:37.049> as<00:01:37.200> well<00:01:37.380> strangely<00:01:37.829> enough

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
with the draw as well strangely enough

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.350 
with the draw as well strangely enough
but<00:01:39.650> obviously<00:01:40.650> now<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.040> know<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.430> what

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
but obviously now we know that what

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.859 
but obviously now we know that what
we've<00:01:42.509> got<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.290> win<00:01:44.600> we've<00:01:45.600> got

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
we've got to do is to win we've got

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.749 
we've got to do is to win we've got
hopefully<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.770> squad<00:01:47.070> I've<00:01:47.220> selected<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
hopefully in the squad I've selected the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.969 
hopefully in the squad I've selected the
players<00:01:48.030> will<00:01:48.240> enable<00:01:48.479> us<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.200> well

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
players will enable us to do that well

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.319 
players will enable us to do that well
