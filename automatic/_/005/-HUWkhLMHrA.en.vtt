00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.110
 I 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.619
 yes if i am very honest i have to 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.060
 Just as I just think that's 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.520
 interesting 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.410
 as short as that it goes it's not 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.809
 something special 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.110
 that that can happen can be from a photo 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.410
 to be a book 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.800
 what you can see from the exhibition 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.800
 places or service 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.480
 it's just that we'll talk about was her 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.850
 I'm doing a very good team with than 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.379
 not only so we do it with salmon 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.120
 but basically it is so now 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.050
 and then a topic comes on us 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.579
 path 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.650
 and then take that with me 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:08.110
 to each other and well then go 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.940
 view and then go there concept 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.580
 collect grammes of material and 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.990
 then hand of course colors 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.130
 anything but what you need for 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.180
 a collection and on the basis thereof 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.180
 is sketched 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.030
 i was recently i was in the high line 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.190
 park in new york 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.670
 that is a garden designed by piet 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.670
 oudhof 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.580
 you can be caught by something you 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.369
 then my thinking where it's fantastic 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.420
 something that this is in the middle of the city and 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.460
 that they are one because it is a rail 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.110
 has been what meter went over 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.009
 but they have something on them 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.929
 bent to 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.030
 to a natural product as it were 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.030
 and you will be caught by zoom 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.600
 yes it is yes how happens it is in one 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.600
 time that you think fascinating 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.410
 how
