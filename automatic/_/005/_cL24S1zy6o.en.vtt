00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:09.030
 hi i'm chloe and let's see how 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.610
 save the cards after a run 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.610
 or of good throws you put them to zero 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.760
 well by numerical order 1 0 1 2 3 such 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.770
 up to 21 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:28.320
 it's like to erase the energies that 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:30.600
 there was or what I had done you pick them up 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.610
 all on a map 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.670
 and you have several options one of the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.990
 options is to put it that way directly 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.510
 inside a wooden box 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.400
 who isolated them from everything and keep it 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.830
 above a piece of furniture inside a 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.400
 wardrobe where you want this is 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.300
 One option 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.730
 another option is to wrap it in silk in a 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.440
 silk lilac or purple color , the 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.280
 we wrap why then because the silk 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.340
 isolates from the energies that there may be in 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.250
 a house and another option is these sachets 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.409
 that they sell in esoteric stores that 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.859
 It is lined with silk 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.429
 you put there all those that you have 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:16.289
 and you keep it jce I would recommend that 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.569
 were always inside the drawer of 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.069
 a desk in a closet that does not 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.499
 was within reach of anyone so that 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.150
 you only touch them and they have 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:27.640
 your energies 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.650
 I have already told you in another lesson 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.300
 how to clean the letters then from time 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.610
 in when you clean them 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.960
 and you keep them and other times if you believe 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.690
 which is necessary because you keep them 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.580
 directly for the next time over 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.930
 everything when I started you start that we do not 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.990
 you throw the cards to anyone but the 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.790
 family or friends well too much 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.690
 people what they do is in the bag or in 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.970
 the box put a quartz pendulum or a 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.700
 amethyst because it helps to clean 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.190
 letters that have good energies and already 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.230
 this is how it is and this is how the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.230
 letters correctly until soon
