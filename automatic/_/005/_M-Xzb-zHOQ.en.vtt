mall<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.939> couldn't<00:01:21.869> expect<00:01:22.140> maybe<00:01:22.409> even<00:01:22.650> you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
mall I couldn't expect maybe even you

mall I couldn't expect maybe even you
know<00:01:23.840> for<00:01:24.840> example<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.259> i<00:01:25.380> invested<00:01:25.860> AE<00:01:26.100> care

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
know for example if i invested AE care

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.600 
know for example if i invested AE care
could<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:26.880> expect<00:01:27.210> maybe<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:28.259> know<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:29.280> I'm

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
actually had so you know it all depends

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
actually had so you know it all depends
on<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.170> market<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.680> honest<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.040> ps3<00:01:38.369> monk

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
on the market to be honest the ps3 monk

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.609 
on the market to be honest the ps3 monk
has<00:01:38.670> been<00:01:38.820> pretty<00:01:39.060> dead<00:01:39.240> at<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> moment<00:01:39.560> as<00:01:40.560> I

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
has been pretty dead at the moment as I

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.289 
has been pretty dead at the moment as I
think<00:01:41.009> as<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:42.000> not

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
think as you can see here it's not

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.889 
think as you can see here it's not
really<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.899> most<00:01:43.470> easiest<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.640> know<00:01:44.899> market

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
really the most easiest you know market

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.770 
really the most easiest you know market
to<00:01:46.020> actually<00:01:46.290> trade<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.220> think<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.329> xbox

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
to actually trade in I think the xbox

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.899 
to actually trade in I think the xbox
market<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.680> lot<00:01:49.829> more<00:01:49.979> easier<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.549> my

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
market is a lot more easier in my

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.819 
market is a lot more easier in my
opinion<00:01:51.390> because<00:01:51.899> there's<00:01:52.170> more<00:01:52.320> deals<00:01:52.619> going

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
opinion because there's more deals going

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.380 
opinion because there's more deals going
about<00:01:53.070> obviously<00:01:53.610> more<00:01:53.970> people<00:01:54.240> who<00:01:54.329> are

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
about obviously more people who are

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.670 
about obviously more people who are
pacts<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.140> know<00:01:55.229> put<00:01:55.439> them<00:01:55.530> up<00:01:55.649> for

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680

that Pennywise you know on the screen

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.910 
that Pennywise you know on the screen
now<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.780> actually<00:02:13.050> searching<00:02:13.500> for

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
now is actually searching for

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.699 
now is actually searching for
walruses<00:02:14.220> because<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.180> want<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.959> did

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
walruses because I want to I did

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.650 
walruses because I want to I did
actually<00:02:16.800> do<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.190> but<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:18.120> think<00:02:18.330> i<00:02:18.540> made

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
actually do this but I think i made

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.020 
actually do this but I think i made
about<00:02:18.780> 5<00:02:19.380> or<00:02:19.410> 6<00:02:19.560> k<00:02:19.860> profit<00:02:20.190> by<00:02:20.280> doing<00:02:20.459> this<00:02:20.580> but

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
about 5 or 6 k profit by doing this but

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.400 
about 5 or 6 k profit by doing this but
didn't<00:02:21.239> actually<00:02:21.330> record<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.170> series

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
didn't actually record it in this series

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.729 
didn't actually record it in this series
so<00:02:22.860> what<00:02:23.430> actually<00:02:23.550> want<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.880> do<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.630> such<00:02:25.530> as

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
so what actually want to do is I such as

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.440 
so what actually want to do is I such as
suarez<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.099> in<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.370> center<00:02:26.640> for<00:02:26.670> position<00:02:27.239> and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
suarez is in the center for position and

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.470 
suarez is in the center for position and
then<00:02:28.349> if<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:29.010> can<00:02:29.130> get<00:02:29.220> one<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:30.090> know<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.209> put

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
about 2 to 3 K under the market actually

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.760 
about 2 to 3 K under the market actually
the<00:02:32.790> market<00:02:33.090> price<00:02:33.239> then<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.050> will<00:02:34.230> apply<00:02:34.650> a

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770

centerfold stroke color onto him and

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.440 
centerfold stroke color onto him and
then<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.380> can<00:02:37.560> make<00:02:37.680> about<00:02:37.770> 72<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> profit<00:02:38.970> by

actually picked up quite a few already

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.660 
actually picked up quite a few already
mainly<00:03:58.079> quite<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.319> few<00:03:58.590> from<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.010> boxes<00:03:59.519> from

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
mainly quite a few from the boxes from

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.370 
mainly quite a few from the boxes from
League<00:03:59.940> silver<00:04:00.780> league<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:03.420> know<00:04:03.569> it<00:04:04.140> is

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
League silver league and you know it is

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.800 
League silver league and you know it is
a<00:04:04.410> pretty<00:04:04.709> good<00:04:04.920> lead<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.220> trade<00:04:05.430> in<00:04:05.810> apart

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
a pretty good lead to trade in apart

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.360 
a pretty good lead to trade in apart
from<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.109> goals<00:04:07.319> I<00:04:07.530> really<00:04:07.890> would<00:04:08.040> stay<00:04:08.220> away

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
from the goals I really would stay away

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.849 
from the goals I really would stay away
from<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.579> gold<00:04:08.819> gold<00:04:09.209> guys<00:04:09.480> I<00:04:10.109> think<00:04:10.709> they're

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
from the gold gold guys I think they're

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.860 
from the gold gold guys I think they're
pretty<00:04:11.040> awful<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.519> trade<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.790> think<00:04:12.090> mainly

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
pretty awful to trade I think mainly

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.300 
pretty awful to trade I think mainly
with<00:04:13.109> open<00:04:13.380> bids<00:04:13.590> is<00:04:13.739> pretty<00:04:14.010> much<00:04:14.100> impossible

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
with open bids is pretty much impossible

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.000 
with open bids is pretty much impossible
but<00:04:14.819> i<00:04:14.880> would<00:04:15.090> say<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:15.930> 59th<00:04:16.410> minute<00:04:16.500> is<00:04:16.799> worth

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
but i would say the 59th minute is worth

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.039 
but i would say the 59th minute is worth
