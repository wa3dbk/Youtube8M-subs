shot<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:11.129> just<00:02:11.310> crack<00:02:11.549> it<00:02:11.580> right<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
shot you just crack it right in the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.380 
shot you just crack it right in the
middle<00:02:12.269> and<00:02:12.420> basically<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.879> aim<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.180> tip

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
middle and basically I just aim the tip

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.390 
middle and basically I just aim the tip
of<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.599> stick<00:02:16.230> right<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> center<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
of the stick right to the center of the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.580 
of the stick right to the center of the
drum<00:02:17.519> just<00:02:20.660> really<00:02:21.660> no<00:02:21.810> special<00:02:22.170> trick<00:02:22.349> there

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
drum just really no special trick there

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.039 
drum just really no special trick there
but<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:23.580> second<00:02:23.970> approach<00:02:24.209> is<00:02:24.330> actually

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
but the second approach is actually

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.990 
but the second approach is actually
going<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.470> rim<00:02:25.620> shots<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.069> which<00:02:26.400> you

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
going for the rim shots in which you

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.910 
going for the rim shots in which you
actually<00:02:27.209> are<00:02:27.989> going<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.230> use<00:02:28.290> more<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.620> like

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
actually are going to use more of like

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.920 
actually are going to use more of like
one<00:02:29.459> quarter<00:02:29.819> of<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.940> stick<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.450> go<00:02:30.630> for<00:02:30.900> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
one quarter of the stick and go for the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.960 
one quarter of the stick and go for the
the<00:02:31.500> rim<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.890> drum<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:37.640> then<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.760> third

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
the rim of the drum and then the third

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.559 
the rim of the drum and then the third
is<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.750> more<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.470> subtle<00:02:40.829> thing<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.519> is<00:02:42.180> used

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
is a more of a subtle thing that is used

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.910 
is a more of a subtle thing that is used
when<00:02:42.840> playing<00:02:43.110> grooves<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.590> stuff<00:02:43.769> like<00:02:43.860> that

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
when playing grooves and stuff like that

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.229 
when playing grooves and stuff like that
and<00:02:44.190> it's<00:02:44.280> playing<00:02:44.519> ghost<00:02:44.730> notes<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.150> the

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
and it's playing ghost notes on the

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.449 
and it's playing ghost notes on the
snare<00:02:45.299> drum<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.840> that's<00:02:45.959> basically<00:02:46.459> filling

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
snare drum and that's basically filling

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.900 
snare drum and that's basically filling
in<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.670> gaps<00:02:47.910> with<00:02:48.090> really<00:02:48.569> low<00:02:48.780> dynamic

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
in the gaps with really low dynamic

00:02:49.910 --> 00:03:00.500 
in the gaps with really low dynamic
bounces<00:02:50.910> on<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.120> snare<00:02:51.329> drum<00:02:51.569> mic<00:02:59.030> and<00:03:00.030> as<00:03:00.389> you

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
bounces on the snare drum mic and as you

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.729 
bounces on the snare drum mic and as you
can<00:03:00.660> see<00:03:00.690> i'm<00:03:00.930> sort<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.200> filling<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.620> the

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
can see i'm sort of filling in the

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.920 
can see i'm sort of filling in the
grooves<00:03:02.010> there<00:03:02.310> with<00:03:02.639> my<00:03:02.790> left<00:03:03.030> hand<00:03:03.120> doing

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
grooves there with my left hand doing

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.809 
grooves there with my left hand doing
like<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.200> little<00:03:04.530> bounce<00:03:05.010> on<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> snare<00:03:05.579> and

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
like a little bounce on the snare and

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.069 
like a little bounce on the snare and
then<00:03:05.910> i'm<00:03:06.030> actually<00:03:06.180> playing<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.600> powerful

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
then i'm actually playing the powerful

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.750 
then i'm actually playing the powerful
strokes<00:03:07.260> with<00:03:07.470> my<00:03:07.590> right<00:03:07.769> hand<00:03:07.799> in<00:03:08.190> that

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
strokes with my right hand in that

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:22.570 
strokes with my right hand in that
particular<00:03:08.910> groove

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.480 

with<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.270> snare<00:03:23.570> drum<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.680> sound<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:25.040> go<00:03:25.190> for

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
with the snare drum the sound I go for

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.340 
with the snare drum the sound I go for
and<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:26.210> stroke<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:26.600> make<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.930> drum<00:03:27.200> is

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
and the stroke I make the drum is

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.040 
and the stroke I make the drum is
usually<00:03:27.770> a<00:03:27.950> combination<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.480> side<00:03:29.750> of<00:03:29.780> the

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
usually a combination of the side of the

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.620 
usually a combination of the side of the
stick<00:03:30.260> hitting<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.100> rim<00:03:31.250> and<00:03:31.600> hitting<00:03:32.600> the

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
stick hitting the rim and hitting the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.070 
stick hitting the rim and hitting the
center<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.200> drum<00:03:33.350> with<00:03:33.740> the<00:03:33.830> tip<00:03:38.080> let's

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
center of the drum with the tip let's

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.280 
center of the drum with the tip let's
just<00:03:39.170> become<00:03:39.560> my<00:03:39.740> sound<00:03:40.070> now<00:03:40.880> if<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:42.020> want<00:03:42.230> to

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
just become my sound now if I want to

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.050 
just become my sound now if I want to
get<00:03:42.440> more<00:03:42.620> ring<00:03:42.920> out<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.520> drum<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:43.880> don't

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
get more ring out of the drum I don't

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.120 
get more ring out of the drum I don't
hit<00:03:44.210> in<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.360> center<00:03:44.660> hit<00:03:44.840> more<00:03:45.050> to<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.230> edge

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.030 

more<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.250> center<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:50.470> little<00:03:51.470> bit<00:03:51.590> fatter<00:03:51.860> a

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
more the center a little bit fatter a

more the center a little bit fatter a
little<00:03:52.220> bit<00:03:52.310> drier

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
playing it came from playing rock and

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.760 
playing it came from playing rock and
roll<00:04:22.530> where<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:23.070> come<00:04:23.850> down<00:04:24.350> with<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.380> side<00:04:25.740> of

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:22.749 
the other one is the double stroke which

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:24.959 
the other one is the double stroke which
is<00:05:22.870> a<00:05:22.900> rebound<00:05:23.409> you<00:05:24.039> throw<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.520> stick<00:05:24.789> down

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:24.969 
is a rebound you throw the stick down

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.510 
is a rebound you throw the stick down
once<00:05:25.389> and<00:05:25.749> you<00:05:26.349> get<00:05:26.529> two<00:05:26.710> strokes<00:05:27.069> out<00:05:27.219> of<00:05:27.370> it

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
once and you get two strokes out of it

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.360 
once and you get two strokes out of it
like<00:05:27.669> this<00:05:28.919> the<00:05:29.919> wrist<00:05:30.159> only<00:05:30.490> moves<00:05:30.699> once

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
like this the wrist only moves once

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.309 
like this the wrist only moves once
looks<00:05:33.370> and<00:05:33.550> what<00:05:33.699> basically<00:05:34.150> happens<00:05:34.270> is<00:05:34.870> you

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
looks and what basically happens is you

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.429 
looks and what basically happens is you
throw<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:35.770> stick<00:05:36.069> down<00:05:36.400> and<00:05:36.909> as<00:05:37.840> it<00:05:38.050> comes<00:05:38.289> up

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:38.439 
throw the stick down and as it comes up

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:41.240 
throw the stick down and as it comes up
naturally<00:05:39.129> you<00:05:39.249> let<00:05:39.430> your<00:05:39.580> fingers<00:05:39.789> open<00:05:40.180> up

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
naturally you let your fingers open up

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.309 
naturally you let your fingers open up
like<00:05:42.250> this<00:05:42.310> so<00:05:42.909> there's<00:05:43.599> stick<00:05:43.810> down<00:05:44.020> the

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 
like this so there's stick down the

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.350 
like this so there's stick down the
fingers<00:05:44.710> open<00:05:44.949> up<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.580> stick<00:05:45.789> comes<00:05:46.060> back

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
fingers open up the stick comes back

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.540 
fingers open up the stick comes back
your<00:05:46.870> risk<00:05:47.080> doesn't<00:05:47.319> move<00:05:47.620> and<00:05:47.860> then<00:05:48.370> you

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
your risk doesn't move and then you

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.070 
your risk doesn't move and then you
throw<00:05:48.819> the<00:05:49.000> stick<00:05:49.240> back<00:05:49.419> down<00:05:49.719> with<00:05:49.990> your

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
throw the stick back down with your

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.290 
throw the stick back down with your
fingers<00:05:53.370> that's<00:05:54.370> known<00:05:54.699> as<00:05:54.729> the<00:05:54.969> double

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
fingers that's known as the double

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:04.830 
fingers that's known as the double
stroke

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.750 

on<00:06:05.470> the<00:06:05.740> crash<00:06:06.010> cymbals<00:06:08.130> let<00:06:09.130> my<00:06:09.280> whole<00:06:09.490> body

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
on the crash cymbals let my whole body

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.750 
on the crash cymbals let my whole body
throw<00:06:10.180> itself<00:06:10.540> into<00:06:10.990> the<00:06:11.110> symbol<00:06:11.430> to<00:06:12.430> get<00:06:12.610> more

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
throw itself into the symbol to get more

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.110 
throw itself into the symbol to get more
power<00:06:14.370> but<00:06:15.370> obviously<00:06:15.760> if<00:06:15.880> you're<00:06:15.970> playing

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
power but obviously if you're playing

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:23.040 
power but obviously if you're playing
something<00:06:16.419> soft<00:06:16.810> you<00:06:17.500> know<00:06:17.620> I<00:06:21.690> don't<00:06:22.690> need<00:06:22.870> to

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
something soft you know I don't need to

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.460 
something soft you know I don't need to
use<00:06:23.139> that<00:06:23.350> full<00:06:23.560> power<00:06:23.800> stroke<00:06:25.110> but<00:06:26.110> I<00:06:26.169> always

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
use that full power stroke but I always

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.590 
use that full power stroke but I always
have<00:06:26.800> that<00:06:26.979> motion<00:06:27.490> it<00:06:28.120> helps<00:06:28.449> with<00:06:28.570> the

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
have that motion it helps with the

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:37.590 
have that motion it helps with the
groove<00:06:34.110> ready<00:06:35.110> to<00:06:35.229> go<00:06:35.350> here
