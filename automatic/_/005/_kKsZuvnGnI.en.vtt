00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
why I've letting it air dry just see if

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.219 
why I've letting it air dry just see if
it<00:00:45.580> works<00:00:45.790> without<00:00:46.180> using<00:00:46.540> any<00:00:46.809> kind<00:00:47.049> of

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:47.229 
it works without using any kind of

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.270 
it works without using any kind of
people<00:00:47.949> artists<00:00:48.159> on<00:00:48.339> it's<00:00:48.549> a<00:00:48.610> giant<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.860> then

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
people artists on it's a giant so then

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.049 
people artists on it's a giant so then
I'm<00:00:51.400> going<00:00:51.580> to<00:00:51.640> curl<00:00:51.820> my<00:00:51.940> hair<00:00:52.089> and<00:00:52.330> then<00:00:52.809> um

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
I'm going to curl my hair and then um

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.670

works<00:00:56.860> um<00:00:57.309> but<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.510> reason<00:00:58.690> why<00:00:58.960> i'm<00:00:59.019> curling

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
works um but the reason why i'm curling

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.160 
works um but the reason why i'm curling
my<00:00:59.559> hair<00:00:59.589> after<00:01:00.299> it<00:01:01.299> aired<00:01:01.540> arises<00:01:01.809> because

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
my hair after it aired arises because

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.869 
my hair after it aired arises because
the<00:01:02.500> curl<00:01:02.680> holds<00:01:02.979> a<00:01:03.040> little<00:01:03.250> bit<00:01:03.369> better<00:01:03.580> than

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
the curl holds a little bit better than

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.330 
the curl holds a little bit better than
if<00:01:04.239> I<00:01:04.449> blow<00:01:04.629> dry<00:01:04.839> for<00:01:05.080> blow<00:01:05.530> drying<00:01:05.830> kind<00:01:06.190> of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
if I blow dry for blow drying kind of

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.520 
if I blow dry for blow drying kind of
makes<00:01:06.670> it<00:01:06.880> straighter<00:01:07.510> and<00:01:07.780> that's<00:01:08.290> it<00:01:08.409> really

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
makes it straighter and that's it really

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.460 
makes it straighter and that's it really
hold<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:08.979> curl<00:01:09.189> as<00:01:09.400> well<00:01:09.640> so<00:01:10.290> we're<00:01:11.290> going<00:01:11.380> to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
hold a curl as well so we're going to

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.530 
hold a curl as well so we're going to
test<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:11.890> with<00:01:12.070> just<00:01:12.430> air<00:01:12.729> drying<00:01:12.939> it<00:01:13.180> and<00:01:13.360> then

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
test it with just air drying it and then

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.790 
test it with just air drying it and then
we'll<00:01:14.350> see<00:01:14.650> how<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.100> frizzies<00:01:15.820> holds<00:01:16.600> up<00:01:16.800> um
