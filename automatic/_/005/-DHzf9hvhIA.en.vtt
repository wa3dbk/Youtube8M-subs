00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:17.939
 [Music] 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.790
 good continuing once connected to 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.760
 our programmer to our 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.790
 computer we will enter the page 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.270
 of penguin here have the address for 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:36.120
 that you can download all the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.570
 files and everything you need to know 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.660
 on this penguin platform what 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.690
 we are going to download is the first version 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.690
 here in downloads bootloader version 1 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.660
 expand we download this file to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:57.240
 who are using peak 18 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.730
 efe 25 50 if you are using peak 18 efe 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:04.280
 45 50 that can also be done with 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.140
 this pick download from version 2.12 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.860
 once downloaded I already have it 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:14.479
 downloaded I will proceed to do the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.930
 de del del pib for this to open 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.510
 the application that I have here the piquito 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.090
 two 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.870
 will allow us to do the engraving in 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.670
 our plate because here we have 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.800
 open the program recognizes it 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.590
 perfectly at the peak that is the peak 18 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.000
 f 25 50 this is totally in 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.510
 White 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.200
 what we are going to do is record for this 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.680
 let's import x 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.820
 I will locate myself 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.440
 download file 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:53.630
 and I have already downloaded the bootloader 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:57.020
 what is a hexadecimal file we open 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.149
 and we put in wright 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.700
 with this it is loading or it is 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.320
 keeping recording at our peak the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.320
 bootloader which will allow 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.060
 that our peak can emulate the 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.830
 programs and Chinese arduino sketch or 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.060
 that we are already able to verify if 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.060
 we want to verify 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.770
 ok it's all perfect already recorded now 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.710
 what are we going to do the next step 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.980
 is to place our pick to our plate 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.590
 that we just finished welding and 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.230
 put all the components 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.890
 and then let's continue 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.930
 what we are going to do now is to try the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.659
 we are going to connect it to the pc and we are going to 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.280
 install your drivers so let's go 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.270
 then to see that the software 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.570
 we need 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.080
 ok continuing with the explanation 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:59.170
 also from about penguin the following 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.380
 step will connect our penguin to 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.170
 usb port of our computer that I 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.080
 I'm going to do it now ok 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.950
 the following we are working on this 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.610
 case in windows 7 we will install the 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.680
 drivers for this we are headed or 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.099
 we download from the official website 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.050
 of penguin here we have for example a 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.350
 tutorial also on how to install it 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.920
 in windows 7 it is in english but what 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.410
 can translate and can see what is 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.239
 simple to install the first thing says that 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.000
 we must download the drivers 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.930
 to install it on our pc I 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.230
 I already have it downloaded 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.790
 here to my pc 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:49.239
 what is this 475-byte file what 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.239
 we execute 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.230
 we accept install next 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.230
 this is the route where you are going to install 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.450
 our our controllers and there 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.150
 we must also point at the 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.680
 device manager if 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.260
 we continue installing 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.390
 ok is already installed now we have to 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.840
 go to the properties of our team 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.550
 we go to team properties 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.570
 and we're going to go to administrator 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.890
 dispositives 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:24.020
 and here as you can see, it comes out and we 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.180
 recognizes the device says penguin 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.650
 project what we are going to do is 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.970
 update your driver we select 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.460
 We can update software 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.889
 driver search software 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.229
 controller on the computer 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:43.360
 we examined and remember that it had 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:47.680
 installed in program files 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.300
 it's called lip usb that's the route of the 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.500
 drivers then we go to 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.330
 select drivers accept and next 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.220
 we get a warning that the 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.050
 driver software 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.930
 you may 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.610
 is not classified or is suitable for 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.070
 Our team what we do is 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.520
 install the software anyway 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.010
 and with this it indicates that it was finished 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.560
 correctly ok with this is already 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.330
 installed our driver our 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.720
 controller to be able to control the 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.910
 penguin that simple is the 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.010
 next step will install the others 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.790
 components that are needed to be able 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:34.500
 program this microcontroller to 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.300
 this we also follow in the tutorial of 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.950
 of a penguin tells us that we should 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:44.490
 install python version 2.6 wx python 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:48.000
 2.5 and usb 2.6 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.900
 I already have it downloaded, you are these 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 records 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.529
 I have it here then we are going to install 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.059
 first python 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:06:01.059
 version 2.6 since the leader 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.919
 of the penguin uses python as 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.740
 programming base language 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:13.130
 then we install like any other 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.130
 Program 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.409
 we wait for the installation to finish 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:31.980
 ok it 's finished now let's 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:35.340
 install this wx python which is also 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:39.830
 a component which is going to act as 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:42.830
 a bridge to our penguin 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.830
 we install 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.160
 let's leave these two selected 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.820
 so you can compile the scripts 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:07.670
 python we finalize is going to be all the 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:10.520
 process also the compilation of 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.700
 bookstores that is now we are going to 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:17.750
 install usb which is the driver that 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:20.000
 also uses python to send 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:24.529
 messages through the serial port of 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.439
 usb then we install finish 

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:30.559
 with this we have installed the 

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:35.779
 necessary components to be able to use 

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:38.580
 the id of of penguin we can follow 

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:42.229
 seeing also our 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.229
 our tutorial too
