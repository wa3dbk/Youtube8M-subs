00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.100
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.470
 new tutorial presented by happiness 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.010
 so says today a new potion 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.890
 magical 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.930
 so we'll see how together 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.740
 optimize the display including 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.510
 windows 7 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.400
 because ben it's true it's a 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.710
 big handicap on windows 7 is that 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.710
 all these translucent effects and so on 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.469
 eat a lot of food and so 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.210
 to further optimize your system but 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.030
 without the coachmen could not without him 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.040
 take a little off its originality 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.920
 we will see together so how 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.590
 optimize this nice display so for 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.550
 we go here we will right click 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.950
 on computer we will make properties and 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.740
 in the property were so worth in 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.110
 system protection 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.210
 so here are advanced system settings 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.820
 I'm cheated I get to click 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.430
 directly there we go in the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.350
 performances and so we'll put 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.140
 we will put personal settings 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.500
 personalized by we have by m here 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.770
 personalized so what are we going 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.920
 make 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.090
 already we will activate the display of 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:32.420
 transparent so we'll disable it 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:36.140
 here you also disable and from 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:40.380
 animate the control the elements 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.240
 ie here so you uncheck for 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.509
 the next four is unchecked 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.759
 so here after you do so 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.950
 applied ok me I can not do it 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.040
 because my capture software 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.380
 it's going to derail him 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.060
 but once you do apply ok 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.409
 you restart your machine you 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.700
 will see that you will still leave a 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.530
 little effect rather not too bad of your 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.970
 windows 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.869
 it's just going to take away transparency here 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.060
 from there and re clearly it's rather 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.190
 not bad and you 'll see you won 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.830
 still a good 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.950
 - good 10% of ram power 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.540
 consume less and so that's so 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.319
 tested and approved by the Nordic Bo 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.499
 as usual 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.629
 so new potion I wish you to 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.889
 all full of good things and I you 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.819
 say very soon about the happiness of 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.819
 go it's him
