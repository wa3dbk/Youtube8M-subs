to leave here with with two points to
bonnie<00:02:09.790> is<00:02:09.970> it's<00:02:10.660> not<00:02:10.869> much<00:02:11.110> but<00:02:11.380> it's<00:02:11.440> it's

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
bonnie is it's not much but it's it's

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.220 
bonnie is it's not much but it's it's
it's<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:14.410> know<00:02:14.500> it's<00:02:14.560> at<00:02:15.040> least<00:02:15.190> leading<00:02:15.550> so

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
it's you know it's at least leading so

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.750 
it's you know it's at least leading so
you<00:02:17.230> know<00:02:17.320> we<00:02:17.470> still<00:02:17.680> there's<00:02:18.070> still<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.490> lot<00:02:18.730> of

you know we still there's still a lot of

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.700 
you know we still there's still a lot of
racing<00:02:19.150> left<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.600> we<00:02:19.900> have<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.140> keep<00:02:20.260> focused

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
racing left and we have to keep focused

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.790 
racing left and we have to keep focused
and<00:02:20.830> keep<00:02:21.610> pushing<00:02:21.940> forward<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:23.680> know

know that you can really kind of maybe

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.740 
know that you can really kind of maybe
slow<00:03:09.070> down<00:03:09.250> just<00:03:09.490> a<00:03:09.670> little<00:03:09.820> bit<00:03:09.940> last<00:03:10.420> three

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
slow down just a little bit last three

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.320 
slow down just a little bit last three
laps<00:03:10.930> but<00:03:11.230> up<00:03:11.350> until<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.680> point<00:03:11.970> it's<00:03:12.970> you

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
laps but up until that point it's you

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.300 
laps but up until that point it's you
know<00:03:13.420> we<00:03:13.600> all<00:03:13.780> keep<00:03:14.050> pushing<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.500> real<00:03:14.680> we're

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
know we all keep pushing it real we're

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.250 
know we all keep pushing it real we're
kind<00:03:15.489> of<00:03:15.550> gauging<00:03:15.910> where<00:03:16.030> each<00:03:16.120> other<00:03:16.239> are<00:03:16.420> if

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
kind of gauging where each other are if

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.550 
kind of gauging where each other are if
you<00:03:17.739> can<00:03:17.920> do<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:19.390> just<00:03:20.170> keep<00:03:20.380> pushing

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
you can do that and just keep pushing

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.050 
you can do that and just keep pushing
because<00:03:20.800> you<00:03:21.100> know<00:03:21.220> these<00:03:21.519> guys<00:03:21.670> over<00:03:21.850> here

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
think you know kind of just my riding

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.890 
think you know kind of just my riding
style<00:04:00.070> a<00:04:00.220> little<00:04:00.549> more<00:04:00.700> on<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.060> edge<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.690> not

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
style a little more on the edge and not

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.450 
style a little more on the edge and not
so<00:04:02.170> precise<00:04:02.620> but<00:04:02.920> they<00:04:03.549> don't<00:04:03.790> is<00:04:03.940> a<00:04:03.970> unique

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
so precise but they don't is a unique

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.520 
so precise but they don't is a unique
like<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:04.820> said<00:04:04.880> it<00:04:05.630> has<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:06.170> little<00:04:06.380> bit

like I said it has a little bit
everything<00:04:07.010> it<00:04:07.130> has<00:04:07.280> real<00:04:08.270> real<00:04:08.600> super<00:04:08.900> cross

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
everything it has real real super cross

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.470 
everything it has real real super cross
sections<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:09.800> real<00:04:10.340> outdoor<00:04:10.730> sections<00:04:11.210> and

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
sections and real outdoor sections and

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.400 
sections and real outdoor sections and
and<00:04:11.690> then<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:12.290> have<00:04:12.380> a<00:04:12.650> mix<00:04:13.370> of<00:04:13.520> both<00:04:13.550> so<00:04:14.410> it's

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
and then you have a mix of both so it's

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.210 
and then you have a mix of both so it's
a<00:04:15.500> tough<00:04:15.710> track<00:04:16.040> and<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:18.380> lighting<00:04:18.650> isn't<00:04:18.980> the

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
a tough track and the lighting isn't the

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.860 
a tough track and the lighting isn't the
greatest<00:04:19.430> out<00:04:19.970> there<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:20.420> there<00:04:20.570> is<00:04:20.690> some

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
greatest out there so there is some

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.180 
greatest out there so there is some
shadows<00:04:21.290> and<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.500> ruts<00:04:21.710> and<00:04:21.890> things<00:04:22.100> like

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
shadows and the ruts and things like

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.800 
shadows and the ruts and things like
that<00:04:22.250> so<00:04:22.430> you<00:04:22.670> have<00:04:22.790> to<00:04:22.910> really<00:04:23.180> watch<00:04:23.600> where

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
that so you have to really watch where

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.240 
that so you have to really watch where
you're<00:04:23.930> going<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:24.290> make<00:04:24.530> sure<00:04:24.560> that<00:04:24.710> you<00:04:25.160> know

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
you're going and make sure that you know

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.860 
you're going and make sure that you know
the<00:04:25.490> rut<00:04:25.670> gets<00:04:25.910> a<00:04:26.030> little<00:04:26.150> too<00:04:26.450> deep<00:04:26.660> or

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
the rut gets a little too deep or

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.390 
the rut gets a little too deep or
something<00:04:27.110> like<00:04:27.170> that<00:04:27.260> you<00:04:27.410> try<00:04:27.950> to<00:04:28.010> change<00:04:28.250> it

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
something like that you try to change it

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.439 
something like that you try to change it
up<00:04:28.550> because<00:04:29.740> it's<00:04:30.740> kind<00:04:30.980> of<00:04:31.100> hard<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:31.280> see

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.509 

ah
