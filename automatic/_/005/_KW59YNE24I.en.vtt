make sure this groove here is that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.260 
make sure this groove here is that
obviously<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.670> would<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:47.909> been<00:01:48.000> locked

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
obviously this would have been locked

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.940 
obviously this would have been locked
off<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.780> actually<00:01:49.200> you've<00:01:49.350> lined<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.740> that

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
off so actually you've lined up that

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.030 
off so actually you've lined up that
groove<00:01:50.310> with<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.119> take<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.869> off<00:01:52.040> and

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
groove with this we can take you off and

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.109 
groove with this we can take you off and
in<00:01:53.189> there<00:01:54.680> you<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.070> little<00:01:56.280> piece

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
in there you have that little piece

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.819 
in there you have that little piece
that's<00:01:57.450> holding<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.960> there<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.649> twist

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
that's holding it in there so you twist

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.540 
that's holding it in there so you twist
it<00:01:59.450> and

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
it and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.340 
it and
line<00:02:02.550> it<00:02:02.730> up<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.480> put<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:04.200> up

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
line it up so you can just put it up

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.070 
line it up so you can just put it up
this<00:02:04.830> is<00:02:04.980> where<00:02:05.210> if<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.480> bit<00:02:06.600> stuck<00:02:06.900> you

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
this is where if it's a bit stuck you

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.580 
this is where if it's a bit stuck you
might<00:02:07.230> need<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.500> use<00:02:07.530> them<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:10.350> small

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
might need to use them the small

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.540 
might need to use them the small
screwdriver<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:12.470> small<00:02:13.470> screwdriver<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:16.550> from

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
underneath just put it there you go it's

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:36.770 
underneath just put it there you go it's
off<00:02:31.100> side<00:02:32.540> get<00:02:33.540> your<00:02:33.720> new<00:02:33.930> one<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.630> gonna

off side get your new one this is gonna

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:45.220 
off side get your new one this is gonna
be<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.080> new<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.970> need<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.270> do<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:43.490> your<00:02:44.490> new

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
be the new you need to do is your new

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.720 
be the new you need to do is your new
levers<00:02:46.230> most<00:02:46.590> likely<00:02:46.980> wouldn't<00:02:47.250> come<00:02:47.459> with

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
levers most likely wouldn't come with

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.530 
levers most likely wouldn't come with
the<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.930> pivot<00:02:49.520> which<00:02:50.520> is<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:50.910> your<00:02:51.120> old<00:02:51.270> one

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
the the pivot which is in your old one

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.970 
the the pivot which is in your old one
so<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:52.020> need<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.260> remove<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.800> old<00:02:53.010> pivot

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
so you need to remove the old pivot

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.160 
so you need to remove the old pivot
should<00:02:55.980> just<00:02:56.160> come<00:02:56.340> out<00:02:56.550> if<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.540> poke<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.990> from

should just come out if you poke it from
the<00:02:58.320> back<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:59.010> want<00:02:59.760> just<00:03:00.060> come<00:03:00.330> out<00:03:03.140> just<00:03:04.140> take

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
the back I want just come out just take
