Assassin's<00:02:41.010> Creed<00:02:41.250> wasn't<00:02:42.030> really<00:02:42.209> expecting

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
Assassin's Creed wasn't really expecting

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.630 
Assassin's Creed wasn't really expecting
to<00:02:42.690> be<00:02:42.870> such<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> huge<00:02:43.650> jump<00:02:43.950> graphically

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
to be such a huge jump graphically

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.699 
to be such a huge jump graphically
because<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.180> was<00:02:45.480> basically<00:02:45.720> designed<00:02:46.049> for

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
because it was basically designed for

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.830 
because it was basically designed for
current<00:02:46.980> platforms<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:47.760> then<00:02:48.239> poured<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.690> up

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
current platforms and then poured it up

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.310 
current platforms and then poured it up
I<00:02:49.019> would<00:02:49.260> think<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.209> PlayStation<00:02:51.989> 4<00:02:52.230> and

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
I would think to the PlayStation 4 and

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.140 
I would think to the PlayStation 4 and
the<00:02:52.380> Xbox<00:02:52.440> one<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.670> wasn't<00:02:54.060> really

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
the Xbox one so I wasn't really

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.000 
the Xbox one so I wasn't really
expecting<00:02:54.420> anything<00:02:54.720> really<00:02:55.230> big<00:02:55.500> but<00:02:55.829> what
