job I've got a good signal here reading
nickel<00:00:36.860> in<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:37.640> nickel<00:00:37.999> range<00:00:38.379> about<00:00:40.719> six

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
nickel in the nickel range about six

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.910 
nickel in the nickel range about six
inches<00:00:42.019> deep<00:00:42.260> I<00:00:43.120> found<00:00:44.120> this<00:00:44.710> which<00:00:45.710> i<00:00:45.859> think

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
inches deep I found this which i think

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.389 
inches deep I found this which i think
is<00:00:46.850> a<00:00:46.909> lipstick<00:00:50.019> crap<00:00:51.019> there's<00:00:51.889> another<00:00:52.129> piece

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
is a lipstick crap there's another piece

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.930 
is a lipstick crap there's another piece
to<00:00:52.460> it

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
to it

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.619 
to it
where'd<00:00:53.149> it<00:00:53.179> go<00:00:53.569> where's<00:00:54.499> the<00:00:54.620> other<00:00:54.739> piece

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
where'd it go where's the other piece

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.389 
where'd it go where's the other piece
there's<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.749> bottom<00:00:56.929> of<00:00:57.229> it<00:00:57.350> or<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.859> cap<00:00:58.100> to

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
there's the bottom of it or the cap to

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.920 
there's the bottom of it or the cap to
it<00:00:59.469> and<00:01:00.469> there's<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:02.449> thing<00:01:02.690> itself

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
it and there's the thing itself

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.470 
it and there's the thing itself
so<00:01:05.530> I<00:01:05.920> don't<00:01:06.700> know<00:01:06.760> how<00:01:06.880> long<00:01:07.060> it's<00:01:07.270> been<00:01:07.330> since

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
so I don't know how long it's been since

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.950 
so I don't know how long it's been since
they<00:01:07.780> made<00:01:07.960> lipsticks<00:01:08.380> out<00:01:08.500> of<00:01:08.620> metal<00:01:08.770> but

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
they made lipsticks out of metal but

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:21.090 
they made lipsticks out of metal but
first<00:01:10.960> fine<00:01:11.310> pretty<00:01:12.310> cool

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.460 

so<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:23.060> de<00:01:23.270> hunt<00:01:23.540> was<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:23.810> bust

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
so the de hunt was a bust

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.880 
so the de hunt was a bust
I<00:01:25.030> was<00:01:26.030> only<00:01:26.120> out<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.420> get<00:01:26.660> I<00:01:27.020> was<00:01:27.260> only<00:01:27.440> able<00:01:27.650> to

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
I was only out to get I was only able to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.230 
I was only out to get I was only able to
get<00:01:28.070> out<00:01:28.160> for<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.430> couple<00:01:28.940> of<00:01:29.000> hours<00:01:29.150> anyway

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
get out for a couple of hours anyway

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.570 
get out for a couple of hours anyway
went<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.300> that<00:01:32.360> field<00:01:32.660> I<00:01:32.780> showed<00:01:33.020> you<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:34.460> only

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
went in that field I showed you the only

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.970 
went in that field I showed you the only
thing<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:34.850> found<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.210> any<00:01:35.270> interest<00:01:35.720> was<00:01:35.870> that

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
thing I found of any interest was that

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.700 
thing I found of any interest was that
that<00:01:36.980> lipstick<00:01:37.540> found<00:01:38.540> a<00:01:38.600> lump<00:01:38.780> of<00:01:38.930> lead<00:01:39.080> from

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
that lipstick found a lump of lead from

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.220 
that lipstick found a lump of lead from
our<00:01:39.800> little<00:01:39.980> bullet<00:01:40.310> probably<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:41.230> beaver

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
our little bullet probably and beaver

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.380 
our little bullet probably and beaver
tail<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.800> stuff<00:01:42.980> like<00:01:43.130> that<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:44.120> field

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
tail and stuff like that so the field

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.260 
tail and stuff like that so the field
shows<00:01:44.750> some<00:01:45.170> signs<00:01:45.410> of<00:01:45.680> life<00:01:45.860> some<00:01:46.820> sides<00:01:47.060> of

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
shows some signs of life some sides of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.380 
shows some signs of life some sides of
age<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.590> we'll<00:01:48.740> definitely<00:01:48.860> be<00:01:49.220> back<00:01:49.400> but

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
age so we'll definitely be back but

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.070 
age so we'll definitely be back but
towards<00:01:51.230> the<00:01:51.290> end<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.560> hunt<00:01:51.800> my<00:01:53.080> Garrett

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
towards the end of the hunt my Garrett

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.210 
towards the end of the hunt my Garrett
ace<00:01:54.260> 250<00:01:54.710> started<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.340> go<00:01:55.460> haywire<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.770> screen

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
ace 250 started to go haywire the screen

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.560 
ace 250 started to go haywire the screen
would<00:01:58.340> go<00:01:58.520> blank<00:01:58.990> segments<00:01:59.990> would<00:02:00.160> fall<00:02:01.160> out

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
would go blank segments would fall out

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.050 
would go blank segments would fall out
the<00:02:02.570> audio<00:02:02.930> part<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:03.590> never<00:02:03.800> changed<00:02:04.490> so<00:02:05.030> I

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
the audio part of it never changed so I

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.790 
the audio part of it never changed so I
didn't<00:02:05.509> think<00:02:06.170> it<00:02:06.290> was<00:02:06.380> part<00:02:06.680> of<00:02:06.710> the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
didn't think it was part of the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.910 
didn't think it was part of the
processing<00:02:07.369> board<00:02:07.550> itself<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.649> would<00:02:09.649> still

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
processing board itself I would still

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.520 
processing board itself I would still
beep<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.850> know<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.330> if<00:02:11.630> I<00:02:11.750> press<00:02:12.020> on<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:12.410> in

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
beep you know and if I press on it in

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.010 
beep you know and if I press on it in
certain<00:02:12.740> spots<00:02:13.160> everything<00:02:13.760> would<00:02:13.970> come<00:02:14.840> to

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
certain spots everything would come to

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.010 
certain spots everything would come to
life<00:02:15.200> as<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.530> should<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.010> show<00:02:17.000> me<00:02:17.209> you<00:02:17.930> know

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
life as it should and show me you know

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.470 
life as it should and show me you know
depth<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.850> target<00:02:19.850> indication<00:02:20.360> and

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
depth and target indication and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.140 
depth and target indication and
everything<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.459> pinpoint<00:02:22.459> was<00:02:22.610> working<00:02:22.940> fine

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
everything so pinpoint was working fine

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.630 
everything so pinpoint was working fine
except<00:02:24.050> for<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.320> LCD<00:02:24.650> pie<00:02:25.010> wasn't<00:02:25.250> lighting

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
except for the LCD pie wasn't lighting

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.710 
except for the LCD pie wasn't lighting
up<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:27.850> came<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.060> conclusion<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.600> it

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
up so I came to the conclusion that it

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.390 
up so I came to the conclusion that it
was<00:02:29.810> time<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.080> take<00:02:30.230> her<00:02:30.380> apart<00:02:30.470> again<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.160> I

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
was time to take her apart again and I

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.950 
was time to take her apart again and I
think<00:02:31.459> what<00:02:31.820> happened<00:02:32.209> was

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.700 

this<00:02:36.800> part<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.250> circuit<00:02:37.730> that<00:02:38.710> connects

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
this part of the circuit that connects

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.750 
this part of the circuit that connects
to<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.130> LCD<00:02:40.700> screen<00:02:40.760> itself<00:02:41.540> over<00:02:42.410> here<00:02:42.830> all

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
to the LCD screen itself over here all

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.950 
to the LCD screen itself over here all
these<00:02:43.970> little<00:02:44.210> tiny<00:02:44.800> solder<00:02:45.800> joints<00:02:46.840> some<00:02:47.840> of

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
these little tiny solder joints some of

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.130 
these little tiny solder joints some of
them<00:02:48.050> were<00:02:48.460> busted<00:02:49.460> from<00:02:50.330> when<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.570> installed

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
them were busted from when I installed

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.890 
them were busted from when I installed
the<00:02:51.380> LED<00:02:52.370> lights<00:02:52.670> on<00:02:54.850> this<00:02:55.850> part<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.360> the

the LED lights on this part of the
detector<00:02:57.440> up<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.340> here's<00:02:58.550> my<00:02:58.730> LEDs<00:02:59.180> and

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
detector up and here's my LEDs and

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.430 
detector up and here's my LEDs and
there's<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.290> wire<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:01.390> so<00:03:02.390> what<00:03:03.320> I'm

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
there's the wire for it so what I'm

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.800 
there's the wire for it so what I'm
doing<00:03:03.470> is<00:03:03.890> I'm<00:03:04.070> taking<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.670> little<00:03:05.510> bit<00:03:05.600> of<00:03:05.690> that

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
doing is I'm taking a little bit of that

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.150 
doing is I'm taking a little bit of that
cat5<00:03:06.580> bare<00:03:07.580> copper<00:03:07.880> wire<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.740> jumping<00:03:09.740> this

lead to the post back and forth with
individual<00:03:15.050> ones<00:03:15.490> so<00:03:16.490> that<00:03:17.410> it'll<00:03:18.410> be<00:03:18.590> all

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
individual ones so that it'll be all

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.210 
individual ones so that it'll be all
connected<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.460> work<00:03:19.850> properly<00:03:21.010> it's<00:03:22.010> very

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
connected and work properly it's very

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.240 
connected and work properly it's very

inside encased inside the solder so when

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.560 
inside encased inside the solder so when
I<00:03:42.260> lifted<00:03:42.650> this<00:03:42.860> screen<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:44.180> try<00:03:44.360> and

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
I lifted this screen to try and

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.820 
I lifted this screen to try and
backlight<00:03:45.020> behind<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.740> which<00:03:46.670> proved<00:03:47.330> to<00:03:47.450> be

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
backlight behind it which proved to be

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.510 
backlight behind it which proved to be
not<00:03:48.830> possible

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
not possible

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.940 
not possible
I<00:03:49.670> must<00:03:50.480> have<00:03:50.630> moved<00:03:51.110> it<00:03:51.230> enough<00:03:51.440> times<00:03:51.710> to

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
I must have moved it enough times to

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.620 
I must have moved it enough times to
wiggle<00:03:52.280> these<00:03:52.460> into<00:03:52.820> breaking<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:54.080> know<00:03:54.230> so

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
wiggle these into breaking you know so

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.180 
wiggle these into breaking you know so
get<00:03:56.630> it<00:03:56.720> all<00:03:56.840> fixed<00:03:57.170> up<00:03:57.350> back<00:03:57.650> together<00:03:57.800> and

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
get it all fixed up back together and

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.840 
get it all fixed up back together and
figure<00:03:59.180> out<00:03:59.210> how<00:03:59.360> we<00:03:59.450> do<00:03:59.740> get<00:04:00.740> right<00:04:00.890> back<00:04:03.850> so

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
figure out how we do get right back so

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.140 
figure out how we do get right back so
here<00:04:05.030> we<00:04:05.150> have<00:04:05.300> it<00:04:06.160> all<00:04:07.160> put<00:04:07.730> back<00:04:07.970> together

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
here we have it all put back together

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.660 
here we have it all put back together
and<00:04:08.450> I<00:04:08.870> just<00:04:09.710> have<00:04:09.830> the<00:04:09.950> battery<00:04:10.250> cover<00:04:10.430> off

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
and I just have the battery cover off

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.420 
and I just have the battery cover off
still<00:04:11.000> right<00:04:11.420> there<00:04:11.660> I<00:04:11.840> put<00:04:12.740> that<00:04:12.890> I<00:04:13.100> plugged

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
still right there I put that I plugged

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.380 
still right there I put that I plugged
this<00:04:13.580> in<00:04:14.200> now<00:04:15.200> this<00:04:15.410> is<00:04:15.470> my<00:04:16.150> modification<00:04:17.150> for

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
this in now this is my modification for

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.250 
this in now this is my modification for
volume<00:04:17.690> control

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
volume control

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.940 
volume control
I<00:04:18.549> bought<00:04:19.549> a<00:04:19.900> volume<00:04:20.900> control<00:04:21.049> pod<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:21.799> that

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
I bought a volume control pod so that

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.280 
I bought a volume control pod so that
you<00:04:22.040> would<00:04:22.160> use<00:04:22.310> on<00:04:22.520> your<00:04:22.610> headphones<00:04:22.790> and

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.350 

shorten<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.380> cord<00:04:27.680> on<00:04:27.830> it<00:04:28.040> by<00:04:28.640> restoring<00:04:29.030> it

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
shorten the cord on it by restoring it

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.630 
shorten the cord on it by restoring it
to<00:04:29.390> the<00:04:29.540> board<00:04:29.780> inside<00:04:30.170> and<00:04:30.860> then<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:31.370> have<00:04:31.550> an

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
to the board inside and then I have an

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.720 
to the board inside and then I have an
adapter<00:04:32.210> that<00:04:33.080> goes<00:04:33.140> to<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.530> larger<00:04:34.010> size<00:04:34.310> for

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
adapter that goes to the larger size for

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.470 
adapter that goes to the larger size for
bigger<00:04:34.910> headphones<00:04:35.950> but<00:04:36.950> anyway<00:04:37.270> so<00:04:38.270> now<00:04:38.420> we

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
bigger headphones but anyway so now we

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.120 
bigger headphones but anyway so now we
turn<00:04:38.780> her<00:04:38.870> on<00:04:40.390> we<00:04:41.390> got<00:04:41.540> our<00:04:41.630> blue<00:04:41.780> LEDs<00:04:42.260> but

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
turn her on we got our blue LEDs but

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.840 
turn her on we got our blue LEDs but
besides<00:04:43.490> that<00:04:43.580> you<00:04:44.770> can<00:04:45.770> see<00:04:45.980> all<00:04:46.160> my<00:04:46.190> segments

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
besides that you can see all my segments

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.570 
besides that you can see all my segments
now<00:04:47.000> work

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
now work

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.640 
now work
and<00:04:48.670> if<00:04:48.790> you<00:04:48.910> rub<00:04:49.900> your<00:04:49.930> fingers<00:04:50.380> around<00:04:50.500> the

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
and if you rub your fingers around the

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.430 
and if you rub your fingers around the
backside<00:04:50.950> here<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.700> these<00:04:51.820> connections<00:04:52.450> you

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
backside here to these connections you

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.590 
backside here to these connections you
get<00:04:53.620> all<00:04:53.740> different<00:04:54.160> kinds<00:04:55.030> of<00:04:55.620> readings<00:04:57.600> but

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
get all different kinds of readings but

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.420 
get all different kinds of readings but
it's<00:04:59.140> going<00:04:59.350> a<00:04:59.380> little<00:04:59.440> hill<00:04:59.710> haywire<00:05:00.220> now

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
it's going a little hill haywire now

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.830 
it's going a little hill haywire now
because<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.730> coils<00:05:01.060> not<00:05:01.210> even<00:05:01.390> plugged<00:05:01.600> in

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
because the coils not even plugged in

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.550 
because the coils not even plugged in
but<00:05:02.470> you<00:05:02.590> can<00:05:02.740> see<00:05:02.890> all<00:05:03.040> my<00:05:04.110> segments<00:05:05.110> now<00:05:05.230> work

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
but you can see all my segments now work

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.010 
but you can see all my segments now work
all<00:05:05.830> of<00:05:05.980> my<00:05:06.130> LEDs<00:05:06.430> now<00:05:06.730> work<00:05:07.000> sensitivity<00:05:07.990> goes

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
all of my LEDs now work sensitivity goes

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.110 
all of my LEDs now work sensitivity goes
all<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:08.320> way<00:05:08.410> up<00:05:11.760> batteries<00:05:12.760> at<00:05:12.940> three

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
all the way up batteries at three

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.200 
all the way up batteries at three
quarters<00:05:13.390> I<00:05:13.750> used<00:05:13.930> rechargeable<00:05:14.620> batteries

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
quarters I used rechargeable batteries

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.120 
quarters I used rechargeable batteries
they<00:05:16.210> tend<00:05:16.450> to<00:05:16.510> discharge<00:05:17.140> and<00:05:17.620> run<00:05:18.010> out

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
they tend to discharge and run out

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.750 
they tend to discharge and run out
faster<00:05:18.730> than<00:05:19.600> disposable<00:05:20.560> batteries<00:05:20.710> but<00:05:21.640> I'm

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
faster than disposable batteries but I'm

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.160 
faster than disposable batteries but I'm
okay<00:05:22.030> with<00:05:22.060> that<00:05:22.210> because<00:05:22.450> I<00:05:22.630> can<00:05:22.780> recharge

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170
