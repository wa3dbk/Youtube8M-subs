00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.790
 simple 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.710
 from beginning to end 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.540
 hello welcome new mechanics video 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.580
 My name is Jesus and today we are going to see 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.570
 how to change our antipole filter 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.040
 cabin 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.140
 if you are interested in knowing more about the subject 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.910
 between the roberts page where 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.939
 You will find extensive information on 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.640
 pollen and cabin filters in addition 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.590
 If you need spare parts or give chase 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.779
 drop a vehicle you can do it from the 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.399
 web without leaving home or the filter of the 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.530
 interior serves to prevent them from entering 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.230
 impurities and dust inside the passenger compartment 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.320
 of the vehicle there are two types the normal 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.180
 and carbon is carbon used to 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.130
 prevent more impurities from entering 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.740
 people who are allergic to their location 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.570
 is in heating mode and for 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.070
 you can access it may be made from 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.230
 the engine compartment or from inside the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.700
 vehicle interior depending on the 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.380
 type of car that we have is very 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.690
 important that said filter be clean 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.310
 especially in summer times since yes 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.020
 our performance is obstructed 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.100
 air conditioning equipment will look very 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.440
 diminished 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.110
 in this particular model the center of 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.510
 passenger compartment is accessed from the bathroom 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.630
 the motor 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.830
 but we remove the rubber and open the 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.010
 plastic where water falls 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.480
 windshield wipers we raise the two 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:22.850
 lashes second tab 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.850
 and we released our cabin filter 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.009
 as we can see our filter is very 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:30.899
 dirty and clogged these filters have 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.159
 convenient that they can not be cleaned anymore 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.289
 that the material that is made stays 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.479
 stuck dirt and dust therefore 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.500
 it will always have to be changed at the time of 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.700
 ride it 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.049
 we will have to take into account that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.030
 they always carry some brands 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.520
 indicating the entrance of the air 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.560
 and it will have to be mounted as indicated by the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.220
 marks indicates the brand the arrows towards 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.870
 down 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.870
 what is the direction that the air takes 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.780
 we close the two tabs that we have 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.890
 open before 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.240
 and we lower the plastic 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.570
 where the water of the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.570
 wiper washer 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.030
 and with this we conclude this 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.980
 video about mechanics in the links that 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.960
