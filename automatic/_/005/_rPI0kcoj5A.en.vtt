00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 you say yes right first personal 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.940
 patronite army of bulls and zakharkin 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.170
 thanks more my son comic yes here 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.450
 honestly tell you that lately 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.519
 dreamed not looked at the bill though you 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.510
 you know I am always interested in information 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.250
 but this time no you can explain with 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.789
 tactical point of view which series was 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.260
 the most difficult 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.820
 not from the point of view and from the point of view 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.840
 strategy the most difficult of course matches 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.599
 were against cisco 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.480
 honestly it is a miracle to sometimes 3 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.309
 pp but also played out in terms of 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.800
 tactics 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:41.940
 Well, Novgorod united they played about 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.210
 in similar ok 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.600
 cisco they were very fast maybe 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.670
 faster than and and it caused a little bit 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.280
 such tension but picked up the key and 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.520
 the final was no easier because the leopard 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.140
 plays more predictable you said 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.120
 love such phrases that let 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.739
 Be the first to say no 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.490
 not one of me talking about working for 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.260
 rise decline after last match like 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.330
 we lacked a series of defeats 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.280
 some of this bridge that's here is here 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.040
 it is very good what dima said it 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.250
 because they will succeed opportunities 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.600
 better understand the meaning because in fact 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.729
 to manage the training process 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.080
 about whether sports form the most difficult 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.540
 to achieve the result 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.060
 Pyklia team is very cool what is it 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.220
 understood and if we talk about the stage on 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.490
 planned yes because well i 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.450
 said what we really do 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.829
 you just need to understand again 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.630
 physiological pattern 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.729
 pedagogical very mass of thin 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.870
 nuances that a trainer should know for 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.820
 to really manage 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.710
 sports forms that is, it turns out that 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.190
 donate and championship medals 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.080
 it was as if you were defeated in the end game 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.610
 three defeats in a row the day of Leningrad 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.130
 blockade now quickly tell up 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.110
 fire back and a medal for him for pavel well 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.630
 we can not say that donations 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.280
 I did not think that the team I just thought that 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.990
 the team may drop to level 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.060
 due to the skill we would need 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.190
 win and boy then no one 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.240
 planning a defeat sports plan 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.040
 form and tasks were not at ease 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.570
 go through all the matches beating everyone there and 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.520
 showed such brilliant hockey and 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.800
 Kamanda would not learn to tolerate 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.250
 fight to be able to defend ie those 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.980
 all the important points that are needed and 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.710
 rafting we were preparing the playoff team after 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.200
 of how we started the series very well 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.510
 it was clear that now the most important and 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.460
 the team is clear that we had a problem or 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.800
 the gap in the team is training 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.840
 I need such butt matches for departure 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.400
 the character where the city ​​is needed but the copper of the rat 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.590
 that's what they do 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.090
 ska very inspection protocol that there even 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.720
 fish for the first place removed 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.190
 championship 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.989
 you feel that you are at some point 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.190
 swept that already started to look askance and 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.190
 time was on the verge of failure 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.460
 well it seemed to me that 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.470
 the head of the claim they understood that we 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.580
 do it because 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.730
 vice president romance this byrd 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.920
 constantly with the team 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.570
 Smolin Timchenko was interested that we 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.100
 We do and therefore they were in the know 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.480
 our plans thank you for what they 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:17.459
 believed that they agreed 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.110
 with such a strategy, the last three 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.760
 from Russians who would play like that 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.440
 brilliant it was really ass 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.090
 my wife frost 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.920
 involved created a construction scheppach it 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.040
 First, how did you manage to create 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.629
 chemistry find this there as if everything was 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.060
 not hard enough because some 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.440
 point in time we learned that not 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.269
 there will be a team in Donetsk and 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.819
 the whole list of players and false understandable we 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.799
 filled it with dodon when he played 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.209
 our team is a very technical very 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.400
 fast and attacking shooting range 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.569
 aimed at the gate 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.590
 credibility on urge careers on 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.390
 the planet that we knew well the thorn of what 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.269
 because we watched them when he 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.069
 was Cherepovets and then when we wanted 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.450
 invite the national teams you understand what 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.430
 the level of this hitter we knew 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:10.560
 Fairly well panarin and whales 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.900
 brilliant unity courageous player 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.859
 but he is not such a thin player and therefore 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.919
 there just needed a player who could 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.680
 here it is the combining beginnings 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.690
 complete the throws line so well 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.210
 something turned out the baby's body was not found 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.300
 each other and developed during the season 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.900
 the finale came up so brilliant 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.610
 teamwork 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.160
 the latter just won three 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.750
 something of the world second Gagarin Cup hour 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.260
 his calm as a breeding professor 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.570
 After you have any emotions from this 3 smart 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.520
 emotions bezus surely fold guys 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.280
 because the season he really isn't 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.020
 as smooth as not everything is possible 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.120
 Now I tell what was in the team 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.890
 because so much 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.650
 psychological background work in 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.900
 the team was and do not believe and somewhere your strength 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.820
 over very difficult was the path to this 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.980
 victory very happy for the guys that they managed 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.800
 Here come to a decisive match in such 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.070
 brilliant shape with so wonderful 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.160
 hold the last game and therefore 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.930
 spiritual joy is still a task 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.110
 which you need to have time to decide this 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.900
 season in general it will end 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.660
 sobbing the answer to this question I will skip 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.730
 Do yourself without you know without comments 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.680
 say and given by the task whether 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.960
 he has no interview or you 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.240
 against us nobody forbade quite 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.750
 no one forbade you to give an interview 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.400
 just less voice reactions not 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.170
 I wanted to cast it, I didn't do it 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.300
 Alexey Shevchenko you get him 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:43.550
 Marina is not a person, he was very objective 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.550
 he absolutely gracie need to spend and 40 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:59.880
 million gave birth to me was very sad 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:06:02.340
 when we called the last name it may not 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.310
 I know I can be something at home 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.790
 significant fixation 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.170
 lay in vain is not easy just 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.030
 in fact when to hear that 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.480
 I was asked how do you feel about 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.940
 I told you specifically that it is one thing 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.950
 just really you would have to pasha 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.690
 difficult moments were together why I 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.730
 I did not speak to everyone and do not want to give 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.400
 interview because it was all 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.930
 passed once was bad none of 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.740
 these did not call did not tell me 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.540
