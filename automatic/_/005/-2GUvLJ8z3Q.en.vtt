single-shot<00:00:24.869> assault<00:00:25.170> rifle<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.560> found<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
single-shot assault rifle I found a

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.950 
single-shot assault rifle I found a
single-shot<00:00:26.340> assault<00:00:26.699> rifle<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.750> the

single-shot assault rifle in the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.599 
single-shot assault rifle in the
character<00:00:28.260> class<00:00:28.439> things<00:00:28.769> got<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:28.980> SMR<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.580> I

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
character class things got the SMR and I

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.830 
character class things got the SMR and I
was<00:00:29.760> using<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.029> they're<00:00:30.449> kind<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> big

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
was using that they're kind of the big

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.450 
was using that they're kind of the big
changes<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.470> guess<00:00:31.619> was<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.279> class

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
changes I guess was the the class

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.459 
changes I guess was the the class
selection<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> pick<00:00:33.120> 10<00:00:33.329> system<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> spent<00:00:34.440> a

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
selection to pick 10 system so I spent a

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.420 
selection to pick 10 system so I spent a
little<00:00:34.559> time<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.070> before<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> game

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
little time in that before the game

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.250 
little time in that before the game
started<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.510> interesting<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.930> mean<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> way

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
started it's interesting I mean the way

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.139 
started it's interesting I mean the way
that<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.530> can<00:00:37.739> customize<00:00:38.399> your<00:00:38.430> loadout<00:00:38.850> so

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
that you can customize your loadout so

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.729 
that you can customize your loadout so
you<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> certain<00:00:40.079> mount<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.290> points<00:00:40.649> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
you have a certain mount of points and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.780 
you have a certain mount of points and
you<00:00:40.800> choose<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.190> equipment<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.670> want

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
you choose the equipment that you want

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.850 
you choose the equipment that you want
to<00:00:41.879> use<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.329> there's<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.379> things<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.739> like

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
to use but there's the things in it like

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.490 
to use but there's the things in it like
for<00:00:44.370> example<00:00:44.899> stalker<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.050> now<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> weapon

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
for example stalker is now a weapon

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.080 
for example stalker is now a weapon
attachment<00:00:46.920> rather<00:00:47.070> than<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> perk<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.030> you

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
attachment rather than a perk so if you

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.580 
attachment rather than a perk so if you
want<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> move<00:00:48.360> faster<00:00:48.780> while<00:00:49.140> you're<00:00:49.289> aiming

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
want to move faster while you're aiming

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.040 
want to move faster while you're aiming
that's<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.670> stock<00:00:50.940> attached<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> your<00:00:51.840> gun

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
that's like a stock attached to your gun

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.889 
that's like a stock attached to your gun
but<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.610> can't<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.480> fast

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
but so you can't have that and fast

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.779 
but so you can't have that and fast
reloading<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:56.039> red<00:00:56.219> dot<00:00:56.370> sight<00:00:56.579> at<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
reloading and a red dot sight at the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.369 
reloading and a red dot sight at the
same<00:00:57.000> time<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:57.750> kind<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.170> setup

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
same time and that was kind of my setup

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.810 
same time and that was kind of my setup
in<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:58.710> more<00:00:58.890> fair<00:00:59.070> three<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.489> obviously<00:00:59.579> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
in one more fair three so obviously I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.939 
in one more fair three so obviously I
was<00:00:59.940> furious<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.570> punched<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.620> hole<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
was furious and I punched a hole in the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650 
was furious and I punched a hole in the
monitor<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.399> was<00:01:02.820> trying<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.210> replicate<00:01:03.390> my

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
monitor I was trying to replicate my

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.950 
monitor I was trying to replicate my
modern<00:01:04.229> warfare<00:01:05.000> as<00:01:06.000> well<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.479> then<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.840> got

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
modern warfare as well and then I got

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.960 
modern warfare as well and then I got
greedy<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.380> perk<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.280> perk

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
greedy with a perk so you can have perk

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.880 
greedy with a perk so you can have perk
I<00:01:09.270> think<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.960> perk<00:01:10.140> 1<00:01:10.290> greed<00:01:10.350> perk<00:01:10.740> 2

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
I think it's like perk 1 greed perk 2

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.620 
I think it's like perk 1 greed perk 2
greed<00:01:10.920> 3<00:01:11.520> greed<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.030> double<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.420> on

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
greed 3 greed so you can double up on

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.810 
greed 3 greed so you can double up on
perks<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.140> all<00:01:13.260> three<00:01:13.470> classes<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.549> ended<00:01:14.760> up

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
perks in all three classes so I ended up

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.230 
perks in all three classes so I ended up
with<00:01:14.939> 6<00:01:15.240> perks<00:01:15.509> one<00:01:16.500> weapon<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.430> not<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.970> lot

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
with 6 perks one weapon and not a lot

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.520 
with 6 perks one weapon and not a lot
else<00:01:18.270> really<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:19.110> gonna<00:01:19.200> run<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.500> there

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
else really it's gonna run out there

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.649 
else really it's gonna run out there
with<00:01:19.740> no<00:01:19.890> weapons<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.340> loads<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.970> perks<00:01:21.180> so

you<00:01:31.229> make<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> maps<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.579> what<00:01:33.000> are<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.150> playing

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
you make the maps so what are we playing

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.410 
you make the maps so what are we playing
we<00:01:33.479> played<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:34.850> turbine<00:01:35.850> which<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.210> based

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
we played on turbine which is based

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.300 
we played on turbine which is based
around<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.689> kind<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> crashed<00:01:37.200> jetliner<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
around a kind of a crashed jetliner and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.620 
around a kind of a crashed jetliner and
that<00:01:38.520> was<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.790> was<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.909> cool<00:01:39.060> map<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.420> was<00:01:39.479> all

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that was that was a cool map it was all

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.960 
that was that was a cool map it was all
very<00:01:39.990> open<00:01:40.229> there<00:01:40.560> was<00:01:40.619> some<00:01:40.799> kind<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.579> lot

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
very open there was some kind of a lot

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.429 
very open there was some kind of a lot
of<00:01:42.030> verticality<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:42.960> you're<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.259> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
of verticality to it so you're in a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
of verticality to it so you're in a
valley<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.829> middle<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.220> plane

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
valley in the middle with the plane

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.819 
valley in the middle with the plane
crashed<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:46.170> there's<00:01:46.439> sort<00:01:46.740> of

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
crashed in it and then there's sort of

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.859 
crashed in it and then there's sort of
hills<00:01:47.070> around<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.579> with<00:01:47.729> buildings<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.689> go

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
hills around it with buildings we can go

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.330 
hills around it with buildings we can go
into<00:01:49.020> there<00:01:49.320> was<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> minigun<00:01:49.799> set<00:01:50.040> up<00:01:50.159> kind<00:01:50.280> of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
into there was a minigun set up kind of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.580 
into there was a minigun set up kind of
overlooking<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.570> central<00:01:52.020> big<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.470> for

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
overlooking the central big on that for

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.050 
overlooking the central big on that for
a<00:01:52.619> bit<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.009> tried<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.490> choose<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.759> B<00:01:53.880> Vaughn

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
a bit I tried to choose the B Vaughn

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.670 
a bit I tried to choose the B Vaughn
terrible<00:01:54.390> with<00:01:54.479> minigun<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:54.990> didn't<00:01:55.470> spend

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
terrible with minigun so I didn't spend

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.910 
terrible with minigun so I didn't spend
too<00:01:55.920> long<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.130> that

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
too long on that

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.110 
too long on that

transmitter on a bridge that's that's

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.699 
transmitter on a bridge that's that's
the<00:02:06.369> turbine<00:02:06.729> level<00:02:07.479> what<00:02:08.319> was<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.500> other<00:02:08.560> one

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
the turbine level what was the other one

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.889 
the turbine level what was the other one
that<00:02:08.770> we<00:02:08.890> were<00:02:08.950> playing<00:02:09.509> thank<00:02:10.509> you<00:02:10.630> folks

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
that we were playing thank you folks

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.630 
that we were playing thank you folks
just<00:02:11.110> told<00:02:11.290> me<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.650> was<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:12.160> was<00:02:12.280> overflow

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
just told me that it was it was overflow

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.430 
just told me that it was it was overflow
so<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.940> was<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.090> kind<00:02:13.810> of<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.959> ruined<00:02:14.200> City

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
so that was a kind of a ruined City

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.500 
so that was a kind of a ruined City
scape<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.890> lot<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.190> indoor<00:02:15.490> sections<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.270> lot<00:02:16.390> of

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
scape a lot of indoor sections a lot of

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.760 
scape a lot of indoor sections a lot of
kind<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.750> narrow<00:02:17.580> kind<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.640> bizarre<00:02:18.970> marketing

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
kind of narrow kind of bizarre marketing

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.310 
kind of narrow kind of bizarre marketing
places<00:02:20.800> how<00:02:21.190> does<00:02:21.400> multi<00:02:21.700> team<00:02:21.850> work<00:02:22.260> okay<00:02:23.260> so

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
places how does multi team work okay so

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.780 
places how does multi team work okay so
I<00:02:23.410> guess<00:02:23.560> we<00:02:23.650> were<00:02:23.709> playing<00:02:23.890> by<00:02:24.010> 12<00:02:24.250> people<00:02:24.550> at

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
I guess we were playing by 12 people at

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.880 
I guess we were playing by 12 people at
once<00:02:25.000> but<00:02:25.300> we<00:02:25.420> were<00:02:25.600> four<00:02:26.110> different<00:02:26.500> teams<00:02:26.620> so

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
once but we were four different teams so

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.800 
once but we were four different teams so
four<00:02:27.100> teams<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.459> three<00:02:27.700> all<00:02:28.480> playing

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
four teams of three all playing

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.630 
four teams of three all playing
simultaneously<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:29.890> we<00:02:30.100> had<00:02:30.220> our<00:02:30.250> team<00:02:30.520> of

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
simultaneously so we had our team of

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.010 
simultaneously so we had our team of
three<00:02:30.790> me<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.180> Mike<00:02:31.330> but<00:02:31.750> then<00:02:31.900> we're

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
three me you and Mike but then we're

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.890 
three me you and Mike but then we're
playing<00:02:32.230> at<00:02:32.380> three<00:02:33.100> others<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:33.510> yeah<00:02:34.510> it's

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
playing at three others so yeah it's

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.720 
playing at three others so yeah it's
like<00:02:35.140> your<00:02:35.620> normal<00:02:35.709> team<00:02:36.040> deathmatch<00:02:36.250> but<00:02:36.670> you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
like your normal team deathmatch but you

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.729 
like your normal team deathmatch but you
just<00:02:36.940> got<00:02:37.090> us<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.269> smaller<00:02:37.720> kind<00:02:38.320> of<00:02:38.440> tighter

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
just got us a smaller kind of tighter

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.770 
just got us a smaller kind of tighter
knit<00:02:38.980> team<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.550> I<00:02:39.760> guess<00:02:40.120> if<00:02:40.269> that<00:02:40.390> appeals<00:02:40.660> to

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
knit team so I guess if that appeals to

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.479 
knit team so I guess if that appeals to
you<00:02:40.900> just<00:02:41.110> I<00:02:41.260> team<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.590> up<00:02:41.650> with<00:02:41.769> a<00:02:41.830> few<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.220> few

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
you just I team you up with a few a few

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.220 
you just I team you up with a few a few
friends<00:02:42.760> rather<00:02:43.060> than<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.360> few<00:02:43.780> friends<00:02:43.989> being

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
friends rather than a few friends being

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.479 
friends rather than a few friends being
part<00:02:44.410> of<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.530> bigger<00:02:44.709> team<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:44.950> that's<00:02:45.250> you

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
part of a bigger team and that's you

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.070 
part of a bigger team and that's you
know<00:02:45.519> that's<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.850> cool<00:02:46.030> addition<00:02:46.360> ourselves<00:02:46.840> I

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
know that's a cool addition ourselves I

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.870 
know that's a cool addition ourselves I
think<00:02:47.500> for<00:02:47.620> me<00:02:47.709> it's<00:02:47.890> gonna<00:02:48.010> take<00:02:48.100> even<00:02:48.850> more

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
think for me it's gonna take even more

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.310 
think for me it's gonna take even more
time<00:02:49.000> than<00:02:49.300> usual<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.780> get<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.019> grips<00:02:50.200> with

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
time than usual to get to grips with

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.560 
time than usual to get to grips with
your<00:02:50.650> ideal<00:02:51.040> loadout<00:02:51.730> because<00:02:52.090> there's<00:02:52.269> so

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
your ideal loadout because there's so

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.540 
your ideal loadout because there's so
much<00:02:52.720> flexibility<00:02:53.290> in<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.560> now<00:02:53.680> right<00:02:54.130> exactly

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
much flexibility in it now right exactly

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.699 
much flexibility in it now right exactly
you're<00:02:54.640> gonna<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:55.000> mean<00:02:55.200> modern<00:02:56.200> warfare<00:02:56.320> 3<00:02:56.470> you

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
you're gonna I mean modern warfare 3 you

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.650 
you're gonna I mean modern warfare 3 you
get<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:57.010> your<00:02:57.190> loadout<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.239> go<00:02:58.300> right<00:02:58.480> that's

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
get to your loadout you go right that's

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.820 
get to your loadout you go right that's
that<00:02:58.840> but<00:02:59.019> then<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.230> think<00:02:59.410> this<00:02:59.500> is<00:02:59.620> gonna<00:02:59.739> be

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
that but then I think this is gonna be

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.319 
that but then I think this is gonna be
something<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.070> could<00:03:00.160> be<00:03:00.250> iterating<00:03:00.730> on<00:03:00.820> like

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
something you could be iterating on like

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.630 
something you could be iterating on like
loads<00:03:01.690> as<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.500> play<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:02.920> go<00:03:03.100> or<00:03:03.220> maybe<00:03:03.400> I'd<00:03:03.549> be

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
loads as you play you go or maybe I'd be

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.100 
loads as you play you go or maybe I'd be
better<00:03:03.790> with<00:03:03.910> this<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:04.720> are<00:03:04.840> gonna<00:03:04.959> be

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
better with this and you are gonna be

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.740 
better with this and you are gonna be
able<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.260> get<00:03:05.380> that<00:03:05.500> kind<00:03:05.709> of<00:03:06.120> very<00:03:07.120> gradual

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
able to get that kind of very gradual

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.660 
able to get that kind of very gradual
kind<00:03:08.110> of<00:03:08.310> improvement<00:03:09.310> on<00:03:09.400> what<00:03:09.519> you're<00:03:09.640> doing

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
kind of improvement on what you're doing

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.539

it for a few months you'll have such a

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.270 
it for a few months you'll have such a
kind<00:03:15.459> of<00:03:16.230> personalized<00:03:17.230> loadout<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:17.980> mean<00:03:18.130> it's

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
kind of personalized loadout I mean it's

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.970

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
you're gonna see just people with such a

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.910 
you're gonna see just people with such a
kind<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.310> wide<00:03:21.489> variety<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:22.560> perks<00:03:23.560> and

kind of wide variety of perks and
weapons<00:03:24.280> yeah<00:03:24.549> I<00:03:24.760> think<00:03:24.880> it's<00:03:25.269> gonna<00:03:25.360> really

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
weapons yeah I think it's gonna really

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.240 
weapons yeah I think it's gonna really
add<00:03:25.690> something<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.590> game<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:26.980> think<00:03:27.130> that

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
add something to the game I think that

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.740 
add something to the game I think that
games<00:03:27.670> come<00:03:27.820> they<00:03:27.940> described<00:03:28.269> it<00:03:28.390> as<00:03:28.510> they

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
games come they described it as they

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.210 
games come they described it as they
just<00:03:28.930> took<00:03:29.019> all<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.650> things<00:03:29.860> you<00:03:29.980> can<00:03:30.100> have

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
just took all the things you can have

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.440 
just took all the things you can have
put<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.459> in<00:03:30.549> a<00:03:30.610> bucket<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.180> then<00:03:31.329> you're

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
put it in a bucket and then you're

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.580 
put it in a bucket and then you're
allowed<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.720> pick<00:03:31.870> 10<00:03:32.019> things<00:03:32.260> out<00:03:32.410> of<00:03:32.470> that

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
allowed to pick 10 things out of that

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.780 
allowed to pick 10 things out of that
bucket<00:03:32.950> right<00:03:33.100> I<00:03:33.220> think<00:03:33.340> they<00:03:33.519> should<00:03:33.700> have

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
bucket right I think they should have

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.490 
bucket right I think they should have
actually<00:03:34.239> represented<00:03:34.959> that<00:03:35.049> visually<00:03:35.380> just

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
actually represented that visually just

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.750 
actually represented that visually just
had<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:35.709> bucket<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.220> your<00:03:36.340> soldier<00:03:36.610> just

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
had a bucket and your soldier just

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.910 
had a bucket and your soldier just
routes<00:03:36.970> through<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.570> picks<00:03:38.350> up<00:03:38.530> out<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.799> it

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
routes through it and picks up out of it

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.250 
routes through it and picks up out of it
and<00:03:39.100> going<00:03:39.280> puts<00:03:39.820> a<00:03:39.910> new<00:03:40.030> shoes<00:03:40.269> on

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
happy a new policy it's coming out at

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.279 
happy a new policy it's coming out at
the<00:04:21.609> end<00:04:21.729> of<00:04:21.789> the<00:04:21.910> year<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.630> given<00:04:23.050> that<00:04:23.139> you

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
the end of the year and given that you

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.920 
the end of the year and given that you
did<00:04:23.889> pretty<00:04:23.979> well<00:04:24.100> in<00:04:24.220> this<00:04:24.400> map<00:04:24.669> any<00:04:25.330> tips<00:04:25.780> for

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
did pretty well in this map any tips for

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.180 
did pretty well in this map any tips for
weapons<00:04:26.380> that<00:04:26.500> people<00:04:26.710> should<00:04:26.800> be<00:04:26.860> choosing

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
weapons that people should be choosing

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.710 
weapons that people should be choosing
day<00:04:27.310> one<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.699> would<00:04:28.150> recommend<00:04:28.270> using

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
day one I would recommend using

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.779 
day one I would recommend using
wildcards<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:29.889> can<00:04:30.010> get<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.310> perks<00:04:30.580> as

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
wildcards so you can get to perks as

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.090 
wildcards so you can get to perks as
your<00:04:30.910> first<00:04:31.180> slot<00:04:32.100> recommendation

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
your first slot recommendation

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.730 
your first slot recommendation
lightweight<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.669> hardline<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.740> just

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
lightweight and hardline and just

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.129 
lightweight and hardline and just
practice<00:04:36.400> basically<00:04:36.760> a<00:04:37.570> lot<00:04:37.840> about<00:04:37.990> the

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
practice basically a lot about the

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.260 
practice basically a lot about the
modern<00:04:38.380> literary<00:04:38.860> but<00:04:39.310> I<00:04:39.430> still<00:04:39.639> prefer<00:04:39.880> the

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
modern literary but I still prefer the

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.150 
modern literary but I still prefer the
original<00:04:40.360> black<00:04:40.900> box<00:04:41.110> because<00:04:41.350> it's<00:04:41.500> not<00:04:41.680> too

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
original black box because it's not too

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.129 
original black box because it's not too
complicated<00:04:42.729> we<00:04:43.479> did<00:04:43.630> pretty<00:04:43.720> well<00:04:43.840> in<00:04:43.960> the

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
complicated we did pretty well in the

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.589 
complicated we did pretty well in the
map<00:04:44.289> right<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:45.340> first<00:04:45.580> map<00:04:45.880> but<00:04:46.150> not<00:04:46.360> so<00:04:46.479> much

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
map right the first map but not so much

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.570 
map right the first map but not so much
the<00:04:46.810> second<00:04:47.169> that<00:04:47.289> okay<00:04:47.949> what<00:04:48.370> kind<00:04:48.490> of

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
the second that okay what kind of

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.380 
the second that okay what kind of
weapons<00:04:48.849> are<00:04:48.940> using<00:04:49.680> using<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.919> mp7<00:04:51.250> where

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
weapons are using using the mp7 where

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.390 
weapons are using using the mp7 where
passtime<00:04:53.390> attachment<00:04:54.290> and<00:04:54.440> reflex<00:04:55.160> sight

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
passtime attachment and reflex sight

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.310 
passtime attachment and reflex sight
excellent<00:04:56.390> do<00:04:56.450> you<00:04:56.510> think<00:04:56.660> you'll<00:04:56.750> be<00:04:56.780> picking

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
excellent do you think you'll be picking

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.340 
excellent do you think you'll be picking
out<00:04:57.440> when<00:04:57.620> it<00:04:57.710> comes<00:04:57.800> out<00:04:58.070> oh<00:04:58.370> definitely

black ops 2 how did you find it really

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.200 
black ops 2 how did you find it really
really<00:05:06.350> good<00:05:06.590> really<00:05:07.160> enjoyable<00:05:07.520> get<00:05:07.940> into<00:05:08.150> it

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
really good really enjoyable get into it

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.750 
really good really enjoyable get into it
game<00:05:08.390> it<00:05:08.630> is<00:05:08.870> pretty<00:05:09.200> good<00:05:09.320> to<00:05:09.440> be<00:05:09.560> fair

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
game it is pretty good to be fair

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.100 
game it is pretty good to be fair
there's<00:05:10.760> a<00:05:10.820> lot<00:05:10.970> more<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.270> do<00:05:11.450> the<00:05:11.720> map<00:05:11.900> seem<00:05:12.080> a

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
there's a lot more to do the map seem a

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.010 
there's a lot more to do the map seem a
lot<00:05:12.260> bigger<00:05:12.410> this<00:05:13.070> seems<00:05:13.280> a<00:05:13.370> lot<00:05:13.490> more<00:05:14.020> that

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
lot bigger this seems a lot more that

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.510 
lot bigger this seems a lot more that
you<00:05:15.140> can<00:05:15.260> deal<00:05:15.470> with<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.770> creating<00:05:16.400> of<00:05:16.430> the

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
you can deal with the creating of the

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.590 
you can deal with the creating of the
classes<00:05:16.880> and<00:05:17.060> things<00:05:17.210> like<00:05:17.330> that

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
classes and things like that

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.720 
classes and things like that
it<00:05:17.900> seems<00:05:18.080> really<00:05:18.350> good<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.800> lot<00:05:19.280> more<00:05:19.460> freedom

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
it seems really good a lot more freedom

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.910 
it seems really good a lot more freedom
a<00:05:20.120> lot<00:05:20.450> more<00:05:20.630> movement<00:05:20.870> found<00:05:21.650> it<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:21.800> little

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
a lot more movement found it a little

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.960 
a lot more movement found it a little
bit<00:05:22.040> out<00:05:22.100> to<00:05:22.250> start<00:05:22.490> off<00:05:22.550> for<00:05:22.670> but<00:05:22.790> when<00:05:22.880> you

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
bit out to start off for but when you

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.190 
bit out to start off for but when you
get<00:05:23.120> into<00:05:23.240> it<00:05:23.360> it<00:05:23.540> just<00:05:23.720> seemed<00:05:23.870> a<00:05:23.900> lot<00:05:24.050> lot

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
get into it it just seemed a lot lot

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.590 
get into it it just seemed a lot lot
easier<00:05:24.500> to<00:05:24.680> be<00:05:25.280> able<00:05:25.340> to<00:05:25.490> play<00:05:25.730> than<00:05:25.970> previous

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
easier to be able to play than previous

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.720 
easier to be able to play than previous
codes<00:05:26.840> I<00:05:26.930> think<00:05:27.140> how<00:05:28.010> did<00:05:28.160> you<00:05:28.250> find<00:05:28.460> the<00:05:28.550> maps

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
codes I think how did you find the maps

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.190 
codes I think how did you find the maps
I<00:05:28.850> saw<00:05:28.970> you<00:05:29.120> were<00:05:29.210> on<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.510> the<00:05:29.540> cruise<00:05:30.020> ship

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
I saw you were on the the cruise ship

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.350 
I saw you were on the the cruise ship
map<00:05:30.470> pollution<00:05:31.310> map<00:05:31.460> were<00:05:31.550> very<00:05:31.730> good<00:05:31.910> quite

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
map pollution map were very good quite

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.540 
map pollution map were very good quite
small<00:05:32.720> but<00:05:33.230> I<00:05:33.260> like<00:05:33.290> the<00:05:33.470> smaller<00:05:33.710> map<00:05:33.950> so<00:05:34.190> yeah

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
small but I like the smaller map so yeah

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.710 
small but I like the smaller map so yeah
I<00:05:34.580> really<00:05:34.850> enjoyed<00:05:35.120> that<00:05:35.150> one<00:05:35.300> probably<00:05:35.540> good

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
I really enjoyed that one probably good

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.330 
I really enjoyed that one probably good
that<00:05:35.750> one<00:05:35.960> and<00:05:36.350> the<00:05:36.470> other<00:05:36.680> one<00:05:36.830> it<00:05:36.950> was<00:05:37.040> an

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
that one and the other one it was an

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.310 
that one and the other one it was an
urban<00:05:37.610> map<00:05:37.790> I<00:05:37.880> think<00:05:38.030> it's<00:05:38.150> called<00:05:38.390> overflow

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
urban map I think it's called overflow

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.510 
urban map I think it's called overflow
how<00:05:39.500> do<00:05:39.560> you<00:05:39.620> find<00:05:39.770> it<00:05:39.920> that<00:05:40.010> were<00:05:40.370> a<00:05:40.430> lot

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
how do you find it that were a lot

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.610 
how do you find it that were a lot
bigger<00:05:40.700> very<00:05:41.690> similar<00:05:42.020> to<00:05:42.140> the<00:05:42.230> old<00:05:42.260> old

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
bigger very similar to the old old

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.140 
bigger very similar to the old old
attack<00:05:42.920> pods<00:05:43.190> we've<00:05:43.340> got<00:05:43.520> the<00:05:43.610> bigger<00:05:43.790> maps<00:05:44.000> to

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
attack pods we've got the bigger maps to

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.970 
attack pods we've got the bigger maps to
run<00:05:44.330> around<00:05:44.420> on<00:05:44.660> bit<00:05:44.900> better<00:05:45.260> to<00:05:45.620> find<00:05:45.830> your

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
run around on bit better to find your

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.640 
run around on bit better to find your
team<00:05:46.130> members<00:05:46.490> but<00:05:46.640> yeah<00:05:47.180> so<00:05:47.480> good<00:05:47.720> what's

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
team members but yeah so good what's

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.710 
team members but yeah so good what's
your<00:05:48.800> loadout<00:05:49.100> what<00:05:49.250> we're<00:05:49.370> using<00:05:49.580> I<00:05:49.940> got<00:05:50.690> a
