little<00:03:31.560> things<00:03:31.890> are<00:03:32.069> tricky<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.580> install<00:03:33.239> good

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489

you<00:03:35.489> know<00:03:35.610> what<00:03:35.730> setting<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.239> down<00:03:36.390> on<00:03:36.510> the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
you know what setting it down on the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:52.870 
you know what setting it down on the
table<00:03:36.780> really<00:03:37.110> helps<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.709> lot<00:03:37.860> so<00:03:38.299> try<00:03:39.299> that

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.340 

okay

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:12.880 

glue<00:03:58.100> takes<00:03:58.400> just<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.760> minute<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:59.150> dry

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.180

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
okay and I need just a little more glue

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.819 
okay and I need just a little more glue

a little longer than I had hoped on

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.850 
a little longer than I had hoped on
video<00:04:20.690> but

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.640 

zip<00:04:28.729> dry<00:04:29.000> is<00:04:29.060> really<00:04:29.569> great<00:04:29.810> glue<00:04:30.080> for<00:04:30.289> holding

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
zip dry is really great glue for holding

your paper projects together and it does
dry<00:04:34.250> fairly<00:04:34.580> quickly<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:35.860> doesn't<00:04:36.860> stay<00:04:37.069> tacky

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
dry fairly quickly so doesn't stay tacky

several of them but I think it's cute so
it<00:06:38.730> lines<00:06:38.970> up<00:06:39.180> perfectly<00:06:39.930> with<00:06:40.050> the<00:06:40.350> hole<00:06:41.360> so

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
it lines up perfectly with the hole so

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.050 
it lines up perfectly with the hole so
it<00:06:42.540> makes<00:06:42.720> it<00:06:42.840> easy<00:06:43.020> to<00:06:43.940> adhere<00:06:46.760> and<00:06:47.760> now<00:06:48.000> we

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
it makes it easy to adhere and now we

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:59.670 
it makes it easy to adhere and now we
will<00:06:48.690> put<00:06:48.900> on<00:06:49.140> the<00:06:49.920> window<00:06:50.310> trims
