with the guitar so when you're ready
let's<00:00:20.760> get<00:00:20.939> started<00:00:22.970> okay<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.029> first<00:00:24.390> off

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
let's get started okay so first off

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.120 
let's get started okay so first off
you're<00:00:24.930> going<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.109> start<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.529> head<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
you're going to start with the head and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.460 
you're going to start with the head and
the<00:00:26.970> heads<00:00:27.150> really<00:00:27.420> easy<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.779> just<00:00:27.930> roll<00:00:28.439> up

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the heads really easy you just roll up

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.070 
the heads really easy you just roll up
ball<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.039> clay<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:30.060> basically<00:00:30.240> make<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
ball of clay and you basically make a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.340 
ball of clay and you basically make a
cute<00:00:31.560> little<00:00:31.650> face<00:00:31.920> out<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.719> then<00:00:33.719> with

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
cute little face out of it and then with

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.799 
cute little face out of it and then with
the<00:00:34.530> guitar<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.700> basically<00:00:35.880> draw<00:00:36.690> it

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
the guitar you just basically draw it

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.479 
the guitar you just basically draw it
out<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> clay<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.770> then<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.100> carve<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
out in the clay and then you carve it

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.880 
out in the clay and then you carve it
out<00:00:38.629> so<00:00:39.629> those<00:00:39.780> are<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.930> two<00:00:39.989> steps<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.530> started

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
out so those are the two steps I started

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.220 
out so those are the two steps I started
off<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.280> first<00:00:41.670> because<00:00:42.600> those<00:00:42.840> are<00:00:43.050> going

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
off with first because those are going

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.680 
off with first because those are going
to<00:00:43.290> be<00:00:43.379> two<00:00:43.680> different<00:00:43.890> entities<00:00:44.850> until<00:00:45.570> you

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
to be two different entities until you

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.990 
to be two different entities until you
combine<00:00:46.050> them<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.440> then<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> next<00:00:47.370> step<00:00:47.820> is

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
combine them and then the next step is

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.900 
combine them and then the next step is
to<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.559> legs<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> body<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
to have the legs and the body and the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.229 
to have the legs and the body and the
legs<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:51.629> pretty<00:00:51.750> much<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.410> noodles<00:00:53.059> you<00:00:54.059> just

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
legs are pretty much to noodles you just

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.910 
legs are pretty much to noodles you just
combine<00:00:54.629> them<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.379> cut<00:00:55.590> them<00:00:55.739> off

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
combine them and then you cut them off

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.720 
combine them and then you cut them off
at<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.460> end

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.600 

so<00:01:00.730> what<00:01:00.940> you<00:01:01.030> should<00:01:01.060> have<00:01:01.210> at<00:01:01.690> this<00:01:01.900> point<00:01:02.200> is

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
so what you should have at this point is

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.520 
so what you should have at this point is
something<00:01:03.610> that<00:01:03.730> looks<00:01:03.940> like<00:01:04.000> this<00:01:07.470> okay<00:01:08.470> so

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
something that looks like this okay so

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.890 
something that looks like this okay so
what<00:01:09.130> we're<00:01:09.250> going<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.430> start<00:01:09.610> on<00:01:09.820> is<00:01:10.180> one<00:01:10.780> of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
what we're going to start on is one of

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.260 
what we're going to start on is one of
the<00:01:10.960> arms<00:01:11.400> because<00:01:12.400> that<00:01:12.640> one<00:01:12.820> is<00:01:12.940> going<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.150> be

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
the arms because that one is going to be

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.520 
the arms because that one is going to be
resting<00:01:13.780> right<00:01:13.990> on<00:01:14.050> top<00:01:14.380> of<00:01:14.410> the<00:01:14.620> guitar<00:01:19.530> okay

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
resting right on top of the guitar okay

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.480 
resting right on top of the guitar okay
so<00:01:20.590> we're<00:01:20.800> going<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:20.980> start<00:01:21.010> in<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.370> guitar

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
so we're going to start in the guitar

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.200 
so we're going to start in the guitar
and<00:01:21.970> what<00:01:22.720> you<00:01:22.840> should<00:01:23.170> have<00:01:23.200> next<00:01:24.070> is<00:01:24.250> the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
and what you should have next is the

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.390 
and what you should have next is the
neck<00:01:25.360> now<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.410> neck<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:26.710> really<00:01:27.070> easy<00:01:27.220> you

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
neck now the neck is really easy you

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.580 
neck now the neck is really easy you
just<00:01:27.550> flat<00:01:27.940> out<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.270> piece<00:01:28.630> of<00:01:28.660> clay<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.230> then

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
just flat out a piece of clay and then

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.760 
just flat out a piece of clay and then
you<00:01:29.800> carve<00:01:30.070> it<00:01:30.160> out<00:01:30.250> with<00:01:30.550> your<00:01:30.580> exacto<00:01:31.180> and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you carve it out with your exacto and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.750 
you carve it out with your exacto and
once<00:01:32.770> you're<00:01:32.890> done<00:01:33.040> you<00:01:33.220> can<00:01:33.310> place<00:01:33.550> that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
once you're done you can place that

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.430 
once you're done you can place that
right<00:01:34.030> onto<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.510> guitar<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:38.050> next<00:01:38.229> step

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
right onto the guitar so the next step

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.580 
right onto the guitar so the next step
is<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:39.160> work<00:01:39.490> on<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.820> headstock<00:01:40.270> which<00:01:41.200> is<00:01:41.410> one

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
is to work on the headstock which is one

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.410 
is to work on the headstock which is one
of<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:41.770> hardest<00:01:41.950> pieces<00:01:42.520> just<00:01:42.729> because<00:01:43.180> we're

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
of the hardest pieces just because we're

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.960 
of the hardest pieces just because we're
going<00:01:43.510> to<00:01:43.600> actually<00:01:43.840> add<00:01:44.259> tuners<00:01:44.830> at<00:01:45.160> the<00:01:45.759> top

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
going to actually add tuners at the top

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.850 
going to actually add tuners at the top
so<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:46.840> need<00:01:47.110> four<00:01:47.410> pins<00:01:47.680> like<00:01:48.009> this<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:49.860> one

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
so you need four pins like this and one

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.690 
so you need four pins like this and one
of<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.040> ends<00:01:51.369> have<00:01:51.550> to<00:01:51.759> be<00:01:51.910> blunt<00:01:53.700> now

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
of the ends have to be blunt now

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.700 
of the ends have to be blunt now
remember<00:01:55.119> you<00:01:55.240> need<00:01:55.330> four<00:01:55.660> pieces<00:01:55.900> so<00:01:56.410> with

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
remember you need four pieces so with

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.160 
remember you need four pieces so with
your<00:01:56.860> pliers<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:58.210> can<00:01:58.420> cut<00:01:58.780> them<00:01:58.960> out<00:01:59.110> and

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
your pliers you can cut them out and

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.520 
your pliers you can cut them out and
bend<00:01:59.770> them<00:01:59.979> as<00:02:00.190> well<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.840> as<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.050> can<00:02:02.259> see<00:02:02.500> I

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
bend them as well so as you can see I

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.180
