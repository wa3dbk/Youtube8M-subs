00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.320 

okay<00:00:02.740> hi<00:00:03.040> Callum<00:00:03.400> this<00:00:03.699> is<00:00:03.850> just<00:00:04.060> a<00:00:04.120> little

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:04.330 
okay hi Callum this is just a little

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.790 
okay hi Callum this is just a little
reminder<00:00:04.600> for<00:00:04.960> you<00:00:05.200> about<00:00:05.860> indices<00:00:06.580> or<00:00:07.120> powers

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:07.800 
reminder for you about indices or powers

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.730 
reminder for you about indices or powers
as<00:00:08.800> they're<00:00:09.040> sometimes<00:00:09.280> called<00:00:10.499> that's<00:00:11.499> where

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
as they're sometimes called that's where

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.129 
as they're sometimes called that's where
you<00:00:11.830> write<00:00:12.129> one<00:00:12.999> big<00:00:13.329> number<00:00:13.749> which<00:00:13.929> is<00:00:14.110> the

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
you write one big number which is the

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.560 
you write one big number which is the
base<00:00:14.440> number<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.759> then<00:00:15.879> you<00:00:15.999> put<00:00:16.209> a<00:00:16.240> smaller

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
base number and then you put a smaller

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.050 
base number and then you put a smaller
number<00:00:16.810> a<00:00:17.050> bit<00:00:17.289> up<00:00:17.440> high<00:00:17.679> and<00:00:18.070> that's<00:00:18.670> the<00:00:18.880> bit

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
number a bit up high and that's the bit

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.120 
number a bit up high and that's the bit
that's<00:00:19.240> called<00:00:19.539> the<00:00:19.630> index<00:00:20.019> or<00:00:20.349> I<00:00:20.590> call<00:00:20.890> it<00:00:21.009> the

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
that's called the index or I call it the

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.779 
that's called the index or I call it the
power<00:00:21.340> most<00:00:21.939> people<00:00:22.359> do<00:00:22.449> too<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:24.070> for<00:00:24.279> example

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
power most people do too so for example

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.269 
power most people do too so for example
if<00:00:25.420> you<00:00:25.599> have<00:00:25.920> 2<00:00:26.920> to<00:00:27.490> the<00:00:27.519> power<00:00:27.640> 4<00:00:28.830> that's<00:00:29.830> a

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
if you have 2 to the power 4 that's a

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.100 
if you have 2 to the power 4 that's a
shorthand<00:00:30.820> white<00:00:31.269> way<00:00:31.839> of<00:00:32.619> writing<00:00:33.190> 2<00:00:33.730> times<00:00:34.719> 2

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
shorthand white way of writing 2 times 2

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.200 
shorthand white way of writing 2 times 2
times<00:00:35.640> 2<00:00:36.780> times<00:00:37.780> 2<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.670> when<00:00:39.820> you're<00:00:39.969> writing

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
times 2 times 2 so when you're writing

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.529 
times 2 times 2 so when you're writing
out<00:00:40.480> what<00:00:40.510> it<00:00:40.840> means<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.949> base<00:00:42.250> number<00:00:42.640> is<00:00:43.270> the

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
out what it means the base number is the

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.529 
out what it means the base number is the
only<00:00:43.780> number<00:00:44.440> that<00:00:44.469> you<00:00:44.710> write<00:00:45.149> but<00:00:46.149> you<00:00:46.300> write

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
only number that you write but you write

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.540 
only number that you write but you write
it<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.989> number<00:00:47.379> of<00:00:47.410> times<00:00:47.559> that<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.309> power

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
it the number of times that the power

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.470 
it the number of times that the power
tells<00:00:48.969> you<00:00:49.149> to<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.530> 2<00:00:50.770> to<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.039> power<00:00:51.219> 4<00:00:51.550> only

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
tells you to but 2 to the power 4 only

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.049 
tells you to but 2 to the power 4 only
contains<00:00:52.989> multiples<00:00:53.680> of<00:00:53.800> 2<00:00:54.070> you<00:00:54.730> don't<00:00:54.969> get

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
contains multiples of 2 you don't get

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:01.259 
contains multiples of 2 you don't get
any<00:00:55.210> fours<00:00:55.600> in<00:00:55.840> it<00:00:57.000> okay<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:59.379> 2<00:01:00.070> times<00:01:00.699> 2<00:01:00.820> times

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
any fours in it okay so 2 times 2 times

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.040 
any fours in it okay so 2 times 2 times
2<00:01:01.780> times<00:01:02.260> 2<00:01:02.859> is<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:03.940> same<00:01:04.150> as<00:01:04.420> 2<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.870> power

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
2 times 2 is the same as 2 to the power

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.910 
2 times 2 is the same as 2 to the power
4<00:01:05.460> which<00:01:06.460> actually<00:01:06.970> is<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.299> same<00:01:07.509> as<00:01:07.840> 2<00:01:08.710> 4<00:01:09.220> 8

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
4 which actually is the same as 2 4 8

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:20.429 
4 which actually is the same as 2 4 8
rubbish<00:01:11.920> -<00:01:12.850> 2<00:01:13.299> -<00:01:13.540> 4<00:01:14.670> 4<00:01:15.670> 2<00:01:16.119> 0<00:01:16.150> 8<00:01:16.540> +<00:01:17.079> 8<00:01:17.439> 2<00:01:17.770> to<00:01:18.009> 16<00:01:19.079> so<00:01:20.079> 2

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
rubbish - 2 - 4 4 2 0 8 + 8 2 to 16 so 2

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.499 
rubbish - 2 - 4 4 2 0 8 + 8 2 to 16 so 2
times<00:01:20.740> 2<00:01:21.009> times<00:01:21.040> 2<00:01:21.400> times<00:01:21.579> 2<00:01:22.170> equals<00:01:23.170> 16<00:01:24.509> so

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
times 2 times 2 times 2 equals 16 so

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.999 
times 2 times 2 times 2 equals 16 so
what<00:01:25.750> if<00:01:25.900> we<00:01:26.020> had<00:01:26.229> 2<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.799> power<00:01:26.979> 5<00:01:27.900> well

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
what if we had 2 to the power 5 well

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.850 
what if we had 2 to the power 5 well
same<00:01:30.009> sort<00:01:30.310> of<00:01:30.399> idea<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:32.110> only<00:01:32.380> write<00:01:32.829> the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
same sort of idea you only write the

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:41.490 
same sort of idea you only write the
base<00:01:33.159> numbers<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.700> you<00:01:39.880> write<00:01:40.149> it<00:01:40.390> 5<00:01:41.200> times

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
base numbers but you write it 5 times

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.350 
base numbers but you write it 5 times
over<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.040> number<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.549> power<00:01:42.790> tells<00:01:43.149> you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
over the number that the power tells you

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.539 
over the number that the power tells you
2<00:01:44.200> times<00:01:44.530> 2<00:01:44.770> times<00:01:44.799> 2<00:01:45.219> times<00:01:45.700> 2<00:01:46.030> times<00:01:46.060> 2<00:01:46.509> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.550 
2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 and
that<00:01:48.549> I<00:01:48.579> suppose<00:01:48.850> is<00:01:49.240> just<00:01:49.420> one<00:01:49.630> more<00:01:49.869> -<00:01:50.140> on<00:01:50.350> top

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
that I suppose is just one more - on top

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.630 
that I suppose is just one more - on top
of<00:01:50.740> 2<00:01:51.189> to<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.369> 4<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:53.229> that<00:01:53.380> would<00:01:53.500> be<00:01:53.530> 32

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.490 

suppose<00:01:59.300> we<00:01:59.510> choose<00:01:59.720> a<00:01:59.780> different<00:02:00.110> base

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
suppose we choose a different base

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.220 
suppose we choose a different base
number<00:02:00.980> now<00:02:01.130> suppose<00:02:01.610> we<00:02:01.790> choose<00:02:02.150> five<00:02:02.750> as<00:02:03.110> the

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
number now suppose we choose five as the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.080 
number now suppose we choose five as the
base<00:02:03.410> number

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
base number

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.580 
base number
supposing<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.150> wanted<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.570> write<00:02:05.750> five<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.560> the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
supposing I wanted to write five to the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.820 
supposing I wanted to write five to the
power<00:02:06.710> three<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:08.260> see<00:02:09.260> what<00:02:09.410> that<00:02:09.500> equals

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
power three and see what that equals

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.040 
power three and see what that equals
well<00:02:10.040> again<00:02:10.340> it's<00:02:10.880> only<00:02:11.210> the<00:02:11.510> base<00:02:11.720> number

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
well again it's only the base number

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.760 
well again it's only the base number
that<00:02:12.410> we<00:02:12.500> write<00:02:12.740> out<00:02:13.090> so<00:02:14.090> it's<00:02:14.210> 5<00:02:14.480> times<00:02:15.410> 5

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
that we write out so it's 5 times 5

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.650 
that we write out so it's 5 times 5
times<00:02:16.310> 5<00:02:17.240> you<00:02:17.920> write<00:02:18.920> it<00:02:19.100> three<00:02:19.550> times<00:02:19.910> because

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
times 5 you write it three times because

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.510 
times 5 you write it three times because
that's<00:02:21.020> what<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.320> power<00:02:21.500> tells<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.220> and

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.300 

by<00:02:25.520> similar<00:02:26.030> kind<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.360> reasoning<00:02:26.900> 5<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:28.190> the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
by similar kind of reasoning 5 to the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.210 
by similar kind of reasoning 5 to the
power<00:02:28.550> 4<00:02:29.230> again<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.440> only<00:02:30.590> write<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.070> base

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
power 4 again you only write the base

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.670 
power 4 again you only write the base
numbers<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:34.610> fives<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:35.930> you're<00:02:36.200> right

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
numbers the fives but you're right

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.430 
numbers the fives but you're right
four<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.580> them<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:37.910> time<00:02:38.210> because<00:02:38.810> that's

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
four of them this time because that's

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.240 
four of them this time because that's
what<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.800> power<00:02:39.950> is

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
what the power is

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.480 
what the power is
supposing<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.180> wanted<00:02:41.570> to<00:02:41.720> multiply<00:02:42.320> two<00:02:43.250> of

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
supposing I wanted to multiply two of

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.850 
supposing I wanted to multiply two of
these<00:02:43.700> power<00:02:44.120> numbers<00:02:44.630> together<00:02:44.870> this<00:02:45.650> only

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
these power numbers together this only

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.440 
these power numbers together this only
works<00:02:46.160> by<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.460> way<00:02:46.580> if<00:02:46.790> they<00:02:46.910> got<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.240> same

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
works by the way if they got the same

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.050 
works by the way if they got the same
base<00:02:47.840> number<00:02:48.320> so<00:02:48.860> suppose<00:02:49.280> I<00:02:49.610> wanted<00:02:49.910> to

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
base number so suppose I wanted to

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.980 
base number so suppose I wanted to
multiply<00:02:50.570> 5<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> power<00:02:51.860> 3<00:02:52.310> by<00:02:52.580> 5<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.870> the

multiply 5 to the power 3 by 5 to the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.480 
multiply 5 to the power 3 by 5 to the
power<00:02:54.200> 4<00:02:55.300> well<00:02:56.300> I<00:02:56.600> know<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.320> 5<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.220> power

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.170 
power 4 well I know that 5 to the power
3<00:03:00.490> is<00:03:01.540> that<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.920> I've<00:03:04.040> got<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.370> multiply<00:03:04.700> that

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
3 is that and I've got to multiply that

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.830 
3 is that and I've got to multiply that
by<00:03:06.670> 5<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.030> power<00:03:08.060> 4<00:03:08.690> which<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:10.840> 5

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
times 5 times 5 times 5 well now it's

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.110

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
quick way of doing that would just have

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.729 
quick way of doing that would just have
been<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:39.770> add<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.280> 2<00:03:40.489> powers<00:03:40.910> together<00:03:41.590> 5<00:03:42.590> to

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
been to add the 2 powers together 5 to

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
the power 3 times 5 to the power 4 but

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.470 
the power 3 times 5 to the power 4 but
you<00:03:48.410> write<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.800> same<00:03:49.070> base<00:03:49.459> number<00:03:49.910> but<00:03:50.360> you

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
you write the same base number but you

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.540 
you write the same base number but you
add<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.290> powers<00:03:51.650> together<00:03:52.010> to<00:03:52.220> get<00:03:52.340> the

add the powers together to get the

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.380 
for 4 above and below councils and that
fall<00:05:06.080> in<00:05:06.200> that<00:05:06.230> for<00:05:06.620> council<00:05:07.130> and<00:05:07.700> that<00:05:07.730> forum

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
fall in that for council and that forum

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.450 
fall in that for council and that forum
that<00:05:08.570> for<00:05:08.810> council<00:05:09.290> and<00:05:09.740> you're<00:05:09.890> only<00:05:10.070> left

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
that for council and you're only left

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.100 
that for council and you're only left
with<00:05:10.670> 1<00:05:10.910> 4<00:05:11.830> so<00:05:12.830> 4<00:05:13.130> to<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:13.430> power<00:05:13.460> 4<00:05:14.000> divided<00:05:14.930> by

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
with 1 4 so 4 to the power 4 divided by

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.450 
with 1 4 so 4 to the power 4 divided by
4<00:05:15.320> to<00:05:15.740> the<00:05:15.800> power<00:05:15.860> 3<00:05:16.690> just<00:05:17.690> equals<00:05:18.169> 4<00:05:18.530> 4<00:05:18.980> 4<00:05:19.340> to

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
4 to the power 3 just equals 4 4 4 to

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.320 
4 to the power 3 just equals 4 4 4 to
the<00:05:19.550> power<00:05:19.580> 1<00:05:19.970> I<00:05:20.000> suppose<00:05:20.450> you<00:05:20.600> could<00:05:20.780> call<00:05:20.990> it

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
the power 1 I suppose you could call it

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.580 
the power 1 I suppose you could call it
and<00:05:23.330> if<00:05:23.510> we<00:05:23.660> notice<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.200> other<00:05:24.320> way<00:05:24.470> of

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
and if we notice the other way of

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.640 
and if we notice the other way of
getting<00:05:24.620> that<00:05:25.180> is<00:05:28.540> we're<00:05:29.540> just<00:05:29.720> taking<00:05:30.290> away

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
getting that is we're just taking away

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.580 
getting that is we're just taking away
the<00:05:30.830> second<00:05:31.610> power<00:05:31.760> from<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:32.210> first<00:05:32.450> one<00:05:32.720> even

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
the second power from the first one even

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.980 
the second power from the first one even
though<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:33.890> numbers<00:05:34.280> are<00:05:34.310> being<00:05:34.610> divided<00:05:35.090> to

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
though the numbers are being divided to

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.430 
though the numbers are being divided to
get<00:05:36.169> the<00:05:36.320> answer<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:37.730> power<00:05:38.090> is<00:05:38.870> this<00:05:39.140> power

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
get the answer the power is this power

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.370 
get the answer the power is this power
minus<00:05:40.310> that<00:05:40.520> power<00:05:40.820> 4<00:05:41.419> minus<00:05:41.870> 3<00:05:42.220> is<00:05:43.220> 1<00:05:44.200> so<00:05:45.200> when

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
minus that power 4 minus 3 is 1 so when

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.440 
minus that power 4 minus 3 is 1 so when
you<00:05:45.590> multiply<00:05:46.250> them<00:05:46.460> together<00:05:46.640> you<00:05:46.970> add<00:05:47.240> the

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
you multiply them together you add the

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.409 
you multiply them together you add the
powers<00:05:47.840> but<00:05:48.740> when<00:05:48.950> you<00:05:49.100> divide<00:05:49.520> them<00:05:49.790> you

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
powers but when you divide them you

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.110 
powers but when you divide them you
subtract<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.290> power<00:05:51.470> you're<00:05:51.800> dividing<00:05:52.160> to

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
subtract the power you're dividing to

00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:01.600 
subtract the power you're dividing to
get<00:05:53.270> the<00:05:53.390> answer

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.639 

ah
