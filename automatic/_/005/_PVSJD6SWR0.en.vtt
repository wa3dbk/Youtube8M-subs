00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
so basically I've never played with it

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.549

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
basically you can like dig blocks and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.790 
basically you can like dig blocks and
place<00:00:37.559> them<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.250> create<00:00:38.489> shortcuts<00:00:39.090> which<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.960> I

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
super useful and at the same time it

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.830 
super useful and at the same time it
might<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:50.100> might<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.610> useless<00:00:51.449> but

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
