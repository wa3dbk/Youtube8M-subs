00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.789

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.820
 Okay, I'll explain it better to you 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.739
 but already making it clear that the bud review 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.780
 of the game is the worldwide revelation of 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.960

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.860
 name of the cup of 2014 we'll know 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.170
 finally which game will we go? 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.400
 could be playing this year what 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.920
 happened today 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.140
 the site does not official site but a page 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.580
 on the jury channel site that would be page 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.799
 say so official for this new 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.450
 code was aired on a page that has a 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.030
 image that we can not 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.590
 you can see for sure what you have to 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.020
 background hence the background image 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.850
 represents above has a computer that 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.290
 the just own hours counter in 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.150
 that will leave the training is going to be 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.509
 This Sunday, the 4th day 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.880
 right along with it lg has launched a 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.890
 three-minute trailer almost four 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.140
 minutes or so, which is actually 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.149
 has nothing to do with the game itself that 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.340
 had with the game but does not show any 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.280
 Game image or anything is kind of a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.070
 interview is a mini-documentary alone 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.829
 there with people of the military and 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.860
 things like talking about pms 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.890
 esp / n 6 is short for private 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.090
 military and compadres that are nothing more than 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.830
 what is 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.170
 military soldiers of the company 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.870
 private military or, in other words, 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.269
 hired by someone to do some 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.620
 work, that's what happened in the 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.800
 passed even by the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.569
 armies of the same country 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.209
 but was eventually banned so the 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.160
 block the beauty of it and nowadays that 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.260
 act of you hire pms and it's 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.819
 considered as mercenarism they are 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.010
 considered mercenaries in fact 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.440
 so they do a job of 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.900
 with weapons and everything in exchange for a 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.130
 large amount of money right and this 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.340
 It is something that comes half to 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.620
 breaking this whole market of 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.900
 military over the world is what is 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.910
 would have even talked in the video speaks 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.560
 including that it is not in the 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.140
 If I am not mistaken, I think 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.269
 62% of the military in Afghanistan are 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.650
 mercenaries and stuff and that 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.170
 has to do with those of this year with those of this 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.519
 year will just address this seems 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.530
 that these pms are going to come out is the big big 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.299
 is the great evil of the next codes the 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.040
 great villain of the next can so much 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.250
 if this trailer that left it starts 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.139
 saying that next to the jury ooo 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.420
 most powerful militia in the world is not a 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.920
 not the country's most powerful military 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.200
 not just one country but one 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.420
 corporation in the then will be basically 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.250
 around this training to 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.769
 explain the people squares what 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.260
 actually means six pm what are 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.690
 these mercenaries right on the site itself 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.849
 what came out now is that it has this image 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.200
 and there's that computer in there. 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.989
 The top can be found in the 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.450
 source code of the site three links that give 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.459
 precisely for articles that talk about 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.190
 these pm is an article of the 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.370
 wikipedia another one a business article 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.500
 insight that is a gringo site of 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.989
 news and more on this type of 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.849
 thing is ne and another news about a dollar 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.250
 in new york times talking about 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:02.010
 precisely these mercenaries and the pms 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.930
 and everything else then, for sure, it's going to spin 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.940
 around that campaign what we people 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.680
 you should know but on day 4 do not wait 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.660
 multiplayer still lost 4 but by 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.389
 few answers will be given 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.000
 for people like in dini is the 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:17.370
 name of the game is because the game will 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.840
 go through this pms thing and it's 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.519
 It is likely that we will not have anything 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.200
 First World War like that pomegranate 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.320
 that I brought the day before yesterday pointed out yesterday 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.790
 yesterday I do not remember anymore but why this 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.770
 pms business they were the ones 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.330
 allowed from the past and allowing 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.730
 the countries' own army. 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.590
 hired these soldiers 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.270
 private partnerships to help them but 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.500
 nowadays it does not exist anymore then 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.480
 that the pms are considered 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.160
 mercenaries then this is something more current 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.170
 and how it looks like the game will tackle 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.290
 precisely in the mercenaries these 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.300
 premises acting illegally is well 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.340
 probably something of the 21st century something 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.940
 pretty current, right let's hope 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.120
 to see 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.130
 and that's basically it 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.140
 day on the 4th until Sunday that the 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.970
 excerpt will also leave an article in the game 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.040
 which is a respected magazine 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.690
 I met you out there. 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.760
 be the cover of the game uncontested way 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.560
 12 pages of information and everything else 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.300
 The staff here inform me 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.070
 imedi Studios remer then they will 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.720
 talked a lot about the 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.980
 it is very likely that already in this 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.020
 Sunday we have enough 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.420
 information about the new call of duty 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.580
 finally a new era of heat is beginning 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.110
 and with the web itself, let's 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.120
 hope for something quite 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.350
 interesting and cool for us 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.210
