00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.579 

i<00:00:00.060> am<00:00:00.989> dr.<00:00:01.260> Romanov<00:00:02.149> our<00:00:03.830> topic<00:00:04.830> is<00:00:05.569> how<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:07.200> run

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
i am dr. Romanov our topic is how to run

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.320 
i am dr. Romanov our topic is how to run
slow<00:00:09.200> in<00:00:10.200> spite<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:10.910> look<00:00:11.910> like<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> easy

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
slow in spite that it look like a easy

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.420 
slow in spite that it look like a easy
again<00:00:12.830> that<00:00:14.150> as<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.210> matter<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.900> fact<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.430> become

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
again that as a matter of fact it become

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.599 
again that as a matter of fact it become
very<00:00:17.670> difficult<00:00:19.430> thing<00:00:20.430> for<00:00:21.109> novice<00:00:22.109> runners

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
very difficult thing for novice runners

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.240 
very difficult thing for novice runners
they<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.910> couldn't<00:00:24.600> get<00:00:24.840> into<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.710> slow<00:00:26.010> run

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
they just couldn't get into the slow run

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.550 
they just couldn't get into the slow run
for<00:00:27.090> them<00:00:27.269> much<00:00:27.720> more<00:00:27.900> comfortable<00:00:28.349> run

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
for them much more comfortable run

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.420 
for them much more comfortable run
faster<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:31.070> physiological<00:00:32.070> system

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
faster but the physiological system

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
faster but the physiological system
couldn't<00:00:33.290> keep<00:00:34.290> up<00:00:34.469> with<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.489> how<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.120> run

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
couldn't keep up with that so how to run

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.930 
couldn't keep up with that so how to run
slower<00:00:37.160> that<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:39.020> could<00:00:40.020> maintain<00:00:40.950> your

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
slower that you can could maintain your

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.090 
slower that you can could maintain your
physiological<00:00:42.360> system<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.230> normal<00:00:43.620> condition

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
physiological system in normal condition

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.590 
physiological system in normal condition
and<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:45.020> overloaded<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:48.030> premise<00:00:48.420> of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
and not overloaded it so the premise of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.010 
and not overloaded it so the premise of
slow<00:00:48.960> run<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.770> same<00:00:50.039> as<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> normal<00:00:51.239> running

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
slow run is the same as a normal running

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.760 
slow run is the same as a normal running
there<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.920> folder<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.760> pull<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.050> disposed

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
there is a folder is pull and disposed

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.299 
there is a folder is pull and disposed
but<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.940> everything<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.140> little<00:00:58.620> bit<00:00:58.829> squeezed

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
but it everything a little bit squeezed

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.840 
but it everything a little bit squeezed
in<00:01:00.270> space<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.870> time<00:01:01.399> cadence<00:01:02.399> could<00:01:02.609> be<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
in space and time cadence could be the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.940 
in space and time cadence could be the
same<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:04.040> range<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.280> motion<00:01:05.729> there<00:01:06.090> oh<00:01:06.560> if<00:01:07.560> you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
same but range of motion there oh if you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.940 
same but range of motion there oh if you
like<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.810> stride<00:01:09.810> length<00:01:10.049> will<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.680> much

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
like it stride length will be much

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.810 
like it stride length will be much
shorter<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:12.290> efforts<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:14.189> maintain<00:01:14.369> this

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
shorter and efforts to maintain this

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.289 
shorter and efforts to maintain this
thing<00:01:15.090> will<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.479> much<00:01:15.720> less<00:01:16.439> as<00:01:16.680> well<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.820> it's

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
thing will be much less as well so it's

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.920 
thing will be much less as well so it's
again<00:01:19.369> difficulty<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.700> lying<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.600> print

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
again difficulty is lying in the print

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
again difficulty is lying in the print
in<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:23.270> perception<00:01:24.270> area<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.500> anything

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
in the perception area not in anything

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.510 
in the perception area not in anything
else<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.259> learn<00:01:28.470> how<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.920> reduce

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
else so you have to learn how to reduce

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.300 
else so you have to learn how to reduce
everything<00:01:29.759> what<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.420> call<00:01:30.920> efforts<00:01:31.920> range

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
everything what you call efforts range

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.069 
everything what you call efforts range
of<00:01:32.520> motion<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:35.299> if<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.540> like<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:36.900> right

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
of motion and if you like it's right

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.560 
of motion and if you like it's right
length<00:01:37.350> even<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.100> don't<00:01:38.159> want<00:01:38.700> too<00:01:39.450> much

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
length even I don't want too much

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.920 
length even I don't want too much
emphasized<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.439> thing<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.509> hay<00:01:42.750> now

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
emphasized to this thing and the hay now

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.210 
emphasized to this thing and the hay now
practical<00:01:44.299> side<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> clip<00:01:45.829> we<00:01:46.829> will<00:01:46.979> show

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
practical side of the clip we will show

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.899 
practical side of the clip we will show
how<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.670> look<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.950> just<00:01:49.950> look<00:01:50.549> at<00:01:50.729> this

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
how it look like and just look at this

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.240 
how it look like and just look at this
and<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.299> will<00:01:51.479> see<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.799> deviation<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:52.979> very

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
and you will see the deviation but very

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.179 
and you will see the deviation but very
small<00:01:53.640> amount<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.149> angle<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.040> will

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
small amount of angle and then you will

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.209 
small amount of angle and then you will
see<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:57.149> stride<00:01:57.869> length<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.680> very

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
see the stride length but it's very

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.980 
see the stride length but it's very
small<00:01:59.640> your<00:02:00.240> feet<00:02:00.509> barely<00:02:00.869> moving<00:02:01.500> ahead<00:02:01.829> or

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
small your feet barely moving ahead or

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.749 
small your feet barely moving ahead or
leaving<00:02:03.990> behind<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.710> are<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.189> under<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
leaving behind they are just under the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.059 
leaving behind they are just under the
body<00:02:05.939> all<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.390> time<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.469> cadence<00:02:07.710> what

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
body all the time and the cadence what

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.460 
body all the time and the cadence what
you're<00:02:08.250> maintaining<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.270> same<00:02:09.539> as<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.899> do

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
you're maintaining is the same as you do

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.370 
you're maintaining is the same as you do
it<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:11.060> normal<00:02:12.060> running<00:02:12.300> it's

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
it in normal running it's

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.160 
it in normal running it's
out<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.760> 180<00:02:14.760> steps<00:02:15.690> per<00:02:15.930> minute<00:02:16.850> so<00:02:18.140> try<00:02:19.140> it

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
out to 180 steps per minute so try it

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.240 
out to 180 steps per minute so try it
and<00:02:21.020> then<00:02:22.020> we<00:02:22.170> will<00:02:22.320> come<00:02:22.380> back<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.710> this<00:02:22.860> topic

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
and then we will come back to this topic

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.240 
and then we will come back to this topic
again<00:02:23.900> thank<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.340> it's<00:02:26.340> our<00:02:26.610> topic<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.060> today
