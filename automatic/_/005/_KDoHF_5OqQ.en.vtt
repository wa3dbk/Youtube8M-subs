 A lot of people like taking a facial fruit because this is natural, nutritious and easy to 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.820
 doing it. Most fruits are rich sources of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that replenish 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.400
 Skin naturally. 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.860
 1. Clean the face with the baby oil using a piece of cloth. This would remove all external 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.410
 Impurities. 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.410
 2. Place a full finger rub the lemon on the face and rub gently to peel the dead skin. 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.280
 Wipe with cotton cloth. 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 3. Next, apply lemon cleansing gel and clean the face well. 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.890
 Most fruit packets are made by blending soft fruit pulp together to create thick 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.890
 The puree is then applied to the face. In this facial fruit, we used in the first place 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.890
 Two fruits: papaya and banana. Papaya is a natural peeling skin anti-aging agent. 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.410
 Bananas are rich in vitamin C and B6 which is very important for maintaining flexibility 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.200
 Of the skin. 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.550
 It is rich in antioxidants and therefore protects the skin from oxygen free radicals. A natural 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.890
 Moisturizing, moisturizes the skin well. A mixture of these can give a smooth and flexible 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.330
 the skin. 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.330
 4. Prepare a fruit face pack with cumbersome papaya and banana. Make sure that the papaya 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.370
 The bananas are brand new. Apply this to the face and leave it for 20 to 30 minutes. 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.560
 5. Wipe it off with a damp cotton cloth and sprinkle a bit of rose water for the skin.
