00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
until they become sort of a whitish in

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.229 
until they become sort of a whitish in
color<00:00:54.559> so<00:00:55.559> now<00:00:55.770> I'm<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.609> to<00:00:56.730> put<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
color so now I'm going to put in the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.170 
color so now I'm going to put in the
sugar<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.739> there's<00:00:58.920> about<00:00:59.100> 200<00:00:59.789> grams<00:00:59.969> of

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.959 

so<00:03:09.109> basically<00:03:09.620> our<00:03:10.549> muffin<00:03:11.030> mixture<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:12.379> now

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:12.969 
so basically our muffin mixture is now

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:20.949 
so basically our muffin mixture is now
ready<00:03:13.969> for<00:03:14.329> baking<00:03:15.159> scoop<00:03:16.629> the<00:03:17.629> mixture<00:03:19.959> into

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
ready for baking scoop the mixture into

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.330 
ready for baking scoop the mixture into
the<00:03:21.260> cups<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:24.010> just<00:03:25.269> fill<00:03:26.269> up<00:03:26.480> to

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
the cups and just fill up to

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.119 
the cups and just fill up to
three-quarters<00:03:28.989> because<00:03:29.989> we<00:03:30.139> don't<00:03:30.319> want<00:03:30.500> we

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
three-quarters because we don't want we

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.179 
three-quarters because we don't want we
want<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.609> little<00:03:32.060> bit<00:03:32.209> of<00:03:32.389> you<00:03:32.629> know

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.189 
want a little bit of you know

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.550 
want a little bit of you know
overflowing<00:03:34.189> but<00:03:34.639> not<00:03:34.879> too<00:03:35.120> much<00:03:35.150> because

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
overflowing but not too much because

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.199 
overflowing but not too much because
otherwise<00:03:36.560> your<00:03:36.889> muffin<00:03:37.250> will<00:03:37.400> end<00:03:37.549> up<00:03:37.730> on<00:03:37.939> the

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
otherwise your muffin will end up on the

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.640 
otherwise your muffin will end up on the
team<00:03:38.780> rather<00:03:39.049> than<00:03:39.170> in<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.650> cups<00:03:41.650> so

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
team rather than in the cups so

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.679 
team rather than in the cups so
basically<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.069> mixture<00:03:43.400> is<00:03:43.939> all<00:03:44.209> in<00:03:44.359> the<00:03:44.389> cups

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
basically the mixture is all in the cups

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.050 
basically the mixture is all in the cups
now<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.200> it<00:03:45.470> is<00:03:45.680> now<00:03:45.889> they're<00:03:46.519> ready<00:03:46.639> to<00:03:46.879> go<00:03:47.000> to

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
very suitable for past you measure it

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.770 
very suitable for past you measure it
