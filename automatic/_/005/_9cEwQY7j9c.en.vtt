00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.140
 hello youtube users today I come with a review of some of the games that most 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.950
 I liked that it is as it says in the title 'the naruto ya and puden ultimate ninja 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.160
 clog 2 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.450
 it's a great game I think of all of those who have played so much from playstation 2 to 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.380
 playstation 3 this is the best not only for the graphic quality that has improved 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.410
 quite for being a unanimous game but for the game system 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.620
 for example one when playing story mode in certain parts we find 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.020
 that system of the godó shuar that really makes it enjoyable 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.500
 but if you're not familiar with what I'm telling you, I mean, for example, 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.920
 In some parts your enemy will knock you out and you should quickly touch a button that the 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.950
 game tell you how for example circle to dodge the attack is really very 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.350
 good 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.399
 then I loved the new characters that are adding and the attacks that they 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.489
 they put certain things there that I did not like but we will explain them little 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.260
 to little 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.090
 first I will tell you the story mode system 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.219
 We started from the moment Naruto returns from his training with tour and now 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:13.750
 until he defeats perín 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.860
 the only thing that if you play you will notice that the chapter of sasuke akatsuki mode against 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.890
 Kyle Irvi is not 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.780
 they have to collect 84 thousand hindrances and 37 cursed puppets for 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.970
 you can unlock it this game has an advantage that many of the other naruto 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.630
 snob has 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.640
 when playing story mode one can go to any map 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.580
 if I said that 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.130
 bosh with naruto from the village of the leaf if you want to be able to go to the fortress 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.600
 uchiha and so on 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.140
 I loved that because it is very well thought out in truth 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.060
 I really liked that naruto is in senin mode and joc mode do and that all 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.990
 the characters have favorable transformations 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.689
 what I did not like very much was that for example the awakening mode that would come to 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.520
 to be transformed can only be used when you have little life left 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.689
 would be the last resort another thing that I did not like is that naruto mode 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.909
 semen and naruto mode joc hague is the same only change your clothes 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.240
 powerful characters like hitachi p 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.050
 malaga are very badly done but the height of the highs was that all 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.420
 tie will not put the magnetic and bingham 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.459
 over their powers are strips bombs the worst thing is that when they transform it 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.160
 only uses the interim ghaní as a special technique uses the ball of 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.190
 fire anyway I can forgive them because little is known about him 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.060
 but that his initial attacks are bombs is a small lack of respect 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.169
 In my opinion 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.870
 something that can be taken as good as bad is that a 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.719
 surprise character of the game the queen who is lars 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:36.919
 if those of the queen 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.730
 because they made a decision like that I have no idea but you can see that it's 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:44.289
 fashion to implement characters that have nothing to do with the game because in the 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.289
 Last sultan likud we can use to give green light of star wars 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.540
 if you want to know my favorite character of the game it's obviously kakashi I like 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.620
 because his attacks 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.549
 its speed 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:55.560
 your specials 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.679
 etc 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:03:00.459
 I truly believe that he is one of the best characters but not the best 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.540
 misfortune since if you use a ida of the akatsuki group you will be unstoppable 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.560
 you will ask yourself why so strong and in the anime is powerful but neither 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.840
 for so much so in the game he throws you so many combos of explosive birds that 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.890
 it does not let you breathe the worst is that when it transforms it invokes a bird 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.219
 giant that is very difficult to beat 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.349
 an important thing to know before playing that through it was transformed 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.069
 your enemies will not be able to use their special technique against you but 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.279
 Obviously your transformation will last some time in my opinion the best 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.930
 Transformation is that of Naruto Hénin modes when transformed into the fox 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.059
 of the nine tails 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:40.879
 when you are monstrous you are unstoppable big speed luxury attacks really 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.889
 a great character to choose 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.569
 the maps are not as many as in all naruto 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.049
 but these are better made obviously and more detailed 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.999
 There are certain stupid things like in every game 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:55.999
 for example if you are naruto and your enemy is carini you use the ras in 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:59.790
 you win it by just throwing perfume you stop the ras in gam and not only that but 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:03.269
 that also takes away life is something stupid but it's like that 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.099
 in the previous minutes if I remember correctly the powers were pressing 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.190
 twice down and circle and the specials were once triangle or two 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.829
 times for the second special 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.739
 here your powers are handled with triangle nothing more 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.609
 with a triangle and circle you use a special attack like ras in gan 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.389
 with a triangle and keep the circle comes out another attack and with two triangles 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.210
 the second special that as in all other titles is the one that removes more 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.919
 lifetime 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.559
 to reload chacra we must hold the triangle pressed 

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:35.830
 the typical attack combos are almost all doing the following first 

00:04:35.829 --> 00:04:40.079
 we attack with the fists to the enemy then we touch circle and down and if you are kate 

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:40.960
 for example 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.540
 it would disappear to look behind your enemy and there is a small presentation 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.080
 in which you attack him 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.090
 then there is another one that is circle and up and kaka if it hits you then it jumps and makes you 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.090
 the chi dori 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.010
 This game is good that we have at our disposal the choice of 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.120
 language but not your language title 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.720
 there japanese english 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.449
 Spanish 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.400
 I personally recommend Japanese up titled 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.139
 good friends until here comes the video this week I leave with the trailer 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.450
 Game official says goodbye to his ex geothermal friend 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.909
 xilinx what do you have
