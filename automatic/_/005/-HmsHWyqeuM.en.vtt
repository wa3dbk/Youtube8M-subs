 land in the next year and a half there 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.200
 who think like me that this hawk 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.580
 or not like me who think that the 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.619
 alignment of the stars will bring 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.690

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.489
 who think like me that this is going to

 be just a great opportunity to 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.579
 appreciate firsthand how great 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.579
 it is the universe

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.960
 early morning and you will not be able to appreciate 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.090
 all parts of the world but if from the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.610
 north central and south america we are 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.739
 fortunate to be able to witness 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.809
 this phenomenon at first glance although 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.629
 according to experts with binoculars 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.960
 it can be better appreciated still 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.940
 We hope the sky is clear 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.940
 eclipse of the moon can be seen in everything 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.890

 in the morning and four thirty in 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.690
 the morning eastern time and it is a 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.149
 total lunar eclipse where the sun 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.460
 ten the moon will be aligned with the 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.860
 land in the middle preventing all 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.259
 sunlight shines on the moon 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.570
 earth will shade the moon but 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.030
 for being smaller than the sun rays 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.649
 solar collectors get around what 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.399
 will illuminate the moon with a color 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.410

 decades 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.800

 that there is some evidence as such that 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.060
