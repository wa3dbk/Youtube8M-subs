00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
going to do is kind of cook down the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.260 
going to do is kind of cook down the
onions<00:01:19.500> will<00:01:19.950> sweat<00:01:20.369> them<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.790> brown<00:01:21.000> them<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
onions will sweat them and brown them a

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.510 
onions will sweat them and brown them a
little<00:01:21.509> bit<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.140> regular<00:01:22.680> recipe<00:01:22.890> calls<00:01:23.400> for

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
little bit the regular recipe calls for

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.899 
little bit the regular recipe calls for
vegetable<00:01:24.180> oil<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.600> go<00:01:24.720> down<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:26.310> onions

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
vegetable oil to go down but the onions

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.730 
vegetable oil to go down but the onions
actually<00:01:27.390> release<00:01:27.780> their<00:01:27.990> own<00:01:28.140> water<00:01:28.439> when

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
actually release their own water when

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.080 
actually release their own water when
you<00:01:28.860> cook<00:01:29.040> them<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.520> don't<00:01:29.700> think<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:29.880> need

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you cook them so I don't think we need

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.609 
you cook them so I don't think we need
to<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.360> they<00:01:30.509> start<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.899> stick<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> little<00:01:31.350> will

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
to if they start to stick a little will

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.109 
to if they start to stick a little will
probably<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.070> add<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.399> bit<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.880> water

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
probably just add a little bit of water

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.670 
probably just add a little bit of water
to<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.539> pan<00:01:33.720> that's<00:01:34.020> how<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.200> cook<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.470> lot<00:01:34.500> of

to the pan that's how I cook a lot of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.240 
to the pan that's how I cook a lot of
vegetables<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.850> cook<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.060> its<00:01:36.299> own<00:01:37.250> water

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
