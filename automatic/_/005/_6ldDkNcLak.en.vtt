00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
my computer is a little too loud so I

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.850 
my computer is a little too loud so I
think<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.440> learn<00:00:49.649> how<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
think I just have to learn how to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.160 
think I just have to learn how to
configure<00:00:50.280> my<00:00:50.430> microphone<00:00:50.879> better<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.539> know
