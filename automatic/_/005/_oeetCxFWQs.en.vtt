00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
thing about them is and the reason I

thing about them is and the reason I
haven't<00:01:12.079> put<00:01:12.380> them<00:01:12.469> on<00:01:12.679> is<00:01:13.549> because<00:01:14.149> they're

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
haven't put them on is because they're

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.809 
haven't put them on is because they're

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.950 
11 252
and<00:01:29.690> 12<00:01:30.170> 253<00:01:31.040> range<00:01:31.280> in<00:01:31.640> fact<00:01:31.850> even<00:01:32.090> go<00:01:32.450> into<00:01:32.600> 12

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
and 12 253 range in fact even go into 12

and 12 253 range in fact even go into 12
253<00:01:33.710> is<00:01:33.800> a<00:01:33.830> little<00:01:34.100> bit<00:01:34.220> on<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.400> high<00:01:34.580> side<00:01:34.720> so

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
253 is a little bit on the high side so

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.080 
253 is a little bit on the high side so
this<00:01:36.680> particular<00:01:37.010> set<00:01:37.370> of<00:01:37.400> strings<00:01:37.700> is<00:01:38.030> a

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
this particular set of strings is a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.560 
this particular set of strings is a
light<00:01:38.390> gauge<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:39.280> I'm<00:01:40.280> not<00:01:40.580> necessarily<00:01:41.210> too

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
light gauge and I'm not necessarily too

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.780 
light gauge and I'm not necessarily too
keen<00:01:41.870> on<00:01:42.050> trying<00:01:42.350> them<00:01:42.650> but<00:01:42.860> for<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.400> for<00:01:43.760> the

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
keen on trying them but for the for the

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.859 
keen on trying them but for the for the
purposes<00:01:44.270> of<00:01:45.010> evaluation<00:01:46.010> i<00:01:46.130> figured<00:01:46.430> i<00:01:46.490> would

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
purposes of evaluation i figured i would

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.820 
purposes of evaluation i figured i would
DJ<00:01:47.869> 200<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.800> reason<00:01:49.100> i<00:01:49.220> chose<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:50.780> ej<00:01:51.140> 200<00:01:51.680> for

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
DJ 200 the reason i chose the ej 200 for

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.460 
DJ 200 the reason i chose the ej 200 for
this<00:01:51.950> change<00:01:52.220> is<00:01:52.720> because<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.930> elixirs<00:01:54.440> that

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
this change is because the elixirs that

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.859 
this change is because the elixirs that
are<00:01:54.890> on<00:01:55.040> here<00:01:55.450> are<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:57.710> oldest<00:01:58.479> in<00:01:59.479> terms<00:01:59.720> of

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
are on here are the oldest in terms of

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.390 
are on here are the oldest in terms of
the<00:02:00.050> amount<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.320> time<00:02:00.590> they've<00:02:00.950> been<00:02:00.979> on<00:02:01.250> the

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
the amount of time they've been on the

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.620 
the amount of time they've been on the
instrument<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:04.850> know<00:02:04.970> I'm<00:02:05.060> willing<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.390> do

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
instrument so you know I'm willing to do

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.160 
instrument so you know I'm willing to do
it<00:02:05.810> on<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.680> guitar<00:02:07.430> where<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.149> strings<00:02:08.899> are

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
it on a guitar where the strings are

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.609 
it on a guitar where the strings are
slightly

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
slightly

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.820 
slightly
older<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.360> what<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.900> want<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.170> do<00:02:13.319> is<00:02:13.349> I've

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
older so what I want to do is I've

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.280 
older so what I want to do is I've
already<00:02:14.010> tried<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.909> be<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.209> close<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.629> 440<00:02:16.110> as<00:02:16.200> I

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
already tried to be as close to 440 as I

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.520 
already tried to be as close to 440 as I
could<00:02:16.500> with<00:02:16.680> my<00:02:16.709> tuning<00:02:17.190> fork<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:18.019> I<00:02:19.019> want<00:02:19.409> to

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
could with my tuning fork and I want to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
want to do a quick sound check with the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.820 
want to do a quick sound check with the
elixirs<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.209> are<00:02:27.510> on<00:02:27.629> here

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:58.560 

I'll<00:02:32.830> see

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.300 

just<00:02:59.570> want<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.840> give<00:02:59.960> you<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.200> town<00:03:00.410> okay<00:03:01.250> so

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
just want to give you the town okay so

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:10.880 
just want to give you the town okay so
you<00:03:01.670> can<00:03:01.820> hear

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.890 

that<00:03:11.890> ought<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.069> be<00:03:12.189> sufficient<00:03:12.689> I'll<00:03:13.689> try<00:03:13.870> to

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
that ought to be sufficient I'll try to

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.259 
that ought to be sufficient I'll try to
do<00:03:14.079> the<00:03:14.230> same<00:03:14.469> thing<00:03:14.829> with<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.430> Dean<00:03:15.819> Martin's

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
do the same thing with the Dean Martin's

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.920 
do the same thing with the Dean Martin's
once<00:03:16.480> i<00:03:16.599> get<00:03:16.749> them<00:03:16.840> on<00:03:16.959> Dean<00:03:17.319> Martin's<00:03:18.930> Dean

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
once i get them on Dean Martin's Dean

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.679 
once i get them on Dean Martin's Dean
Markley<00:03:20.469> and<00:03:21.030> we'll<00:03:22.030> see<00:03:22.180> what<00:03:22.329> happens<00:03:22.420> i

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689 
Markley and we'll see what happens i

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.860 
Markley and we'll see what happens i
expect<00:03:23.139> the<00:03:23.260> tone<00:03:23.439> to<00:03:23.560> be<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.709> little<00:03:23.889> higher

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
expect the tone to be a little higher

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:32.850 
expect the tone to be a little higher
because<00:03:25.870> they're<00:03:26.049> lighter<00:03:26.290> gauge<00:03:26.730> we'll<00:03:27.730> see

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.950 

okay<00:03:33.580> so<00:03:33.640> it's<00:03:33.970> now<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:35.820> don't<00:03:36.820> 25<00:03:37.660> minutes

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
okay so it's now I don't 25 minutes

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.010 
okay so it's now I don't 25 minutes
later<00:03:39.150> would<00:03:40.150> have<00:03:40.240> taken<00:03:40.390> me<00:03:40.570> a<00:03:40.600> little<00:03:40.780> less

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
later would have taken me a little less

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.110 
later would have taken me a little less
time<00:03:41.050> except<00:03:41.800> I'm<00:03:42.550> not<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:42.850> matters<00:03:43.090> to

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
time except I'm not that it matters to

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.730 
time except I'm not that it matters to
you<00:03:43.330> because<00:03:43.570> you're<00:03:44.320> watching<00:03:44.650> this

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
you because you're watching this

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.670 
you because you're watching this
back-to-back<00:03:45.150> but<00:03:46.150> we<00:03:46.780> had<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:46.930> snow<00:03:47.050> storm<00:03:47.320> so

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
back-to-back but we had a snow storm so

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.090 
back-to-back but we had a snow storm so
I've<00:03:47.800> got<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.010> move<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.280> cars<00:03:48.490> um<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:50.010> put<00:03:51.010> him

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
I've got to move the cars um I put him

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.240 
I've got to move the cars um I put him
on<00:03:51.220> there<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:52.590> brought<00:03:53.590> him<00:03:53.680> up<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:54.070> same

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
on there I brought him up to the same

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.910 
on there I brought him up to the same
pitch<00:03:54.490> and<00:03:55.060> which<00:03:56.020> is<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.170> mistake<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.590> made<00:03:56.740> in<00:03:56.860> a

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
pitch and which is a mistake I made in a

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.400 
pitch and which is a mistake I made in a
previous<00:03:56.950> video<00:03:57.430> for<00:03:58.120> some<00:03:58.300> reason<00:03:58.690> they

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
previous video for some reason they

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.750 
previous video for some reason they
weren't<00:03:59.620> on<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.800> same<00:03:59.980> pitch<00:04:00.250> when<00:04:00.520> I<00:04:00.550> made

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
weren't on the same pitch when I made

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.620 
weren't on the same pitch when I made
the<00:04:00.790> switch<00:04:01.120> from<00:04:01.709> stock<00:04:02.709> strings<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.520> the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
the switch from stock strings to the

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.190 
the switch from stock strings to the
elixirs<00:04:04.630> on<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.830> first<00:04:06.480> string<00:04:07.480> change<00:04:07.810> thing

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
elixirs on the first string change thing

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.290 
elixirs on the first string change thing
for<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.470> guild<00:04:08.650> 50<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.490> don't<00:04:10.090> know<00:04:10.180> why<00:04:10.270> I

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
for the guild 50 I don't know why I

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.430 
for the guild 50 I don't know why I
didn't<00:04:10.540> pay<00:04:10.630> attention<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:11.080> that<00:04:11.200> but<00:04:11.380> I

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
didn't pay attention to that but I

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.979 
didn't pay attention to that but I
should<00:04:11.680> have<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:12.850> original<00:04:13.239> set<00:04:13.510> I<00:04:13.720> should

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
should have the original set I should

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.210 
should have the original set I should
have<00:04:14.050> double<00:04:14.380> check<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.680> make<00:04:14.709> sure<00:04:14.890> they<00:04:15.190> were

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
have double check to make sure they were

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.620 
have double check to make sure they were
the<00:04:15.430> same<00:04:15.610> pitch<00:04:15.880> because<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.120> makes<00:04:16.390> for<00:04:16.600> a

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
the same pitch because that makes for a

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.009 
the same pitch because that makes for a
better<00:04:16.750> comparison<00:04:17.200> in<00:04:17.890> any<00:04:18.070> way<00:04:18.690> yeah<00:04:19.690> I

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
better comparison in any way yeah I

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.530 
better comparison in any way yeah I
found<00:04:20.320> it<00:04:20.500> interesting<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:21.190> Dean<00:04:22.090> Markley

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
found it interesting that Dean Markley

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.840 
found it interesting that Dean Markley
decided<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.620> throw<00:04:23.830> in<00:04:24.100> a<00:04:24.250> dean<00:04:24.520> markley

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
decided to throw in a dean markley

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.330 
decided to throw in a dean markley
sticker<00:04:25.390> in<00:04:26.110> between<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.740> second<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.220> third

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
sticker in between the second and third

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.520 
sticker in between the second and third
strings<00:04:27.880> in<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.240> set<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:29.020> when<00:04:29.169> I<00:04:29.200> took<00:04:29.320> him

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
strings in the set and when I took him

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.170 
strings in the set and when I took him
out<00:04:29.590> of<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.740> box<00:04:29.980> and<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.730> was<00:04:30.850> going<00:04:31.150> through

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
out of the box and I was going through

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.670 
out of the box and I was going through
you<00:04:31.750> know<00:04:31.780> string<00:04:32.110> by<00:04:32.260> string<00:04:32.290> because<00:04:32.620> I

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
you know string by string because I

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.620 
you know string by string because I
changed<00:04:33.010> my<00:04:33.100> strings<00:04:33.430> one<00:04:33.970> of<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.150> time<00:04:34.360> I

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
changed my strings one of the time I

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.500 
changed my strings one of the time I
changed<00:04:35.380> my<00:04:35.440> loi<00:04:35.770> first<00:04:36.190> and<00:04:36.460> my<00:04:36.610> fifth<00:04:37.270> string

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
changed my loi first and my fifth string

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.260 
changed my loi first and my fifth string
and<00:04:37.690> so<00:04:37.840> forth<00:04:38.520> just<00:04:39.520> out<00:04:39.640> of<00:04:39.669> habit<00:04:39.820> so<00:04:40.120> a<00:04:40.150> I

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
and so forth just out of habit so a I

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.719 
and so forth just out of habit so a I
like<00:04:40.450> to<00:04:40.540> do<00:04:40.660> it<00:04:40.780> but<00:04:41.500> I<00:04:41.890> found<00:04:42.460> this<00:04:42.669> in

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
like to do it but I found this in

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.980 
like to do it but I found this in
between<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.360> second<00:04:44.229> and<00:04:44.260> third<00:04:44.350> strings<00:04:44.800> so

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
between the second and third strings so

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.480 
between the second and third strings so
obviously<00:04:46.990> this<00:04:47.229> becomes<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.830> guitar<00:04:48.460> case

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
obviously this becomes a guitar case

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.719 
obviously this becomes a guitar case
sticker<00:04:49.620> if<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.919> want<00:04:51.190> to<00:04:51.250> advocate<00:04:51.520> the

sticker if I want to advocate the

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.120 
sticker if I want to advocate the
strings<00:04:52.120> if<00:04:52.750> I<00:04:53.140> don't<00:04:53.350> think<00:04:53.620> they're<00:04:54.010> worth

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
strings if I don't think they're worth

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.119
