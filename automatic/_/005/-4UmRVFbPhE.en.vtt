00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.110
 hello how you can also hard to see 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.060
 we are currently the kitchen and 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.680
 while in our kitchen and I carry 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.180
 a nerd glasses are extremely 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.950
 At that time, nike mirrors the video for 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.350
 The school arrived incredibly well 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.610
 is and had somehow said at 1,000 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.470
 thumbs up there are within the 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.370
 next two three weeks a second 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.170
 part 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.140
 and I think we have less than 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.660
 24 hours the 1000 also reached high 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.250
 what I just found so blatant and the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.379
 Applications to date the promised 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.260
 second part with five snack ideas the 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.660
 The mega are really fast 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.309
 delicious healthy and arno awesome too 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.090
 take and not a good grandson 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.739
 combination 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.739
 and that's why we start right away 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.080
 The raps need somehow logical 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.970
 then I have a little bit 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.250
 Chicken meat taken as well 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.110
 paprika and tomato ketchups and 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.030
 as well as small and difficult draw 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.440
 tomatoes and I've already started the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.509
 saute small tomatoes in a pan 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.929
 as well as the rear meat and the 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.929
 paprika 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.670
 my self made is really mega 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.799
 easy, and I just enter 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.179
 bit of ketchup to the tomatoes because of me 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.229
 Love it when the sugar is out of the 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.549
 Ketscher presents in the pan 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.679
 caramelized and that's a bit 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.719
 sweet you will of course you can do it too 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.369
 you still have to know me if I am 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.469
 tastes great and in time in the 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.149
 I'll fry my rap with ten cheeses 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.560
 of course that would have to be deleted as well 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.359
 not why if she is not ten kilos 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.039
 Thus, then just take the cream cheese 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.109
 example and I just mine 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.130
 fried ingredients are given in the rap and 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.130
 that spread a bit 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.740
 berlin red something but everything before 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.150
 a pack then keeps that really good 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.350
 also very good to take away 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.899
 then you just put it a bread box 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.400
 and tada a great snake for the school 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.080
 for example easy to take away 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.460
 and I have to say that they taste good 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.460
 really mega mega delicious 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.379
 The check is really super easy 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.120
 and although I have only now a few 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.230
 Frozen turn up then emerged 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.659
 placed in a mixer 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.859
 just like half a banana you could 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.599
 also a whole I take that 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.189
 is enough then actually comes 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.780
 a few thick flakes with it all 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.519
 Of course you can also do it 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.720
 oatmeal or so take then give 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.310
 I cut a few more 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.439
 Data just add it up 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.030
 Sweet or have natural fashion 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.900
 I'm mistaken myself for a bit 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.549
 decided because I just 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.290
 tried it and I think it's great 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.909
 Of course, there is one more delicious 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.859
 Add a little normal milk because 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:03:00.889
 I just make milk or have something 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:02.209
 All well mixed by I have one 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.340
 breakfast , he gets back into it 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.720
 old rudi glass is the super soon 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.549
 so you can find it on the go 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.829
 easy to take along and the color he sees 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.900
 always really cool or me 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.489
 make the thing somehow the boss makes 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.409
 through the banana and the things block 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.669
 still relatively long says what I super 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.739
 courage for the school for example or 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.269
 easy to find on the go because who 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.709
 does not even know what boredom always 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.209
 a bit hungry and me, somehow 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.159
 I would like to see you through the camera 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.659
 give it away so you can try it if 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.799
 you want to know how well the taste 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.799
 then it's just imitating 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.640
 both the name is new to me 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.620
 For this purpose I have first 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.310
 such village in from a tour 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.989
 took 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.220
 they are available in nature and salted but 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.020
 I think that nature is a bit 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.030
 fits better and I just have one 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.580
 half banana cut small and also 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.680
 both sides of my rice waffles what also 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.150
 always something peanut must be given 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.310
 I think that's good with seed 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.540
 then glue together and I have on it 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.209
 still a bit behind mine 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.980
 The charge is 100 percent more 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.110
 exists and no artificial sugar 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.610
 In addition, for example, what I have a lot 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.830
 good find because it's all me 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.269
 really so financially father anthony moderate 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.269
 just in good health 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.509
 mega delicious but as you can not see 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:18.509
 so easy to eat 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.870
 For this we need a bit of salad 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.940
 tomato humus and grass with the cheese and 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.400
 First I have my salad leaves 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.200
 So mini romand leaves will be something 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.090
 humus coated and then at 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.400
 ruwel the thesis that escada been 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.260
 and then I have that 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.420
 just tried as possible 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.040
 to roll that thick white one 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:52.330
 not in the middle of me somewhere 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:53.950
 the thing also quite good with it all 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.450
 I still have a little better 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.490
 with a charity martin one 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.020
 toothpick attached and that is now 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.510
 really as well as simplest variant 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.550
 This salad rapeseed you can of course 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.860
 with all sorts of stuff for example 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.630
 even with turkey breast or even salami it 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.250
 Definitely delicious but I found 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.390
 somehow combination of cheese and 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.390
 had to be very delicious 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.580
 For this we need more I have me 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.130
 now completely decided to me 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.919
 also two eggs then a zucchini 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.750
 and then we need some feta cheese 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.490
 a little more baking powder and such 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.900
 muffin molds are best suited 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.310
 the little silicone folk 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.560
 Of course you can do that too 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:42.729
 you have at home or first does not rattle 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:44.560
 my zucchini to these zucchini gast 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.570
 he comes but the package I just see 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.850
 with the help of my hands have crumbled so 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.440
 and then you can not on the eggs 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.789
 add flour and the baking powder 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.430
 and then you can easily do it now 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:55.900
 by mixing all distracts information because I 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.699
 have two three portions made him 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.990
 again in the infobox that is me 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.850
 linked to a recipe and there you can 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:06.100
 just for your portion and wishes 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:07.960
 tackle too dry is then give 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.490
 just add some milk and with that 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.320
 whole further through with it so one 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.970
 thicker dough thereby acquiring the 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.330
 fill this well into the mesh industry 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.330
 can 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:23.009
 Munich 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.490
 and then the power comes now too 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:32.160
 already at 190 degrees and upper lower heat 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.160
 in the oven for about 30 minutes 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.520
 then the whole thing will look and feel like that 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.440
 It's best for you to cool off something I am 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.240
 also someone who likes to be called male 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.069
 But actually it is not a good idea 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.599
 and they are really delicious 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:47.919
 I also tried it for the first time and 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:49.539
 I am absolutely thrilled 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.070
 You can definitely take it with you 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:52.300
 but i also like that as well 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.400
 a side of salad, for example 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:58.300
 I can imagine and yes to everyone 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.880
 I highly recommend case of course 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.139
