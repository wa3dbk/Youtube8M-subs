00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.700
 Hello guys 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.080
 Welcome to another painting in 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.349
 five minutes 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.759
 today with a design of grapes grapes 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.230
 red nÃ© 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.560
 we had already made the jug the bottle 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.660
 in the previous video and we will continue 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.130
 here with the gloves 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.360
 so I separated some very colors 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:38.960
 pretty purple background 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.090
 I came to shade and lights with a red 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.360
 flourishing it gives this essence nuance 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.719
 or wonderful video, right? 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.780
 but the black one will help a lot 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.050
 to make the shadows then before 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.140
 start to fill the rains 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:04.160
 We're going to censor a little wine. 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.160
 in black and we will fill the spaces 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:16.970
 among them this is a space here has 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.790
 another another here here a little bit here 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:24.090
 It is a light fill first saving 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.320
 and if this fund is to start 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.320
 fill the rains 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:38.860
 the bottom is already filled 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:43.060
 now we'll start to fill in and the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.160
 gloves all or even change brush here 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.830
 I have brush number 4 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.100
 But as the gloves are bigger we go with 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.290
 a brush number 8 even then it 's just 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.470
 fill in purple 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.910
 then we'll darken're beginning 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.910
 just in case 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.590
 so now I've finished filling 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.920
 all with culture and we will start the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.610
 shadows with wine 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.290
 if you want to acquire handouts 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:27.180
 dvds designs brushes videos or six 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:31.000
 hits on my site www.maxipark.com.br 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.959
 and we'll fill in all the shadows where 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.489
 put the shadow always below the 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:42.250
 another grape always below never looks in 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:46.540
 Upstairs because it's going to be suzy then we 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.590
 Let's darken down here with wine. 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.110
 let's dry accelerate drying with 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:57.330
 dryer and then 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.980
 blooming red this is good 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.850
 so she will receive only shadow 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.799
 behind 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.370
 this is very important to define the 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:09.670
 shade of the grape because then come the lights 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.709
 definitive 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.010
 I always start with the first one and I go 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.500
 climbing up to the last one up there because 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.610
 as one is below the other we 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:25.350
 we always have to start with the first 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.350
 and we follow 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:37.890
 and I'm going to put it above all here with 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:41.980
 wine and a bait of black she will stay 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:45.310
 more beautiful yet very few 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.670
 look at a bait people because black is a 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.420
 dominant color with starting here and if you 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.459
 put much goes too dark 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:00.189
 so it was only a little bit the bait of 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:02.109
 black where you on the povinho that goes 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:07.709
 give a nice touch 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:07.709
 If you want to learn how to paint 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:15.419
 these wonderful pieces all 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.419
 templates on the site 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.630
 www.escolasesc.com.br ms.com br br 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:38.830
 I believe everything is dark now 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:41.500
 I'll dry a little with a dryer and 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.840
 let's make the lights with red 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.130
 blooming left to pull here 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.740
 easier 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:52.260
 in the corner of the brush you get a 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.260
 bit of blooming red 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:59.649
 and only on the outside it dips only in the 

00:04:57.549 --> 00:05:05.829
 external part 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:10.019
 You've been giving the lights. 

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:10.019
 very straight contour 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:20.159
 and now only a few lights with white I go 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.439
 throw the lights all over that side 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:25.110
 if you want to get in touch 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:28.229
 with me my email is more bread 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:34.019
 at hotmail.com 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:38.969
 I myself respond and the staff of the 

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:42.199
 facebook can access the page by painting 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:42.199
 with marchas to pass bread 

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:51.269
 here is the finished project I hope 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:54.029
 You enjoyed it and see you next time. 

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:56.569
 not painting in five minutes with martins 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.569
 to pass bread
