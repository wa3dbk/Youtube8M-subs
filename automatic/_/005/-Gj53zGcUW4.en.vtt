00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.689
 guys girls hello all of me yes cut 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.630
 unleashed and this is minecraft today as 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.880
 every Thursday I bring you the video of 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.290
 I have got you used to seed 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.420
 because lately replacing the 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.550
 incredible seeds from the seeds 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.940
 there are 15 diamonds for the face in the 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.370
 populated language of mushrooms and so on 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.760
 then the one who touches today the truth that 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.590
 it is very, very good, it is also a 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.440
 I challenge you and I propose that 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:36.460
 start this map today or when 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.460
 you can because it's a good challenge come on 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.240
 and we were here we put this seed 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.100
 just agree to always look here 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.350
 that there are no more spaces because if 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.520
 there is a space is not going to be generated or here 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.310
 that we have a space is worth it we remove it 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.300
 and ready we generate structures we do not touch 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.650
 nothing here is worth 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.000
 and we create world 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.120
 We create world and see where we went is 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.190
 very well the seed 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:12.430
 we see more we see much more are worth 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.760
 we see we see that there is only bad 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.400
 the seeds brings an island worth such that 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.840
 this island 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.260
 s in love with a single tree worth going 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.970
 where you go there is nothing just a biome 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.840
 of mushrooms that is here is below 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.450
 great you already have a tree and you're 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.300
 being a survival map is a 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.570
 mushroom biome because quite big very 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.540
 very nice and good I will teach you 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.910
 that brings this mushroom biome so low 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.040
 worth with a tree you have to take care of 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.420
 well already planting trees all that 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.500
 because it is that if there is nothing that 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.660
 do 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.330
 I can see there we have joined in there is worth 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.180
 you have here just seen this 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.640
 small protruding pillar that makes a 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.720
 little beach here a nice creek and os 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.590
 you go to this mushroom worth and in this mushroom 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.470
 there's the trunk and here you count 1 2 and 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.750
 3 in the room 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.170
 but I had to take a show because I 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:21.750
 if I do not see the two either 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.459
 in the room we go down here is worth and 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.150
 already here I'm going to take a block so that 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.150
 do not go in now 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.210
 not me 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.560
 and here with care because I 'm going to 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.460
 find an answer and I'm going to break it 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.190
 and I do not want to find an answer 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.290
 zombies is worth having it is a cave 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.880
 typical iron and they do not have to offer 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.330
 It is worth looking for already heard against 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.510
 chest is how very just to leave 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.610
 deform the cavern in a bar the 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.420
 backing in a cave and would be here the 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.400
 chest 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.650
 and let's say that they have broken that they are not 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.180
 ok but let's follow the stone and you 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.580
 make an experience farm 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.410
 quite 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.060
 nice 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.290
 and we also have 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.420
 well we have left we have here the tree 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.980
 okay then we throw it there and you see 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.379
 there are in the distance that you have the first 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.260
 line is brown is being colored 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:23.620
 red and the second brown line is in 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.800
 red color we come here 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.370
 and such that here 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.490
 and we go down 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.430
 father 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.470
 answers skeletons guys also brings 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.620
 a cave a mini cave valley I think 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.190
 there was not much more country over there such and 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.530
 what iron is there, what is typical is 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.060
 nothing food a cure vince that is going to 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.290
 serve no purpose because there are no logs of 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.019
 June 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.090
 and nothing nothing great to do a 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.549
 place with perhaps more fishing rod for 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.870
 do not die of hunger and such but let's 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.959
 I am very seeing skeletons farm 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.790
 because because that's how you basically get out 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.879
 bone 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.709
 in a way that wants to fly I want to 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.200
 fly well well in a pretty way 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.790
 fast and economical and then good apart 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.469
 If you do not know what kind of farm you can 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.019
 do I think my third video of 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:17.720
 tutorials is a skeleton farm 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.959
 so right there you can do it and if 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.009
 we did not sell over here to the opposite side 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.919
 we come here 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:29.550
 and how this truth cube is like 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.380
 perfectly done 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.380
 Well, nothing is going to get 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.320
 we are going to put it 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.040
 if we enter because I 'm going to do it and 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.040
 let's cover everything 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:48.830
 if you see this stone to dispense it 

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:51.319
 better is lava no guys is another response 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.330
 another responds there is here that is 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:56.050
 submerged left to stay here is 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.050
 pretty curious 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.500
 and see if he covered it and we see it because if 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.220
 there is nothing to do 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.220
 to see see 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:17.860
 to enter very well like that 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:20.309
 nowadays it is there you can see the stone 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.309
 very pink 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.379
 is a farm is a farm that 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.429
 after zombies 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.429
 just zombies 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.070
 who believes the whole motto 'if you do not go 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.910
 to be able to offer anything and the one that comes in 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.910
 Water 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:43.069
 Hello 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.670
 good guys this is a cavern worth and 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.670
 this caverns is going to bring 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.670
 a dungeon over there in agreement there's 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:57.090
 nothing good too and the truth is that 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.740
 very well and the chests have nothing and 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.610
 least to mount pigs and how to 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.740
 super pigs 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.659
 and more of the same or be a garbage of 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.719
 according to the new interesting thing is that 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:10.710
 iron and you answer that letters that 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:10.710
 we have here 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.370
 and well basically this has been the 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:21.390
 today's seed 3 res bread mushroom biome 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.040
 and only island of a single tree there is no more 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.380
 if you spend in that way you have 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.080
 left without a flag or is it a map of 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.690
 survival to see if you can achieve 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.970
 end here and kill the dragon I challenge you 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.400
