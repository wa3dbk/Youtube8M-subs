00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
better I mean we needed to transition

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.519 
better I mean we needed to transition
better<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.840> take<00:00:24.990> better<00:00:25.170> care<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
better you can take better care of the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.410 
better you can take better care of the
ball<00:00:25.680> need<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.340> take<00:00:26.460> better<00:00:26.490> shots<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.359> I

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
ball need to take better shots and I

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.640 
ball need to take better shots and I
think<00:00:27.630> when<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.840> started<00:00:28.170> doing<00:00:28.349> all<00:00:28.470> those

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
think when we started doing all those

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.320 
think when we started doing all those
three<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.550> started<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:29.939> taking<00:00:30.179> better

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
three it started with taking better

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.609 
three it started with taking better
shots<00:00:30.599> right<00:00:30.810> at<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.960> start<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.289> second

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
shots right at the start of the second

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.049 
shots right at the start of the second
half<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.099> get<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.460> think<00:00:32.669> two<00:00:32.790> or<00:00:32.880> three

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
half you can get it I think two or three

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.970 
half you can get it I think two or three
three-point<00:00:33.480> plays<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> row<00:00:34.050> knocked<00:00:34.739> out

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
three-point plays in a row knocked out

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.830 
three-point plays in a row knocked out
of<00:00:35.130> three<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.910> obviously<00:00:36.270> got<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.540> crowd

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
of three and obviously got the crowd

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.860 
of three and obviously got the crowd
going<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.290> got<00:00:37.440> back<00:00:37.620> into<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.450> that

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
going and got back into it and that that

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.209 
going and got back into it and that that
slowed<00:00:40.170> down<00:00:40.350> their<00:00:40.559> transition<00:00:41.040> we

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
slowed down their transition we

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.799 
slowed down their transition we
obviously<00:00:41.399> guard<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.940> much<00:00:42.360> better<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
obviously guard it much better the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.119 
obviously guard it much better the
