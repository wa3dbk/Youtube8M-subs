same<00:01:49.259> lines<00:01:49.860> as<00:01:50.479> Angry<00:01:51.479> Birds<00:01:51.720> you're<00:01:52.049> trying

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
same lines as Angry Birds you're trying

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.380 
same lines as Angry Birds you're trying
to<00:01:52.500> get<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.399> survive<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.210> gets

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
to get and survive and it gets

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.240 
to get and survive and it gets
progressively<00:01:54.659> harder<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:55.890> see<00:01:56.100> this

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
progressively harder you can see this

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.300 
progressively harder you can see this
one<00:01:56.490> here<00:01:57.060> actually<00:01:57.270> has<00:01:57.920> one<00:01:58.920> already<00:01:59.100> made

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
one here actually has one already made

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.950 
one here actually has one already made
because<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.640> already<00:01:59.729> finish<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.210> level<00:02:00.540> you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
because I already finish this level you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.359 
because I already finish this level you
can<00:02:01.079> see<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.350> has<00:02:01.530> different<00:02:01.770> things<00:02:02.130> like

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
can see it has different things like

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.020 
can see it has different things like
propellers<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.710> these<00:02:04.710> air<00:02:04.979> pushers<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.700> when

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
propellers and these air pushers so when

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.580 
propellers and these air pushers so when
you<00:02:06.119> start<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.689> actually<00:02:07.020> push<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
you start it you can actually push the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.820 
you start it you can actually push the
air<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:08.879> see<00:02:09.060> here<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.300> explode<00:02:10.259> into

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
air and you can see here I explode into

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.730 
air and you can see here I explode into
the<00:02:11.300> TNT<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.720> roll<00:02:12.989> across

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
the TNT and then I roll across

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.470 
the TNT and then I roll across
finish<00:02:14.010> line<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.250> that's<00:02:14.550> somewhat<00:02:15.300> how<00:02:15.420> you

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
finish line so that's somewhat how you

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.000 
finish line so that's somewhat how you
want<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.720> do<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:15.960> can<00:02:16.080> see<00:02:16.230> here<00:02:16.470> how<00:02:16.980> it
