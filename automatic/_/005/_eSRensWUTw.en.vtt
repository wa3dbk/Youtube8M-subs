00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello together today will be spectacular 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.080
 because there are scallops with liquorice 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:13.080
 pesto you know what that means 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.210
 means to grill my grill 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.550
 blogger colleague jay kay from heat 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.400
 comedian and christian the ruler over 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.199
 The licorice planets just got me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.400
 It's a disposal 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.560
 corresponding link I grab you 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.320
 Of course in the video description 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.579
 licorice powder and syrup would be 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.460
 laughed if we do not have one 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.530
 Use for we would start with 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.170
 two to three tablespoons toasted 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.210
 pine nuts one to two handfuls 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.560
 fresh basil olive oil 100 to 120 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.980
 2 milliliters of garlic cloves and 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.440
 parmesan cheese about 50 grams and of course 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.140
 our licorice syrup we want today 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.540
 make a licorice pesto if you can 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.040
 start to google about licorice 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.120
 and co you will see that something 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.350
 is something in the near future in the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.840
 gastronomy is still full 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.799
 I'm looking forward to it here 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.619
 youtube to be the first one 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.729
 at all a receptor combination of 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.549
 Grill makes the preparation of the pastor 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.090
 is just as simple as the pine nuts 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:23.960
 garlic cloves basil and the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.340
 Put parmesan cheese in a blender 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.689
 with the amount of liquorice you have to 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.100
 Be careful, we want it 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.560
 not too much in the foreground 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.130
 That's why I decided to do it 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.979
 on this amount festo a half 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.979
 Teaspoon to take from the paint 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.710
 yes, then I start the whole mixa yet 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.859
 without crushing the oil and then giving 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.109
 can gradually add the olive oil here 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.880
 one then from the crowd of men 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:09.219
 the consistency decide if you want something 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.219
 takes less or a little more of the oil 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.920
 then full speed 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.120
 and we are done 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.780
 For me, the consistency is so accurate 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.170
 super we take care of times 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.940
 Scallops I have six here 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.550
 Scallops with them to some extent 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.970
 stay in shape to really like these 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.970
 with bacon 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.560
 The monolith grill is prepared for 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.470
 medium direct heat and now barbecue 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.690
 We got our scallops from both 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.690
 each three to four minutes 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.110
 in between turn once 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.569
 and then they are almost good 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:52.559
 now only the liquorice festo 

00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:56.739
 pass and finish 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:59.349
 spectacular scallops with licorice 

00:04:56.739 --> 00:05:01.539
 Pesto I tell you what you will become 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.439
