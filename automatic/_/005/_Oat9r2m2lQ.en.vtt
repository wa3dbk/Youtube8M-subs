00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:13.709
 did you know that we have a heavy 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.339
 Game is warned about it was a 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.809
 heavy game 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.939
 why does she still have the better end ? 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.439
 for you, because in the end, it's up to us 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.609
 believed because we are more for 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.869
 have done yes chance 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.199
 played out as the adversary and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.089
 that's why it deserves to be won but 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.519
 There was still a lot of sand in the area 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.079
 we have to grow 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.430
 of course if we go further up 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.330
 want to play the six points 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.110
 Of course we have also made up for it but we 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.110
 still need to increase 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.440
 we made it our intention 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.090
 the game that we the next three 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.920
 retract after the first away game 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.560
 we have three points in front of our own audience 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.170
 clinging here and above all because of it 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.580
 the second half-time is the voltage 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.840
 expected carrier players all very well 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.150
 stood and just first half 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.100
 what difficult to play cards from 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.350
 but then there was the one or 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.180
 others must deal more consistently , however 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.680
 by and large have patience 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.290
 proved and then rewarded on 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.570
 circuit dominated the 90 minutes 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.380
 the game maybe once 23 minutes 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.820
 something unsettled then you deserve 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.140
 very relieved i want germany 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.270
 building block print because I knew that 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.890
 everyday defensively well adjusted 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.180
 always and she always is and she is 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.840
 was also on us today 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.070
 adjusted 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.680
 that's why it's hard to get involved 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.000
 come so you can see that already 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.290
 following work is done that one 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.810
 not for nothing has become third in the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.150
 last year in europe league against 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.600
 camaras can not say how to get the 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.600
 pronounce 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.520
 deserved to win so that's one 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:19.310
 good team and that's why I am 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:21.380
 relieved because we stayed patient 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.060
 are because we just tried the 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.440
 opponents to play from left to right 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.430
 right 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.230
 Of course it may be for that 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.519
 the fans are not as attractive as we are 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.709
 also play with you over the back 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.120
 but thumbs that's important 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.650
 to make an opponent 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.519
 disassemble and that's also true 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.690
 his chance came 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.489
 yes I believe in the program 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.739
 preparation worked well as 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.019
 Team extremely moved together and victories 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.489
 natural and room to help us well in 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.260
 the season started but still nothing 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.489
 achieved and now you want performance 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.810
 to confirm the next weeks 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.790
 blind understanding I would now 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.769
 do not say but I'll tell you everything 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.450
 good understanding because we know that 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.980
 Walks we rehearsed quite well 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.870
 and yes I think that works completely 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.330
 good but of course it has to get better 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.920
 we can still go there too 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.299
 then we took what we played 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.860
 have now delivered team 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.510
 Trust she realizes that she is easy 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.470
 can do much more than what they are in 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.700
 Last year has delivered that 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.739
 Of course, with the newcomers 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.360
 few other parameters or added 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.690
 are 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.850
 which naturally give impulses for us and 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.620
 that's why she believes in me and the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.480
 win in the wrc and the cup so cup victory 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.010
 always doing well 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.870
 no substitute for victory have known that 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.280
 we are in a good mood for being that 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.800
 have confidence after the last game 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.930
 and we really wanted the three 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.240
 points and then we are relatively fast 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.680
 the 2 1 succeeded then of course one 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.800
 we have to open up a bit 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.060
 get this year and eleven meters and 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.550
 of course my cards played with that 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.890
 3 1 2 if you then time there with two 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.240
 at home then you should 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.950
 normal in this game i believe 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.450
 Every player needs trust and me 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.410
 I am the trainer of 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.030
 the whole team 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.930
 I think it was important to that 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.730
 my first preparation of the 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.739
 needs plan even better 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.140
 and that's the way it goes 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.940
 i have my trainer and co-trainer 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.850
 of course, something has said something 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.380
 for balls i need and they have too 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.239
 It is equivalent to her 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.860
 philosophy and of course i can 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.739
 then put something better in scene if 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.440
 I get the balls in the 16er than if 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.180
 I like it once in a while 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.100
 because I just do not get it 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.720
 I agree with the safety or the table 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.580
 only forwarded but rather the the 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.040
 just keep doing more work 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.110
 believe in us wanting to improve in 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.250
 every game we can do too 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.250
 of course
