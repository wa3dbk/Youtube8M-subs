00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
game Pokemon so I'm just using my

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.640 
game Pokemon so I'm just using my
competitive<00:01:26.939> Pokemon<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.500> just

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
competitive Pokemon but if you just

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.609 
competitive Pokemon but if you just
utilize<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.130> same<00:01:29.640> strategy<00:01:30.210> then<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.380> should

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
utilize the same strategy then it should

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.789 
utilize the same strategy then it should
just<00:01:31.770> work<00:01:31.890> fine

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.139 

all<00:01:39.859> right<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:40.250> apparently<00:01:40.340> if<00:01:40.880> you've

won if you want but if you can only use
in-game<00:02:45.530> Pokemon<00:02:46.190> then<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:47.480> try<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.049> get

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
in-game Pokemon then just try to get

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.629 
in-game Pokemon then just try to get
these<00:02:48.889> moves<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.280> everything<00:02:49.900> see<00:02:50.900> ya<00:02:51.019> I

these moves and everything see ya I

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.400 
these moves and everything see ya I
switched<00:02:52.639> out<00:02:52.760> from<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:53.030> spirit<00:02:53.269> before<00:02:54.139> I

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
switched out from that spirit before I

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.039 
switched out from that spirit before I
take<00:02:54.799> out<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.190> picture<00:02:55.730> because<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.480> want<00:02:56.989> to

just roar it out with stealth rocks on

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.490 
just roar it out with stealth rocks on
the<00:03:25.250> field<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.880> course<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.299> then<00:03:26.840> when<00:03:27.410> it

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
the field of course and then when it

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.650 
the field of course and then when it
comes<00:03:27.590> back<00:03:27.769> in<00:03:28.040> I'm<00:03:28.340> pretty<00:03:29.209> sure<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.569> will

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
comes back in I'm pretty sure it will

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.199 
comes back in I'm pretty sure it will
faint<00:03:29.930> if<00:03:30.139> not<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.590> will<00:03:30.799> have<00:03:30.980> 1<00:03:31.250> hp<00:03:31.609> left<00:03:32.200> or<00:03:33.200> I

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
faint if not it will have 1 hp left or I

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.900 
faint if not it will have 1 hp left or I
think<00:03:35.209> 1<00:03:35.359> XP<00:03:35.660> yeah<00:03:36.819> so<00:03:37.819> I<00:03:39.669> missed<00:03:40.669> what

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
think 1 XP yeah so I missed what

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.050 
think 1 XP yeah so I missed what
happened<00:03:41.239> there<00:03:41.419> but<00:03:42.280> sends<00:03:43.280> out<00:03:43.400> some<00:03:43.760> relax

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
happened there but sends out some relax

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.039 
happened there but sends out some relax

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
this special socks that specialism

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.949 
this special socks that specialism
retarded<00:03:48.530> but<00:03:48.739> special<00:03:49.669> as<00:03:49.850> in<00:03:50.120> special

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
retarded but special as in special

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.629 
retarded but special as in special
attacking<00:03:51.410> although<00:03:52.100> I<00:03:52.130> guess<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.459> would

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
attacking although I guess you would

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:53.290 
attacking although I guess you would
have<00:03:52.850> to<00:03:53.000> be<00:03:53.090> a

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
have to be a

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.790 
have to be a
harder<00:03:53.540> to<00:03:53.690> use<00:03:53.720> a<00:03:53.870> special<00:03:54.410> attacking

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
harder to use a special attacking

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:02.260 
harder to use a special attacking
strikes<00:03:55.340> so<00:03:56.060> either<00:03:56.570> way<00:03:58.720> he<00:03:59.720> along<00:04:00.500> with<00:04:01.270> the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
strikes so either way he along with the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.950 
strikes so either way he along with the
Lapras<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:02.990> Blastoise<00:04:03.560> both<00:04:03.860> have<00:04:04.930> Blizzard

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
Lapras and Blastoise both have Blizzard

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.280 
Lapras and Blastoise both have Blizzard
which<00:04:06.410> is<00:04:06.680> perfect<00:04:07.310> accuracy<00:04:08.020> inhale

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
which is perfect accuracy inhale

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.840 
which is perfect accuracy inhale
so<00:04:09.680> that's<00:04:09.830> another<00:04:10.040> reason<00:04:10.310> why<00:04:10.520> you<00:04:10.550> want<00:04:10.670> to

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
so that's another reason why you want to

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.020 
so that's another reason why you want to
get<00:04:10.940> rid<00:04:11.120> of<00:04:11.150> hail<00:04:11.390> I<00:04:12.340> want<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.400> say<00:04:13.520> perfect<00:04:13.940> I

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
get rid of hail I want to say perfect I

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.520 
get rid of hail I want to say perfect I
mean<00:04:14.210> like<00:04:14.530> aerial<00:04:15.530> ace<00:04:16.390> accuracy<00:04:17.390> so<00:04:18.200> it'll

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
mean like aerial ace accuracy so it'll

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.820 
mean like aerial ace accuracy so it'll
hit<00:04:18.680> every<00:04:19.040> time<00:04:19.220> with<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:20.060> hail<00:04:20.239> going<00:04:20.510> and

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
hit every time with the hail going and

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.370 
hit every time with the hail going and
it<00:04:21.830> even<00:04:22.130> has<00:04:22.310> a<00:04:22.390> slight<00:04:23.390> chance<00:04:23.630> to<00:04:24.020> hit

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
it even has a slight chance to hit

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.090 
it even has a slight chance to hit
through<00:04:24.710> protect<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.370> detect<00:04:26.020> so<00:04:27.020> take<00:04:27.950> out

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
through protect and detect so take out

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.270 
through protect and detect so take out
the<00:04:28.280> Charizard<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:32.590> switch<00:04:33.590> into<00:04:33.800> Blastoise

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
the Charizard and switch into Blastoise

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:43.720 
the Charizard and switch into Blastoise
so<00:04:34.640> I<00:04:34.970> switch<00:04:35.390> out<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.780> my<00:04:36.490> effect<00:04:37.490> or<00:04:37.760> to<00:04:42.730> use

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
so I switch out to my effect or to use

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:55.780 
so I switch out to my effect or to use
the<00:04:44.120> sunny<00:04:44.540> day<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:45.850> solar<00:04:46.850> beam<00:04:52.810> so<00:04:53.810> and<00:04:54.790> then

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
the sunny day and solar beam so and then

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.320 
the sunny day and solar beam so and then
I<00:04:55.820> missed<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.420> part<00:04:56.630> where<00:04:56.900> it<00:04:57.050> said<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.880> Sun

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
I missed that part where it said the Sun

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.120 
I missed that part where it said the Sun
is<00:04:59.360> faded<00:04:59.840> and<00:05:00.020> I<00:05:00.650> go<00:05:00.800> for<00:05:01.570> another<00:05:02.919> sunny<00:05:03.919> day

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
is faded and I go for another sunny day

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.040 
is faded and I go for another sunny day
and<00:05:04.480> I<00:05:06.940> just<00:05:07.940> realized<00:05:08.150> I<00:05:08.419> forgot<00:05:08.450> to<00:05:08.900> mention

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
and I just realized I forgot to mention

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.340 
and I just realized I forgot to mention
the<00:05:09.650> full<00:05:09.980> restores<00:05:10.930> even<00:05:11.930> though<00:05:12.020> I<00:05:12.050> am
