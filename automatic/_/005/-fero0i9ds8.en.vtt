even though it's cut coming off kind of
low<00:01:47.170> that's<00:01:48.159> still<00:01:48.549> something<00:01:49.030> we<00:01:49.270> want<00:01:49.479> to

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
low that's still something we want to

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.840 
low that's still something we want to
