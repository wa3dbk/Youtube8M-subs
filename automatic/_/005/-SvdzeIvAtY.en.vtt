comm today we're going to continue
working<00:00:09.110> with<00:00:09.260> fractions<00:00:09.889> and<00:00:10.010> today<00:00:10.639> we're

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
working with fractions and today we're

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.580 
working with fractions and today we're
going<00:00:10.969> to<00:00:11.150> learn<00:00:11.360> how<00:00:11.690> to<00:00:11.719> write<00:00:12.139> fractions

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
going to learn how to write fractions

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.459 
going to learn how to write fractions
out<00:00:13.039> as<00:00:13.309> words<00:00:13.820> because<00:00:14.690> now<00:00:14.869> we've<00:00:15.110> learned

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
out as words because now we've learned

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.650 
out as words because now we've learned
the<00:00:15.980> basics<00:00:16.010> in<00:00:16.550> the<00:00:16.640> last<00:00:16.880> section<00:00:17.150> of<00:00:17.480> how<00:00:17.600> to

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
the basics in the last section of how to

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.060 
the basics in the last section of how to
write<00:00:17.869> a<00:00:17.900> fraction<00:00:18.199> down<00:00:18.619> in<00:00:18.770> terms<00:00:18.949> of

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
write a fraction down in terms of

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.100 
write a fraction down in terms of
numbers<00:00:19.520> now<00:00:20.360> we<00:00:20.420> probably<00:00:20.780> should<00:00:20.990> get<00:00:21.050> a

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
numbers now we probably should get a

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.540 
numbers now we probably should get a
little<00:00:21.320> practice<00:00:21.830> with<00:00:21.860> how<00:00:22.190> do<00:00:22.250> you<00:00:22.370> write

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
little practice with how do you write

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.460 
little practice with how do you write
them<00:00:22.700> out<00:00:22.790> in<00:00:22.940> words<00:00:23.150> because<00:00:23.720> a<00:00:23.750> lot<00:00:24.080> of<00:00:24.110> times

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
them out in words because a lot of times

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.560 
them out in words because a lot of times
in<00:00:24.740> your<00:00:24.890> problems<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:25.700> your<00:00:25.820> word<00:00:26.030> problems

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
in your problems and your word problems

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.270 
in your problems and your word problems
everything<00:00:27.260> will<00:00:27.500> be<00:00:27.590> written<00:00:27.770> out<00:00:27.950> in<00:00:28.010> terms

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 
everything will be written out in terms

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.190 
everything will be written out in terms
of<00:00:28.460> words<00:00:28.790> so<00:00:29.390> let's<00:00:29.570> get<00:00:29.720> a<00:00:29.750> little<00:00:29.930> bit<00:00:30.110> of

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
of words so let's get a little bit of

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.369 
of words so let's get a little bit of
practice<00:00:30.620> with<00:00:30.770> that<00:00:30.800> today<00:00:31.899> what<00:00:32.899> if<00:00:33.020> you<00:00:33.140> had

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
practice with that today what if you had

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.160 
practice with that today what if you had
the<00:00:33.559> fraction<00:00:34.100> 1/2<00:00:34.730> this<00:00:35.480> is<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:35.629> fraction<00:00:36.110> I

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
the fraction 1/2 this is a fraction I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.290 
the fraction 1/2 this is a fraction I
know<00:00:36.260> you've<00:00:36.559> all<00:00:36.739> seen<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:37.370> it<00:00:38.030> what<00:00:38.210> it

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
know you've all seen and it what it

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.000 
know you've all seen and it what it
means<00:00:38.449> is<00:00:38.719> if<00:00:38.839> you<00:00:38.929> cut<00:00:39.140> something<00:00:39.409> into<00:00:39.800> two

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
means is if you cut something into two

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.919 
means is if you cut something into two
pieces<00:00:40.309> and<00:00:40.850> you<00:00:40.940> only<00:00:41.120> take<00:00:41.390> one<00:00:41.420> of<00:00:41.809> those

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:41.929 
pieces and you only take one of those

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:44.889 
pieces and you only take one of those
pieces<00:00:42.230> away<00:00:42.499> that<00:00:43.219> represents<00:00:44.059> 1/2<00:00:44.480> how<00:00:44.839> do

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
pieces away that represents 1/2 how do

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.369 
pieces away that represents 1/2 how do
you<00:00:45.079> write<00:00:45.260> it<00:00:45.289> down<00:00:45.530> in<00:00:45.769> terms<00:00:45.859> of<00:00:46.489> words<00:00:47.449> well

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
you write it down in terms of words well

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.309 
you write it down in terms of words well
1/2<00:00:48.829> is<00:00:49.069> written<00:00:49.399> like<00:00:49.550> this<00:00:49.850> one<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:51.199> number

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
1/2 is written like this one the number

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:55.479 
1/2 is written like this one the number
one<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:52.039> then<00:00:52.850> 1/2<00:00:53.949> so<00:00:54.949> you<00:00:55.039> write<00:00:55.190> that<00:00:55.339> down

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
one and then 1/2 so you write that down

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.790 
one and then 1/2 so you write that down
as<00:00:55.609> 1/2<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.120> if<00:00:56.210> you<00:00:56.329> have<00:00:56.420> 1/2<00:00:56.929> of<00:00:57.199> a<00:00:57.319> gallon<00:00:57.769> of

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
as 1/2 so if you have 1/2 of a gallon of

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.939 
as 1/2 so if you have 1/2 of a gallon of
milk<00:00:58.159> or<00:00:58.670> one<00:00:59.329> half<00:00:59.600> of<00:00:59.899> a<00:01:00.319> candy<00:01:00.679> bar<00:01:00.829> or

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
milk or one half of a candy bar or

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.200 
milk or one half of a candy bar or
whatever<00:01:01.280> that's<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.760> way<00:01:01.879> that<00:01:02.030> you<00:01:02.120> would

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
whatever that's the way that you would

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.219 
whatever that's the way that you would
write<00:01:02.389> that<00:01:02.449> down<00:01:03.040> now<00:01:04.040> what<00:01:04.220> if<00:01:04.370> we<00:01:04.489> had<00:01:04.760> as

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
write that down now what if we had as

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.100 
write that down now what if we had as
another<00:01:06.229> fraction<00:01:06.770> this<00:01:07.460> fraction<00:01:07.909> here<00:01:08.110> one

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
another fraction this fraction here one

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.140 
another fraction this fraction here one
out<00:01:09.380> of<00:01:09.440> three<00:01:09.860> pieces<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:10.460> here<00:01:10.700> I<00:01:10.730> chopped<00:01:11.120> a

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
out of three pieces so here I chopped a

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.900 
out of three pieces so here I chopped a
pizza<00:01:11.780> into<00:01:12.140> three<00:01:12.410> pieces<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:13.010> I<00:01:13.490> only<00:01:13.670> take

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
pizza into three pieces and I only take

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.280 
pizza into three pieces and I only take
one<00:01:14.090> of<00:01:14.180> these<00:01:14.300> pieces<00:01:14.540> away<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:15.020> give<00:01:15.170> it<00:01:15.260> to

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
one of these pieces away and give it to

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.920 
one of these pieces away and give it to
a<00:01:15.410> friend<00:01:15.650> that<00:01:15.950> fraction<00:01:16.760> is<00:01:17.090> is<00:01:17.570> written

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
a friend that fraction is is written

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.570 
a friend that fraction is is written
here<00:01:18.080> on<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.260> board<00:01:18.470> how<00:01:18.830> do<00:01:18.890> we<00:01:19.160> write<00:01:19.310> that

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
here on the board how do we write that

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.500 
here on the board how do we write that
down<00:01:19.850> that's<00:01:20.360> called<00:01:20.800> 1/3<00:01:21.820> 1<00:01:22.820> because<00:01:23.360> it's

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
down that's called 1/3 1 because it's

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.300 
down that's called 1/3 1 because it's
from<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:23.690> top<00:01:23.960> it's<00:01:24.320> one<00:01:24.590> piece<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.220> I'm

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
from the top it's one piece and I'm

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.760 
from the top it's one piece and I'm
giving<00:01:25.580> it<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:25.910> out<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:26.960> three<00:01:27.230> pieces<00:01:27.440> you

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
giving it and out of three pieces you

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.750 
giving it and out of three pieces you
write<00:01:27.980> that<00:01:28.160> as<00:01:28.370> third<00:01:29.380> so<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:30.560> is<00:01:30.680> one<00:01:30.980> third

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
write that as third so this is one third

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.470 
write that as third so this is one third
of<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.450> pizza<00:01:32.690> or<00:01:32.990> one<00:01:33.260> third<00:01:33.830> of<00:01:34.010> a<00:01:34.190> pie<00:01:34.480> all

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
of a pizza or one third of a pie all

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.440 
of a pizza or one third of a pie all
right<00:01:35.720> now<00:01:36.560> let's<00:01:36.830> go<00:01:37.070> here<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:37.760> say<00:01:38.060> what<00:01:38.360> if

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
right now let's go here and say what if

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.270 
right now let's go here and say what if
we<00:01:38.540> have<00:01:38.720> this<00:01:38.960> fraction<00:01:39.350> here<00:01:39.500> three<00:01:39.980> out<00:01:40.220> of

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
we have this fraction here three out of

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.720 
we have this fraction here three out of
four<00:01:41.270> pieces<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.020> means<00:01:42.260> I<00:01:42.410> chopped<00:01:42.980> a<00:01:43.220> piece

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
four pieces this means I chopped a piece

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.970 
four pieces this means I chopped a piece
of<00:01:43.910> wood<00:01:44.150> into<00:01:44.420> four<00:01:44.840> equal<00:01:45.260> pieces<00:01:45.410> I<00:01:45.770> take

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
of wood into four equal pieces I take

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.410 
of wood into four equal pieces I take
three<00:01:46.250> of<00:01:46.340> those<00:01:46.490> pieces<00:01:46.730> and<00:01:46.880> give<00:01:47.150> it<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.300> a

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
three of those pieces and give it to a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.630 
three of those pieces and give it to a
friend<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.530> fraction<00:01:49.070> then<00:01:49.190> of<00:01:49.460> that

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
friend and the fraction then of that

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.220 
friend and the fraction then of that
wood<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:50.090> I'm<00:01:50.210> giving<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.660> my<00:01:50.780> friend<00:01:51.050> is

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
wood that I'm giving to my friend is

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:58.090 
wood that I'm giving to my friend is
written<00:01:52.040> as<00:01:53.230> three<00:01:54.230> from<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.740> top<00:01:55.960> out<00:01:57.100> of

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
written as three from the top out of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.260 
written as three from the top out of
four<00:01:58.340> pieces<00:01:58.550> you<00:01:58.760> write<00:01:59.000> it<00:01:59.150> as<00:01:59.300> fourths<00:02:01.270> so

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
four pieces you write it as fourths so

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.210 
four pieces you write it as fourths so
you<00:02:02.600> should<00:02:02.780> see<00:02:02.930> a<00:02:02.960> pattern<00:02:03.230> by<00:02:03.560> now<00:02:03.770> the

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
you should see a pattern by now the

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.710 
you should see a pattern by now the
first<00:02:04.490> thing<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:04.790> write<00:02:04.970> down<00:02:05.150> is<00:02:05.390> what<00:02:05.600> the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
first thing you write down is what the

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.320 
first thing you write down is what the
top<00:02:05.930> thing<00:02:06.260> is<00:02:06.590> right<00:02:07.159> so<00:02:07.400> three<00:02:07.640> here<00:02:08.030> one

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
top thing is right so three here one

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.449 
top thing is right so three here one
here<00:02:08.599> one<00:02:08.659> here<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.649> second<00:02:10.099> part<00:02:10.310> is

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
here one here the second part is

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.970 
here one here the second part is
basically<00:02:10.970> what<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.239> bottom<00:02:11.690> is<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.440> four

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
basically what the bottom is so four

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.309 
basically what the bottom is so four
turns<00:02:13.400> into<00:02:13.610> fourths<00:02:14.210> three<00:02:14.750> turns<00:02:15.110> into

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
turns into fourths three turns into

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.850 
turns into fourths three turns into
third

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
third

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.750 
third
and<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.250> turns<00:02:16.610> into<00:02:16.820> half<00:02:17.240> like<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:18.760> alright

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
and to turns into half like that alright

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.370 
and to turns into half like that alright
let's<00:02:20.120> go<00:02:20.240> ahead<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.480> move<00:02:20.540> on<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:20.960> say<00:02:21.200> what

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
let's go ahead and move on and say what

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.550 
let's go ahead and move on and say what
if<00:02:21.470> we<00:02:21.590> have<00:02:21.830> two<00:02:22.670> out<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.060> seven<00:02:23.750> pieces<00:02:24.440> how

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
if we have two out of seven pieces how

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.990 
if we have two out of seven pieces how
would<00:02:24.710> you<00:02:24.830> write<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.190> down<00:02:25.400> in<00:02:25.550> terms<00:02:25.760> of

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
would you write that down in terms of

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.020 
would you write that down in terms of
English<00:02:26.530> well<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:28.130> have<00:02:28.250> two<00:02:28.490> pieces<00:02:28.700> that

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
English well you have two pieces that

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.520 
English well you have two pieces that
I'm<00:02:29.150> giving<00:02:29.450> out<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.690> seven<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.350> write

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
I'm giving out of seven so you write

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.880 
I'm giving out of seven so you write
that<00:02:30.710> as<00:02:30.890> two<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:32.600> have<00:02:32.780> seven<00:02:33.170> pizzas<00:02:33.620> so

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
that as two and you have seven pizzas so

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.280 
that as two and you have seven pizzas so
it's<00:02:34.100> seven<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.910> seven<00:02:37.940> is<00:02:38.540> here<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.960> thuh

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
it's seven so seven is here the thuh

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.800 
it's seven so seven is here the thuh
implies<00:02:40.250> that<00:02:40.400> it's<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.610> fraction<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:41.030> 2/7

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
implies that it's a fraction so 2/7

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.230 
implies that it's a fraction so 2/7
sounds<00:02:42.170> just<00:02:42.320> like<00:02:42.500> 2/4<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.370> comes<00:02:43.610> from<00:02:43.790> 4

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
sounds just like 2/4 that comes from 4

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.500 
sounds just like 2/4 that comes from 4
and<00:02:44.770> then<00:02:45.770> finally<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.700> last<00:02:46.910> little<00:02:47.120> example

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
and then finally the last little example

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.000 
and then finally the last little example
will<00:02:47.660> do<00:02:47.810> here<00:02:48.110> what<00:02:48.500> if<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.680> had<00:02:48.770> something

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
will do here what if you had something

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.760 
will do here what if you had something
like<00:02:49.160> 10<00:02:49.670> pieces<00:02:50.030> out<00:02:50.300> of<00:02:50.420> 19<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:51.170> know<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.620> looks

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
like 10 pieces out of 19 I know it looks

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.140 
like 10 pieces out of 19 I know it looks
like<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> crazy<00:02:52.220> fraction<00:02:52.760> but<00:02:52.880> it's<00:02:53.000> very

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
like a crazy fraction but it's very

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.420 
like a crazy fraction but it's very
possible<00:02:53.390> I<00:02:53.660> could<00:02:53.720> chop<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.140> pizza<00:02:54.530> up<00:02:54.680> into<00:02:54.950> 19

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
possible I could chop a pizza up into 19

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.000 
possible I could chop a pizza up into 19
equal<00:02:55.850> slices<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.600> then<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.320> give<00:02:57.500> 10<00:02:57.800> of<00:02:57.890> those

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
equal slices and then I give 10 of those

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.430 
equal slices and then I give 10 of those
slices<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.580> my<00:02:58.670> friend<00:02:59.000> so<00:02:59.660> if<00:02:59.780> I<00:02:59.870> do<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.080> what

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
slices to my friend so if I do that what

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.830 
slices to my friend so if I do that what
fraction<00:03:01.040> would<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.430> write<00:03:01.700> down<00:03:01.940> in<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.390> book<00:03:02.600> or

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
fraction would I write down in a book or

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.720 
fraction would I write down in a book or
in<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.989> paper<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.530> would<00:03:04.040> write<00:03:04.310> down<00:03:04.489> that<00:03:04.670> I

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
in a paper I would write down that I

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.350 
in a paper I would write down that I
gave<00:03:04.940> him<00:03:05.180> 10<00:03:05.570> because<00:03:06.050> that's<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.410> top<00:03:07.360> 19

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
gave him 10 because that's the top 19

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.880 
gave him 10 because that's the top 19
because<00:03:08.750> that's<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.290> bottom<00:03:09.620> 19<00:03:13.720> so<00:03:14.720> 10<00:03:15.140> 19

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
because that's the bottom 19 so 10 19

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.350 
because that's the bottom 19 so 10 19
sand<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.160> way<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.340> read<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:16.700> is<00:03:16.820> exactly<00:03:17.239> what

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
sand the way you read it is exactly what

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.330 
sand the way you read it is exactly what
we're<00:03:17.600> representing<00:03:18.110> with<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.380> math<00:03:18.560> 10

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
we're representing with the math 10

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.520 
we're representing with the math 10
pieces<00:03:19.820> out<00:03:19.940> of<00:03:19.970> 19<00:03:20.570> that's<00:03:20.750> what<00:03:20.989> it<00:03:21.080> means<00:03:21.230> so

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
pieces out of 19 that's what it means so

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.970 
pieces out of 19 that's what it means so
again<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.910> recap<00:03:23.239> fractions<00:03:23.959> is<00:03:24.140> just<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.769> way

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
again to recap fractions is just a way

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.520 
again to recap fractions is just a way
for<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.209> write<00:03:26.540> down<00:03:26.750> when<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.019> have<00:03:27.170> less

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
for you to write down when you have less

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.009 
for you to write down when you have less
than<00:03:27.769> 1<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.160> something<00:03:28.360> if<00:03:29.360> you<00:03:29.540> have<00:03:29.690> less<00:03:29.900> of

than 1 of something if you have less of

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.380 
than 1 of something if you have less of
1<00:03:30.230> of<00:03:30.350> something<00:03:30.500> then<00:03:31.459> you<00:03:31.700> are<00:03:31.730> chopping<00:03:32.299> it

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
1 of something then you are chopping it

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.420 
1 of something then you are chopping it
up<00:03:32.480> 2<00:03:32.690> into<00:03:33.200> an<00:03:33.290> equal<00:03:33.620> number<00:03:33.650> of<00:03:33.890> pieces<00:03:34.250> and

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
up 2 into an equal number of pieces and

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.789 
up 2 into an equal number of pieces and
you're<00:03:34.970> giving<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:36.170> many<00:03:36.350> of<00:03:36.440> those<00:03:36.560> pieces

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
you're giving so many of those pieces

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.650 
you're giving so many of those pieces
that's<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.519> quantity<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.060> representing

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
that's the quantity of representing

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.030 
that's the quantity of representing
that's<00:03:38.810> what<00:03:38.989> you're<00:03:39.110> giving<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.470> friend<00:03:39.860> or

that's what you're giving to a friend or

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.170 
that's what you're giving to a friend or
that's<00:03:40.220> what<00:03:40.430> you're<00:03:40.580> putting<00:03:40.820> in<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.000> bank

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
that's what you're putting in the bank

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.780 
that's what you're putting in the bank
or<00:03:41.390> that's<00:03:41.510> something<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:42.560> if<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:43.220> have<00:03:43.459> for

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
or that's something so if you have for

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.330 
or that's something so if you have for
instance<00:03:44.090> if<00:03:44.299> you<00:03:44.660> have<00:03:44.840> 3/4<00:03:45.620> of<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.860> pizza<00:03:46.070> or

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
instance if you have 3/4 of a pizza or

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.940 
instance if you have 3/4 of a pizza or
3/4<00:03:47.120> of<00:03:47.209> a<00:03:47.330> pizza<00:03:47.630> this<00:03:47.870> can<00:03:48.049> also<00:03:48.170> be<00:03:48.290> written

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
3/4 of a pizza this can also be written

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.110 
3/4 of a pizza this can also be written
as<00:03:49.130> 3/4

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
as 3/4

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.479 
as 3/4
because<00:03:50.570> 4<00:03:50.900> can<00:03:51.170> can<00:03:51.440> go<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:51.920> mean<00:03:52.070> quarter

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
because 4 can can go and mean quarter

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.850 
because 4 can can go and mean quarter
also<00:03:52.670> but<00:03:53.420> 3/4<00:03:53.870> is<00:03:54.019> typically<00:03:54.320> how<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.560> write

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
also but 3/4 is typically how you write

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.190 
also but 3/4 is typically how you write
it<00:03:54.890> if<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:55.549> have<00:03:55.700> 3/4<00:03:56.540> of<00:03:56.660> a<00:03:56.720> pizza<00:03:56.930> in<00:03:57.170> the

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
it if I have 3/4 of a pizza in the

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.170 
it if I have 3/4 of a pizza in the
fridge<00:03:57.560> what<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.250> means<00:03:58.430> is<00:03:58.610> I<00:03:58.640> have<00:03:58.760> less<00:03:59.150> than

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
fridge what it means is I have less than

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.170 
fridge what it means is I have less than
one<00:03:59.600> pizza<00:03:59.959> I<00:04:00.170> only<00:04:00.530> have<00:04:00.739> 3<00:04:01.010> pizzas<00:04:01.250> out<00:04:01.549> of<00:04:01.760> 4

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
one pizza I only have 3 pizzas out of 4

one pizza I only have 3 pizzas out of 4
P<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.900> pizza<00:04:03.230> slices<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:03.920> I<00:04:03.980> originally

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
P the pizza slices that I originally

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.580 
P the pizza slices that I originally
chopped<00:04:05.330> up<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:06.110> that's<00:04:06.290> what<00:04:06.470> these

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
chopped up so that's what these

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.229 
chopped up so that's what these
fractions<00:04:07.010> are<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:07.640> make<00:04:07.940> sure<00:04:08.120> you

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
fractions are so make sure you

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.190 
fractions are so make sure you
understand<00:04:08.690> how<00:04:08.810> to<00:04:09.080> take<00:04:09.739> these<00:04:11.200> fractions

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
understand how to take these fractions

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.870 
understand how to take these fractions
and<00:04:12.320> write<00:04:12.739> them<00:04:12.980> out<00:04:13.100> in<00:04:13.280> terms<00:04:13.430> of<00:04:13.610> words

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
and write them out in terms of words

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.400 
and write them out in terms of words
make<00:04:14.209> sure<00:04:14.360> you'll<00:04:14.480> understand<00:04:14.959> that<00:04:15.140> concept

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
make sure you'll understand that concept

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.400 
make sure you'll understand that concept
do<00:04:16.250> these<00:04:16.430> yourself<00:04:16.579> and<00:04:17.150> then<00:04:17.630> go<00:04:18.079> follow<00:04:18.320> me

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
do these yourself and then go follow me

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.930 
do these yourself and then go follow me
on<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.769> next<00:04:18.979> section<00:04:19.130> where<00:04:19.489> we<00:04:19.700> will
