00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.260
 Hello everyone, this is wonderful again. 2d 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.090
 probably nobody needs to tell 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.800
 who is a harfield cat 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.660
 it's pretty popular character 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.670
 who got his comedian 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.230
 my cartoon series and even 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.269
 two feature films also in 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.460
 1995 on the sega about this cat 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:01:01.690
 released a game about which today and 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:01:03.820
 will be discussed and so at the beginning of our game 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.780
 the protagonist as always hung in front 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.490
 but the TV scared him some dog 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.200
 frightened by garfield, he jumped up and broke 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.940
 Along the way TV but the heroes do not 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.550
 confused and fixed it 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.030
 however, extra details remain 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.280
 Garfield just threw out after turning 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.070
 TV appeared the main villain of the game 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.039
 called glich who dragged the main 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.960
 hero in tv and now our cat 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.280
 will have to run through different worlds 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.319
 film based 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.810
 and also fight with bosses who 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:37.240
 appearance resemble eliade or host 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.450
 garfield john and finally get out 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.790
 TV in fact the usual game 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.280
 platformer all levels are different from each 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.439
 friend for example from different worlds garfield 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.780
 looks different though they have one and 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.390
 same melee weapon and throwing 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.750
 and the level is not just repainted to others 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.399
 colors are different level design itself 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.100
 for example in the orange beard revenge level 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.649
 we start on a boat that sails itself 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.140
 the game is like a side scroller then we 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.509
 getting to the shore gameplay again 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.390
 changing now you need to scramble up 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.920
 on trees and vines and in the last 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.080
 level so generally all sorts 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.610
 interesting traps 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.739
 pretty tangled level stylized 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.110
 under the black and white gangster detective 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.030
 called casablanca in which you 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.709
 will have to wander around a bit 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.049
 beasts searching for a way out at the end of each 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.970
 level waiting for us boss battles with 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.660
 which is also based on a certain 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.209
 tactics 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.519
 for example the count servant in the first level 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.620
 will need to hit the light abbasov 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.269
 level 3 million years BC 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.549
 will have to attack homemade 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.829
 catapult by the way due to flaws 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.260
 games on this boss sometimes happen 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.209
 dishes and it disappears you stay in 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.750
 trapped this infinite level up 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.750
 reboot 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.470
 the game in my opinion is one of 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.870
 most grafonisty on sega 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.360
 very beautiful backdrops and the design itself 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.910
 levels as well as unimaginably beautiful 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.640
 animation of the main character of enemies and bosses 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.680
 and all because all the animations for the game 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.569
 drew multiplier and creator 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.700
 garfield jim davis the only one 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.400
 my opinion minus the game is 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.650
 that she is very short we have everything 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.280
 six levels that runs from 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.590
 strength for forty minutes however when came out 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.690
 the game came out with it and a bunch of promotional promo 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:47.360
 materials such as this one 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:49.280
 T-shirt as you see each of 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.940
 corfu images to match 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.760
 level 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.340
 however, there is no pirate cat in the image. 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.010
 orange beard but there is an image 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.340
 garfield in a viking roman suit and 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.620
 Robin Hood so now a month later 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.530
 game on portable sega game gear and 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.269
 kind of like patching a few holes so 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.269
 as it has a level with a viking and 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.040
 Robin Hood however Garfield version for 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.560
 ginger looks the same in all 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.350
 levels what about level 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.419
 the spacesuit he is the game version for bye 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.419
 which came out in the ninety sixth year 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.490
 and now we only have the code 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.590
 a roman from where he and I climbed a lot 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.780
 resources and failed to get 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.820
 some information and so on 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:05:07.880
 all kinds of stim playstation plus 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:05:11.210
 xbox live was sega's dick son 1993 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.960
 July 1998 with cable 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.570
 by providers 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.710
 America there was a gaming service for 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.130
 prefixes sega 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.990
 service activation cost $ 25 per 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.490
 This amount included an adapter such 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.169
 a kind of cartridge which 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.040
 connected to the console as well 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.810
 connected to the provider's cable 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.090
 Monthly fee was 15 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.970
 dollars however users had 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.979
 access to 50 free games monthly 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.070
 this me some kind of playstation plus 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.750
 four free games games by the way 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.510
 run out every time you start 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:49.610
 games in memory of the console and how I suppose 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:51.440
 temporary cartridge memory but at 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.630
 turn off the console all the data 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.300
 erased and had to record games 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:01.520
 again the benefit of this procedure is not occupied 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:03.470
 a lot of break time i have a bunch 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.990
 forums I often stumble upon 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.740
 comments like sega channel is the best 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.440
 what happened 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.380
 childhood and so on and all because 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.599
 sega tea could be found 4 count 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.030
 all sorts of demos and most importantly 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:19.190
 exclusives for example some games don't 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.849
 available in america on cartridges can 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:25.750
 it was download and sega of what 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:28.520
 but why am I so deep in this topic 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.919
 all because in this services 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.590
 there was a game Garfield be lost levels 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:36.500
 which both talks and contained 3 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.960
 lost levels from the main game from 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.300
 Sigachev were for us pancakes some games 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.770
 but unfortunately garfield lost levels in their 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.770
 The composition is not included to this day 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:49.370
 it is also interesting that on the original 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.130
 cartridges games rummaging a bit with 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.310
 code you can see this message 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.110
 that the level is being finalized 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.539
 and it is called the same code 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.539
 like the rest of the levels only change 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:04.940
 ordinal units this may mean as 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:07.490
 at least what the game was thinking 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.620
 more levels however either developers 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.259
 did not manage from afar is not a complete game 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.880
 either sega members paid for creation 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:17.570
 exclusive of Lost Hills 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:20.060
 or both together but in the end 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.219
 the game still came out really cool and I 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.070
 I learned about the existence of such a miracle as 

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:28.389
 sega channel here would be us such a thing in 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.389
 childhood it would be something 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:39.599
 Here's the release and it's over. Thank you all. 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.599
 for viewing to new meetings and
