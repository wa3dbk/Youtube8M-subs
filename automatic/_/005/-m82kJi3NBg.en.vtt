because<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.410> was<00:00:16.560> for<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.800> early<00:00:16.949> church<00:00:17.480> or

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
because that was for the early church or

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.480 
because that was for the early church or
that<00:00:18.869> God<00:00:19.080> doesn't<00:00:19.350> speak<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.710> people<00:00:20.100> anymore

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
that God doesn't speak to people anymore

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.170 
that God doesn't speak to people anymore
because<00:00:21.390> we<00:00:21.660> have<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.990> Bible<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.500> read<00:00:23.180> we

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
because we have the Bible to read we

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.670 
because we have the Bible to read we
have<00:00:24.210> spent<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:24.750> much<00:00:24.869> time<00:00:24.930> thinking<00:00:25.529> up

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
have spent so much time thinking up

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.410 
have spent so much time thinking up
things<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.189> God<00:00:26.369> won't<00:00:26.880> do

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
things that God won't do

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.200 
things that God won't do
and<00:00:27.619> yet<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:28.740> wonder<00:00:29.039> why<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.340> see<00:00:29.519> no<00:00:29.670> power<00:00:29.910> at

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and yet we wonder why we see no power at

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.440 
and yet we wonder why we see no power at
work<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.720> church<00:00:31.669> but<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.820> power<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.300> not

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
work in the church but the power is not

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.360 
work in the church but the power is not
going<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.719> be<00:00:33.870> there<00:00:34.079> if<00:00:34.230> God<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.860> not<00:00:34.890> there

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
going to be there if God is not there

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
going to be there if God is not there
and<00:00:35.579> why<00:00:36.420> do<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:36.690> expect<00:00:37.020> him<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.469> show<00:00:37.620> up<00:00:38.070> if

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
and why do we expect him to show up if

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.110 
and why do we expect him to show up if
we<00:00:39.390> created<00:00:40.200> beings<00:00:40.590> are<00:00:40.829> telling<00:00:41.730> him<00:00:41.879> what

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
we created beings are telling him what

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.139 
we created beings are telling him what
he<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.570> cannot<00:00:43.110> do<00:00:43.610> do<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.670> know<00:00:44.760> why<00:00:44.940> we

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
he can and cannot do do you know why we

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.690 
he can and cannot do do you know why we
limit<00:00:45.450> God<00:00:45.829> because<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:46.980> want<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.219> limit<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
limit God because we want to limit the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.900 
limit God because we want to limit the
effect<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.570> he<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.469> our<00:00:49.590> lives<00:00:49.910> we

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910

were<00:01:16.259> made<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.680> more<00:01:17.600> because<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.020> made

meant to be that

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.740 
meant to be that
it's<00:01:24.410> like<00:01:24.620> an<00:01:24.770> escalator<00:01:25.130> in<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:26.240> as<00:01:26.450> long

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
it's like an escalator in that as long

as you are saved or take the first step
you<00:01:30.470> eventually<00:01:30.740> reach<00:01:31.160> heaven<00:01:31.810> but<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.500> more

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
you eventually reach heaven but the more

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.580

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
steps you take the sooner you get to the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.040 
steps you take the sooner you get to the
next<00:01:36.740> level<00:01:37.010> and<00:01:37.340> in<00:01:38.120> this<00:01:38.240> case<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.840> sooner

I'm talking about walking so close to
God<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.670> when<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.970> touch<00:01:48.240> someone<00:01:48.600> it's

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
God that when you touch someone it's
