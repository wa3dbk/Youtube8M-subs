really gather now resist me ok push it
back<00:01:20.460> pretty<00:01:20.700> easy<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.180> coffee<00:01:22.189> now<00:01:23.189> here's

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
back pretty easy with coffee now here's

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.109 
back pretty easy with coffee now here's
splenda<00:01:24.299> which<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.659> processed<00:01:25.290> sugar<00:01:26.030> do<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
splenda which is processed sugar do the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.020 
splenda which is processed sugar do the
same<00:01:27.330> thing

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.160 

okay<00:01:31.570> so<00:01:32.200> going<00:01:32.409> back<00:01:32.530> pretty<00:01:33.930> now<00:01:34.930> this<00:01:35.110> is

without it okay go back and do the

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:16.470 
without it okay go back and do the
alumina<00:02:09.360> resist<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:14.280> lot<00:02:15.280> stronger<00:02:15.610> now<00:02:16.000> what

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
alumina resist a lot stronger now what

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.420 
alumina resist a lot stronger now what
it<00:02:16.660> is<00:02:16.870> watch<00:02:17.470> what<00:02:17.680> happens<00:02:18.069> when<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.310> take

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
it is watch what happens when you take

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.590 
it is watch what happens when you take
aluminum<00:02:19.140> coffee<00:02:20.140> coffee<00:02:21.390> put<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.480> together

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
aluminum coffee coffee put it together

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.530 
aluminum coffee coffee put it together
like<00:02:22.959> you're<00:02:22.989> gonna<00:02:23.260> right<00:02:24.069> there<00:02:24.250> right<00:02:24.430> now

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.520 

resist<00:02:33.569> still<00:02:34.569> they<00:02:34.720> are<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.959> really<00:02:35.200> funny

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
resist still they are you really funny

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.449 
resist still they are you really funny
though<00:02:36.630> am<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.810> really<00:02:38.019> trying<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.590> can't<00:02:39.160> fake

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
though am I really trying I can't fake

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.069 
though am I really trying I can't fake
how<00:02:39.700> much<00:02:39.850> I'm<00:02:40.000> trying<00:02:40.269> I<00:02:40.390> mean<00:02:40.420> I'm<00:02:40.690> doubling

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
how much I'm trying I mean I'm doubling

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.050 
how much I'm trying I mean I'm doubling
tripling<00:02:41.260> my<00:02:41.560> effort<00:02:41.980> on<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.250> trying<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.850> get

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
tripling my effort on that trying to get

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.759 
tripling my effort on that trying to get
I'm<00:02:43.269> actually<00:02:43.510> going<00:02:43.810> under<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.320> deeper<00:02:44.680> to

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
I'm actually going under you deeper to

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.979 
I'm actually going under you deeper to
get<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.280> up<00:02:46.049> so<00:02:47.049> what<00:02:47.230> happens<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.769> this

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
get you up so what happens is this

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.750 
get you up so what happens is this
everything<00:02:49.989> emits<00:02:50.680> an<00:02:51.220> energy<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:54.519> law<00:02:54.730> of

everything emits an energy the law of

everything emits an energy the law of
vibrational<00:02:55.540> energy<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.140> higher<00:02:56.470> energy

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
vibrational energy is higher energy

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.670 
vibrational energy is higher energy
transvenous<00:02:57.579> lower<00:02:58.030> energy<00:02:58.590> from<00:02:59.590> a

it<00:03:28.329> transmits<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.650> that's<00:03:30.459> why<00:03:30.640> you<00:03:30.700> can

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
it transmits it and that's why you can

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.330 
it transmits it and that's why you can
we<00:03:31.600> can<00:03:31.780> show<00:03:31.959> through<00:03:32.200> muscle<00:03:32.380> testing<00:03:32.920> how
