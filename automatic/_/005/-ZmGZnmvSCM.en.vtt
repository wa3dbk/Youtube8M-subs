00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
show you the lightning-rod shifters work

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.049 
show you the lightning-rod shifters work
right<00:00:07.740> now<00:00:07.890> I'm<00:00:07.980> locked<00:00:08.220> on<00:00:08.370> overdrive<00:00:08.849> at<00:00:09.000> a

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
right now I'm locked on overdrive at a

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.790 
right now I'm locked on overdrive at a
dead<00:00:09.240> stop<00:00:09.269> so<00:00:09.750> I'm<00:00:09.809> gonna<00:00:09.900> drop<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.260> down<00:00:10.440> one

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
dead stop so I'm gonna drop it down one

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.390 
dead stop so I'm gonna drop it down one
there<00:00:11.550> second<00:00:12.000> gear<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.330> first<00:00:12.980> look<00:00:13.980> at<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> -

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
there second gear is first look at the -

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.470 
there second gear is first look at the -
it's<00:00:14.670> what<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.910> reads<00:00:16.130> so<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.250> take<00:00:17.460> off<00:00:17.699> you

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
it's what it reads so you take off you

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:42.430 
it's what it reads so you take off you
just<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.810> first<00:00:19.020> gear

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.770 

now<00:00:43.280> it's<00:00:43.460> back<00:00:43.670> in<00:00:43.880> overdrive<00:00:44.360> they're<00:00:44.690> all

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
now it's back in overdrive they're all

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.250 
now it's back in overdrive they're all
locked<00:00:45.050> out<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.860> idea<00:00:46.190> is<00:00:46.370> you<00:00:46.520> can<00:00:46.670> only<00:00:46.820> ship

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
locked out the idea is you can only ship

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.620 
locked out the idea is you can only ship
one<00:00:48.740> upper<00:00:49.130> one<00:00:49.310> down<00:00:49.550> in<00:00:49.790> sequence<00:00:50.330> there's

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
one upper one down in sequence there's

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.420 
one upper one down in sequence there's
no<00:00:50.840> way<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.170> can<00:00:51.320> over<00:00:51.560> ship<00:00:51.770> or<00:00:51.980> under<00:00:52.190> shift

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
no way you can over ship or under shift

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.510 
no way you can over ship or under shift
any<00:00:52.610> of<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.850> gear

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.860 

again<00:00:57.730> sequential<00:00:58.240> if<00:00:58.300> you<00:00:58.390> want<00:00:58.540> to<00:00:58.630> go<00:00:58.690> back

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
again sequential if you want to go back

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.590 
again sequential if you want to go back
down<00:00:59.050> you<00:00:59.320> start<00:00:59.560> take<00:01:00.550> it<00:01:00.670> back<00:01:00.820> out<00:01:01.000> on

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
down you start take it back out on

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.590 
down you start take it back out on
overdrive<00:01:02.110> but<00:01:02.410> locks<00:01:02.830> the<00:01:03.040> other<00:01:03.160> two

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.710 

after<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.520> stop<00:01:28.760> sign<00:01:29.030> I'll<00:01:29.300> be<00:01:29.480> able<00:01:29.570> to

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
after the stop sign I'll be able to

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.959 
after the stop sign I'll be able to
follow<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.860> at<00:01:31.040> first

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.050 

drop<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.869> first<00:01:37.460> can<00:01:38.460> hear<00:01:38.609> it<00:01:38.700> lock<00:01:38.850> it

drop in the first can hear it lock it

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:47.359 
drop in the first can hear it lock it
out<00:01:40.340> stake<00:01:41.340> off<00:01:41.520> again<00:01:41.819> like<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.060> normally<00:01:42.299> do

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
