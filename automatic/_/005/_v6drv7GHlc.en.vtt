on my hair I really kind of this lay it
on<00:00:25.260> when<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.800> really<00:00:26.070> put<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.730> let<00:00:26.880> it

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
on when I do really put it on and let it

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.200 
on when I do really put it on and let it
soak<00:00:27.150> into<00:00:27.359> my<00:00:27.539> hair<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.260> feels<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.099> good<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.060> I

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
soak into my hair it feels so good and I

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.580 
soak into my hair it feels so good and I
feel<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.599> really<00:00:30.810> retains<00:00:31.320> moisture

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
feel like it really retains moisture

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.280 
feel like it really retains moisture
when<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.369> don't<00:00:32.669> do<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:33.840> feel<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.079> my

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
when I don't do this I just feel like my

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.680 
when I don't do this I just feel like my
ends<00:00:34.739> are<00:00:34.800> about<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.219> split<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.239> break

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
ends are about to split and just break

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.569 
ends are about to split and just break
off<00:00:36.930> my<00:00:37.350> hair<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.890> sensitive<00:00:38.160> right<00:00:38.520> now

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
off my hair is so sensitive right now

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.549 
off my hair is so sensitive right now
but<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.360> really<00:00:39.660> helps<00:00:39.960> me<00:00:40.020> retain<00:00:40.230> moisture

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
but this really helps me retain moisture

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.490 
but this really helps me retain moisture
especially<00:00:41.070> if<00:00:41.579> I'm<00:00:41.700> blow<00:00:41.940> drying<00:00:42.020> or<00:00:43.020> curling

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
especially if I'm blow drying or curling

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.720 
especially if I'm blow drying or curling
like<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.739> have<00:00:44.010> been<00:00:44.219> lately<00:00:44.430> obviously

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
like I have been lately obviously

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.700

colored<00:00:45.420> hair<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.020> very<00:00:46.530> very

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
colored hair you have to be very very

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.680 
colored hair you have to be very very
careful<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.489> terms<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.879> moisturizing<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.629> I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
careful in terms of moisturizing so I

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.990 
careful in terms of moisturizing so I
think<00:00:48.780> I've<00:00:49.020> really<00:00:49.260> found<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.800> primary<00:00:50.789> key

hair<00:01:16.170> too<00:01:16.380> much<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.740> i<00:01:16.799> don't<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.130> that

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
hair too much so i don't think that

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.710 
hair too much so i don't think that
there's<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.490> lot<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.670> breakage<00:01:18.150> when<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.509> comes

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
there's a lot of breakage when it comes

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.510 
there's a lot of breakage when it comes
to<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.110> brush<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.799> i<00:01:20.280> would<00:01:20.400> highly

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
to this brush and i would highly

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.710 
to this brush and i would highly
recommend<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.119> i<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> little<00:01:21.540> bit

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
recommend it i know it's a little bit

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.350 
recommend it i know it's a little bit
pricey<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.470> size<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.729> me<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.210> was

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
pricey for the size but to me this was

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.120 
pricey for the size but to me this was
really<00:01:24.659> worth<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.990> because<00:01:25.080> i<00:01:25.229> feel<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
really worth it because i feel like the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.130 
really worth it because i feel like the
other<00:01:26.280> travel<00:01:26.670> russia<00:01:26.820> had<00:01:27.060> was<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.810> tangle

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
other travel russia had was the tangle

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.590 
other travel russia had was the tangle
teezer<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.130> was<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.759> really<00:01:30.030> ripping

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
teezer and that was just really ripping

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.530 
teezer and that was just really ripping
out<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.110> ends<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.060> wasn't<00:01:33.240> good<00:01:33.509> for

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
out the ends and it just wasn't good for

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.359 
out the ends and it just wasn't good for
dry<00:01:33.869> hair<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.829> definitely<00:01:35.009> good<00:01:35.340> for

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
dry hair so this is definitely good for

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.940 
dry hair so this is definitely good for

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
and then I kind of did some finishing

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.630 
and then I kind of did some finishing
touches<00:02:01.960> because<00:02:02.560> it<00:02:02.680> wasn't<00:02:02.980> exactly<00:02:03.100> I

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
touches because it wasn't exactly I

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.880 
touches because it wasn't exactly I
don't<00:02:04.060> know<00:02:04.120> how<00:02:04.270> I<00:02:04.300> would<00:02:04.780> necessarily<00:02:05.110> do<00:02:05.740> it

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
don't know how I would necessarily do it

it on there it really stays on this is
the<00:03:15.220> same<00:03:15.430> way<00:03:15.550> that<00:03:15.670> I<00:03:15.730> would<00:03:15.850> use<00:03:16.030> my<00:03:16.060> bare

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
the same way that I would use my bare

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.390 
the same way that I would use my bare
minerals<00:03:16.810> eyebrow<00:03:17.140> pencil<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:18.010> if<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.190> go<00:03:18.310> and

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
minerals eyebrow pencil so if you go and

it<00:03:20.800> the<00:03:21.130> same<00:03:21.370> exact<00:03:21.760> way<00:03:22.060> but<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.690> just<00:03:22.900> think

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
it the same exact way but I just think

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.930 
it the same exact way but I just think
this<00:03:23.200> color<00:03:23.440> matched<00:03:23.920> me<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.220> bit<00:03:24.459> better<00:03:24.610> and

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
this color matched me a bit better and

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.930 
this color matched me a bit better and
it<00:03:25.269> definitely<00:03:25.450> is<00:03:25.780> smoother<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.739> easier<00:03:27.400> to

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.420 
it definitely is smoother and easier to
