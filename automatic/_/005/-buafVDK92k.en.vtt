could say getting on the run early doors

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.320 
could say getting on the run early doors
is<00:01:18.479> its<00:01:19.229> pivotal<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.950> what<00:01:20.850> you'll<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.119> later

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
is its pivotal in what you'll do later

about 2,000 calories it was a it was

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.370 
about 2,000 calories it was a it was
boiling<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.810> know<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.110> such<00:01:34.350> a

boiling and you know with such a
contrast<00:01:34.829> from<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.670> now<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.060> you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
contrast from then and now it's you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.929 
contrast from then and now it's you
think<00:01:36.630> we're<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.840> two<00:01:36.960> different<00:01:36.990> places<00:01:37.380> but

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
think we're in two different places but

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.730 
think we're in two different places but
you<00:01:38.939> know<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.479> good<00:01:40.140> quite<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> good

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
you know it's a good quite a good

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.499 
you know it's a good quite a good
training<00:01:40.979> camp<00:01:41.250> here<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.670> i<00:01:41.850> think<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> webos

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
training camp here and i think the webos

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.700 
training camp here and i think the webos
probably<00:01:42.780> helped<00:01:43.110> us<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> little<00:01:43.409> bit<00:01:43.530> more

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
probably helped us a little bit more

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.679 
probably helped us a little bit more
than<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.920> being<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.340> obviously<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.540> know

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
than it being up obviously you know

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.080 
than it being up obviously you know
yourself<00:01:46.259> any<00:01:46.740> player<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.220> squad<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.729> you

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
yourself any player to the squad if you

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.310 
yourself any player to the squad if you
ever<00:01:48.210> additions<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> strike<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
ever additions in the strike and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.960 
ever additions in the strike and
department<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:49.799> well<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:50.070> course<00:01:50.250> certainly

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
department as well of course certainly

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.190 
department as well of course certainly
seems<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.299> all<00:01:51.600> settling<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.020> quite<00:01:52.170> well

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
seems to be all settling in quite well

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.380 
seems to be all settling in quite well
though<00:01:52.439> yeah<00:01:53.130> i<00:01:53.159> think<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.939> lads<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.180> made

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
though yeah i think the lads have made

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.649 
though yeah i think the lads have made
it<00:01:54.509> easy<00:01:54.659> for<00:01:54.780> us<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.049> integrate<00:01:55.380> an<00:01:56.659> upcoming

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
it easy for us to integrate an upcoming

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.139 
it easy for us to integrate an upcoming
and<00:01:57.990> gel<00:01:58.409> pretty<00:01:58.710> well<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.070> know<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.640> couple<00:01:59.880> ads

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
and gel pretty well I know a couple ads

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.340 
and gel pretty well I know a couple ads
from<00:02:00.299> playing<00:02:00.540> them<00:02:00.659> against<00:02:00.930> them<00:02:01.049> before

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
from playing them against them before

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.289 
from playing them against them before
and<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.710> couple<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.460> played<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:02.729> before<00:02:03.060> and

and a couple that played with before and

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.870 
and a couple that played with before and
obviously<00:02:04.079> it's<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.770> lot<00:02:04.920> easier<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.579> someone

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
obviously it's a lot easier for someone

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
big things from the salt obviously if we

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.300 
big things from the salt obviously if we
were<00:03:16.569> provided<00:03:17.019> with<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.139> chances<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:18.069> he

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
were provided with the chances and he

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.270
