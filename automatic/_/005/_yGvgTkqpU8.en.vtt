00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.540
 I had a chat with the teacher. 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.670
 Professor Carlos, we are here to 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.740
 one more tennis tip and today we go 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.000
 two important aspects of the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.670
 drawback 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.369
 Come on then I'll go here and run two 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.420
 two returns two ways to return 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.130
 the sacs 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.689
 as I said at the beginning of our tip 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.400
 let's talk about two important aspects 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.070
 on return of service 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.439
 the first aspect is that you move 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.120
 to return this ball you do not 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.480
 stay a lot of people make a mistake 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.399
 want to stay here implanted and not 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.370
 can return well then the first 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.010
 The point is that you are not flexing 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.840
 tiptoe 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.850
 You have to be on your toes and 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.489
 stirring who is here on his toes 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.390
 moving and when you move you will 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.620
 synchronize your split with the impact of 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.629
 serve your opponent 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.940
 It's more or less the way I'm going to do without a ball. 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.379
 For now, then you'll train. 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.199
 here so you move opponent 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.720
 attacked customers and when doing a sprint 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.000
 You're getting ready to go too. 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.460
 I'll show you in the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.229
 practice first aspect people 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.930
 make a common mistake is to stand still and 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.270
 Then you end up coming back badly then first 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.460
 aspect is that you are moving 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.880
 Just move in order to get back well. 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:29.579
 this bomb stirs split and returns the ball 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.280
 these politicians and return by stirring 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.110
 split returns 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.460
 so this is the first aspect that you 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.560
 you are stirring a lot while the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.049
 opponent is preparing to take out 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.759
 because this will make all the difference 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.920
 so you can hit the ball well 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.930
 let's take a second look now you 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.880
 already understood the importance of moving 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.180
 this makes a total difference in its evolution 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.740
 a common mistake that amateurs often 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.200
 commit the people who play the tournament 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.600
 of weekend plays in the club plays in 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.090
 condominium is already wanted to kill on the first 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.799
 ball the first ball she says it all 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.780
 drawback 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.700
 so your opponent is taking out 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.740
 it is important that he hit the first 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.720
 I sack the first ball of him and I eat 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.790
 developer and you too as 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.770
 developer at this point will put 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.110
 its evolution in the rope 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:21.000
 the first mistake that people make already 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.890
 that winning the point will not work 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.690
 as the name itself returns 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.350
 opponent draws 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.130
 you put your evolution on the rope 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.320
 opponent draws 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.360
 you put your return on the court 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.550
 these were the two tips today to 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.170
 first that you move well 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.810
 I split it so you can 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.910
 return a ball and the second one that places 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.860
 this evolution on the court because placing 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.590
 the return of serve on the court you 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.110
 get already built point you go on 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.970
 your evolution on the court, you have already 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.890
 responsibility for the opponent and 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.510
 that way you can play better 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.790
 I hope these two tips have helped 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.690
 you can enjoy a lot more 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.060

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.770
