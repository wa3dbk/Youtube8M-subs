00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.130
 hello guys today martÃ­n algarra and I give them 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.810
 one of our welcome to football is 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.850
 free throw today we are going to 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.240
 learn they advanced the world that they 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.560
 He has asked me for a long time 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.619
 that the end was sorry for the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.210
 delay and hopefully the tutorials serve me 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.370
 I am to subscribe please subscribe 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.379
 it's very important so let's go with the 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.390
 tutorial the tricks you should know for 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.820
 make progress the world are rivers 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.680
 crossover and around the world if you can 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.220
 being these two tricks will surely get you 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.220
 get out the water 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.650
 for me was to pass on the world is a 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.580
 very nice trick so I think it's worth 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.580
 It's worth learning 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.460
 the most common mistake when learning abbas 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.350
 is the diagonal ball phrase to the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.760
 leg that makes the first round but 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.320
 move the whole body towards the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.820
 ball is more difficult than moving 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.800
 only the leg and direction to the 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.900
 ball if they are clear that this is a 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.110
 error are going to learn the abbot very very 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.360
 fast I know a lot of people who have gone 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.830
 very well in the wrong way so 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.369
 imagine how easy it is to learn it from 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.369
 the right way 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.340
 once 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.050
 when the ball goes straight line to the 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.760
 leg case the first touch is more 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.320
 difficult to pass the first round but 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.970
 much easier to control the return to 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.650
 world should try that leg 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.240
 contrary to the leg that is the first 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.300
 touch gets in the path of the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.300
 ball 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.310
 as I told you at the beginning it 's easier 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.650
 pass the leg when the ball is sent 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.390
 diagonally but it's harder to do the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.400
 second part of the vas that is the turn 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.020
 to the world so it's really worth it 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.210
 that costs you a little more at the beginning 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.560
 learn the abbot to kelava always be 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.980
 inaccurate to send the ball in 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.980
 diagonal 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.590
 another frequent mistake despairing and 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.700
 look around the world very high 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.530
 after having done the reverse 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.149
 crossover but you should really look 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.459
 the ball down that's going to give you comfort 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.840
 and soft style and to learn it 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.180
 they should only do this phase on 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.100
 exercise that is cushioning the blow of 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.959
 river is crossover here they are going to give 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.940
 mind that if they do it very high it will be 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.230
 impossible to cushion it just as 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.700
 difficult to do around the world 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.700
 high to close the abbot 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.690
 Like you will get the water that is the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.170
 back to the high world but you will not see 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.030
 so pretty 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.530
 now to do it in combo make sure 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.540
 that the trick they do before washing 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.290
 the ball in the right place for 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.290
 make it more like 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.540
 to finish show it the years 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.200
 consecutive to see the cool 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.200
 that look together 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.680

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.530

 forget that bateen will appear first 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.300
 know the first the crossover and the 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.220
 round the world if we cheat goes to 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.480
 be very complicated with the garment so 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.480
