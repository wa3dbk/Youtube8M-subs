00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
the Sun for 25 some 26 1 430 I think the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.160 
the Sun for 25 some 26 1 430 I think the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
before they changed him to orange so

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.610 
before they changed him to orange so

a<00:03:12.510> striker<00:03:12.930> in<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.770> 4312<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.120> said<00:03:15.300> they're

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
a striker in a 4312 and it said they're

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.320 
a striker in a 4312 and it said they're
on<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.720> date<00:03:15.930> basically<00:03:16.200> was<00:03:16.410> worth<00:03:16.590> about

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
on a date basically was worth about

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.910 
on a date basically was worth about
8,000<00:03:18.330> 9,000<00:03:18.900> coins<00:03:19.140> as<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.260> centre-forward<00:03:19.590> so

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
8,000 9,000 coins as a centre-forward so

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.289 
8,000 9,000 coins as a centre-forward so
I<00:03:19.950> figure<00:03:20.250> he's<00:03:20.459> been<00:03:20.610> converted<00:03:21.090> he'll<00:03:21.209> be

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
I figure he's been converted he'll be

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.330 
I figure he's been converted he'll be
worth<00:03:21.450> quite<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.840> lot<00:03:21.959> more<00:03:22.380> but<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.830> end<00:03:23.250> up

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
worth quite a lot more but I end up

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.800 
worth quite a lot more but I end up

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
random left back Wally he's in Syria a

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.770 
random left back Wally he's in Syria a
so<00:04:35.400> he's<00:04:35.550> not<00:04:35.670> that<00:04:35.880> random<00:04:36.120> but<00:04:36.450> a<00:04:36.480> bronze

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780

playing<00:06:07.260> at<00:06:07.410> Marseilles<00:06:07.830> so<00:06:07.890> I'm<00:06:08.130> thinking

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
playing at Marseilles so I'm thinking

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.920 
playing at Marseilles so I'm thinking
what<00:06:08.640> I'm<00:06:08.700> gonna<00:06:08.820> do<00:06:09.060> is<00:06:09.090> whichever<00:06:09.660> one<00:06:09.900> I

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
what I'm gonna do is whichever one I

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.570 
what I'm gonna do is whichever one I
don't<00:06:10.170> get<00:06:10.380> in<00:06:10.500> form<00:06:10.770> or<00:06:10.890> by<00:06:10.920> their<00:06:11.250> normal

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.980 
don't get in form or by their normal
card<00:06:11.790> anyway<00:06:12.180> so<00:06:12.240> they'll<00:06:12.480> both<00:06:12.600> be<00:06:12.630> getting

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
card anyway so they'll both be getting

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.630 
card anyway so they'll both be getting
nine<00:06:13.170> chemistry<00:06:13.680> plane<00:06:13.950> next<00:06:14.220> to<00:06:14.340> each<00:06:14.460> other

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
nine chemistry plane next to each other

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.660 
nine chemistry plane next to each other
which<00:06:15.510> seems<00:06:15.870> like<00:06:15.990> a<00:06:16.020> quite<00:06:16.200> a<00:06:16.230> idea<00:06:17.040> to<00:06:17.220> me<00:06:17.460> if

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
which seems like a quite a idea to me if

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.730 
which seems like a quite a idea to me if
you<00:06:18.240> want<00:06:18.390> list<00:06:18.570> more<00:06:18.780> of<00:06:18.900> their<00:06:19.020> hidden<00:06:19.290> stats

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
you want list more of their hidden stats

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.190

like<00:06:19.980> Valbuena<00:06:20.670> and<00:06:20.820> Remy<00:06:21.360> both<00:06:21.600> have<00:06:21.810> forced

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
like Valbuena and Remy both have forced

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.350 
like Valbuena and Remy both have forced
our<00:06:22.320> skills<00:06:22.770> I<00:06:23.010> think<00:06:23.520> valbuena's<00:06:24.030> got<00:06:24.210> a

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
our skills I think valbuena's got a

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.210 
our skills I think valbuena's got a
better<00:06:24.690> week<00:06:24.930> for<00:06:25.200> he's<00:06:25.320> he's<00:06:25.590> right<00:06:25.860> footed

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
better week for he's he's right footed

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.200 
better week for he's he's right footed
which<00:06:26.340> is<00:06:26.460> a<00:06:26.490> bit<00:06:26.640> annoying<00:06:26.700> when<00:06:26.940> you<00:06:27.000> spend

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
which is a bit annoying when you spend

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.310 
which is a bit annoying when you spend
on<00:06:27.270> the<00:06:27.330> right<00:06:27.510> you<00:06:27.630> preferring<00:06:27.930> to<00:06:27.990> be<00:06:28.110> left

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
on the right you preferring to be left

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.900 
on the right you preferring to be left
but<00:06:28.530> I<00:06:28.650> find<00:06:28.860> players<00:06:29.130> with<00:06:29.310> forced<00:06:29.610> our<00:06:29.760> week

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
but I find players with forced our week

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.940 
but I find players with forced our week
but<00:06:30.150> you<00:06:30.570> know<00:06:30.720> are<00:06:30.960> just<00:06:31.380> about<00:06:31.620> as<00:06:31.740> good<00:06:31.890> with

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
but you know are just about as good with

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.820 
but you know are just about as good with
their<00:06:32.250> left<00:06:32.580> as<00:06:32.820> their<00:06:33.090> right<00:06:33.390> and<00:06:33.660> Remy<00:06:34.290> also

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
their left as their right and Remy also

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.350 
their left as their right and Remy also
has<00:06:34.950> the<00:06:35.010> force<00:06:35.220> our<00:06:35.400> skills<00:06:35.669> any<00:06:35.850> freestyle

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
has the force our skills any freestyle

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.330 
has the force our skills any freestyle
week<00:06:36.540> for<00:06:36.900> and<00:06:37.080> he<00:06:37.200> has<00:06:37.320> a<00:06:37.350> finesse<00:06:37.770> shot<00:06:37.800> trait

so might be quite good of those finesses

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.399 
so might be quite good of those finesses
you<00:06:39.990> see<00:06:40.140> shots<00:06:40.410> not<00:06:40.590> a<00:06:40.620> great<00:06:40.890> but<00:06:41.070> he<00:06:41.130> does
