00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
good at all and i don't know what it is

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.020 
good at all and i don't know what it is
but<00:00:36.510> my<00:00:37.290> accuracy<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:38.040> isn't<00:00:38.340> there<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.579> i

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
but my accuracy just isn't there like i

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.700 
but my accuracy just isn't there like i
like<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.719> plan<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> little<00:00:40.170> bit<00:00:40.379> lower<00:00:40.559> of

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
like to plan a little bit lower of

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.290 
like to plan a little bit lower of
sensitivity<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.489> then<00:00:41.640> when<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.790> trickshot

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
sensitivity but then when I trickshot

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.850 
sensitivity but then when I trickshot
obviously<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> higher<00:00:43.379> sensitivity

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
obviously I like the higher sensitivity

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.680 
obviously I like the higher sensitivity
and<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.700> doesn't<00:00:44.969> work<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.120> me<00:00:45.300> I'm<00:00:45.450> not

what's challenging for me with the top
five<00:04:46.110> series<00:04:46.650> especially<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.880> distance<00:04:48.330> one

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
five series especially the distance one

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.030 
five series especially the distance one
the<00:04:48.660> creativity<00:04:49.050> want<00:04:49.380> obviously<00:04:49.530> you<00:04:49.949> know

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
the creativity want obviously you know

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.670 
the creativity want obviously you know
my<00:04:50.220> most<00:04:51.210> creative<00:04:51.600> shot<00:04:51.810> that<00:04:52.139> you<00:04:52.560> know<00:04:52.650> i

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
my most creative shot that you know i

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.040 
my most creative shot that you know i
think<00:04:52.830> is<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.370> best<00:04:53.610> or<00:04:53.970> my<00:04:54.270> you<00:04:54.960> know

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
think is the best or my you know

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.719 
think is the best or my you know
favorite<00:04:55.320> most<00:04:55.680> creative<00:04:56.040> shot<00:04:56.250> is<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.550> one

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
favorite most creative shot is the one

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.610 
favorite most creative shot is the one
that<00:04:57.030> wins<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:57.630> then<00:04:57.720> you<00:04:57.930> know<00:04:58.050> so<00:04:58.260> on<00:04:58.380> so

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
that wins and then you know so on so

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.189 
that wins and then you know so on so
forth<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.639> tomahawk<00:05:00.120> one's<00:05:00.389> fairly<00:05:00.780> easy

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
forth and the tomahawk one's fairly easy

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.980 
forth and the tomahawk one's fairly easy
to<00:05:01.410> decide<00:05:02.100> the<00:05:03.030> winners<00:05:03.389> and<00:05:03.660> stuff<00:05:03.840> like

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
to decide the winners and stuff like

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.360 
to decide the winners and stuff like
that<00:05:04.050> i<00:05:04.199> mean<00:05:04.350> i<00:05:04.530> can<00:05:04.860> just<00:05:04.979> sort<00:05:05.130> of<00:05:05.190> pick

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
that i mean i can just sort of pick

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.529 
that i mean i can just sort of pick
which<00:05:05.550> one<00:05:05.729> I<00:05:05.760> like<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:05.970> best<00:05:06.090> but<00:05:06.449> the

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
which one I like the best but the

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.110 
which one I like the best but the
distant<00:05:07.080> one<00:05:07.110> is<00:05:07.350> so<00:05:07.800> hard<00:05:08.130> because<00:05:08.400> obviously

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
distant one is so hard because obviously

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.240 
distant one is so hard because obviously
I<00:05:09.810> don't<00:05:10.139> have<00:05:10.260> a<00:05:10.320> tape<00:05:10.530> measure<00:05:10.800> that<00:05:11.039> I<00:05:11.100> can

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
I don't have a tape measure that I can

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.770 
I don't have a tape measure that I can
just<00:05:11.370> go<00:05:11.520> into<00:05:11.789> the<00:05:11.910> game<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:12.419> measure<00:05:12.630> out

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
just go into the game and measure out

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.870 
just go into the game and measure out
exactly<00:05:13.289> where<00:05:13.590> each<00:05:13.620> person<00:05:13.800> is<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.610> see

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
exactly where each person is and see

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.170 
exactly where each person is and see
exactly<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.690> know<00:05:16.020> how<00:05:16.410> much<00:05:17.010> distance<00:05:17.760> is

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
exactly you know how much distance is

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.730 
exactly you know how much distance is
actually<00:05:18.690> on<00:05:18.810> a<00:05:18.840> shot<00:05:19.169> so<00:05:19.350> it<00:05:19.440> makes<00:05:19.560> it<00:05:19.680> very

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
actually on a shot so it makes it very

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.300 
actually on a shot so it makes it very
challenging<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:21.110> you<00:05:22.110> know<00:05:22.229> I<00:05:22.530> don't<00:05:23.160> know

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
challenging and you know I don't know

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.040 
challenging and you know I don't know
just<00:05:23.520> it's<00:05:23.850> such<00:05:24.000> a<00:05:24.060> challenging<00:05:24.570> series<00:05:24.930> to

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
just it's such a challenging series to

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.779 
just it's such a challenging series to
do<00:05:25.260> as<00:05:25.470> well<00:05:25.979> as<00:05:26.010> you<00:05:26.190> know<00:05:26.370> there's<00:05:26.610> certain

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
do as well as you know there's certain

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.120 
do as well as you know there's certain
maps<00:05:27.210> that<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:27.870> know<00:05:27.960> we<00:05:28.260> always<00:05:28.500> see<00:05:29.100> people

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
maps that you know we always see people

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.100 
maps that you know we always see people
hitting<00:05:29.789> distance<00:05:30.240> shots<00:05:30.479> on<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:30.960> if<00:05:31.020> you

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
hitting distance shots on and if you

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.290 
hitting distance shots on and if you
guys<00:05:31.229> want<00:05:31.590> me<00:05:31.710> to<00:05:31.830> do<00:05:31.979> you<00:05:32.460> know<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.580> full<00:05:33.090> map

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
guys want me to do you know a full map

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.080 
guys want me to do you know a full map
of<00:05:33.630> you<00:05:33.930> know<00:05:34.050> turbine<00:05:34.500> shots<00:05:34.889> you<00:05:35.430> know<00:05:35.490> I<00:05:35.700> can

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
of you know turbine shots you know I can

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.510 
of you know turbine shots you know I can
do<00:05:36.300> that<00:05:36.570> or<00:05:36.930> a<00:05:36.960> full<00:05:37.500> series<00:05:37.979> of<00:05:38.220> turbine

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
do that or a full series of turbine

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.070 
do that or a full series of turbine
shots<00:05:38.760> I<00:05:38.880> can<00:05:39.090> do<00:05:39.330> that<00:05:39.539> but<00:05:39.750> I<00:05:39.780> just<00:05:39.960> don't

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
shots I can do that but I just don't

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.300 
shots I can do that but I just don't
think<00:05:40.200> it's<00:05:40.380> gonna<00:05:40.470> be<00:05:40.620> enjoyable<00:05:41.010> for<00:05:41.099> you

guys I think you guys would rather you

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.260 
guys I think you guys would rather you
know<00:05:42.990> maybe<00:05:43.229> not<00:05:43.470> as<00:05:43.740> distance<00:05:44.370> of<00:05:44.520> shots<00:05:44.820> but

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
know maybe not as distance of shots but

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.029 
know maybe not as distance of shots but
you<00:05:45.419> know<00:05:45.539> cool<00:05:45.840> creative<00:05:46.260> maps<00:05:46.560> that<00:05:46.860> you

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039
