00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
22-pound from beyond retro I think the

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.509 
22-pound from beyond retro I think the
electron<00:03:19.530> in<00:03:19.769> general<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.160> quite<00:03:20.340> expensive

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
electron in general is quite expensive

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.250 
electron in general is quite expensive
but<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:21.060> always<00:03:21.269> found<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:21.720> much<00:03:21.840> stuff<00:03:22.079> there

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
but I always found so much stuff there

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.960 
but I always found so much stuff there
that<00:03:22.290> i<00:03:22.470> absolutely<00:03:22.530> love<00:03:23.069> even<00:03:23.850> though<00:03:23.940> i

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
that i absolutely love even though i

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.780 
that i absolutely love even though i
think<00:03:24.269> in<00:03:24.870> my<00:03:25.019> opinion<00:03:25.049> is<00:03:25.560> quite<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> lot<00:03:26.519> but

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
think in my opinion is quite a lot but

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.089 
think in my opinion is quite a lot but
i'm<00:03:27.389> used<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.930> obviously<00:03:28.319> vintage<00:03:28.769> shops<00:03:28.950> in

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
i'm used to obviously vintage shops in

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.520 
i'm used to obviously vintage shops in
edinburgh<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.700> they<00:03:30.180> vary<00:03:30.840> wildly<00:03:31.260> from

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
edinburgh and they vary wildly from

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.440 
edinburgh and they vary wildly from
being<00:03:31.980> like<00:03:32.160> quite<00:03:32.489> cheap<00:03:32.849> to<00:03:33.239> being

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
being like quite cheap to being

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.300 
being like quite cheap to being
ridiculously<00:03:34.260> expensive<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:34.950> i<00:03:34.980> think<00:03:35.069> that's

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
ridiculously expensive so i think that's

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.190 
ridiculously expensive so i think that's
maybe<00:03:35.569> somewhere<00:03:36.569> in<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.750> middle<00:03:37.049> but

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
maybe somewhere in the middle but

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.750 
maybe somewhere in the middle but
they're<00:03:37.349> not<00:03:37.470> Levi's<00:03:37.859> or<00:03:38.099> anything<00:03:38.459> which<00:03:38.639> I

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
they're not Levi's or anything which I

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.699 
they're not Levi's or anything which I
would<00:03:38.880> have<00:03:38.970> preferred<00:03:39.120> ones<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:40.260> relief<00:03:40.560> i

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
would have preferred ones that relief i

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.220 
would have preferred ones that relief i
but<00:03:41.069> i've<00:03:41.250> also<00:03:41.880> got<00:03:42.150> em<00:03:42.299> little<00:03:42.569> frayed<00:03:42.989> bits

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
but i've also got em little frayed bits

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.979 
but i've also got em little frayed bits
