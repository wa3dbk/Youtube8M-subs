00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 the lack of drivers for transportation 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.450
 of grain production of the state concerns 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.030
 farmers and entrepreneurs in the 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.710
 sector in some carriers have 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.750
 trucks stopped for lack of 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.049
 qualified professionals 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.150
 the family of felipe grows soy and corn 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.090
 part of the production stocked in this warehouse 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.670
 in sidrolÃ¢ndia with capacity for 46 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.949
 thousand tons that also receives grain of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.529
 other farmers in the largest region 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.230
 part of the soybean stock of the last cycle 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.660
 the amount of corn left over must already be 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.130
 marketed in the coming days is that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.620
 with the arrival of the maize crop 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.950
 safrinha space is needed to receive the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.989
 production time of much movement 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.899
 inside and outside the warehouse and with the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.149
 of a new cycle an old problem comes back 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.329
 to worry producers sell the crop 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.489
 beans to shipping ports 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.280
 road was very expensive if we were to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.140
 put on the tip of the pen the most expensive is 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.949
 one of the most expensive of all, right? 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.530
 and arrives in the harvest superlote the warehouses 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.600
 your freight gets very expensive 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.060
 one of the main problems of 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.580
 transport in the agricultural sector is the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.830
 qualified drivers in that 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.729
 carrier for example six vehicles 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.210
 unemployed due to lack of professionals 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.670
 What's missing is a driver. 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.280
 qualified 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.979
 drivers who have prepared to 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.900
 driving these trucks have truck 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.549
 stopped almost six months ago 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.409
 and to meet demand as not 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.210
 find professionals prepared 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.750
 the entrepreneur had to outsource the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.750
 service inside hire drivers 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.180
 self-employed professionals or other 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.060
 other small business 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.210
 have two or three trucks coming 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.040
 if you add my strength so that people 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.770
 can serve our client 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.240
 according to the trade union of the companies 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.490
 transportation and logistics 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.350
 more than 4 thousand drivers are missing 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.640
 specialized in the transport of 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.450
 loads in the state 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.129
 of this total 50% only in the agricultural sector and 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.009
 lack of professionals influence 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.900
 directly in the increase of the freight price 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.900
 esteem does not have much calculation 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.030
 I need people 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.760
 team that is 5 8% that we have one 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.129
 increased cost and freight due to this 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.439
 lack of drivers and problems 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.030
 structural changes that Brazil is undergoing 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.680
 and for those who want to become professional in 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.510
 large field this entity offers

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.379
 different sectors 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.470
 this course we have the school of 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.959
 driver's goal is to teach with 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.180
 the student learns to operate it 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.879
 machine that is once learning the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.069
 operate the machine and use the resources 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.019
 that the vehicle offers it has conditions 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.250
 to drive in any type of 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.409
 paving 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.989
 Israel has already worked with the 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.090
 food industry sought expertise in 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.780
 hope of finding a new job in the 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.230
 sector 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.409
 in fact we thought that you 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.030
 I knew a little about the branch actually the 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.739
 people have to be inside the room 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.109
 class to sit up and update if 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.730
 qualifying in the labor market 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.590
 the school principal explains that the 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.720
 has been increasing demand for courses 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.090
 every year and how the trucks are 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.889
 increasingly modern, it is
