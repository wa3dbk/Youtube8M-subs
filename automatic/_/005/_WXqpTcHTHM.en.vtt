head right now I've had this here for it

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.930 
head right now I've had this here for it
eight<00:00:15.630> weeks<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.410> I'm<00:00:17.250> actually<00:00:17.460> going<00:00:17.820> to

eight weeks and I'm actually going to

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.849 
eight weeks and I'm actually going to
take<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.449> out<00:00:18.660> today<00:00:18.900> because<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.560> don't<00:00:19.770> want

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
take it out today because I don't want

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.910 
take it out today because I don't want
my<00:00:20.310> hair<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.000> need<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.240> start<00:00:21.960> matting<00:00:22.740> up

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
my hair and the need to start matting up

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.359 
my hair and the need to start matting up
or<00:00:23.460> yeah<00:00:24.470> so<00:00:25.760> I'm<00:00:26.760> singing<00:00:27.269> out<00:00:27.390> today<00:00:27.689> and

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
or yeah so I'm singing out today and

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.540 
or yeah so I'm singing out today and
honestly<00:00:29.369> i<00:00:29.970> think<00:00:30.420> i<00:00:31.109> would<00:00:31.830> probably<00:00:32.399> get

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
honestly i think i would probably get

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.479 
honestly i think i would probably get
this<00:00:32.730> here<00:00:33.210> again<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:33.989> future<00:00:34.340> i'm<00:00:35.340> going

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
this here again in the future i'm going

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.209 
this here again in the future i'm going
to<00:00:35.550> come<00:00:35.730> close<00:00:35.910> up<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.780> really<00:00:37.110> has<00:00:37.920> not

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
to come close up so it really has not

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.580 
to come close up so it really has not
tangled<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.120> much<00:00:39.360> at<00:00:39.600> all<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.260> has<00:00:40.410> been

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
tangled that much at all and it has been

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.220 
tangled that much at all and it has been
eight<00:00:40.770> weeks<00:00:40.800> since<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.239> how<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.930> falls

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
eight weeks since it here how it falls

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.840 
eight weeks since it here how it falls
in<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.559> back<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.370> see<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.640> is

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
in the back of you can see and this is

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.959 
in the back of you can see and this is
the<00:00:48.030> curl<00:00:48.480> texture<00:00:49.289> does<00:00:49.710> change<00:00:50.280> over<00:00:50.730> time

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the curl texture does change over time

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.180 
the curl texture does change over time
so<00:00:51.360> when<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.050> comes<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.350> little<00:00:52.469> bit<00:00:52.710> close<00:00:52.920> up

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
so when it comes a little bit close up

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.660 
so when it comes a little bit close up
for<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.750> get<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> good<00:00:55.079> look<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.680> curl

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
for you to get a good look of the curl

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.610 
for you to get a good look of the curl
pattern<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.510> still<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.230> really

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
pattern but it's still it's a really

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.229 
pattern but it's still it's a really
pretty<00:00:59.690> curl<00:01:00.690> pattern<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.649> more<00:01:02.340> relaxed

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
pretty curl pattern it's more relaxed

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.620 
pretty curl pattern it's more relaxed
more<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.840> free<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:05.180> compared<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.420> when<00:01:06.600> i

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
more just free going compared to when i

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.740 
more just free going compared to when i
first<00:01:07.200> got<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:08.280> hear<00:01:08.490> installed<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.570> like

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
first got to hear installed it was like

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.100 
first got to hear installed it was like
a<00:01:09.780> deep<00:01:10.229> set<00:01:10.770> wave<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.670> i<00:01:11.850> did<00:01:12.150> not<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.750> at

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
a deep set wave and i did not like it at

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.219 
a deep set wave and i did not like it at
all<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.979> every<00:01:14.340> time<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:15.000> see<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.840> wash

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
all but every time you see you on wash

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.499 
all but every time you see you on wash
to<00:01:16.560> hear<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.130> curl<00:01:17.430> pattern<00:01:17.939> does<00:01:18.119> change

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
to hear the curl pattern does change

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.640 
to hear the curl pattern does change
over<00:01:18.869> time<00:01:19.110> um<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:21.720> only<00:01:21.840> advice<00:01:22.170> i<00:01:22.409> have

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
over time um so the only advice i have

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.740 
over time um so the only advice i have
if<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:23.640> um<00:01:23.970> one<00:01:24.420> thing<00:01:24.450> i

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
if you get this here um one thing i

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.749 
if you get this here um one thing i
don't<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.500> does<00:01:25.740> shed<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.310> sheds<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
don't like it does shed it sheds like a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.749

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
will shed but it's really good curl

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.429 
will shed but it's really good curl
patterns<00:01:49.890> really<00:01:50.189> nice<00:01:50.399> own<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:51.420> does<00:01:51.810> tango

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
patterns really nice own it does tango

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.620 
patterns really nice own it does tango
but<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:52.890> not<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.369> visual<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.450> don't

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
but it's not so visual like you don't

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.709 
but it's not so visual like you don't
see<00:01:54.689> knots<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> back<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.490> my<00:01:56.520> head<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.000> I

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
see knots in the back of my head that I

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.390 
see knots in the back of my head that I
never

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400
