00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.049
 [Music] 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.620
 Hello everyone, and we welcome you in 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.500
 this my new video always here on 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.609
 my youtube channel the corner 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.119
 of computer science as you already read from 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:25.240
 titolo this video is about the root for 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.730
 android 4.3 many have asked me 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.470
 how to do it because they had gods 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.840
 problems updating from 4.2 4.3 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.980
 because the official google toolkit 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.750
 nexus 4 has not been updated and therefore 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.870
 I'll show you how to burp the android 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.090
 4.3 first thing we start with going 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.780
 in the phone settings like 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:55.510
 see here the version is that of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.980
 android 4.3 jelly beans and once 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.620
 in the setting you have to go to 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.020
 bild number as you see mine 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.109
 byte is the last update then 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.170
 the one that ends with the letter y il 

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:08.859
 you must tabare seven times on the number 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.109
 of the byte 

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:13.420
 now tells us that we have moved on to 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:15.820
 to be a developer 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.469
 let's go back and find the menu again 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.770
 developer ie options 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:24.249
 developer we enter and activate the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.530
 usb debug mode let's do it ok 

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:28.869
 once you have activated the mode 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.869
 debugging usb 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.560
 you must switch off the phone and restart it 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.520
 in fastboot mode to start it in 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.429
 this mode 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.950
 you have to switch it back on by pressing the 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.759
 power button plus the key 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.759
 volume less 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.810
 that we have entered fastboot mode 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.240
 we need to connect our phone to 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.040
 computer is once connected there 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.960
 we move to our pc 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.540
 once you have connected the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.810
 phone to computer you have not downloaded 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.050
 already the toolkit for the nexus 4 I leave you 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.770
 the download link to download it later 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:14.130
 you will have to download the file to perform 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.190
 the root file here is a zip that 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.860
 we're going to flash from our recovery 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.840
 so I leave the link as always 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.320
 in the video description 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.720
 now you have to start the toolkit when 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:33.300
 you start it here you will be asked a question 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:36.300
 write no here put android 4.2.2 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.810
 so let's write 13 let's send 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.470
 now we are in the menu of our toolkit 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.560
 we must root 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.989
 in a few words the toolkit will carry out the 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.700
 root however tells us that he broke it went to 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.620
 good end that installed everything though 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.320
 the fundamental things that interest us 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.570
 to us of the procedure is the release of the 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.840
 bootloader and installation of 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:04.560
 the clock recovery work touch so then 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.980
 to do this we must do number 8 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.040
 so here we write 8 and send it here 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.820
 let's put the number two on super 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.820
 shaun fire 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.170
 tells us what recovery we need to do 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.560
 the first therefore we write 1 and we do 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.320
 sending 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.470
 now he asks us if our device in 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.000
 fastboot mode we write yes and 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.720
 we confirm 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.470
 now we have to write yes this 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.470
 question that makes us 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.849
 during the burp procedure e 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.620
 especially in this part when he says 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.260
 who is waiting for the device 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.129
 you will see that the nexus will have it all 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.599
 black screen but you see that behind is 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.859
 backlit so it means that it is 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.659
 switched on 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.280
 you have to wait especially in this one 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.579
 part when I'm doing the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.769
 recognition of the system therefore not 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.219
 you have to worry if you put it off 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.219
 time 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.960
 ok now the procedure is over like 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:45.050
 you will notice that your nexus is being 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.779
 restarting and will upgrade android 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.999
 the memory folder is almost open 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:51.949
 internal of the nexus therefore means that 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:55.819
 the proceedings are now complete 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:59.599
 we close the toolkit let's copy 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:03.110
 the super file on zip to perform 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:05.809
 the root on our rest nexus is the file 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.149
 zip that we went to download first and 

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:10.039
 now we just have to copy it into the 

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:12.649
 our internal memory 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:15.740
 now that he copied into memory 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:18.889
 internal we verify ok now there 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.529
 we move on the phone to leave from 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.849
 recovery this zip to make the 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:25.159
 our root 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.529
 now that we've copied our zip 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:29.779
 in the phone you have to disconnect the 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:33.110
 phone from the computer and the only way to 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:34.999
 get into recovery mode by doing it from 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.309
 fastboot mode like I did 

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:41.869
 see earlier entry into mode 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:45.019
 fastboot and do with the barbell of 

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:47.779
 volume you have to choose the recovery mode 

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:49.869
 and consent with the key 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:49.869
 power on 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.510
 now that we have entered shelters 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:04.710
 we have to do install zip from sd card 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:07.230
 then the first choose from sd card we give 0 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.470
 slash that our internal memory is 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:15.080
 let's go get our file e 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.080
 this super update on zip 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:22.500
 we see the confirmation with yes now that it is 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:25.889
 installed let's go back is the first 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.680
 re boot system now here we will do one 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:32.000
 question we must do no and the 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.000
 phone will restart 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.380
 now that the phone has rebooted 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:41.050
 we verify if the root has been executed 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.820
 I have successfully downloaded it 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.240
 an application called ruth 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:52.110
 checkers basic that checks if it has been 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:56.980
 installed the root we do on verification 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:59.320
 we make grant and application there 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.690
 says the device was voted with 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.910
 success so thank you for having 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.880
 saw this video as always if you have 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:09.130
 of the problems commented on below the video and 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.290
 for this video and see you all a 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.890
