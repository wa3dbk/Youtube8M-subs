00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
what to do is probably why my

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.999 
what to do is probably why my
pinstriping<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.590> different<00:01:13.830> from

pinstriping is so different from

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.149 
pinstriping is so different from
everyone<00:01:14.549> else's<00:01:14.940> because<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.330> wasn't

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
everyone else's because I wasn't

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.499 
everyone else's because I wasn't
learning<00:01:17.159> from<00:01:17.430> somebody<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.299> taking

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
learning from somebody and then taking

learning from somebody and then taking
their<00:01:18.720> style<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.259> making<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.740> my<00:01:19.890> own<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.100> was

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
their style and making it my own I was

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:33.010 
their style and making it my own I was
making<00:01:20.700> my<00:01:20.820> own<00:01:20.850> style<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.509> my<00:01:21.630> own

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.639 

I<00:01:33.520> moved<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:34.609> California<00:01:34.670> ten<00:01:35.390> years<00:01:35.600> ago<00:01:35.840> in<00:01:36.109> a

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
I moved to California ten years ago in a

purple and purple faded rims and the

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.620 
purple and purple faded rims and the
roof<00:01:43.399> was<00:01:43.520> all<00:01:43.670> metal<00:01:43.939> flake<00:01:44.179> with<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.420> big

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
roof was all metal flake with a big

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.289 
roof was all metal flake with a big
panel<00:01:44.929> on<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:45.350> it<00:01:45.740> was<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.729> know<00:01:46.759> it<00:01:46.880> was<00:01:47.210> a

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
panel on it it was you know it was a

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.940 
panel on it it was you know it was a
totally<00:01:47.689> different<00:01:47.929> car<00:01:48.140> for<00:01:48.380> what<00:01:48.560> was<00:01:48.679> going

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
totally different car for what was going

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.830 
totally different car for what was going
on<00:01:49.069> at<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:49.429> time<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:49.909> just<00:01:50.270> think<00:01:50.509> that<00:01:50.569> is

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
on at this time I just think that is

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.520 
on at this time I just think that is
probably<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.530> best<00:01:51.860> part<00:01:52.789> are<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.090> best<00:01:53.530> era

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
probably the best part are the best era

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.499 
probably the best part are the best era
in<00:01:54.770> hot<00:01:55.189> riding<00:01:55.429> that's<00:01:55.939> when<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.090> cars<00:01:56.360> were

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
in hot riding that's when the cars were

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.020 
in hot riding that's when the cars were
the<00:01:56.630> fastest<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.380> Rost<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:58.100> it<00:01:58.700> was<00:01:58.850> just

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
the fastest and the Rost and it was just

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.850 
the fastest and the Rost and it was just
on<00:01:59.149> a<00:01:59.179> very<00:01:59.420> edge<00:01:59.659> it<00:01:59.929> was<00:02:00.020> before<00:02:00.170> muscle<00:02:00.649> cars

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
on a very edge it was before muscle cars

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.770 
on a very edge it was before muscle cars
were<00:02:00.920> popular<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:02.060> know<00:02:02.179> is<00:02:02.299> before<00:02:02.569> you<00:02:02.659> can
