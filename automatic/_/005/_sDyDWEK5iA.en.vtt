00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.840
 "Chickpea Salad" 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.400
 but first we learn our materials 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.400

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.680

 5 pieces of pepper 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.640
 2 tablespoons olive oil

 yes after our list of materials, we can proceed to the construction of our salad 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.560
 first I have to say; 1 cup boiled chickpeas ... 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.280
 And as you'll see here, we've got quite a lot of chickpeas. 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.000
 other transactions now 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.680
 We have half bunches of parsley, thin thin meat 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.240
 chickpeas 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.480
 continue with fresh onion 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.760
 White parts may be slightly thicker 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.080
 in this way by cutting in half cut thin 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.000
 we also add fresh onion on parsley 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.520
 continue chopping peppers 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.080
 for a little thinning, we cut peppers in the middle 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.400
 and finely ground 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.600
 row tomatoes 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.480
 tomatoes in small cubes 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.840
 we also chopped tomatoes 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.600
 lemon juice squeezed on ... 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160
 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.840
 and 1 teaspoon salt 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.840
 and mixing 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.760
 Yes, we prepared our salad, we mixed ... 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.760
 After waiting for about half an hour in the refrigerator ... 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.920
