00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.400
 most recently, my son started 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.310
 rubber aircraft this was mine 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.510
 the first plane in general in life through some 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.939
 everything slips then at me 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.900
 so how to run it came to me 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.180
 only at the end 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.070
 launch then he has January wings 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.370
 create so I ordered one more 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.220
 the plane on this time went on this 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.280
 This is a plane with an engine for this. 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.989
 the plane already has normal doctors 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.980
 running on electricity is not that 3 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.980
 genki and flies ask in my 30 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.960
 seconds it already sounds than that though here 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.969
 it is written too long flies over me 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.610
 I ordered one more yes apparently motors 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.520
 must rule it for a reason 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.040
 correct mistakes but here it is all too 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.730
 not a top plane is an assembly here 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.119
 wings 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:12.680
 this is the main palto this is the loop with 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:13.970
 a switch it oh and a this charger 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.270
 device is inserted here two 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.550
 batteries and this charger 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.000
 stuck for recharging this one here 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.920
 things 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.810
 here to this plane even the instruction is not 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.580
 is not on the box is not on a separate 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.280
 everything seems so simple to a piece of paper that 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.039
 Turkey does not need to put a timer and 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:42.979
 I mark for how much the plane is going 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:45.800
 two wings and even sang the longest 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.229
 of course I stuck 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.869
 double-sided tape Chenki because as 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.819
 on evil nails recently cut with short 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.220
 nails very uncomfortable to open at night 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.800
 you first need one side of the glue then 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.410
 glue the satin mask and then peel off 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.869
 another piece of paper after peeling off already 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.950
 stick what you can take all of you 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.270
 ready well here everything is simple 2 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.039
 double sided tape 2 is attached on 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.960
 the top of the body are attached wings and 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.550
 there is no need to tell a joke 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.350
 or any beard you know 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.330
 after its last area its not 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.270
 looked but jokes read no more 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.800
 wear your Eurovision cap 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.630
 of today breaking wings ready 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.940
 Now the limits of RF hair inside as 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:37.850
 always hurry people laugh 4 times 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:40.520
 put on leave the highway put on wheels well 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.190
 and left the propeller all the aircraft is ready 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.850
 but sticking this beauty will not 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.470
 count during assembly by plane for 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.970
 order to charge the plane is used 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.420
 here is such a charger inside two 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.290
 penlight batteries aa 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.790
 Unfortunately, the battery is written 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.890
 cannot be used 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.390
 the plane therefore rub rubbed 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.920
 no batteries is a battery i have 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.660
 there are special holes here 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.220
 who just need to stick this 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.110
 charger wait a minute 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.330
 written not to charge longer than one minute 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.580
 You see, I immediately see that is uncomfortable 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.670
 because somehow put this charging 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.180
 need or hold in your hands and so the plane i 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.300
 collected 6 minutes 11 seconds 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.480
 now we have to wait a minute 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.870
 charge the battery of debt in the country and 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.090
 six minutes 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.710
 the battery is charged and you can run 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.050
 the plane is interesting of course not the plane 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.730
 better than rubber 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.160
 more than 6 dollars that is two today 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.900
 dollar is more expensive than rubber but with 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.900
 this is a full trailer here 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:04:06.720
 good traction I feel peace by 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:09.319
 I know why he screams and that's it 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.319
 which 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.820
 say that the wheels here are definitely unnecessary 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:21.320
 things fell off well and own grief 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:35.480
 landing on the grass flew away 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:45.770
 generally good then you turn it on 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:47.510
 fingers and fingers because 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:55.040
 that we this airplane does not seem to be 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:57.290
 find far flew away yes i'm actually 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.670
 would be a little overrun 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.670
 stupid you phone 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:49.960
 good landing there are gophers 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.960
 refer 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.050
 after the plane hit a tree 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.460
 in the screw bent plastic hesitated 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.099
 in general now flies in zigzags for 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.400
 what spare screws would spare 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:38.529
 a set of wings and tails was given to him 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.819
 for that penny 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:42.819
 cool plane I really liked 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:57.620
 what do you see the whole truth and I see you 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:07:12.550
 see how many birds that they are right here 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:16.689
 here come to life yes that's how cool it went 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.689
 over there under the bridge of my hands
