is<00:00:58.100> that<00:00:58.370> uh<00:00:59.079> well<00:01:01.149> the<00:01:02.149> idea<00:01:02.539> that<00:01:02.629> he<00:01:03.260> was

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
is that uh well the idea that he was

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.900 
is that uh well the idea that he was
traumatized<00:01:04.990> by<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.650> opening<00:01:07.130> scene<00:01:07.460> of<00:01:07.490> him

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910

that<00:01:13.730> doesn't<00:01:13.910> make<00:01:14.090> much<00:01:14.450> sense<00:01:14.510> to<00:01:14.930> me<00:01:15.140> now

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
that doesn't make much sense to me now

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.850
