00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.949
 my car stands out on the road 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.330
 what is this surviving instance 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.339
 volkswagen 1906 release date such 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.939
 able to leave very little alive and 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.939
 graph and 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.940
 just be 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.790
 My acquaintance with cars began with 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.760
 volkswagen 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.970
 father gave me volkswagen golf on the 80th 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.800
 years in saying that this is a good car 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.950
 then we were not yet others 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.510
 bmw 3 series also me was subaru 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.740
 2003 forester turbo too 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.190
 great car 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.810
 but no less current my car and 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.990
 love is naturally volkswagen 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.990
 sirocco 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.970
 The history of this car is similar to 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.700
 revival story because he was 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.100
 purchased in 25 years condition 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.780
 such as the factory went out but none the less 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.560
 I had to restore it 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.290
 restore white beautiful salon 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.600
 install body paint improved 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.920
 suspension made engine exhaust 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.680
 set wheels that delight the soul 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.350
 they know that in general is not the most important thing 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.390
 what is this car rulitsya 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.070
 and moves completely differently even 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.560
 compared to the interior subaru 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.420
 turbocharged here it feels like 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.420
 you are driving on asphalt like karting 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.810
 it was a dear friend she accidentally 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.349
 won 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.349
 work in drugs 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.370
 and brought it to me but since 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.990
 and settle his car 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.370
 lived himself 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.030
 when I saw that he pleases everyone 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.030
 traffic jams 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.970
 here you are me 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:47.670
 Fight club movie is probably one 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.019
 from cases when cinema is even better than a book 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.989
 of course I try to watch last years 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.480
 cinema in the original sense of subtitles without 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.269
 of our wonderful dubbing because 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.620
 then you realize it you understand how much and 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:08.280
 you lose all the same acting intonation 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:12.079
 much more interesting and there are things that 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.079
 just lose about dubbing 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.630
 basically I certainly plays radio 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.560
 maybe it's because of laziness 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.850
 some kind of aura because 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.920
 not you choose 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.930
 chooses you 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.209
 just choose more or less suitable 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.620
 you themed radio type radio 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:37.180
 about rock or our radio and addiction 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.180
 the moods between them are switching 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.730
 from the popular that lately all 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.440
 swept over there in particular 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.600
 fantasy song of ice and flame 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.040
 again fantasy varied 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.870
 artistic tirah tour precisely such 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.380
 here is some very classic long time ago 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.240
 honestly read because the first 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.030
 times I took more technical 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.500
 literature on work and now when 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.760
 manages to relax 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.180
 relax and read something 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.180
 simple 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.650
 now probably really 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.650
 our whole sport is a stick not in transport 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.790
 editions 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.790
 in our case in the park 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.270
 and 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.930
 Jack 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.169
 there have been cases when 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.500
 stopped only to 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.449
 know what kind of car is one 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.340
 once stopped what to see and what about 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:37.330
 I am told under the hood on adopted and 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.160
 said uhha and let go and treat not 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.110
 absolutely normal especially as 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.240
 In recent years, I have long been enough for 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.120
 driving very often on the highway 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.240
 Minsk Moscow there probably 1120 on wheels 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.800
 and as if the last years makes me happy that 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.050
 not only culture grows 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.840
 driving in the country but also culture 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.020
 as a matter of fact 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.020
 DPS staff 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:06.360
 Well, there is certainly quite sharp 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:12.060
 reactions in terms of what wow wow sell and 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.780
 other options for example such 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.510
 be sure to horn or 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.900
 say hello to my friend homer either 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.900
 with me 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.440
 Well, I think the policy rules with me 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.080
 you need to start with yourself 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.020
 because even all politics and no matter 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.820
 everything consists of people like us 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.410
 I do not form state Finnish 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.230
 government people I already 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.230
 this is my policy attitude 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.880
 Well, I can not say that I am a believer rather 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.280
 atheists still can't say 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.140
 something is eating this is also some kind of faith not 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.490
 Vera 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.490
 therefore very neutral attitude 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:18.590
 food well ate meat men 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.590
 meat is our everything, of course, only meat 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.710
 now of course, as if life is big 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.820
 the city cuts out a little bit of this 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.340
 Mostly she still has this 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.000
 spearfishing for example and carriage and 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.300
 enthusiasm 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.660
 a little bit of pictures of a little old 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.630
 cars a little motorcycles but right here 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.230
 we can not say that one hobby is all 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.950
 little by little 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:45.570
 and finally, I wish all the participants 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:49.310
 movements are treated equally 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.310
 to people on all cars
