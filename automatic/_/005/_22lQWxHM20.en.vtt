00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.260
 Y 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:22.789
 I am about to buy transport 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.029
 would be counted already we follow that not 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.029
 can 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.420
 with others 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:39.220
 we together a perfect couple 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.940
 in this way because so the 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.300
 compatibilization is better by 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.300
 put it like that 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:55.500
 but it was very short and that will go from 20 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.500
 what is the description 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.540
 and here you know one billion baker corts 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.019
 open 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.240
 Y 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:19.659
 that is the one that ends of 790 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.659
 because I had this one just came out 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.990
 no lie 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.990
 because they are used 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.650
 so it would be 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.460
 five minutes because he was recording what 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.299
 same and the thing is that I when I 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.299
 I was installing 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:55.070

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.190

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.409
 description the marketing launcher 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.190
 we see that this is what I want 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:25.190
 I do not even want in the profile 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.490
 and play online that she tool does not 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.490
 wants 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.040
 in the S 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:43.739
 the indexed maker 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:46.739
 any customer profile 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.739
 but 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.970
 of something else could unity that you there 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.280
 millions 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.470
 and extract it 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.440
 from the minister to the client accept and say 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.590
 what extraction has been complete has been 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.150
 cited for the version of maikel folch 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.480

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.480
 we go to percent up to five 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.480
 ah 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.870
 this is the create 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.170
 because the version 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.170
 it will be 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.120
 they close it 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.750
 if they saw it 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.200
 creates years of interruption of neighbors 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:14.069
