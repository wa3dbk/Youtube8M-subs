00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.970 
overall it's looking pretty good I
managed<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:59.170> keep<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.320> heat<00:02:00.470> down<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.950> I

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
managed to keep the heat down and I

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.500 
managed to keep the heat down and I
didn't<00:02:01.160> warp<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:01.490> there<00:02:01.820> anything<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.390> it

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
didn't warp it there anything so it

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.510 
didn't warp it there anything so it
shouldn't<00:02:02.750> take<00:02:02.780> much<00:02:02.990> body<00:02:03.200> work<00:02:03.380> at<00:02:03.500> all<00:02:03.560> the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
shouldn't take much body work at all the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.370 
shouldn't take much body work at all the
blend<00:02:04.790> it's<00:02:05.000> actually<00:02:05.300> a<00:02:05.330> really<00:02:05.540> really

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
blend it's actually a really really

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.330 
blend it's actually a really really
smooth<00:02:06.770> transition<00:02:07.430> from<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:09.860> old<00:02:09.979> quarter

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
smooth transition from the old quarter

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.330 
smooth transition from the old quarter
to<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.520> new<00:02:10.640> quarter<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:11.350> they<00:02:12.350> say<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:12.980> far<00:02:13.160> so

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
to the new quarter so they say so far so

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.550 
to the new quarter so they say so far so
