lesson that I did on painting different

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.920 
lesson that I did on painting different
colors<00:01:53.729> underneath<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.420> your<00:01:54.540> shapes

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
colors underneath of your shapes

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.800 
colors underneath of your shapes
underneath<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> your<00:01:55.950> top<00:01:56.219> coat<00:01:56.540> you'll<00:01:57.540> see

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
underneath the your top coat you'll see

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.069 
underneath the your top coat you'll see
this<00:01:58.909> demonstrated<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> free<00:02:00.479> art<00:02:00.689> lesson

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
this demonstrated in the free art lesson

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.060 
this demonstrated in the free art lesson
and<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.680> showed<00:02:02.009> how<00:02:02.280> putting<00:02:02.700> pink<00:02:02.969> under<00:02:03.509> one

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
and I showed how putting pink under one

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.859 
and I showed how putting pink under one
makes<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.460> block<00:02:05.820> look<00:02:06.149> different<00:02:06.630> than<00:02:06.719> if

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
makes this block look different than if

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.139 
makes this block look different than if
you<00:02:06.990> paint<00:02:07.259> yellow<00:02:07.560> underneath<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.879> if<00:02:09.000> you

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
you paint yellow underneath of it if you

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.699 
you paint yellow underneath of it if you
paint<00:02:09.390> yellow<00:02:09.599> you're<00:02:09.869> gonna<00:02:09.959> get<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.200> warmer

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
paint yellow you're gonna get a warmer

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.130 
paint yellow you're gonna get a warmer
block<00:02:11.009> if<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.700> paint<00:02:12.120> green<00:02:12.420> under<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.020> you're

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
block if you paint green under it you're

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.500 
block if you paint green under it you're
gonna<00:02:13.230> get

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
gonna get

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.380 
gonna get
Green<00:02:13.810> or<00:02:14.049> block<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:14.819> this<00:02:15.819> one<00:02:16.030> had<00:02:16.180> some

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
Green or block and this one had some

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.880 
Green or block and this one had some
purple<00:02:16.780> under<00:02:17.019> it<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.349> can<00:02:17.530> see<00:02:17.709> that

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
purple under it so you can see that

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.789 
purple under it so you can see that
these<00:02:18.099> three<00:02:18.579> look<00:02:19.180> decidedly<00:02:19.720> different<00:02:20.409> so

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
these three look decidedly different so

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.619 
these three look decidedly different so
it<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.370> just<00:02:21.610> proves<00:02:21.909> the<00:02:22.030> point<00:02:22.269> that

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
it that just proves the point that

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.649 
it that just proves the point that
whatever<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.620> underneath<00:02:24.129> this<00:02:24.939> blue<00:02:25.329> paint

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
whatever is underneath this blue paint

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.229 
whatever is underneath this blue paint
all<00:02:25.930> this<00:02:26.200> paint<00:02:26.500> was<00:02:26.680> blue<00:02:26.980> but<00:02:27.849> whatever's

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
all this paint was blue but whatever's

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.410 
all this paint was blue but whatever's
under<00:02:28.659> the<00:02:28.780> blue<00:02:28.989> paint<00:02:29.260> first<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:30.239> going<00:02:31.239> to

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
under the blue paint first is going to

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.020 
under the blue paint first is going to
influence<00:02:32.079> what<00:02:32.409> goes<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:32.890> top<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:33.819> that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
influence what goes on top of it so that

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.330 
influence what goes on top of it so that
same<00:02:34.420> thing<00:02:34.810> goes<00:02:35.110> for<00:02:35.140> here<00:02:35.860> so<00:02:36.430> if<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.819> paint

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
same thing goes for here so if I paint

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.979 
same thing goes for here so if I paint
magenta<00:02:39.340> let's<00:02:39.549> say<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:39.760> put<00:02:40.060> some<00:02:40.299> magenta<00:02:40.629> out

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
magenta let's say I put some magenta out

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.910 
magenta let's say I put some magenta out
and<00:02:41.379> I<00:02:42.310> do<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.909> painting<00:02:43.209> on<00:02:43.420> top<00:02:43.480> of<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.109> it's

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
and I do a painting on top of that it's

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.619 
and I do a painting on top of that it's
going<00:02:45.159> to<00:02:45.280> be<00:02:45.400> different<00:02:45.879> than<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:46.299> if<00:02:46.510> I

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
going to be different than it is if I

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.750 
going to be different than it is if I
have<00:02:46.810> orange<00:02:47.260> underneath<00:02:47.680> of<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:48.040> now<00:02:48.519> there

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
have orange underneath of it now there

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.729 
have orange underneath of it now there
you<00:02:48.970> can<00:02:49.239> go<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.780> can<00:02:49.810> scrub<00:02:50.290> different

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
you can go and you can scrub different

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.289 
you can go and you can scrub different
colors<00:02:51.069> of<00:02:51.099> under<00:02:51.459> painting<00:02:51.819> on<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.000> too

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
colors of under painting on it too

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.539 
colors of under painting on it too
there's<00:02:52.569> that's<00:02:52.780> another<00:02:53.170> way<00:02:53.409> not<00:02:54.010> have<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
there's that's another way not have the

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.960 
there's that's another way not have the
whole<00:02:54.730> canvas<00:02:55.090> as<00:02:55.450> one<00:02:55.920> tone<00:02:56.920> or<00:02:57.310> one<00:02:57.519> color

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
whole canvas as one tone or one color

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.940 
whole canvas as one tone or one color
but<00:02:58.239> have<00:02:58.480> different<00:02:59.049> colors<00:02:59.409> I<00:02:59.560> know<00:02:59.620> some

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
but have different colors I know some

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.670 
but have different colors I know some
people<00:03:00.250> do<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.639> they<00:03:01.599> pay<00:03:01.870> they<00:03:02.170> paint<00:03:02.440> some

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
people do this they pay they paint some

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.080 
people do this they pay they paint some
magenta<00:03:03.010> down<00:03:03.400> here<00:03:03.730> maybe<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.730> maybe<00:03:06.909> a

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
magenta down here maybe and maybe a

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.830 
magenta down here maybe and maybe a
splotch<00:03:07.540> over<00:03:08.049> here<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:10.090> they<00:03:10.239> let<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.629> be

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
splotch over here and they let this be

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.660 
splotch over here and they let this be
orange<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.560> maybe<00:03:11.680> they<00:03:11.859> come<00:03:12.040> over<00:03:12.310> here<00:03:12.579> and

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
orange and maybe they come over here and

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.900 
orange and maybe they come over here and
they<00:03:12.760> make<00:03:12.970> this<00:03:14.069> red<00:03:15.069> a<00:03:15.519> little<00:03:16.090> bit<00:03:16.239> red<00:03:16.569> or

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
they make this red a little bit red or

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.930 
they make this red a little bit red or
like<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:19.299> I<00:03:19.949> notice<00:03:20.949> how<00:03:21.099> thin<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.579> is<00:03:21.699> when

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
like that I notice how thin it is when

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.520 
like that I notice how thin it is when
you're<00:03:22.060> under<00:03:22.299> paint<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.959> want<00:03:23.139> to<00:03:23.230> keep<00:03:23.349> the

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
you're under paint you want to keep the

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.309 
you're under paint you want to keep the
paint<00:03:23.769> thin<00:03:24.129> so<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.120> this<00:03:25.629> paint<00:03:25.959> doesn't

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
paint thin so that this paint doesn't

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.729 
paint thin so that this paint doesn't
mix<00:03:26.799> too<00:03:27.430> much<00:03:27.459> with<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.180> other<00:03:28.359> one<00:03:28.629> so<00:03:29.319> then

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
mix too much with the other one so then

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.050 
mix too much with the other one so then
you<00:03:29.889> could<00:03:30.010> go<00:03:30.190> in<00:03:30.340> there<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.549> you<00:03:30.730> can<00:03:30.879> make

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
you could go in there and you can make

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.479 
you could go in there and you can make
orange<00:03:31.569> let's<00:03:31.900> say<00:03:32.079> make<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:32.799> different<00:03:33.280> color

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
orange let's say make a different color

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.439 
orange let's say make a different color
yellowy<00:03:33.940> orange<00:03:34.060> over<00:03:34.720> here<00:03:36.239> now<00:03:37.239> that's

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449 
yellowy orange over here now that's

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.210 
yellowy orange over here now that's
really<00:03:37.810> thick<00:03:38.079> I<00:03:38.260> would<00:03:38.440> have<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.739> block<00:03:39.010> that

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
really thick I would have to block that

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.800 
really thick I would have to block that
off<00:03:39.280> because<00:03:39.609> that's<00:03:39.879> super<00:03:40.150> thick<00:03:40.599> that

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
off because that's super thick that

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.970 
off because that's super thick that
would<00:03:40.959> get<00:03:41.109> in<00:03:41.199> the<00:03:41.260> way<00:03:41.290> but<00:03:41.620> you<00:03:41.709> get<00:03:41.859> the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
would get in the way but you get the

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.970 
would get in the way but you get the
idea<00:03:42.370> now<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:43.840> side<00:03:44.139> could<00:03:44.470> be<00:03:44.500> even<00:03:44.919> a

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
idea now this side could be even a

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.920 
idea now this side could be even a
little<00:03:45.160> more<00:03:45.430> red<00:03:45.699> and<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:46.120> little<00:03:46.359> more<00:03:46.480> red<00:03:46.720> up

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
little more red and a little more red up

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.539 
little more red and a little more red up
there<00:03:47.079> now<00:03:47.199> look<00:03:47.379> how<00:03:47.530> crazy<00:03:47.889> I<00:03:48.190> mean<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.400> looks

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
there now look how crazy I mean it looks

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.900 
there now look how crazy I mean it looks
like<00:03:48.699> an<00:03:48.879> abstract<00:03:49.510> painting<00:03:50.400> but<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.639> would

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
like an abstract painting but that would

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.030 
like an abstract painting but that would
really<00:03:52.269> be<00:03:52.599> fun<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.989> paint<00:03:53.169> on<00:03:53.410> top<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.889> because

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
really be fun to paint on top of because

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.589 
really be fun to paint on top of because
then<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.340> could<00:03:54.489> draw<00:03:54.669> out<00:03:54.910> all<00:03:55.120> your<00:03:55.269> shapes

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
then you could draw out all your shapes

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.129 
then you could draw out all your shapes
and<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:55.989> could<00:03:56.139> begin<00:03:56.319> your<00:03:56.620> painting<00:03:58.139> just

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
and you could begin your painting just

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.170 
and you could begin your painting just
like<00:03:59.349> you<00:03:59.500> would<00:03:59.680> any<00:03:59.709> other<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.430> if<00:04:00.579> you<00:04:00.730> if

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
like you would any other and if you if

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.449 
like you would any other and if you if
you<00:04:01.329> want<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.599> do<00:04:01.780> this<00:04:01.959> technique<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.709> not<00:04:03.280> do

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
you want to do this technique and not do

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.939 
you want to do this technique and not do
it<00:04:03.579> in<00:04:03.730> acrylics<00:04:04.269> I<00:04:04.510> suggest<00:04:05.470> doing<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.829> in

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
it in acrylics I suggest doing it in

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.129 
it in acrylics I suggest doing it in
acrylic<00:04:06.430> because<00:04:06.519> then<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:06.819> just<00:04:07.000> dries<00:04:07.329> you

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
acrylic because then it just dries you

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.839 
acrylic because then it just dries you
can<00:04:08.169> just<00:04:08.530> put<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.859> paper<00:04:09.099> tile<00:04:09.430> on<00:04:09.669> there

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
can just put the paper tile on there

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.740 
can just put the paper tile on there
like<00:04:10.060> this<00:04:10.449> and<00:04:10.859> just<00:04:11.859> blot<00:04:12.190> it<00:04:12.459> and<00:04:12.760> that

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
like this and just blot it and that

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.750 
like this and just blot it and that
blotting<00:04:14.349> gets<00:04:14.560> rid<00:04:14.769> of<00:04:14.799> all<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.220> oil<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.729> oil

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
blotting gets rid of all the oil the oil

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.050 
blotting gets rid of all the oil the oil
soaks<00:04:16.419> up<00:04:16.630> into<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.139> fibers<00:04:17.680> of<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:18.760> paper

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
soaks up into the fibers of the paper

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.789 
soaks up into the fibers of the paper
towel<00:04:19.479> and<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:19.870> basically<00:04:20.079> get<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.500> little<00:04:20.769> a

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
towel and you basically get a little a

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.190 
towel and you basically get a little a
little<00:04:20.949> mono<00:04:21.400> print<00:04:21.880> so<00:04:22.690> you<00:04:22.719> do<00:04:22.990> that<00:04:23.169> a

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
little mono print so you do that a

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.080 
little mono print so you do that a
couple<00:04:23.500> times<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:24.130> you'll<00:04:24.280> be<00:04:24.430> dry<00:04:24.669> enough<00:04:24.940> to

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
couple times and you'll be dry enough to

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.660 
couple times and you'll be dry enough to
paint<00:04:25.300> on<00:04:25.450> top<00:04:25.690> of<00:04:25.950> so<00:04:26.950> let's<00:04:27.159> see<00:04:27.400> what

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
paint on top of so let's see what

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.360 
paint on top of so let's see what
happens<00:04:28.150> if<00:04:28.330> you<00:04:28.450> paint<00:04:28.770> callers<00:04:29.770> overtop<00:04:30.340> of

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
happens if you paint callers overtop of

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.400 
happens if you paint callers overtop of
these<00:04:32.190> let's<00:04:33.190> take<00:04:33.490> blue<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:35.700> paint<00:04:36.700> blue

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
these let's take blue and paint blue

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:44.280 
these let's take blue and paint blue
over<00:04:38.410> this<00:04:38.650> one<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:42.000> paint<00:04:43.000> blue<00:04:43.300> over<00:04:44.080> this

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
over this one and paint blue over this

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.290 
over this one and paint blue over this
one<00:04:44.550> look<00:04:45.550> what<00:04:45.730> happens<00:04:47.610> one<00:04:48.610> looks<00:04:48.880> greener

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
one look what happens one looks greener

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.810 
one look what happens one looks greener
and<00:04:50.430> one<00:04:51.430> looks<00:04:51.670> bluer<00:04:52.890> same<00:04:53.890> blue<00:04:54.190> but<00:04:54.700> when

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
and one looks bluer same blue but when

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.640 
and one looks bluer same blue but when
you<00:04:54.910> take<00:04:55.120> blue<00:04:55.330> and<00:04:55.540> put<00:04:55.690> it<00:04:55.810> in<00:04:55.930> magenta<00:04:56.470> on

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
you take blue and put it in magenta on

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.410 
you take blue and put it in magenta on
this<00:04:56.920> shape<00:04:57.190> you<00:04:57.400> get<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:57.790> color<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.300> when

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
this shape you get that color and when

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.630 
this shape you get that color and when
you<00:04:58.450> take<00:04:58.720> blue<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.290> put<00:04:59.860> it<00:04:59.980> on<00:05:00.100> top<00:05:00.310> of<00:05:00.520> that

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
you take blue and put it on top of that

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.030 
you take blue and put it on top of that
yellowy<00:05:01.060> orange<00:05:01.180> you<00:05:01.630> get<00:05:01.780> that<00:05:02.020> color<00:05:02.320> so<00:05:02.950> you

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
yellowy orange you get that color so you

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.930 
yellowy orange you get that color so you
can<00:05:03.310> see<00:05:03.550> that<00:05:03.790> every<00:05:04.090> time<00:05:04.300> you<00:05:04.450> change<00:05:04.690> these

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
can see that every time you change these

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.520 
can see that every time you change these
under<00:05:06.940> paintings<00:05:07.390> you<00:05:07.510> change<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:08.230> way<00:05:08.350> the

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
under paintings you change the way the

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.410 
under paintings you change the way the
color<00:05:08.770> looks<00:05:09.130> so<00:05:09.310> you<00:05:09.400> can<00:05:09.550> use<00:05:09.700> the<00:05:09.850> same<00:05:10.090> top

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
color looks so you can use the same top

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.740 
color looks so you can use the same top
coat<00:05:10.780> and<00:05:11.050> it's<00:05:12.040> just<00:05:12.280> going<00:05:12.430> to<00:05:12.520> change<00:05:12.820> the

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
coat and it's just going to change the

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.870 
coat and it's just going to change the
way<00:05:13.990> the<00:05:14.260> block<00:05:14.530> or<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:14.860> shape<00:05:15.190> looks<00:05:15.520> because

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
way the block or the shape looks because

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.790 
way the block or the shape looks because
of<00:05:16.030> what's<00:05:16.240> underneath<00:05:16.600> of<00:05:16.930> it<00:05:17.050> what's<00:05:17.260> mixing

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
of what's underneath of it what's mixing

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.100 
of what's underneath of it what's mixing
with<00:05:18.010> it<00:05:18.270> now<00:05:19.270> this<00:05:19.540> one's<00:05:19.750> going<00:05:19.810> to<00:05:19.930> look

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
with it now this one's going to look

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.900 
with it now this one's going to look
gray<00:05:20.440> or<00:05:20.500> because<00:05:20.860> that<00:05:20.890> what<00:05:21.310> was<00:05:21.490> under<00:05:21.790> it

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
gray or because that what was under it

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.530 
gray or because that what was under it
is<00:05:22.480> pretty<00:05:23.020> dark<00:05:23.440> and<00:05:23.650> cool<00:05:24.340> and<00:05:24.580> grey<00:05:24.880> so<00:05:25.330> see

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
is pretty dark and cool and grey so see

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.630 
is pretty dark and cool and grey so see
how<00:05:25.690> that<00:05:25.930> that<00:05:26.530> looks<00:05:26.890> different<00:05:27.100> than<00:05:27.490> that

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
how that that looks different than that

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.430 
how that that looks different than that
one<00:05:27.700> that<00:05:28.150> one<00:05:28.360> that<00:05:28.390> one<00:05:28.600> so<00:05:28.960> you<00:05:28.990> can<00:05:29.200> see

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
one that one that one so you can see

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.620 
one that one that one so you can see
that<00:05:29.680> whatever<00:05:30.130> you<00:05:30.490> paint<00:05:30.760> underneath<00:05:31.240> the

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
that whatever you paint underneath the

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.960 
that whatever you paint underneath the
the<00:05:31.810> top<00:05:32.380> coat<00:05:32.710> is<00:05:32.950> going<00:05:32.980> to<00:05:33.190> affect<00:05:33.700> how<00:05:33.940> the

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
the top coat is going to affect how the

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.420 
the top coat is going to affect how the
shape<00:05:34.480> looks<00:05:34.840> so<00:05:35.500> that's<00:05:35.680> real<00:05:35.890> good<00:05:36.130> to<00:05:36.250> know

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
shape looks so that's real good to know

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.220 
shape looks so that's real good to know
it's<00:05:36.700> another<00:05:36.940> tool<00:05:37.240> in<00:05:37.450> your<00:05:37.480> arsenal<00:05:37.960> we

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
it's another tool in your arsenal we

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.740 
it's another tool in your arsenal we
need<00:05:38.410> as<00:05:38.530> many<00:05:38.710> tools<00:05:38.980> as<00:05:39.280> we<00:05:39.430> can<00:05:39.730> the<00:05:40.390> more<00:05:40.600> we

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
need as many tools as we can the more we

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.780
