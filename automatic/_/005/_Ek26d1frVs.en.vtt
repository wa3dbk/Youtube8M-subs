00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:29.800
 and so ladies and gentlemen boys girls 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.410
 good afternoon evening night to all those who 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.390
 knows what an engine is with 22 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.830
 and here is the honda company and what's in it 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.690
 there is such an engine 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.809
 wonderful tensioner which i 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.440
 Today was dome internally sawed in half 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.350
 to find out what the bitch broke in him 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.879
 here I expected to see a spring which 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.650
 resists pressure of course 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.110
 turned out to be a spring that resist 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.559
 torsion is actually 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.540
 the breakdown is just the breakdown 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:08.110
 springs how does all this fraternity work 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:13.119
 it means we have a pin which is in the body 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:16.390
 and fixed here on the pin there is 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.100
 such a thing of a wreath which does not give 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.549
 he scroll the top 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.950
 relative to the body and below it has 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.170
 here is such 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.299
 I screwed up crap while asking 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.999
 pay attention he has this 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:36.899
 the slot which simultaneously serves to 

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:39.909
 to harass the spring 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.460
 what follows from this color from this then 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.499
 that here many people try for example 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.810
 crush it was done in a vice no 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:48.130
 say it does not work because just 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.530
 here are the comrades 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.829
 This spring is not as you thought 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.509
 the question is how does it work 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.399
 there is he gone for a certain 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.399
 the position is not moving anymore 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:04.560
 no, it works in such a way that when 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:07.899
 Slack spring appears a little bit 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.630
 turns this pin like this 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:14.140
 bolts if you can call and the pin yet 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.300
 there let's say a millimeter is pulled out 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.920
 outwards so slack gets out 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.470
 if a 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.090
 milky happened 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.510
 maybe a chinese belt set 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:29.240
 saved he began to stretch well there 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.150
 and actually these are the pies 8 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.600
 milliliters of oil tensioner just 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.160
 helps him to work properly there 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.610
 so that nothing rusted everything will be 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.670
 tip top 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.970
 That is, it is not hydraulic 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.690
 hydraulics there purely for lubrication 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.370
 when we break this spring 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.970
 the joke is that the tensioners are dying 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.060
 slow 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.370
 why is he dying slowly pin we 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.040
 here this one is completely screwed out yes when 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.170
 everything works right when it breaks 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.820
 spring and it turns out we have 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.820
 begins to consist of two parts 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.640
 nothing prevents this pin from spinning 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.120
 back but naturally he do this 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.120
 immediately can not pressure the tensioner 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.670
 us rollers he does it gradually in 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.850
 flow there I donâ€™t know for some time 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.280
 depending on how you drive 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.900
 twists twists appears 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.080
 more and more like slack in 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.880
 timing belt appears nasty sound 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.790
 which may be some people even 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.170
 don't notice first end up having 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.830
 twists completely and perfectly 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.660
 timing belt start loose 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:50.299
 that is fraught with jumps of teeth and meetings 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.760
 happy valves and pistons which 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:57.739
 then pour out a lot of big money 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.370
 than this one here is a wonderful little self 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.370
 tensioner
