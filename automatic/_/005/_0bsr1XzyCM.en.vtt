00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
to happen so soon maybe it's not going

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.730

point<00:02:41.920> on<00:02:42.100> because<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.459> just<00:02:42.670> always<00:02:42.820> imagined

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
point on because I just always imagined

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.370 
point on because I just always imagined
there'd<00:02:43.450> have<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.630> be<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.840> little<00:02:44.080> bit<00:02:44.230> more

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
there'd have to be a little bit more

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.630 
there'd have to be a little bit more
training<00:02:44.860> maybe<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.130> little<00:02:45.310> bit<00:02:45.489> more

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
training maybe a little bit more

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.850 
training maybe a little bit more
exposition<00:02:46.060> but<00:02:47.020> seeing<00:02:47.290> as<00:02:47.350> how<00:02:47.500> this<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.709> a

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
exposition but seeing as how this is a

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.290 
exposition but seeing as how this is a
manga<00:02:48.220> series<00:02:48.400> they<00:02:48.640> can<00:02:48.760> always<00:02:49.000> just<00:02:49.150> sort

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
manga series they can always just sort

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.820 
manga series they can always just sort
