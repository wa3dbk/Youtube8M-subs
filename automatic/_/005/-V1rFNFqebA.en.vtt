little challenges mm-hmm so it's like

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.470 
little challenges mm-hmm so it's like
that<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.129> the<00:02:10.250> games<00:02:10.580> are<00:02:10.729> pretty<00:02:10.910> damn

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
that and the games are pretty damn

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.539 
that and the games are pretty damn
complete<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.230> kind<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.470> remarkably<00:02:12.950> good

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
complete and kind of remarkably good

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.819 
complete and kind of remarkably good
looking<00:02:13.940> for<00:02:14.120> what<00:02:14.269> for<00:02:14.510> what<00:02:14.540> they<00:02:15.230> are<00:02:15.500> the

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
looking for what for what they are the

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.559 
looking for what for what they are the
star<00:02:16.130> prints<00:02:16.489> shooting<00:02:17.090> game<00:02:17.269> that's<00:02:17.510> a

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
star prints shooting game that's a

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.030 
star prints shooting game that's a
pretty<00:02:17.720> good<00:02:17.900> ripoff<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.230> star<00:02:18.530> soldier<00:02:18.860> and

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
pretty good ripoff of star soldier and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.470 
pretty good ripoff of star soldier and
that's<00:02:19.160> like<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.400> really<00:02:19.579> good<00:02:19.790> like<00:02:20.239> shooter

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
that's like a really good like shooter

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.720 
that's like a really good like shooter
in<00:02:20.630> my<00:02:20.750> opinion<00:02:21.110> for<00:02:21.260> what<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:21.920> which<00:02:22.310> is<00:02:22.370> a

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
in my opinion for what it is which is a

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.080 
in my opinion for what it is which is a
sort<00:02:23.150> of<00:02:23.209> fake<00:02:23.480> 8-bit<00:02:24.319> shooter<00:02:25.250> right<00:02:25.790> if<00:02:25.970> you

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
sort of fake 8-bit shooter right if you

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.819 
sort of fake 8-bit shooter right if you
put<00:02:26.269> yourself<00:02:26.360> in<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.810> mindset<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.410> okay<00:02:27.590> I'm

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
put yourself in the mindset of okay I'm

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:43.470 
put yourself in the mindset of okay I'm
in<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:27.950> 80s<00:02:28.370> yeah<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.090> pretty<00:02:29.239> damn<00:02:29.480> good

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.850 

the<00:02:44.480> show<00:02:44.720> he<00:02:44.959> plays<00:02:45.170> all<00:02:45.470> these<00:02:45.590> little<00:02:45.709> games

a<00:02:47.600> lot<00:02:47.870> but<00:02:48.470> in<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:49.160> DS<00:02:49.400> version<00:02:49.940> are<00:02:50.150> they

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
a lot but in this DS version are they

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.970 
a lot but in this DS version are they
going<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.540> be<00:02:50.630> as<00:02:50.810> hard<00:02:51.140> like<00:02:51.380> can<00:02:51.530> we<00:02:51.560> expect

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
going to be as hard like can we expect

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.210 
going to be as hard like can we expect
that<00:02:52.220> kind<00:02:52.490> of<00:02:53.110> same<00:02:54.110> challenge<00:02:54.650> or<00:02:54.950> is<00:02:55.100> it

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
that kind of same challenge or is it

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.070 
that kind of same challenge or is it
like<00:02:55.370> more<00:02:55.640> it's<00:02:55.940> easier<00:02:56.360> if<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.630> sit<00:02:56.810> get<00:02:56.930> the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
like more it's easier if you sit get the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.470 
like more it's easier if you sit get the
safest<00:02:57.470> object<00:02:57.890> feeling<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.910> challenges<00:02:59.360> are

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
safest object feeling the challenges are

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.449 
safest object feeling the challenges are
kind<00:02:59.569> of<00:02:59.660> easy<00:02:59.810> but<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.470> games<00:03:00.739> on<00:03:01.100> their<00:03:01.280> own

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
kind of easy but the games on their own

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.710 
kind of easy but the games on their own
can<00:03:01.819> be<00:03:01.850> difficult

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
can be difficult

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.960 
can be difficult
like<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.380> RPG<00:03:03.800> has<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.370> know<00:03:04.489> its<00:03:04.700> ups<00:03:04.850> and

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
like the RPG has you know its ups and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.760 
like the RPG has you know its ups and
downs<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.540> can<00:03:05.690> be<00:03:05.870> pretty<00:03:06.080> difficult<00:03:06.319> you

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
downs and it can be pretty difficult you

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.010 
downs and it can be pretty difficult you
can<00:03:06.890> instantly<00:03:07.190> die<00:03:07.459> in<00:03:07.520> it<00:03:07.790> like<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.720> ninja

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
can instantly die in it like the ninja

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.540 
can instantly die in it like the ninja
games<00:03:09.230> are<00:03:09.470> kind<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.739> hard<00:03:09.980> as<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.310> go<00:03:10.459> along

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
games are kind of hard as you go along

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.280 
games are kind of hard as you go along
and<00:03:10.940> with<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.090> enemies<00:03:11.390> will<00:03:11.540> be<00:03:11.600> faster<00:03:12.080> and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
and with the enemies will be faster and

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.320 
and with the enemies will be faster and
stuff<00:03:12.530> like<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.890> so<00:03:13.280> it's<00:03:13.790> kind<00:03:14.060> of<00:03:14.120> weird

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
stuff like that so it's kind of weird

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.030 
stuff like that so it's kind of weird
like<00:03:14.420> challenges<00:03:15.050> aren't<00:03:15.200> as<00:03:15.320> hard<00:03:15.470> but<00:03:15.920> the

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
like challenges aren't as hard but the

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.940 
like challenges aren't as hard but the
games<00:03:16.250> are<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:17.080> yeah<00:03:18.080> pretty<00:03:18.290> much<00:03:18.440> what<00:03:18.830> does

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
games are so yeah pretty much what does

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.270 
games are so yeah pretty much what does
it<00:03:19.070> what<00:03:19.220> are<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.430> challenges<00:03:20.890> let's<00:03:21.890> see<00:03:22.100> all

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
it what are the challenges let's see all

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.550 
it what are the challenges let's see all
sorts<00:03:22.519> of<00:03:22.730> stuff<00:03:22.970> it's<00:03:23.150> like<00:03:23.239> in<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.200> racing

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
sorts of stuff it's like in the racing

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.559 
sorts of stuff it's like in the racing
game<00:03:24.590> for<00:03:24.950> example<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.489> have<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.910> beat<00:03:26.420> the

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
game for example you have to beat the

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.410 
game for example you have to beat the
first<00:03:26.750> track<00:03:27.080> without<00:03:27.440> drifting<00:03:27.709> and<00:03:28.670> so<00:03:28.910> you

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
first track without drifting and so you

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.699 
first track without drifting and so you
basically<00:03:29.660> have<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.930> hit<00:03:30.050> hold<00:03:30.350> on<00:03:30.560> the

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
basically have to hit hold on the

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.380 
basically have to hit hold on the
acceleration<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.370> entire<00:03:31.670> time<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.150> just<00:03:32.300> go

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
acceleration the entire time and just go

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.930 
acceleration the entire time and just go
through<00:03:32.600> that<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:32.989> then<00:03:33.590> like<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.519> first<00:03:34.730> one

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
through that and then like the first one

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.030 
through that and then like the first one
and<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.180> RPGs<00:03:35.569> like<00:03:35.780> get<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:35.989> level<00:03:36.230> seven<00:03:36.470> and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
and the RPGs like get to level seven and

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.070 
and the RPGs like get to level seven and
then<00:03:37.459> later<00:03:37.760> on<00:03:37.940> it's<00:03:38.090> like<00:03:38.180> beat<00:03:38.420> boss<00:03:38.720> of<00:03:38.959> the

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
then later on it's like beat boss of the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.750 
then later on it's like beat boss of the
fourth<00:03:39.319> floor<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.830> big<00:03:40.010> dungeons<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.580> stuff

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
fourth floor the big dungeons and stuff

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.699 
fourth floor the big dungeons and stuff
like<00:03:40.850> that<00:03:41.060> which<00:03:41.690> can<00:03:41.720> actually<00:03:42.380> be<00:03:42.500> pretty

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
like that which can actually be pretty

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.979 
like that which can actually be pretty
early<00:03:43.010> on<00:03:43.280> in<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.489> game<00:03:43.519> right<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.540> it's

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
early on in the game right and it's

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.120 
early on in the game right and it's
other<00:03:45.170> stuff<00:03:45.230> like<00:03:45.530> beat<00:03:45.680> this<00:03:45.799> level<00:03:45.950> would
