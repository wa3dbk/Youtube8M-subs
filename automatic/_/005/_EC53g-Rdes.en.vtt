00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.389 
attack see all the recovery the end when
he<00:01:56.450> lands<00:01:56.869> but<00:01:57.680> if<00:01:57.770> you<00:01:57.829> do<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.100> attack<00:01:58.369> a

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
he lands but if you do the attack a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.609 
he lands but if you do the attack a
little<00:01:58.729> earlier<00:01:59.149> you'll<00:01:59.600> completely<00:02:00.140> recover

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
little earlier you'll completely recover

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.010 
little earlier you'll completely recover
before<00:02:01.189> you<00:02:01.640> land<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.240> then<00:02:02.720> you'll<00:02:02.840> be<00:02:02.899> able

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
before you land and then you'll be able

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.719 
before you land and then you'll be able
to<00:02:03.200> attack<00:02:03.470> or<00:02:03.740> move<00:02:03.890> right<00:02:04.340> when<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:04.549> touch

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
to attack or move right when you touch

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.199 
to attack or move right when you touch
the<00:02:04.909> ground<00:02:06.580> here's<00:02:07.580> what<00:02:07.759> happens<00:02:08.090> if

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
the ground here's what happens if

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.330 
the ground here's what happens if
Charizard<00:02:08.660> does<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.959> attack<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.380> bad<00:02:09.590> way<00:02:09.890> so

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
Charizard does the attack the bad way so

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.009 
Charizard does the attack the bad way so
that<00:02:10.399> he<00:02:10.519> has<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.819> recover<00:02:11.090> at<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.450> end<00:02:11.569> the

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
that he has to recover at the end the

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.440 
that he has to recover at the end the
opponent<00:02:12.380> can<00:02:12.470> hit<00:02:12.560> him<00:02:12.650> back<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.330> here's<00:02:14.330> how

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
opponent can hit him back and here's how

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.030 
opponent can hit him back and here's how
it<00:02:14.569> looks<00:02:14.599> when<00:02:14.930> he<00:02:15.019> does<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> attack<00:02:15.530> earlier

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
it looks when he does the attack earlier

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.890 
it looks when he does the attack earlier
so<00:02:16.310> it's<00:02:16.550> done<00:02:16.849> by<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.090> time<00:02:17.180> he<00:02:17.420> lands<00:02:17.810> and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
so it's done by the time he lands and

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.370 
so it's done by the time he lands and
you<00:02:17.959> can<00:02:18.080> attack<00:02:18.349> again<00:02:18.380> instantly

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
you can attack again instantly

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.720 
you can attack again instantly
ganondorf's<00:02:21.380> down<00:02:21.680> plus<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.400> air<00:02:22.549> is

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
ganondorf's down plus a in the air is

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.670 
ganondorf's down plus a in the air is
another<00:02:23.000> good<00:02:23.150> example<00:02:23.269> of<00:02:23.630> this<00:02:23.810> look<00:02:24.560> how

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
another good example of this look how

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.289 
another good example of this look how
much<00:02:24.830> recovery<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.459> move<00:02:25.610> has<00:02:25.819> at<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.180> end

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
much recovery the move has at the end

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.300 
much recovery the move has at the end
when<00:02:26.420> he<00:02:26.510> lands<00:02:26.930> but<00:02:27.680> if<00:02:27.769> you<00:02:27.830> do<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.040> attack

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
when he lands but if you do the attack

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.250 
when he lands but if you do the attack
earlier<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.940> finish<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.209> just<00:02:29.720> before<00:02:30.019> he

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
earlier and finish it just before he

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.740 
earlier and finish it just before he
lands<00:02:30.500> he's<00:02:31.069> free<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.400> move<00:02:31.700> her<00:02:31.850> attack<00:02:32.180> right

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
lands he's free to move her attack right

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.020 
lands he's free to move her attack right
when<00:02:32.900> he<00:02:32.959> touches<00:02:33.170> down<00:02:33.519> it's<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:34.670> difference

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
when he touches down it's the difference

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.759 
when he touches down it's the difference
between<00:02:35.090> being<00:02:35.569> hit<00:02:35.840> back<00:02:36.080> every<00:02:36.410> time<00:02:36.560> when

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
between being hit back every time when

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.930 
between being hit back every time when
it's<00:02:36.890> blocked<00:02:37.480> you're<00:02:38.480> being<00:02:38.630> safe
