00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.520
 the origin of this project I asked myself 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.119
 the question 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.160
 a simple question actually why is 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:31.850
 what in alfonso in cosi fan tutte 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.350
 and the bitter man a sad he is there 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.090
 characters that have been known for 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.760
 centuries that we have heard this challenge 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.660
 and I wanted to find a way to 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.660
 answer this question 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 1 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.870
 at 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.880
 I asked nicolas bacri a big 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.950
 composer I already knew 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.250
 to write a music that could be 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.570
 become a kind of prelude a kind 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.450
 of contemporary daydreaming about 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.180
 questions asked by this story very 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.140
 enigmatic and who better asked 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.080
 to write about what this opera is 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.840
 deliver that to eric emmanuel schmitt a 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.119
 great writer someone who has a lot 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.300
 of thanks and a lot of music in his 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.979
 texts already and who is great lover of 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.070
 mozart of all that even with herbs 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.289
 scope is still a big amateur is 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.619
 great that someone who respects 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:52.250
 much the language of the organ sotap in 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.780
 August is of course the book and east with 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.780
 which mozart to work 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.880
 so how to put an opera like this 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.350
 implemented in motion then we are 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.950
 come to saint quentin en yvelines where 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.320
 we are 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.460
 happily in residence since a very 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.240
 a long time and we decided to create it here 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.240
 with young singers 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.790
 and also with very young people very 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.860
 school kids to young people with 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.510
 which one works regularly 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.100
 that means for eight years of 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.250
 residence here in this theater we have 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.160
 worked with young students to 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.290
 schools around saint quentin 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.290
 this time we chose two schools to 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.700
 traps and there are young people who 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.280
 all have their energy to is where their ass 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.140
 or on stage and for months and 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.870
 month they worked this partition 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.330
 that was written for them so that they 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.680
 can the yard on two stages 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.680
 the scene with us at saint quentin 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.890
 Oh 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.630
 no 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.569
 for children it's a 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.840
 great experience 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.819
 the opening on the beautiful and the aesthetic 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.199
 it's unexpected for them and it makes them 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.720
 discover a world they do not know 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.400
 not necessarily 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.229
 mandela said it's impossible until 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.840
 when it becomes possible when we 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.560
 the fact and it's a very true word 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.560
 for these children there 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.540
 who knows 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.229
 it's an adventure that gives off a lot 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.300
 for month staff for me this is a 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.610
 from the most beautiful moments music to musical 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.039
 I have never lived in my life 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.220
 because at the same time that I respond to 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.590
 a musical desire game meets all 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.050
 aspects of the photo ie the 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.780
 young talents this time between 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.879
 ages 18 and 26 years old to work 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.310
 with school children to show them the 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:11.180
 beauty and the need to do the 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.360
 music is also while that with 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.349
 the period instruments that have a 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.050
 comprehension 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:20.560
 to pau how to play toys with 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.560
 the singers 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:47.010
 we all got together at once 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.830
 to do something staged 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.420
 by jean yves ruf who is a big 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.400
 colleagues someone that it's 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.250
 so well worked with the 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:00.320
 artists the singers and also the very 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:03.360
 very young so we have a project that is 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.250
 generous this is a project where all the 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.410
 world does it together 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.270
 and the result is really a project 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.810
 of love and that's the opera it's a 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.810
 love project 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.530
 no 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.870
 we 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.940
 no
