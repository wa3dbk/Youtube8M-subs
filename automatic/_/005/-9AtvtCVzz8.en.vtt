Cadillacs<00:00:00.750> have<00:00:00.900> always<00:00:01.140> been<00:00:01.380> about

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
Cadillacs have always been about

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.190 
Cadillacs have always been about
innovation<00:00:02.550> and<00:00:02.790> bringing<00:00:03.419> enhancements<00:00:04.080> to

innovation and bringing enhancements to
the<00:00:04.290> driving<00:00:04.680> experience<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:05.370> we<00:00:06.089> see<00:00:06.420> the

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
the driving experience and we see the

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.509 
the driving experience and we see the
semi<00:00:07.379> autonomous<00:00:07.649> vehicle<00:00:08.340> or<00:00:08.490> the

in<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:10.950> evolution<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:12.000> system<00:00:12.330> works<00:00:12.630> by

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
in that evolution the system works by

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.170 
in that evolution the system works by
using<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.920> fusion<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.759> sensors<00:00:15.540> GPS<00:00:16.410> radar

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
using a fusion of sensors GPS radar

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.560 
using a fusion of sensors GPS radar
cameras<00:00:18.180> all<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.350> combined<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.220> give<00:00:20.520> a

2013 Cadillac XTS and the Cadillac ATS

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.750 
2013 Cadillac XTS and the Cadillac ATS
already<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.710> technology<00:00:38.399> that's<00:00:38.610> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
already have technology that's a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.000 
already have technology that's a
precursor<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.140> kinds<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.500> systems<00:00:40.710> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
precursor to the kinds of systems that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.459 
precursor to the kinds of systems that
we're<00:00:41.190> talking<00:00:41.309> about<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:42.000> instance<00:00:42.469> systems

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
we're talking about for instance systems

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.069 
we're talking about for instance systems
like<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.100> virtual<00:00:44.670> front<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.180> rear<00:00:45.600> bumpers

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
like the virtual front in rear bumpers

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.990 
like the virtual front in rear bumpers
that<00:00:46.379> will<00:00:46.530> bring<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> vehicle<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.399> stop<00:00:47.760> in

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that will bring the vehicle to a stop in

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.180 
that will bring the vehicle to a stop in
the<00:00:48.059> event<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.510> an<00:00:48.840> impending<00:00:49.469> collision<00:00:49.890> at

low speeds obviously full range adaptive
cruise<00:00:53.760> control<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.750> only<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.140> ability

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
complete stop and then the vehicle

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.060 
complete stop and then the vehicle
reaccelerating<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.870> within<00:01:01.109> stop<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.010> go

reaccelerating in within stop and go
traffic<00:01:02.129> situations<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.629> are<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:03.960> about

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
traffic situations we are not about

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.710 
traffic situations we are not about
taking<00:01:04.530> control<00:01:05.010> away<00:01:05.369> from<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.060> driver<00:01:06.180> we

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
taking control away from the driver we

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.359 
taking control away from the driver we
always<00:01:06.960> want<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> driver<00:01:07.500> engaged<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
always want the driver engaged and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.490 
always want the driver engaged and
involved<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> experience<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.320> want

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
involved with the experience but we want

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.200 
involved with the experience but we want
to<00:01:10.650> enhance<00:01:11.040> their<00:01:11.369> ability<00:01:11.729> when<00:01:12.000> they're<00:01:12.119> in

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
to enhance their ability when they're in

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.170 
to enhance their ability when they're in
those<00:01:12.360> situations<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.200> show<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:14.880> call

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.530 

which<00:01:18.180> combines<00:01:19.130> adaptive<00:01:20.130> cruise<00:01:20.340> control

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
which combines adaptive cruise control

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.539 
which combines adaptive cruise control
and<00:01:21.540> Lane<00:01:22.020> centric<00:01:22.560> adaptive<00:01:23.280> cruise<00:01:23.490> control

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
and Lane centric adaptive cruise control

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.550 
and Lane centric adaptive cruise control
is<00:01:24.180> something<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.990> conventional<00:01:25.710> cruise

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
is something like conventional cruise

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.889 
is something like conventional cruise
except<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:27.460> uses<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.790> sensor<00:01:28.149> that<00:01:28.329> detects

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
except it uses a sensor that detects

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.859 
except it uses a sensor that detects
vehicles<00:01:29.470> ahead<00:01:30.100> of<00:01:30.220> you<00:01:30.399> yeah<00:01:31.210> if<00:01:31.689> they're

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
vehicles ahead of you yeah if they're

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.270 
vehicles ahead of you yeah if they're
going<00:01:32.110> slower<00:01:32.350> than<00:01:32.470> your<00:01:32.680> set<00:01:32.890> speed<00:01:33.130> it'll

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
going slower than your set speed it'll

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.960 
going slower than your set speed it'll
slow<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.579> down<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:34.180> pace<00:01:34.750> that<00:01:35.170> they<00:01:35.789> the<00:01:36.789> lane

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
slow you down to pace that they the lane

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.370 
slow you down to pace that they the lane
centering<00:01:37.509> function<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.909> it<00:01:40.210> implies<00:01:40.539> when

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
centering function as it implies when

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.240 
centering function as it implies when
it's<00:01:41.530> engaged<00:01:41.920> will<00:01:42.250> follow<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.880> single<00:01:43.810> lane

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
it's engaged will follow a single lane

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.730 
it's engaged will follow a single lane
is<00:01:45.250> designed<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.850> work<00:01:45.970> on<00:01:46.149> freeways<00:01:46.630> so<00:01:47.350> when

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
is designed to work on freeways so when

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.980 
is designed to work on freeways so when
you<00:01:47.830> have<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.130> two<00:01:48.280> together<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:49.149> have<00:01:49.390> the

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
you have the two together you have the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.080 
you have the two together you have the
opportunity<00:01:50.560> for<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.860> system<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.310> entire<00:01:51.909> to

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
opportunity for the system the entire to

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.300 
opportunity for the system the entire to
basically<00:01:52.509> drive<00:01:52.750> itself<00:01:53.079> for<00:01:53.380> substantial

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
basically drive itself for substantial

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.760 
basically drive itself for substantial
periods<00:01:54.610> of<00:01:54.670> time<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.420> car<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.960> doing<00:01:56.380> its<00:01:56.619> own

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
periods of time the car is doing its own

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.300 
periods of time the car is doing its own
steering<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.549> its<00:01:57.850> own<00:01:58.000> braking<00:01:58.539> to<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.560> stop<00:01:59.979> a

steering and its own braking to a stop a

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.780 
steering and its own braking to a stop a
reasonable<00:02:01.060> distance<00:02:01.209> behind
