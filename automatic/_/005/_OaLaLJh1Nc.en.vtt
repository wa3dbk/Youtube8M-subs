smooth glossy wheel is something I

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
really enjoy it's one of the fundamental

really enjoy it's one of the fundamental
pieces<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:19.199> these<00:00:19.500> bug<00:00:19.770> eyes<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> really

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
pieces of these bug eyes that I really

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.099 
pieces of these bug eyes that I really
think<00:00:20.850> needs<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.210> be<00:00:21.330> preserved<00:00:21.689> and

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
think needs to be preserved and

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.140 
think needs to be preserved and
protected<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.949> on<00:00:23.100> Phoenix<00:00:23.550> we've<00:00:23.730> done<00:00:23.939> that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
protected so on Phoenix we've done that

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.910 
protected so on Phoenix we've done that

this great car in a minute I just wanted
to<00:00:27.689> show<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.320> little<00:00:29.039> bit<00:00:29.189> more<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.730> Phoenix

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
to show you a little bit more of Phoenix

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.630 
to show you a little bit more of Phoenix
it's<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.689> my<00:00:30.779> favorites<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:31.769> things

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it's one of my favorites we have things

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.600 
it's one of my favorites we have things
like<00:00:32.790> these<00:00:33.059> mirrors<00:00:33.540> mounted<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
like these mirrors mounted on the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.549 
like these mirrors mounted on the
windshield<00:00:35.610> posts<00:00:36.120> which<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.200> think<00:00:37.469> are

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
windshield posts which I think are

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.160 
windshield posts which I think are
really<00:00:37.829> it's<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.520> nice<00:00:38.670> way<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> avoid<00:00:39.750> drilling

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
really it's a nice way to avoid drilling

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.600 
really it's a nice way to avoid drilling
holes<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> car<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.100> they<00:00:41.219> work<00:00:41.399> really

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
holes in the car and they work really

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.840 
holes in the car and they work really
well<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.239> also<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> little<00:00:42.690> wider<00:00:43.850> rear

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
well this is also a little wider rear

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.310 
well this is also a little wider rear
view<00:00:45.149> mirror<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.870> makes<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.200> big

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
view mirror and it makes a big

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.020 
view mirror and it makes a big
difference<00:00:46.379> actually<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.370> normal<00:00:47.760> bugeye

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
difference actually the normal bugeye

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.479 
difference actually the normal bugeye
mirrors<00:00:48.390> about<00:00:48.860> seventy<00:00:49.860> percent<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
mirrors about seventy percent of the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.310 
mirrors about seventy percent of the
size<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.030> maybe<00:00:51.300> two-thirds<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
size of this maybe two-thirds of the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.680 
size of this maybe two-thirds of the
size<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.070> your<00:00:53.789> visibility<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.539> that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
size of it and your visibility in that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.910 
size of it and your visibility in that
mirror<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.050> much<00:00:55.260> better<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:55.800> you're

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
mirror is much better and if you're

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.130 
mirror is much better and if you're
going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> drive<00:00:56.370> these<00:00:56.610> cars<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.329> think<00:00:57.989> these

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
going to drive these cars I think these

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.349 
going to drive these cars I think these
issues<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:59.219> help<00:00:59.520> especially<00:00:59.940> if<00:01:00.210> you're

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
issues really help especially if you're

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.479 
issues really help especially if you're
in<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> place<00:01:00.750> where<00:01:00.960> there's<00:01:01.140> traffic<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.949> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
in a place where there's traffic and of

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.100 
in a place where there's traffic and of
course<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.000> love<00:01:03.180> these<00:01:03.329> red<00:01:03.660> stripes
