00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.740
 hello to you today I offer you 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.509
 braid such a beautiful braid 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.380
 it is much easier than it may seem 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:21.089
 at first glance when it comes to 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.669
 konce then with my own hair 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.619
 especially not overclocking so to start 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.730
 transform them with invoices 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.849
 strands on hairpins 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.859
 blender brands two shades blonde 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.520
 fixed alternately will create 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.440
 spectacular and highlight pretty hours 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.780
 in the hair so that they are not confused 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.450
 take a strand of hair and weave a thin 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.630
 pigtail the most common of the three 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.630
 strands 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:58.800
 the end of the knit gum then do 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.350
 the same operation with another strand of hair 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.280
 I advise you to experiment 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.949
 thick of these braids 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.050
 making them thinner or thicker you 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.500
 get another kind of this braid 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.030
 using the same weaving technique 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.640
 then split the remaining hair 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.350
 into 3 equal parts and place the pigtails 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.780
 between 1 and 2 strands 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.270
 now re-numbered in our strands and 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.350
 braids and braided left their spit 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.600
 of 5 strands 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.180
 pigtails in it are also considered strands 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:34.440
 take the fifth strand and transfer it under 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:36.750
 fourth to third and under second now 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.220
 take the first strand and transfer it under 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:46.680
 second to third 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.600
 and under the fourth if you notice with 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.270
 on each side we repeat the symmetrical 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.290
 procedure we transfer the fifth strand under 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.610
 the nearest 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.710
 on the next and under the next then we 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.690
 take the first strand and do the same 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.480
 the very opposite direction 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.429
 transferring this strand under the nearest to 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.350
 neighboring and under the next to not 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.510
 confused I advise you at first 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.850
 speak out loud keywords 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.800
 every time we take the outer strand and 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.550
 the first word sub always refers to 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.890
 strands of hair 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.709
 and the following on ipod are already 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.510
 pigtail and the farther you fly by 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.510
 the easier it becomes to weave 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:37.010
 so once again is extremely and the strand goes here 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.650
 above and below 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.780
 under above and under 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.060
 you can also replace pigtails 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.010
 ordinary thin strands of hair or 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.010
 then the ribbon will turn out perfectly 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.800
 another braid before tying the ends 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.250
 spit can and stretch it a little for 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.530
 this gently pull the strands on the sides 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.970
 after that our hair is ready to wait
