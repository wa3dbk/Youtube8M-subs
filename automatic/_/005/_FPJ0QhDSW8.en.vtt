 urania astronomy newsletter e 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:12.570
 astronautics well found by luca 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.089
 noble and elena lazzaretto also the moon 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.710
 to its atmosphere and what has been confirmed 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.630
 in recent years thanks to development 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.310
 more and more analysis tools 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.960
 precise but careful 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.300
 the atmosphere at the sea has nothing to it 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.039
 see with the earthly one for 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.050
 starting is so rarefied by 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.000
 be almost imperceptible more or less 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.099
 as is our 500 atmosphere 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 kilometers of height where it orbits the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.000
 international space station 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.280
 the latest results tell us that 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.080
 the lunar atmosphere is mostly given by 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.210
 microscopic amounts of helium atoms 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.240
 methane sodium and potassium 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.600
 these atoms fluctuate very freely 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.489
 near the ground where they come from 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.650
 at the moment they are under different study 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.840
 possibilities can be atoms 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.730
 torn off the lunar surface ad 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.760
 example from the energy of sunlight 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.440
 or from the impact with micro meteorites but 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.600
 they can also be what remains of 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.540
 weak spills of gas present in the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.550
 underground a cause does not exclude the other 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.869
 and it should not be forgotten that the presence of 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.210
 an imperceptible atmosphere 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.820
 surface was also detected on 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.250
 mercury and at this point it could 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.210
 also exist on other objects 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.009
 as unexpected as in the case of 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.009
 large asteroids 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.899
 long and now even short explosions 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.759
 ultra long 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.320
 it is gamma ray burst 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.450
 more intense energy emissions 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.340
 of the universe to give an idea a 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.200
 single lightning range can release into 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.360
 a few seconds the same energy as the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.819
 his goals throughout his existence in 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.740
 10 billion years 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.810
 short gamma explosions last less than 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.460
 two seconds occur when two stars 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.860
 super compact neutron stars 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.960
 the explosions melt together 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.149
 so-called long ones last more than two 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.159
 seconds and are produced by the super 9s 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.049
 at times when the nucleus degenerates into 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.720
 a black hole and draws upon itself what 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:13.880
 remains of the star starting from 2010 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.250
 however, three gamma-ray bursts were detected 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.000
 longer than one of the duration of 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.459
 seven hours 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.640
 What causes of the team led by 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.900
 andrew levan of warwick university 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.000
 england still calls into question the 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.560
 supernovae, however, those produced by stars 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.680
 much more massive and compared to 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.750
 the super blue giant being standard 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.790
 over a thousand times bigger than the sun 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.680
 the outer layers need to 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.389
 more time to fall towards the center 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.459
 this could be an explanation 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.889
 but there are also other hypotheses 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.930
 the current range of lightning hunters 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:47.060
 swift satellite example are not 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.400
 calibrated on ultra long explosions 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.690
 targeted observations in the future there 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.690
 help you learn more 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.980
 the kepler telescope has discovered five 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.909
 planets around a star 1,200 years 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.980
 light from the sun 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.870
 two of them remain particular 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.940
 interest since they could be 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.500
 in the list of potentially habitable 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.180
 they are called cutler 62 and cutler 62 fe 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.700
 the dimensions exceed those of the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.569
 land respectively of 60 and 40 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.299
 percent 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.250
 in other words two super lands but 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.000
 one must be cautious in comparing them to the 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.010
 our planet 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.810
 an accurate estimate of the mass is not 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.790
 possible and knowing only of 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.010
 dimensions cannot be said with certainty 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.799
 what they could be made of 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.299
 the dimensions are rocky but also liquid 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.129
 reduced are a plus 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.480
 together with another important fact is 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.970
 that of being at the right distance 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.099
 from his star but when the 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.230
 distance is right when the water in 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.909
 surface and non-icing evaporates but 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.890
 this depends on many factors including 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.720
 also the type of atmosphere of which one 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.780
 planet is always equipped with that atmosphere 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.659
 there is beyond the general list more than 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.730
 850 extrasolar planets discovered to date 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.859
 the important fact is that these two 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.780
 new worlds go on to lengthen the below 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.209
 list of special observatories for the 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.160
 search for other lands and with that it is 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.220
 all from the editors of urania a 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.450

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.489
 urania will meet you next time 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.079
 edition and reminds you that you can
