00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
Note 2 variants so probably probably

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.459 
Note 2 variants so probably probably
that<00:01:55.490> that<00:01:55.819> will<00:01:56.030> be<00:01:56.209> good<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:57.140> I<00:01:57.890> am<00:01:58.340> running

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
that that will be good so I am running

the<00:02:11.870> n7t<00:02:12.410> 100<00:02:13.010> has<00:02:13.160> been<00:02:13.340> out<00:02:13.459> for<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.730> while<00:02:13.940> but

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
the n7t 100 has been out for a while but

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.630 
the n7t 100 has been out for a while but
that's<00:02:14.900> just<00:02:15.140> for<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.380> 3G<00:02:15.709> version<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.459> note

that's just for the 3G version of a note

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.810 
that's just for the 3G version of a note
2<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.840> we<00:02:18.829> couldn't<00:02:19.040> do<00:02:19.190> anything<00:02:19.430> with<00:02:19.790> that

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
2 so we couldn't do anything with that

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.270

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
they've kind of changed that to the way

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.620 
they've kind of changed that to the way
it's<00:05:13.220> supposed<00:05:13.550> to<00:05:13.640> be<00:05:13.789> so<00:05:13.970> that<00:05:14.150> that<00:05:14.419> is

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630

that's<00:05:15.110> white<00:05:15.470> now<00:05:15.710> and<00:05:15.979> 4.4<00:05:16.610> TouchWiz

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.060 

so<00:05:22.250> as<00:05:22.760> I<00:05:23.120> as<00:05:23.480> I<00:05:23.810> went<00:05:23.990> into<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.320> settings<00:05:24.740> and

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
so as I as I went into the settings and

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.810 
so as I as I went into the settings and
compared<00:05:25.820> between<00:05:26.150> my<00:05:26.270> 4.3<00:05:26.990> and<00:05:27.260> this<00:05:28.100> 4.4<00:05:28.790> and

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
compared between my 4.3 and this 4.4 and

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.710 
compared between my 4.3 and this 4.4 and
compare<00:05:29.690> all<00:05:29.840> these<00:05:29.960> different<00:05:31.030> settings<00:05:32.030> all

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720

the<00:05:32.900> menus<00:05:33.230> here<00:05:33.440> I<00:05:33.710> just<00:05:34.160> I<00:05:34.610> couldn't<00:05:34.910> find

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
the menus here I just I couldn't find

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.310 
the menus here I just I couldn't find
hardly<00:05:35.390> any<00:05:35.540> differences<00:05:36.050> so<00:05:36.170> there's

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
hardly any differences so there's

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.130 
hardly any differences so there's
nothing<00:05:36.740> really<00:05:36.950> new<00:05:37.070> going<00:05:37.550> on<00:05:37.670> there

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.930 

overall<00:05:42.140> it's<00:05:42.470> it's<00:05:42.920> a<00:05:43.040> smoother<00:05:43.700> experience

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
overall it's it's a smoother experience

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.990

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
smoothly seems to be running great so

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.400 
smoothly seems to be running great so
one<00:06:16.460> other<00:06:16.580> difference<00:06:17.030> is<00:06:17.300> this<00:06:18.230> if<00:06:18.380> you

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
one other difference is this if you

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.470 
one other difference is this if you
print<00:06:18.710> long<00:06:18.830> press<00:06:19.100> the<00:06:19.130> the<00:06:19.820> power<00:06:20.090> but<00:06:20.330> just

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
print long press the the power but just

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.210 
print long press the the power but just
like<00:06:20.570> you're<00:06:20.690> trying<00:06:20.780> to<00:06:20.930> power<00:06:21.110> it<00:06:21.200> off<00:06:21.320> and<00:06:22.130> I

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
like you're trying to power it off and I

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.380 
like you're trying to power it off and I
don't<00:06:22.280> know<00:06:22.430> if<00:06:22.550> this<00:06:22.700> is<00:06:22.850> just<00:06:22.880> because<00:06:23.240> this

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
don't know if this is just because this

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.320 
don't know if this is just because this
is<00:06:23.510> part<00:06:23.720> of<00:06:23.750> the<00:06:23.840> International<00:06:24.880> menu<00:06:25.880> system

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
is part of the International menu system

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.840 
is part of the International menu system
for<00:06:27.230> the<00:06:27.290> note<00:06:27.470> 2<00:06:27.680> but<00:06:28.190> it<00:06:28.280> has<00:06:28.460> this<00:06:28.610> data

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850 
for the note 2 but it has this data

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.580 
for the note 2 but it has this data
network<00:06:29.330> mode<00:06:29.570> where<00:06:29.720> you<00:06:29.840> can<00:06:29.990> disable<00:06:30.380> it

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
network mode where you can disable it

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.240 
network mode where you can disable it
very<00:06:30.920> quickly<00:06:31.310> like<00:06:31.550> that<00:06:31.610> and<00:06:33.250> that's

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
very quickly like that and that's

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
very quickly like that and that's
definitely<00:06:34.460> gonna<00:06:34.730> be<00:06:34.790> something<00:06:35.060> that<00:06:35.090> my

and all that to accomplish the same
thing<00:06:54.200> but<00:06:54.730> pretty<00:06:55.730> handy<00:06:56.030> for<00:06:56.060> it<00:06:56.270> to<00:06:56.390> be

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
thing but pretty handy for it to be

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.100 
thing but pretty handy for it to be
right<00:06:56.660> there

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110
