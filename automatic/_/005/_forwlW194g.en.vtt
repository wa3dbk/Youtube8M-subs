00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
game right now because there's not

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.149 
game right now because there's not
really<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.460> lot<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:48.649> redeemable<00:01:49.649> about<00:01:49.890> it

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
really a lot that's redeemable about it

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.020 
really a lot that's redeemable about it
in<00:01:50.280> terms<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:51.619> combat<00:01:52.619> well<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.729> terms<00:01:53.820> of

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
in terms of combat well not in terms of

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.080 
in terms of combat well not in terms of
combat<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.990> game<00:01:55.229> modes<00:01:55.850> all<00:01:56.850> that

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
combat but like the game modes all that

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.910 
combat but like the game modes all that
all<00:01:57.479> there<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.869> team<00:01:58.049> deathmatch<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.649> it's

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
all there is is team deathmatch and it's

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.420 
all there is is team deathmatch and it's
uh<00:01:59.149> it's<00:02:00.149> kind<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.540> terrible<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.799> guess<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
uh it's kind of terrible I guess is the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.130 
uh it's kind of terrible I guess is the
word<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.000> unless<00:02:03.540> you're<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> server

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
word for it unless you're on a server

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.350 
word for it unless you're on a server
like<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.680> cuz<00:02:05.070> I'm<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> non-official

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
like this cuz I'm on a non-official

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.999 
like this cuz I'm on a non-official
server<00:02:06.719> where<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.350> player<00:02:07.590> count<00:02:07.890> is

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
server where the player count is

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.790 
server where the player count is
increased<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.629> chaos<00:02:10.080> look<00:02:10.679> at

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
increased so it's just chaos look at

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.820 
increased so it's just chaos look at
that<00:02:11.009> random<00:02:11.910> lag<00:02:12.480> what<00:02:13.080> was<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.379> I<00:02:13.440> don't

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
that random lag what was that I don't

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.080 
that random lag what was that I don't
understand<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:14.310> almost<00:02:14.490> fell<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.910> water

oh<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.830> think<00:02:53.190> but<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:53.520> not<00:02:53.630> something<00:02:54.630> that's

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
oh I think but it's not something that's

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.900 
oh I think but it's not something that's
a<00:02:55.080> staple<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.709> servers<00:02:56.100> like<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.490> replaces

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
a staple and servers like it replaces

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.550 
a staple and servers like it replaces
the<00:02:57.090> t-rex<00:02:57.600> from<00:02:57.810> time<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.230> time<00:02:58.260> for

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
the t-rex from time to time for

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.930 
the t-rex from time to time for
something<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.160> think<00:02:59.220> it's<00:02:59.459> only<00:02:59.580> on<00:02:59.820> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
something and I think it's only on the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.660 
something and I think it's only on the
official<00:03:00.360> servers<00:03:00.750> if<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.470> remember<00:03:02.370> correctly

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
official servers if I remember correctly

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.180 
official servers if I remember correctly
from<00:03:02.850> like<00:03:03.090> people<00:03:03.330> saying<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.720> in<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.840> chat<00:03:04.190> I

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
from like people saying it in the chat I

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.150 
from like people saying it in the chat I
saw<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.900> video<00:03:06.900> for<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.260> animations<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.950> that

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.699 
saw the video for the animations of that
and<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:09.360> looked<00:03:09.600> pretty<00:03:09.870> interesting<00:03:10.530> it's

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709

pretty<00:03:10.980> much<00:03:11.100> as<00:03:11.250> big<00:03:11.430> as<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.670> t-rex<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.300> it

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
pretty much as big as the t-rex and it

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.180 
pretty much as big as the t-rex and it

lines<00:03:25.019> while<00:03:25.800> he's<00:03:26.190> pretty<00:03:27.000> much<00:03:27.120> in<00:03:27.390> the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
lines while he's pretty much in the

doing<00:04:09.810> this<00:04:09.930> video<00:04:10.290> that's<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.650> question<00:04:11.010> I

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
doing this video that's the question I

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.009 
doing this video that's the question I
guess<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.549> was<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.970> was<00:04:12.390> like<00:04:12.540> in<00:04:12.690> my<00:04:12.810> head

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
guess I was I was like in my head

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.530 
guess I was I was like in my head
thinking<00:04:13.290> maybe<00:04:14.250> if<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.549> do<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.700> video<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.150> can

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
thinking maybe if you do a video you can

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.140 
thinking maybe if you do a video you can
get<00:04:15.780> people<00:04:16.049> interested<00:04:16.680> in<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.519> game<00:04:17.729> and

get people interested in the game and
get<00:04:18.390> them<00:04:18.630> playing<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.169> so<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.590> have<00:04:19.979> more<00:04:20.280> of

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
get them playing it so you have more of

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.170 
get them playing it so you have more of
of<00:04:22.140> a<00:04:22.320> selection<00:04:22.680> when<00:04:22.979> it<00:04:23.100> comes<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.580> servers

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
of a selection when it comes to servers

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.120 
of a selection when it comes to servers
so<00:04:24.450> you're<00:04:24.630> not<00:04:24.810> playing<00:04:25.080> on<00:04:25.229> laggy<00:04:25.530> bullshit

we'll<00:05:28.080> see<00:05:28.260> what<00:05:28.410> happens<00:05:28.830> whenever<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.460> game

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
we'll see what happens whenever the game

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.030 
we'll see what happens whenever the game
update<00:05:30.210> comes<00:05:30.480> out<00:05:30.660> and<00:05:30.930> there's<00:05:31.740> a<00:05:31.830> new

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
update comes out and there's a new

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.800 
update comes out and there's a new
game-mode<00:05:32.310> I<00:05:32.670> don't<00:05:32.850> know<00:05:33.000> anything<00:05:33.240> about<00:05:33.600> it

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
game-mode I don't know anything about it

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.690 
game-mode I don't know anything about it
but<00:05:33.930> hopefully<00:05:34.320> its<00:05:34.470> objective<00:05:34.980> based<00:05:35.220> and<00:05:35.550> it

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
but hopefully its objective based and it

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.950 
but hopefully its objective based and it
keeps<00:05:36.110> the<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:38.210> terrible<00:05:39.210> bullshit<00:05:39.660> of<00:05:39.780> team

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
keeps the the terrible bullshit of team

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.500 
keeps the the terrible bullshit of team
deathmatch<00:05:40.260> being<00:05:40.890> the<00:05:41.130> humans<00:05:41.580> just<00:05:41.880> camping

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
deathmatch being the humans just camping

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.500 
deathmatch being the humans just camping

the the health boxes and the ammo boxes

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.210

just<00:05:46.110> keeps<00:05:46.350> that<00:05:46.530> from<00:05:46.590> happening<00:05:47.100> because

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
just keeps that from happening because

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.160 
just keeps that from happening because
they<00:05:47.490> actually<00:05:47.640> have<00:05:47.970> to<00:05:48.150> do<00:05:48.450> something<00:05:48.930> I

they actually have to do something I

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.200 
they actually have to do something I
don't<00:05:49.890> know<00:05:50.160> maybe<00:05:50.340> if<00:05:50.490> somebody<00:05:50.670> has<00:05:50.940> any

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
don't know maybe if somebody has any

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.420 
don't know maybe if somebody has any
idea<00:05:51.630> of<00:05:51.750> what<00:05:51.930> the<00:05:52.020> new<00:05:52.200> mode<00:05:52.890> is<00:05:53.070> they<00:05:53.250> can

I'm<00:06:44.470> not<00:06:44.590> sure<00:06:44.770> if<00:06:44.890> you<00:06:44.980> feel<00:06:45.130> that<00:06:45.310> it's<00:06:45.430> worth

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
I'm not sure if you feel that it's worth

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.310 
I'm not sure if you feel that it's worth
it

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
it

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.050 
it
if<00:06:47.830> I<00:06:48.340> had<00:06:48.550> to<00:06:48.670> say<00:06:48.880> so<00:06:48.940> I<00:06:49.480> don't<00:06:49.960> know<00:06:50.140> either<00:06:50.410> I

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
if I had to say so I don't know either I

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.110 
if I had to say so I don't know either I
paid<00:06:52.060> $15<00:06:52.690> for<00:06:52.870> it<00:06:52.960> when<00:06:53.080> it<00:06:53.110> was<00:06:53.260> in<00:06:53.380> beta<00:06:53.560> and

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
paid $15 for it when it was in beta and

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.020 
paid $15 for it when it was in beta and
so<00:06:55.120> I<00:06:55.150> could<00:06:55.390> get<00:06:55.510> beta<00:06:55.720> access<00:06:56.260> and<00:06:56.830> I<00:06:57.280> guess

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030 
so I could get beta access and I guess

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.850 
so I could get beta access and I guess
