00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.580
 so a long time ago I've been 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.700
 seeing a change of look and now finally 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.750
 they are ready to see it 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.300
 so so 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.119
 although I am it is his people but only if 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.640
 demonstrate today I went to the hairdresser and I passed 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.560
 five hours in the hairdresser and then in 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.260
 five hours really I do not know why I had 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.660
 wait a while 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.930
 I did keratin for the sector but 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.100
 yes super smooth and I decided to make some 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.800
 wicks 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.050
 I wanted to make some wicks 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.200
 Californian women who are type man but 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.720
 that coward and I'm already talking like 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.190
 that if you knew my life if they have 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.920
 been for a while but before they know more 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.920
 as far as I because things 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.880
 I'm looking in the camera and it does not look 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.230
 both but I have never painted and 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.030
 navideas hear me then once 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.270
 paint a piece of purple but you know that 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.940
 I feel an account and I if those characters are 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.440
 make wicks and coordinated side cuts 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.350
 saw that I always technique today so super 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.560
 traditional and I do not know what you want to do to me 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.970
 as a change of look but of a change 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.060
 of look without domain and change of look 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.320
 then I talked to the hairdresser and good 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.210
 if you are and make me these wicks 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.910
 and I do not know what and had talked to a 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.890
 hairdresser as celebrity and in fact I'm going 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.380
 to do the wicks with him but his 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.790
 assistant as I do not know was difficult leader 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.290
 it was not difficult to deal with them but 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.820
 It was just like you very insistent with the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.369
 day I was going to go to the appointment and I do not know that 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.130
 this was this happens like three weeks and 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.590
 I do not know what day I wanted him to 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.009
 I said this week that I was going to go and I did not 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.690
 I know I'm not sure because I did not know why 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.460
 the classes and I do not know what but good 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.840
 ends up making me the hoyas and super 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.350
 improvised and that you can do it to me and 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.440
 already if I can be and she tells me she's going 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.570
 to be a test on a piece of hair 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.120
 I told him he has left us all but he 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.620
 I asked him to do something to me that was 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.700
 Natural that does not give me red hair 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:07.430
 and almost will not be noticed then this was the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.470
 result and they are like little tables 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.250
 he grabbed me bits of hair and put him 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.230
 pieces of aluminum foil dye not 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.930
 we decorate and nothing simply dye 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.820
 I know how dye turned yellow on 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.380
 hair with dye I'm not I think it's 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.110
 because he has not painted it for me before 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.530
 but it goes well as highlights good 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.010
 but it is as if it were the sun 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.690
 that the clear thing is the kisses but it is 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.550
 super happy and I was very excited 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.530
 for showing them because I am is 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.290
 unpredictability several techniques and their change 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.070
 of short look, what clothes do you something and I 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.480
 he said adjusting me before it was too 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.090
 adventurous with my hair simply 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.680
 cuts that is and here super short 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.760
 super crazy but fourth speak of patras 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.129
 gre 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.599
 I mean, I think after the 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:59.090
 experience does not deserve more but aside from me 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:03.090
 I think I do not like more traditional 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.860
 then but I wanted to show you and it was 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.030
 so we are going to thank you 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.030
 must stop it takes me 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:19.260
 Oh, my God , that's close, and there's a lot 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.260
 so much but in the videos 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.210
 in the videos you will not notice because it 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.160
 we give this part of the head is 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.370
 that if you do not see this and apart when 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.900
 go take my keratin 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.640
 to cut the ends because that's the way 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.870
 tips are half dead 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.050
 Well he gave me is that yes very dead and not 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.430
 they have to do that to me and the keratin I 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.810
 I 've talked to you before keratin is 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.640
 a treatment to hydrate the hair 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.230
 and it 's super good we go to the link where 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.490
 I'm talking about that, I 'm addicted to the 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.230
 I always do keratin, I know that 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.120
 there are other treatments but if you allow 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.590
 that's how keratin always does 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.130
 compare with the keratin the design 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.040
 always improves for free does not matter and if 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.840
 these sides are because today is the 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.670
 Anniversary anniversary with the fat man 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.100
 and we're six years together 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.980
 it's too long I know six years but 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.560
 I always make you painful like that 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.230
 we can not start tied for more than 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.910
 five years we can not finish the 6 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:22.410
 but 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.270
 I never wanted that and I was surprised with 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.980
 So I mean I 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.240
 I did not think he was going to send me anything 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.430
 I did not know but it was nice and if I wanted them 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.260
 show my hair I know it's a 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:40.010
 nonsense and this is my microphone so that 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.010
 You will listen better and better to eat 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.540
 I 'm leaving I'm going to God 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.370
 I'm going to upload this so they can 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.350

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.350

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.350
 but 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:03.789
 thanks for looking at my hair blog the 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.789
 change come from behind with you 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.860

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.630
 windsurfer I'm going to show you a video 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.630
 in winsurfing written that edit it 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.640
 but what good to see is that I'm healed 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.990
 a stimulator was cured and I was 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.080
 trying to learn how to windsurf and 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.820
 I loved it but I liked Windsor 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.860
 but what I did not like is that there was already 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.120
 many rocks then I always felt that 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.420
 I was against the rocks and I was going to 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.310
 die then I liked that 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.710
 I would like to be again then I know 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.810
 who margarita on a beach 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.550
 call since he does play if I can 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.990
 do it in case we could scream at 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.190
 winters 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.190
 it sounds weird to say that
