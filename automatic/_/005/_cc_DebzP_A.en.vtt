00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.590 
it comes out if you finger on it it's
like<00:01:47.619> a<00:01:47.649> plane<00:01:47.890> wall<00:01:48.100> little<00:01:48.460> twist<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.119> this

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
like a plane wall little twist and this

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.109 
like a plane wall little twist and this
is<00:01:49.869> how<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.259> comes<00:01:50.320> out<00:01:50.560> if<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.369> way<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:51.729> kind<00:01:52.000> of

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
is how it comes out if the way I kind of

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.600 
is how it comes out if the way I kind of
do<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:54.549> take<00:01:54.819> your<00:01:55.259> brush<00:01:56.259> or<00:01:56.470> pick<00:01:56.679> the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
do it you take your brush or pick the

do it you take your brush or pick the
pick<00:01:57.939> is<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.179> little<00:01:58.420> harder<00:01:58.810> so<00:01:59.020> I'd<00:01:59.170> rather

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
pick is a little harder so I'd rather

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.700 
pick is a little harder so I'd rather
use<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.950> brush<00:02:00.159> and<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.899> just<00:02:02.110> take<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.560> little

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
use the brush and you just take a little

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.190 
use the brush and you just take a little
piece<00:02:02.920> of<00:02:03.039> hair<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:03.520> then<00:02:03.759> you<00:02:03.909> just<00:02:04.140> curl<00:02:05.140> it

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
piece of hair and then you just curl it

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.710 
piece of hair and then you just curl it
on<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:06.340> brush<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:09.869> then<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:11.860> turn<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.160> like

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
on the brush and then you turn it like

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the bottom part up and then you take it

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.780 
the bottom part up and then you take it
out<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.830> makes<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.130> pretty<00:02:18.340> little<00:02:18.640> girl

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.240 
now that one was that really great and
then<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.750> just<00:02:22.870> do<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.140> same<00:02:23.349> for<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.739> others

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
then you just do the same for the others

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:33.410 
then you just do the same for the others
like<00:02:24.489> this<00:02:24.700> one<00:02:25.319> take<00:02:26.319> it<00:02:31.110> push<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.319> out
