it advertises extreme fast RAM and

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.820 
it advertises extreme fast RAM and
optimize<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.060> memory<00:00:27.420> better<00:00:27.660> apparently<00:00:28.230> it

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
optimize the memory better apparently it

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.400 
optimize the memory better apparently it
also<00:00:29.070> says<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.820> five<00:00:30.330> times<00:00:30.539> third<00:00:30.810> latency

the<00:04:32.189> processor<00:04:32.789> plate<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:33.569> is<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.110> LGA<00:04:34.610> 1155

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
the processor plate it is the LGA 1155

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.230 
the processor plate it is the LGA 1155
again<00:04:37.099> for<00:04:38.099> the<00:04:38.250> output<00:04:38.699> so<00:04:38.879> you<00:04:38.939> have<00:04:39.120> the

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
again for the output so you have the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.339 
again for the output so you have the
legacy<00:04:39.719> ps2<00:04:40.620> part<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:41.430> have<00:04:41.520> two<00:04:41.909> USB<00:04:42.389> 2.0

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
legacy ps2 part you have two USB 2.0

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
this motherboard in my existing computer

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.429 
this motherboard in my existing computer
my<00:05:25.590> holding<00:05:25.919> on<00:05:25.979> the<00:05:26.069> board<00:05:26.279> here<00:05:27.409> had<00:05:28.409> a

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:28.439 
my holding on the board here had a

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:31.550 
my holding on the board here had a
really<00:05:28.800> bad<00:05:28.979> day<00:05:29.659> during<00:05:30.659> an<00:05:30.930> electric<00:05:31.319> storm

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
really bad day during an electric storm

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.269 
really bad day during an electric storm
I<00:05:32.180> don't<00:05:33.180> know<00:05:33.240> exactly<00:05:33.360> what<00:05:33.840> happened<00:05:34.169> but

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:34.279 
I don't know exactly what happened but

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:38.149 
I don't know exactly what happened but
it<00:05:35.279> fried<00:05:35.960> when<00:05:36.960> I<00:05:36.990> was<00:05:37.199> gone<00:05:37.440> storm<00:05:37.889> chasing

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159 
it fried when I was gone storm chasing

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:40.399 
it fried when I was gone storm chasing
actually<00:05:38.729> I<00:05:38.759> had<00:05:39.090> it<00:05:39.240> on<00:05:39.389> and<00:05:39.810> that<00:05:40.110> was<00:05:40.229> my

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
actually I had it on and that was my

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.950 
actually I had it on and that was my
fault<00:05:40.529> so<00:05:41.180> when<00:05:42.180> the<00:05:42.300> board<00:05:42.509> didn't<00:05:42.750> survive

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
fault so when the board didn't survive

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.439 
fault so when the board didn't survive
so<00:05:43.770> I<00:05:43.800> had<00:05:43.979> to<00:05:44.069> replace<00:05:44.310> it<00:05:44.639> but<00:05:44.789> hopefully

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
so I had to replace it but hopefully

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.300 
so I had to replace it but hopefully
them<00:05:45.629> on<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.839> board<00:05:46.050> is<00:05:46.349> the<00:05:46.560> only<00:05:46.710> trauma<00:05:46.919> I

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
them on the board is the only trauma I

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.149 
them on the board is the only trauma I
think<00:05:47.729> I've<00:05:47.819> ruled<00:05:48.029> everything<00:05:48.449> else<00:05:48.599> out<00:05:49.159> so

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
think I've ruled everything else out so

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:51.890 
think I've ruled everything else out so
thanks<00:05:50.370> for<00:05:50.460> watching<00:05:50.520> feel<00:05:51.300> free<00:05:51.330> to<00:05:51.629> like

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
installation of the motherboard and I've

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.829 
installation of the motherboard and I've
been<00:05:56.520> running<00:05:56.759> it<00:05:56.849> for<00:05:56.879> about<00:05:57.000> a<00:05:57.089> week<00:05:57.270> now<00:05:57.360> I

00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:57.839 
been running it for about a week now I

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:00.040 
been running it for about a week now I
want<00:05:58.259> to<00:05:58.319> give<00:05:58.440> some<00:05:58.650> input<00:05:58.889> about<00:05:59.339> the

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
want to give some input about the

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.129 
want to give some input about the
motherboard<00:06:01.050> here<00:06:02.509> some<00:06:03.509> little<00:06:03.750> things<00:06:04.020> I

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
motherboard here some little things I

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:04.820 
motherboard here some little things I
didn't<00:06:04.349> notice

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
didn't notice

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.969 
didn't notice
for<00:06:05.580> example<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.569> SATA<00:06:07.050> ports<00:06:07.440> on<00:06:07.680> air

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
for example the SATA ports on air

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.980 
for example the SATA ports on air
instead<00:06:08.729> of<00:06:08.849> like<00:06:09.000> being<00:06:09.210> off<00:06:09.419> at<00:06:09.629> a<00:06:09.719> right

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
instead of like being off at a right

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.329 
instead of like being off at a right
angle<00:06:10.229> to<00:06:10.770> the<00:06:10.830> motherboard

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:11.339 
angle to the motherboard

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:14.329 
angle to the motherboard
they<00:06:11.490> stick<00:06:11.729> straight<00:06:12.060> out<00:06:12.120> and<00:06:12.479> so<00:06:13.110> it<00:06:13.800> makes

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:14.339 
they stick straight out and so it makes

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:16.219 
they stick straight out and so it makes
the<00:06:14.460> cable<00:06:14.789> management<00:06:14.969> a<00:06:15.360> little<00:06:15.870> bit<00:06:16.050> more

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
the cable management a little bit more

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.930 
the cable management a little bit more
difficult<00:06:16.680> it's<00:06:16.949> a<00:06:17.039> little<00:06:17.250> bit<00:06:17.370> less<00:06:17.520> clean

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
difficult it's a little bit less clean

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.420 
difficult it's a little bit less clean
as<00:06:18.240> the<00:06:18.539> SATA<00:06:18.810> cables<00:06:19.259> are<00:06:19.349> sick<00:06:19.620> sticking

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
as the SATA cables are sick sticking

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:26.779

you<00:06:35.580> have<00:06:35.789> your<00:06:35.940> motherboard

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
you have your motherboard

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.529 
you have your motherboard
at<00:06:38.349> the<00:06:38.469> top<00:06:38.710> of<00:06:38.979> the<00:06:39.699> case<00:06:39.909> instead<00:06:40.300> of<00:06:40.389> the

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
at the top of the case instead of the

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:42.779 
at the top of the case instead of the
power<00:06:40.659> supplier<00:06:41.139> it<00:06:41.830> makes<00:06:42.069> it<00:06:42.249> a<00:06:42.370> little

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:42.789 
power supplier it makes it a little

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:46.140 
power supplier it makes it a little
tricky<00:06:43.180> to<00:06:43.569> install<00:06:44.969> particularly<00:06:45.969> cuz<00:06:46.090> I

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
tricky to install particularly cuz I

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.029 
tricky to install particularly cuz I
have<00:06:46.330> fans<00:06:46.659> on<00:06:47.080> the<00:06:47.169> top<00:06:47.349> figure<00:06:47.529> I<00:06:47.650> have<00:06:47.830> two

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 
have fans on the top figure I have two

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:49.950 
have fans on the top figure I have two
fans<00:06:48.340> the<00:06:48.610> top<00:06:48.819> and<00:06:49.150> so<00:06:49.539> that<00:06:49.659> makes<00:06:49.810> it<00:06:49.930> a

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
fans the top and so that makes it a

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.600 
fans the top and so that makes it a
little<00:06:50.050> bit<00:06:50.259> difficult<00:06:50.439> for<00:06:50.800> installation

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
little bit difficult for installation

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.570 
little bit difficult for installation
and<00:06:52.020> again<00:06:53.020> it's<00:06:53.349> got<00:06:53.529> a<00:06:53.560> ton<00:06:53.860> of<00:06:53.889> options<00:06:54.129> for

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
and again it's got a ton of options for

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.209 
and again it's got a ton of options for
USB<00:06:54.999> cables<00:06:55.449> it's<00:06:56.169> got<00:06:56.289> a<00:06:56.319> ton<00:06:56.620> of<00:06:56.650> fan<00:06:56.979> had

00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:57.219 
USB cables it's got a ton of fan had

00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:00.119 
USB cables it's got a ton of fan had
areas<00:06:57.490> I<00:06:57.580> can<00:06:57.699> see<00:06:57.819> at<00:06:57.909> least<00:06:57.999> one<00:06:58.919> chassis<00:06:59.919> fan

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:00.129 
areas I can see at least one chassis fan

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:02.279 
areas I can see at least one chassis fan
there's<00:07:00.699> another<00:07:00.909> one<00:07:01.120> back<00:07:01.270> there<00:07:01.599> so

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:02.289 
there's another one back there so

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.439 
there's another one back there so
there's<00:07:02.439> a<00:07:02.469> ton<00:07:02.650> of<00:07:02.710> different<00:07:02.919> spots<00:07:03.370> for<00:07:03.729> fan

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
there's a ton of different spots for fan

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:06.869 
there's a ton of different spots for fan
ports<00:07:04.990> on<00:07:05.169> the<00:07:05.289> motherboard<00:07:05.529> there's<00:07:06.490> also<00:07:06.699> a

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:06.879 
ports on the motherboard there's also a

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:09.989 
ports on the motherboard there's also a
ton<00:07:07.389> of<00:07:07.419> USB<00:07:08.050> ports<00:07:08.529> so<00:07:08.740> I<00:07:09.219> mean<00:07:09.400> I<00:07:09.669> think<00:07:09.729> this

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:09.999 
ton of USB ports so I mean I think this

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:12.269 
ton of USB ports so I mean I think this
thing<00:07:10.240> can<00:07:10.360> support<00:07:10.659> up<00:07:10.839> like<00:07:11.020> 10<00:07:11.379> USB<00:07:11.740> ports

00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:12.279 
thing can support up like 10 USB ports

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:14.879 
thing can support up like 10 USB ports
so<00:07:12.639> I<00:07:13.060> have<00:07:13.210> like<00:07:13.389> four<00:07:13.749> on<00:07:13.930> the<00:07:14.139> front<00:07:14.499> panel

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:14.889 
so I have like four on the front panel

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:16.860 
so I have like four on the front panel
here<00:07:15.009> got<00:07:15.849> a<00:07:15.879> ton<00:07:16.060> on<00:07:16.180> the<00:07:16.240> back<00:07:16.389> on<00:07:16.659> the

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870 
here got a ton on the back on the

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.450 
here got a ton on the back on the
motherboard<00:07:17.110> itself<00:07:17.560> so<00:07:17.889> it's<00:07:18.039> really<00:07:18.189> good

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460 
motherboard itself so it's really good

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.179 
motherboard itself so it's really good
and<00:07:18.669> the<00:07:19.180> BIOS<00:07:19.749> is<00:07:20.080> actually<00:07:20.379> really<00:07:20.860> easy<00:07:20.889> to

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:21.189 
and the BIOS is actually really easy to

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:23.760 
and the BIOS is actually really easy to
use<00:07:21.490> I<00:07:21.789> thought<00:07:22.360> Asus<00:07:22.930> always<00:07:23.259> had<00:07:23.439> the<00:07:23.620> best

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.770 
use I thought Asus always had the best

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.079 
use I thought Asus always had the best
BIOS<00:07:24.610> the<00:07:24.990> enhanced<00:07:25.990> BIOS<00:07:26.409> but<00:07:27.069> I<00:07:27.310> really<00:07:27.819> like

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:28.089 
BIOS the enhanced BIOS but I really like

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:30.659 
BIOS the enhanced BIOS but I really like
the<00:07:28.389> asrock<00:07:28.990> BIOS<00:07:29.529> again<00:07:29.949> it's<00:07:30.129> very<00:07:30.339> simple

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:30.669 
the asrock BIOS again it's very simple

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:33.540 
the asrock BIOS again it's very simple
to<00:07:30.789> use<00:07:30.819> and<00:07:31.389> since<00:07:32.379> I<00:07:32.499> have<00:07:32.620> a<00:07:32.650> non<00:07:32.949> cave

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:33.550 
to use and since I have a non cave

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.059 
to use and since I have a non cave
processor<00:07:34.360> stupid<00:07:35.229> mistake<00:07:35.710> when<00:07:35.919> I<00:07:35.979> was

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:36.069 
processor stupid mistake when I was

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:37.379 
processor stupid mistake when I was
first<00:07:36.189> building<00:07:36.580> my<00:07:36.669> computer<00:07:36.999> for<00:07:37.120> the<00:07:37.180> first

first building my computer for the first

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:38.700 
first building my computer for the first
time

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
time

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.399

I<00:07:38.800> can't<00:07:39.430> overclock<00:07:40.029> it<00:07:40.060> very<00:07:40.599> easily<00:07:40.930> I<00:07:41.139> can't

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:41.409 
I can't overclock it very easily I can't

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:44.969 
I can't overclock it very easily I can't
up<00:07:41.560> the<00:07:41.710> voltage<00:07:42.129> I<00:07:42.399> can<00:07:42.610> only<00:07:42.819> change<00:07:43.979> like

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:44.979 
up the voltage I can only change like

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:47.339 
up the voltage I can only change like
the<00:07:45.129> base<00:07:45.310> clock<00:07:45.610> of<00:07:45.849> it<00:07:46.000> and<00:07:46.349> this

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:47.349 
the base clock of it and this

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:49.170 
the base clock of it and this
motherboard<00:07:47.680> does<00:07:48.159> it<00:07:48.279> automatically<00:07:48.879> it's

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:49.180 
motherboard does it automatically it's

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.920 
motherboard does it automatically it's

I've<00:07:54.819> got<00:07:55.000> this<00:07:55.120> thing<00:07:55.300> up<00:07:55.389> to<00:07:55.479> 4.3<00:07:56.229> Hertz

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:56.860 
I've got this thing up to 4.3 Hertz

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.329 
I've got this thing up to 4.3 Hertz
it's<00:07:57.580> normally<00:07:57.969> 3.4<00:07:58.899> and<00:07:59.259> so<00:07:59.740> I've<00:07:59.889> been<00:08:00.189> able

00:08:00.329 --> 00:08:00.339 
it's normally 3.4 and so I've been able

00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:03.589 
it's normally 3.4 and so I've been able
to<00:08:00.520> really<00:08:00.819> dramatically<00:08:01.389> increase<00:08:01.930> the
