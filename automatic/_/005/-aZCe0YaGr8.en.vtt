to tell you about this chapter the story
was<00:02:04.789> okay<00:02:05.029> I<00:02:06.579> mean<00:02:07.579> if<00:02:07.819> you<00:02:08.209> didn't<00:02:08.750> see<00:02:08.959> the

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
was okay I mean if you didn't see the

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.740 
was okay I mean if you didn't see the
flash<00:02:09.410> pilot<00:02:10.100> it<00:02:11.090> kind<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.420> gives<00:02:11.600> you<00:02:11.720> a

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
flash pilot it kind of gives you a

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.690 
flash pilot it kind of gives you a
different<00:02:11.900> twist<00:02:12.350> on<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.560> pilot<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.459> don't

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
different twist on the pilot so I don't

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.150 
different twist on the pilot so I don't
think<00:02:13.880> this<00:02:14.000> connects<00:02:14.660> as<00:02:14.930> well<00:02:15.349> as<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.860> arrow

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
think this connects as well as the arrow

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.540 
think this connects as well as the arrow
season<00:02:16.790> 2.5<00:02:17.630> does<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.770> pretty<00:02:19.099> much<00:02:19.280> feels

here<00:03:32.450> no<00:03:33.139> one<00:03:33.379> looked<00:03:33.650> like<00:03:33.859> their<00:03:34.129> their<00:03:35.090> TV

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
here no one looked like their their TV

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.680 
here no one looked like their their TV
counterpart<00:03:36.859> in<00:03:37.069> this<00:03:37.220> at<00:03:37.459> all<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:38.329> looked

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
counterpart in this at all this looked

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.649 
counterpart in this at all this looked
very<00:03:38.930> much<00:03:39.079> like<00:03:39.290> an<00:03:39.650> animated<00:03:40.609> series<00:03:41.239> type

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
very much like an animated series type

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.189 
very much like an animated series type
comic<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.949> that's<00:03:43.940> why<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.120> felt<00:03:44.449> like<00:03:44.479> while<00:03:45.169> I

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
comic and that's why I felt like while I

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.409 
comic and that's why I felt like while I
was<00:03:45.349> reading<00:03:45.680> this<00:03:45.769> like<00:03:45.979> that<00:03:46.699> wasn't<00:03:47.239> based

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
was reading this like that wasn't based

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.229 
was reading this like that wasn't based
on<00:03:47.599> a<00:03:47.659> TV<00:03:47.930> show<00:03:48.079> but<00:03:48.590> more<00:03:48.919> like<00:03:49.129> a<00:03:49.239> comic

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
on a TV show but more like a comic

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.250 
on a TV show but more like a comic
version<00:03:50.780> of<00:03:50.959> an<00:03:51.340> animated<00:03:52.340> show<00:03:52.699> and<00:03:53.000> I<00:03:53.810> mean

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
version of an animated show and I mean

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.869 
version of an animated show and I mean
it's<00:03:54.739> good<00:03:55.400> art<00:03:55.729> I<00:03:56.889> won't<00:03:57.889> give<00:03:58.010> you<00:03:58.040> art<00:03:58.400> maybe

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
it's good art I won't give you art maybe

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.780 
it's good art I won't give you art maybe
three<00:03:59.780> stars<00:04:00.109> because<00:04:00.739> it<00:04:00.949> doesn't<00:04:01.340> fit<00:04:01.519> for

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
three stars because it doesn't fit for

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.270 
three stars because it doesn't fit for
the<00:04:01.879> TV<00:04:02.269> show<00:04:02.299> but<00:04:03.229> if<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:03.680> was<00:04:03.829> just<00:04:03.859> regular

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
the TV show but if it was just regular

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.550 
the TV show but if it was just regular
art<00:04:04.699> I<00:04:04.849> would<00:04:04.909> probably<00:04:05.269> give<00:04:05.389> it<00:04:05.569> three<00:04:06.349> and<00:04:06.379> a

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
art I would probably give it three and a

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.979 
art I would probably give it three and a
half<00:04:06.709> stars<00:04:07.099> but<00:04:07.939> because<00:04:08.359> it's<00:04:08.569> supposed<00:04:08.900> to

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
half stars but because it's supposed to

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.170 
half stars but because it's supposed to
be<00:04:09.079> based<00:04:09.319> on<00:04:09.500> this<00:04:09.650> TV<00:04:10.069> show<00:04:10.099> I'm<00:04:10.819> gonna<00:04:11.090> have

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
be based on this TV show I'm gonna have

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.569 
be based on this TV show I'm gonna have
to<00:04:11.299> deduct<00:04:12.109> a<00:04:12.229> little<00:04:12.530> bit<00:04:12.680> from<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:13.069> and<00:04:13.400> give

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
to deduct a little bit from it and give

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.310 
to deduct a little bit from it and give
it<00:04:13.609> three<00:04:14.269> stars<00:04:15.519> now<00:04:16.519> overall<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.329> do<00:04:17.449> like<00:04:17.780> the

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
it three stars now overall I do like the

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.080 
it three stars now overall I do like the
first<00:04:19.159> chapter<00:04:19.759> but<00:04:20.829> I'm<00:04:21.829> not<00:04:22.130> sure<00:04:22.310> if<00:04:22.490> season

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
first chapter but I'm not sure if season

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.120 
first chapter but I'm not sure if season
zero<00:04:23.449> was<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.810> right<00:04:24.199> name<00:04:24.500> for<00:04:24.530> it<00:04:24.979> because

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
zero was the right name for it because

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.700 
zero was the right name for it because
season<00:04:25.610> zero<00:04:25.880> implies<00:04:26.810> that<00:04:27.169> it<00:04:27.259> takes<00:04:27.409> place

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
season zero implies that it takes place

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.700 
season zero implies that it takes place
before<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.940> season<00:04:29.389> starts<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.409> I<00:04:30.440> was

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
before the season starts so I was

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.890 
before the season starts so I was
expecting<00:04:31.250> you<00:04:31.370> know<00:04:31.490> like<00:04:31.699> what<00:04:32.509> happened

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
expecting you know like what happened

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.890 
expecting you know like what happened
with<00:04:32.990> Barry<00:04:33.259> Allen<00:04:33.889> before<00:04:34.130> how<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:34.970> he<00:04:35.389> meet

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
with Barry Allen before how the he meet

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.760 
with Barry Allen before how the he meet
iris<00:04:36.139> and<00:04:36.860> all<00:04:36.919> that<00:04:37.159> like<00:04:37.490> I<00:04:37.610> was<00:04:37.759> expecting

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
iris and all that like I was expecting

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.560 
iris and all that like I was expecting
that<00:04:39.770> type<00:04:40.099> of<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.310> build<00:04:40.909> up<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.330> will

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
that type of a build up that will

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.430 
that type of a build up that will
connect<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:42.260> but<00:04:42.440> this<00:04:42.560> is<00:04:42.770> more<00:04:43.010> like

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
connect to it but this is more like

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.180 
connect to it but this is more like
season<00:04:45.440> one

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
season one

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.940 
season one
five<00:04:46.790> where<00:04:47.510> it's<00:04:47.780> like<00:04:48.020> right<00:04:48.530> in<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.770> middle

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
five where it's like right in the middle

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.970 
five where it's like right in the middle
of<00:04:49.550> season<00:04:49.960> one<00:04:50.960> where<00:04:51.350> you're<00:04:51.590> they're<00:04:51.830> gonna

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
of season one where you're they're gonna

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.910 
of season one where you're they're gonna
be<00:04:52.130> weaving<00:04:52.370> tails<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:53.120> now<00:04:53.420> season<00:04:54.050> one<00:04:54.290> so

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
be weaving tails and now season one so

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.940 
be weaving tails and now season one so
it<00:04:55.730> doesn't<00:04:56.180> really<00:04:56.240> fit<00:04:56.660> for<00:04:56.990> me<00:04:57.170> like<00:04:57.440> maybe

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
it doesn't really fit for me like maybe

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.540 
it doesn't really fit for me like maybe
a<00:04:58.600> season<00:04:59.600> point<00:04:59.990> five<00:05:00.290> I<00:05:01.010> don't<00:05:01.280> know<00:05:01.400> how

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
a season point five I don't know how

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.190 
a season point five I don't know how
they're<00:05:01.760> going<00:05:01.910> how<00:05:02.480> they<00:05:02.690> should<00:05:02.750> call<00:05:03.140> it

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
they're going how they should call it

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.440 
they're going how they should call it
but<00:05:03.830> it's<00:05:03.920> definitely<00:05:04.070> not<00:05:04.370> season<00:05:05.120> zero

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
but it's definitely not season zero

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.690 
but it's definitely not season zero
because<00:05:05.780> it<00:05:05.930> doesn't<00:05:06.290> take<00:05:06.440> place<00:05:06.740> it's<00:05:07.460> not<00:05:07.670> a

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
because it doesn't take place it's not a

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.360 
because it doesn't take place it's not a
prequel<00:05:08.330> to<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:08.750> season<00:05:09.230> this<00:05:09.620> is<00:05:09.860> very<00:05:10.100> much
