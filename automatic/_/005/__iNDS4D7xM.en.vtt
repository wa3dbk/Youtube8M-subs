00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.030 
liquid eyeliner i like to use this still
linear<00:01:40.760> in<00:01:41.090> time<00:01:41.800> I've<00:01:42.800> also<00:01:42.979> use<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:44.030> L'Oreal

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040

telescopic<00:01:46.270> but<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:48.110> is<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.260> lot<00:01:48.410> better<00:01:48.640> or<00:01:49.640> I

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
telescopic but this is a lot better or I

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.950 
telescopic but this is a lot better or I
guess<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.810> could<00:01:50.840> use<00:01:51.850> pencil<00:01:52.850> eyeliners<00:01:53.420> but

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:02.869 
one is a little bit smaller so then go

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:20.790
