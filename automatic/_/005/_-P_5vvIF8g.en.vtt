 extraterrestrial origin 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.260

 government of the us admitting that such 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.690

 in general, both are 3000 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.820
 two meters and the other two the 03 the 21 and 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.220
 the 03 the 21 and you are about 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.920
 about 3,100 meters the base also 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.050
 has a port the nasa and its 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.140
 secrets the astronaut edgar mitchell 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.090

 with extraterrestrial contacts whose 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.870
 existence has hidden the certain thing is that 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.610
 This is not the first time that accuses 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.370
 the nasa to hide evidence of 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.350
 aliens without going any further makes 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.420
 a few months we talked about the remains of 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.880
 an ancient civilization that the nasa 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.110
 I would have found on the moon 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.450
 discovery that also remained in 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.520
 secret here I will leave you a supposed 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.890

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.130
 to the moon 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.480
 the program 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.010
 or real 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.390
 plus 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.959
