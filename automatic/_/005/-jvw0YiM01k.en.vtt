00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 You will find differences here I welcome 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.660
 warmly welcome you to a new episode 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.220
 is 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.530
 today makes me the smallest and 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.530
 the simplest protein bar in the world 22 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.420
 only two ingredients for the whole receptor 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.550
 for a simple oatmeal from the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.390
 supermarket and a protein over it 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.949
 for example vanilla or chocolate ours 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.679
 recipe you make five big ones 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.539
 protein bars perfect as a snack or for 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.859
 Example for after training leave 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.750
 also transport very well 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.079
 To make these five rules needs 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.720
 your 200 grams of oatmeal and about 100 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.920
 up to 150 grams of protein powder the amount 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.989
 the protein powder that is attached 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.840
 just how many gram of proteins 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.730
 For example, in your mac 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.079
 kroos also thinks about it 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.809
 is the oatmeal for example 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.879
 contain some protein and give 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.710
 then to the recipe expensive desired 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.539
 Add a lot of protein powder to the recipe 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.539
 can be done with both 100 and 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.019
 with for example 150 grams of protein 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.690
 make powder without problems gives the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.640
 oatmeal in the container and gives that 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.820
 protein powder simply part comes now 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.590
 important part mixed that both good 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.300
 that you do not have big lumps of 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.360
 protein powder has more in one place 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.310
 but that the masses are both good 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.020
 are distributed and at this point 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.789
 suitable for example are very good 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.560
 that gives the whole very good taste 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.720
 Alternatively, you can also do something like 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.979
 Add sweetener or stevia to it 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.729
 the whole thing a bit stronger 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.340
 to give taste 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.080
 mix the whole thing well and now 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.039
 the central part of the recipe arrives 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.020
 many fail 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.970
 You have to try as little water as possible 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.380
 it's best to give it up that way 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.080
 before that you if you the ingredients 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.640
 mixed some water added 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.950
 and the whole country is trying with one 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.810
 fork to mix so that 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.399
 you practically no more protein powder 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.619
 can see loose but that everything with 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.390
 The oatmeal is mixed when it is too 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.969
 a lot of water then takes the bolts 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.439
 in the end never firm if yours 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.450
 Consistency looks like this 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.270
 then put the lid on it and ask 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.789
 the whole for about 15 to a maximum of 30 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.810
 minutes the fridge 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.160
 which , for example, are very well suited 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.450
 Coconut rasps are still a small tip 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.430
 or raisins or small nut pieces 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.810
 one adds to the whole thing 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.250
 just a great taste and fits 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.569
 also from the nutrients super pure and 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.489
 the whole thing then after the time again 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.170
 Take the fridge out of the knife 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.400
 and cut completely once 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.650
 you will see that is very much 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.910
 sticky and if you can do that with the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.860
 consistency with the water properly 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.900
 but you still have 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.790
 a pretty solid mass cuts so 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.620
 now the whole in the desired number 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.620
 from riehen here eg 5 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.200
 and gives it all up afterwards 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.970
 separate plate with a knife and 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.160
 fork can you still the bolt the 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.460
 perfect typical regular shape 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.460
 bring 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.550
 and the whole if now for example 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.800
 After that, just want to take part in training 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.170
 in the typical fresh-holding foil give 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.230
 wrap up and then back in the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.340
 fridge 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.560
 in that we have the rule without milk 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.820
 There is hardly anything here 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.290
 with the ingredients what kind of 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.520
 can turn bad in the short term 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.950
 that means you can loose things 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.209
 keep it up a week or so and such 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.209
 Looks at the final result 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.820
 that was a game i hope you have that 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.140
 if you like the other recipe 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.459
 want to see certain recipes writes 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.100
 just in the comments 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.420
 if you wanted to see more recipes 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.800
 any case the copies nice channel 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.450
 See you next time 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.450
 always work fit will
