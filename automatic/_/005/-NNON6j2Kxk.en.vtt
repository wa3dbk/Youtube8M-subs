equal to 0 1 and as you can see it has a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.810 
equal to 0 1 and as you can see it has a
theory<00:00:25.410> reduction<00:00:26.039> at<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.960> few<00:00:27.960> axis<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.070> also

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
theory reduction at a few axis and also

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.889 
theory reduction at a few axis and also
the<00:00:30.800> theater<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.250> low<00:00:32.489> access<00:00:32.759> remains<00:00:33.690> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
which can be bearable as like around 180

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.380 
which can be bearable as like around 180
degrees

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390
