00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello, internet and mobile networks it 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.970
 droid er.ru with the presentation of nokia world 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.330
 that take place in abu dhabi and in my 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.660
 hands 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.469
 nokia's first tablet which 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.730
 called lumia 2520 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.920
 in general, a classic tablet 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.900
 form factor 10 inch screen with full hd 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.990
 By the way, by the way, beautiful 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.330
 clear awesome juicy screen like 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.369
 pretty stupor speed stick on 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.810
 he is rather surprised at many 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.689
 android tablet because it is inside 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.489
 well with a qualcomm snapdragon 800 processor 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.079
 By the way, I'm probably one of 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.829
 the first tablet in the world that this 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.930
 The processor most likely works like this 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.360
 still there are two gigabytes of RAM 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.010
 32 and 64 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.320
 there is also such a capsule here 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.420
 need gold so that the capsules 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.000
 you can insert an additional card 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.250
 micro sd memory and sim card 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.520
 There are options for devices that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.530
 support 4g format but that's it 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.559
 this one no i should be such an inscription 4g 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.510
 there is a 6 and 7 megapixel camera 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.450
 which will make quite good 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.409
 photos and videos for tablets by the way 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.229
 with zeiss optics 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.720
 let's play a little with the interface 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.950
 The device is actually worth it. 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.950
 windows is not surprising windows 8.1 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.299
 also not surprising windows 8.1 rtm this 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.610
 a variation of windows which is made exactly 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.710
 for tablets work on processors with 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.080
 architecture arm that's cool 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.700
 a curtain that can be pushed back and 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.470
 see the entire list of applications before 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.479
 it was not now appeared and 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.180
 answer convenient there is a search you can 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.880
 find anything you can run 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.439
 stick it on your desktop 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.689
 big tiles appeared on the table 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.540
 that size square on and let's 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.159
 can open classic 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.100
 windows windows it is also here 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.960
 only explorer tyrnet and there is an office 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.920
 microsoft word and microsoft application 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.860
 excel power point 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.790
 anode and outlook they all run in 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.850
 desktop version 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.350
 all other applications run here 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.189
 in this tiled interface 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.640
 you can open for example storm where they all 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.720
 There is something to look for, for example, not 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.180
 know facebook 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.470
 yes, there is a facebook application 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.209
 well and for example twitter filter too 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.370
 there i remember a year ago when we 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.810
 tested and windows rt 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.310
 there has not even been an official twitter for 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.350
 him new wants their third-party customers 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.239
 but now he is it nice nice and 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.480
 some games too. nothing here 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.220
 appear for example as an exclusive 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.080
 Demonstrated game created by 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.319
 use dreamworks studio by 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.970
 dragon cartoon in general to this 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.160
 strange game on the graphics is not bad further 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.950
 I have another application that can 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.900
 here show this video editor 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.580
 which is called the bottom theme of the species and 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.560
 Viktor but allows you to somehow handle 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.660
 your videos are generally enough 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.290
 simple functionality here choose 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.910
 choose 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.580
 video choose the style in which 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.120
 will be decorated add music and then 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.900
 Something is obtained well in general 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.359
 enough 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.549
 simple and not very clever 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.859
 vlog here you can not write down unfortunately 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.109
 with this apple kukin 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.150
 but, in any case, there is no 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.560
 Families for the house probably fit well and 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.660
 many many other applications that 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.989
 already have windows rt 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.579
 there are applications nokia camera pro 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.109
 which is the same as on smartphones here 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.299
 This is how the picture looks like 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.970
 medium and poor quality and 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.370
 like on a smartphone, we can 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.430
 make a swap and manually configure everything 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.230
 Parameters that are here like 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.390
 distance like focus and with 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.359
 white balance and so on still here 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.459
 there is a switch mode shooting 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.630
 night shooting i'm moving objects and 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.910
 automatically general 3 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.650
 the mode is no longer sho here they themselves are considered not 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.950
 in addition to the tablet can be purchased 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.780
 its such an accessory 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.690
 this is how you guessed holster with 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.060
 built-in keyboard and battery like 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.170
 everything works well, just take it 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.160
 paste it here should connect 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.140
 connected and now we can either 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.840
 close the cover there is a magnetic 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.690
 a clasp that is generally enough 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.750
 keeps it safe and in common tablet 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.180
 and then we can open all this 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.859
 design tricky to put for example 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.900
 here so here too is by the way a magnet 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.520
 here here below it is very fast when 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.410
 dog curls and enjoy 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.419
 keyboard by the way the keyboard is not so 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.400
 like a surprise so rag know 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.680
 who ate pressed but this here 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.889
 real buttons have that repent and 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.050
 let's try to run something 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.889
 the game is not the text to type yes that's the finger on the left 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.050
 demonstrated just what is and 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.000
 go to a small vader dot ru 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.660
 let's see how on this screen it will be 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.610
 look but from the minuses of this case I 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.280
 would call something that he is still cumbersome 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.160
 and maybe a big so weighty here 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.690
 It seriously weighs the device, I can 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.810
 even refused this extra 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.000
 batteries if the case is more compact 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.310
 and elegant comfortable but become more 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.280
 one bonus here i am here behind 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.889
 2 yusb port looks like a cool turbo 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.990
 blowing like from 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:16.889
 even a man with google glass has come 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.509
 take pictures we are blue tablet so 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.990
 I wanted to say nicely here on the side 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:23.669
 there are still two connectors and this is micro yusbi 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.270
 30 that looks like this 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.210
 strange 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.099
 consists of two sections and also 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.439
 micro-hdmi to connect some 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.229
 large screen as for iron 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:35.669
 as for the design of this tablet 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.770
 he really did succeed he is cool 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:40.259
 thin he is handsome stylish neatness 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.719
 actually generally generally have nokia 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:44.550
 always everything is good with it as for 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:46.770
 use windows of course say 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.569
 difficult to have to walk around a little longer and 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.719
 try to drive what is it 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.620
 use windows rt as 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:55.620
 tablet operating system 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.229
 but one bonus is for sure 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.509
 the gadget is what it costs only 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.840
 some 500 dollars is official 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.449
 price 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.180
 so let's hope such an ace as 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.710
 This gadget will reach well and that we are with you 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.389
