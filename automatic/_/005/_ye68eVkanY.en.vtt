there it should be a good grower his

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.140 
there it should be a good grower his
number<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.460> seven<00:01:31.340> give<00:01:32.340> us<00:01:32.490> some<00:01:32.610> calf<00:01:32.850> -

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150

she's a good eater and
so<00:01:40.490> they<00:01:40.640> should<00:01:40.850> get<00:01:40.969> pretty<00:01:41.240> big<00:01:41.770> rule

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
so they should get pretty big rule

so they should get pretty big rule
number<00:01:42.920> two<00:01:43.039> 24<00:01:43.670> months<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.240> may<00:01:44.359> be

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
number two 24 months so it may be

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.060 
number two 24 months so it may be
slightly<00:01:44.810> less<00:01:45.140> if<00:01:45.409> they<00:01:45.530> really<00:01:45.829> grow<00:01:46.039> up

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
slightly less if they really grow up

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.900 
and just see those two ears pointing up
the<00:02:32.120> one<00:02:32.269> in<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.510> front<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.049> older<00:02:33.349> one

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
the one in the front is the older one

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.259 
the one in the front is the older one
that's<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.060> k-cup<00:02:35.239> and<00:02:36.640> as<00:02:37.640> you<00:02:37.790> can<00:02:37.910> see<00:02:38.120> the

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
that's the k-cup and as you can see the

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.539 
that's the k-cup and as you can see the
grass<00:02:38.510> is<00:02:38.750> starting<00:02:38.959> to<00:02:39.200> slow<00:02:39.950> down<00:02:39.980> on<00:02:40.459> the

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
grass is starting to slow down on the

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.880 
grass is starting to slow down on the
growing<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.930> they<00:02:42.140> don't<00:02:42.290> have<00:02:42.379> as<00:02:42.470> much<00:02:42.650> to

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
growing so they don't have as much to

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.340 
growing so they don't have as much to
graze<00:02:43.129> on<00:02:43.579> and<00:02:45.519> so<00:02:46.519> we<00:02:46.639> got<00:02:46.790> some<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.000> that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
graze on and so we got some of that

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.870 
graze on and so we got some of that
round<00:02:48.350> bale<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.190> last<00:02:49.400> round<00:02:49.579> bale<00:02:49.850> I

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
round bale this is the last round bale I

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.900 
round bale this is the last round bale I
had<00:02:50.150> left<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:50.600> it's<00:02:50.780> not<00:02:50.959> very<00:02:51.200> good<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:51.910> may

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
had left and it's not very good so may

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.809 
had left and it's not very good so may
end<00:02:53.090> up<00:02:53.209> garden<00:02:53.630> mulch<00:02:54.130> because<00:02:55.130> it's<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.489> it's

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
end up garden mulch because it's a it's

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.580 
end up garden mulch because it's a it's
not<00:02:56.030> really<00:02:56.389> that<00:02:56.540> great<00:02:56.720> not<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.230> lot<00:02:57.470> of

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
not really that great not a lot of

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.140 
not really that great not a lot of
nutrients<00:02:58.069> left<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.519> I<00:02:58.579> had<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:58.910> left

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
nutrients left in it I had that left

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.360 
nutrients left in it I had that left
from<00:02:59.359> the<00:03:00.319> end<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.650> winter<00:03:01.329> so<00:03:03.069> and<00:03:04.069> you

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
from the end of the winter so and you

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.270 
from the end of the winter so and you
can<00:03:04.489> see<00:03:04.639> across<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:04.970> way<00:03:05.299> we<00:03:06.190> added<00:03:07.190> another

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
can see across the way we added another

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.370 
can see across the way we added another
ten<00:03:07.790> cattle<00:03:08.299> panels<00:03:08.690> over<00:03:08.959> there<00:03:09.170> because

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
ten cattle panels over there because

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.059 
ten cattle panels over there because
this<00:03:10.099> week<00:03:10.720> one<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.750> our<00:03:11.900> cows<00:03:12.290> broke<00:03:12.769> out<00:03:13.040> a

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
this week one of our cows broke out a

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.789 
this week one of our cows broke out a
k-cup<00:03:13.700> broke<00:03:14.299> out<00:03:14.480> twice<00:03:14.840> in<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:15.139> row<00:03:15.319> I<00:03:15.590> think

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
k-cup broke out twice in a row I think

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.479 
k-cup broke out twice in a row I think
she<00:03:15.980> was<00:03:16.130> in<00:03:16.280> heat<00:03:16.489> or<00:03:16.639> something<00:03:16.670> but

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
she was in heat or something but

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.190 
she was in heat or something but
normally<00:03:19.489> they<00:03:19.670> don't<00:03:19.790> get<00:03:20.060> out<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.569> we<00:03:21.019> get<00:03:21.139> a

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
normally they don't get out and we get a

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.009 
normally they don't get out and we get a
lot<00:03:21.410> of<00:03:22.510> electrical<00:03:23.510> wire<00:03:25.599> electric<00:03:26.599> fencing

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
lot of electrical wire electric fencing

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.309 
lot of electrical wire electric fencing
we<00:03:27.530> got<00:03:27.680> three<00:03:27.919> boxes<00:03:28.720> two<00:03:29.720> of<00:03:29.870> them<00:03:29.989> are<00:03:30.139> going

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
we got three boxes two of them are going

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.199 
we got three boxes two of them are going
all<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.709> time<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:31.099> other<00:03:31.250> ones<00:03:31.459> a<00:03:31.579> backup<00:03:31.970> in

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
all the time the other ones a backup in

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.470 
all the time the other ones a backup in
case<00:03:32.239> one<00:03:32.660> dies<00:03:33.310> so<00:03:34.310> anyways<00:03:35.000> we're<00:03:35.389> all

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
case one dies so anyways we're all

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.099 
case one dies so anyways we're all
reinforced<00:03:36.019> with<00:03:36.530> cattle<00:03:36.980> panels<00:03:37.370> and

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
reinforced with cattle panels and

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.009 
reinforced with cattle panels and
hopefully<00:03:39.130> that'll<00:03:40.130> prevent<00:03:40.870> any<00:03:41.870> more

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
hopefully that'll prevent any more

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.440 
hopefully that'll prevent any more
