00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
one of the biggest goals that we have

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.679 
one of the biggest goals that we have
for<00:00:16.730> the<00:00:16.820> force<00:00:17.029> unleashed<00:00:17.210> is<00:00:17.540> to

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
for the force unleashed is to

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.260 
for the force unleashed is to
re-envision<00:00:18.080> the<00:00:18.349> force<00:00:18.619> to<00:00:19.550> really<00:00:19.820> grab<00:00:20.060> the

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
re-envision the force to really grab the

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.730 
re-envision the force to really grab the
concept<00:00:20.720> of<00:00:20.779> the<00:00:20.900> force<00:00:21.140> if<00:00:21.290> you<00:00:21.410> saw<00:00:21.590> in<00:00:21.710> the

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
concept of the force if you saw in the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.769 
concept of the force if you saw in the
movies<00:00:22.099> and<00:00:22.310> take<00:00:22.820> it<00:00:22.970> so<00:00:23.180> amped<00:00:23.450> up<00:00:23.539> and<00:00:23.689> out

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779

movies and take it so amped up and out
of<00:00:23.900> control<00:00:24.169> that<00:00:24.289> it<00:00:24.590> works<00:00:24.770> really<00:00:25.130> well<00:00:25.250> in

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
of control that it works really well in

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.159 
of control that it works really well in
a<00:00:25.520> video<00:00:25.790> game<00:00:25.849> making<00:00:26.360> you<00:00:26.570> feel<00:00:26.779> like<00:00:27.050> the

most badass Jedi in the universe a

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.420 
most badass Jedi in the universe a
perfect<00:00:30.050> example<00:00:30.259> is<00:00:30.770> lightning<00:00:31.189> when<00:00:31.340> you

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
perfect example is lightning when you

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.310 
perfect example is lightning when you
actually<00:00:31.610> see<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.450> apprentice<00:00:32.960> totally

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
actually see the apprentice totally

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.080 
actually see the apprentice totally
amped<00:00:33.559> up<00:00:33.649> in<00:00:33.800> lightning<00:00:34.190> not<00:00:34.610> only<00:00:34.790> does<00:00:34.940> it

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
amped up in lightning not only does it

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.910 
amped up in lightning not only does it
go<00:00:35.180> purple<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:35.750> crazy<00:00:36.020> but<00:00:36.500> he<00:00:36.559> can<00:00:36.710> actually

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
go purple and crazy but he can actually

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.430 
go purple and crazy but he can actually
nuke<00:00:37.670> many<00:00:38.270> many<00:00:38.510> guys<00:00:38.750> more<00:00:39.170> than<00:00:39.350> you've

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
nuke many many guys more than you've

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.320 
nuke many many guys more than you've
ever<00:00:39.530> seen<00:00:39.800> in<00:00:39.950> the<00:00:40.010> movie<00:00:40.250> before<00:00:40.399> in<00:00:40.880> the

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
ever seen in the movie before in the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.210 
ever seen in the movie before in the
same<00:00:41.510> manner<00:00:41.720> we<00:00:42.050> can<00:00:42.080> use<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:42.590> forest<00:00:42.950> grip

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
same manner we can use the forest grip

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.070 
same manner we can use the forest grip
for<00:00:43.490> example<00:00:43.880> instead<00:00:44.030> of<00:00:44.120> just<00:00:44.330> gripping<00:00:44.570> an

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
for example instead of just gripping an

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.800 
for example instead of just gripping an
x-wing<00:00:45.680> like<00:00:45.980> you<00:00:46.100> saw<00:00:46.280> on<00:00:46.430> Dagobah<00:00:46.640> we<00:00:47.510> really

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
x-wing like you saw on Dagobah we really

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.360 
x-wing like you saw on Dagobah we really
amped<00:00:48.079> up<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:48.320> power<00:00:48.500> to<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:48.920> point<00:00:49.160> where

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
amped up the power to the point where

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.040 
amped up the power to the point where
the<00:00:49.490> apprentice<00:00:49.910> can<00:00:50.090> actually<00:00:50.420> pick<00:00:50.570> up<00:00:50.750> many

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
the apprentice can actually pick up many

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.080 
the apprentice can actually pick up many
objects<00:00:51.740> at<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:51.920> same<00:00:52.010> time<00:00:52.370> and<00:00:52.730> then<00:00:52.820> if<00:00:52.970> he

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
objects at the same time and then if he

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.490 
objects at the same time and then if he
wants<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:53.540> he<00:00:53.660> can<00:00:53.690> actually<00:00:54.110> throw<00:00:54.230> lightning

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
wants to he can actually throw lightning

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.080 
wants to he can actually throw lightning
at<00:00:54.800> them<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:55.310> now<00:00:55.430> they're<00:00:55.579> all<00:00:55.700> charged

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
at them and so now they're all charged

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.940 
at them and so now they're all charged
up<00:00:56.239> like<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.420> cannonball<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:57.560> each<00:00:57.710> one<00:00:57.920> of

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
up like a cannonball and each one of

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.650 
up like a cannonball and each one of
these<00:00:58.070> experiences<00:00:58.700> just<00:00:58.940> really<00:00:59.180> elevates

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
these experiences just really elevates

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.420 
these experiences just really elevates
the<00:00:59.840> action<00:01:00.260> of<00:01:00.380> the<00:01:00.440> forest<00:01:00.829> that's<00:01:01.190> really

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
the action of the forest that's really

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.859 
the action of the forest that's really
well<00:01:01.610> represented<00:01:02.120> in<00:01:02.239> this<00:01:02.360> kind<00:01:02.630> of<00:01:02.720> medium

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
well represented in this kind of medium

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.569 
well represented in this kind of medium
my<00:01:05.869> favorite<00:01:06.380> part<00:01:06.649> of<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:06.890> combat<00:01:07.340> for<00:01:07.490> the

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
my favorite part of the combat for the

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.730 
my favorite part of the combat for the
force<00:01:07.759> unleashed<00:01:07.939> 2<00:01:08.329> is<00:01:08.630> that<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.350> Sabres

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
force unleashed 2 is that the Sabres

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.010 
force unleashed 2 is that the Sabres
actually<00:01:10.189> matter<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:11.240> now<00:01:11.420> carry<00:01:11.750> two

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
actually matter and now carry two

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.660 
actually matter and now carry two
instead<00:01:12.350> of<00:01:12.409> one<00:01:12.499> and<00:01:12.950> not<00:01:13.189> only<00:01:13.310> does<00:01:13.520> that

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
instead of one and not only does that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.309 
instead of one and not only does that
look<00:01:13.909> impressive<00:01:14.359> because<00:01:14.719> you<00:01:14.869> have<00:01:15.049> twice

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.319 
look impressive because you have twice

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.200 
look impressive because you have twice
as<00:01:15.350> much<00:01:15.679> weapon<00:01:16.069> as<00:01:16.189> you<00:01:16.310> used<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.639> but<00:01:17.090> it

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
as much weapon as you used to but it

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.849 
as much weapon as you used to but it
really<00:01:17.329> allowed<00:01:17.569> us<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.780> evolve<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.439> combat

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
really allowed us to evolve the combat

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.709 
really allowed us to evolve the combat
system<00:01:19.039> and<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.819> way<00:01:19.939> you<00:01:19.999> interact<00:01:20.359> with<00:01:20.569> the

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
system and the way you interact with the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.899 
system and the way you interact with the
enemies<00:01:21.109> the<00:01:21.770> number<00:01:21.979> of<00:01:22.009> hits<00:01:22.399> are<00:01:22.549> able<00:01:22.759> to

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
enemies the number of hits are able to

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.330 
enemies the number of hits are able to
achieve<00:01:23.179> on<00:01:23.719> a<00:01:23.749> given<00:01:24.109> target<00:01:24.409> are<00:01:24.859> obviously

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
achieve on a given target are obviously

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.190 
achieve on a given target are obviously
much<00:01:25.579> faster<00:01:26.090> now<00:01:26.119> with<00:01:26.569> being<00:01:26.869> able<00:01:27.020> to<00:01:27.079> do

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
much faster now with being able to do

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.830 
much faster now with being able to do
two<00:01:27.409> hits<00:01:27.789> we<00:01:28.789> also<00:01:28.939> be<00:01:29.240> able<00:01:29.329> to<00:01:29.450> do<00:01:29.569> a<00:01:29.600> duel

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
two hits we also be able to do a duel

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.590 
two hits we also be able to do a duel

to decapitate guys now the changes we
made<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.939> lightsaber<00:01:38.450> really<00:01:38.779> lend<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.139> lot

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
made the lightsaber really lend a lot

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.349 
made the lightsaber really lend a lot
more<00:01:39.499> to<00:01:39.649> the<00:01:39.770> realism<00:01:40.219> and<00:01:40.639> immersion<00:01:41.090> that

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
more to the realism and immersion that

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
the player will experience in the game

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.469 
the player will experience in the game
it's<00:01:42.979> not<00:01:43.159> just<00:01:43.369> like<00:01:43.399> a<00:01:43.520> baseball<00:01:43.759> bat<00:01:44.119> it's

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
it's not just like a baseball bat it's

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.849 
it's not just like a baseball bat it's
going<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.630> be<00:01:44.719> much<00:01:44.840> more<00:01:44.899> like<00:01:45.439> what<00:01:45.619> Star

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
going to be much more like what Star

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.980 
going to be much more like what Star
Wars<00:01:46.039> fans<00:01:46.219> have<00:01:46.369> seen<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.670> movies

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.230 

we've<00:01:49.990> also<00:01:50.170> added<00:01:50.440> some<00:01:50.620> unique<00:01:51.280> force

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
we've also added some unique force

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.240 
we've also added some unique force
powers<00:01:52.540> that<00:01:52.660> didn't<00:01:52.870> exist<00:01:53.050> before<00:01:53.230> we<00:01:54.130> have

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
powers that didn't exist before we have

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.380 
powers that didn't exist before we have
a<00:01:54.280> brand-new<00:01:54.580> force<00:01:54.850> power<00:01:55.060> in<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.210> game

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
a brand-new force power in the game

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.060 
a brand-new force power in the game
which<00:01:55.660> is<00:01:55.840> sort<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.110> an<00:01:56.230> Unleashed<00:01:56.500> version<00:01:56.980> of

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.100 
which is sort of an Unleashed version of
Jedi<00:01:57.250> mind<00:01:57.550> trick<00:01:57.820> we've<00:01:58.060> sort<00:01:58.330> of<00:01:58.360> reimagined

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
Jedi mind trick we've sort of reimagined

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.110 
Jedi mind trick we've sort of reimagined
it<00:01:59.230> for<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.800> unleashed<00:02:00.160> franchise<00:02:00.670> these

aren't the droids you're looking for
parking<00:02:05.080> we<00:02:05.590> took<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.040> next<00:02:06.130> level<00:02:06.340> you

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
parking we took it to the next level you

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.310 
parking we took it to the next level you
basically<00:02:07.150> get<00:02:07.480> a<00:02:07.540> trooper<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:07.990> you<00:02:08.170> turn

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
basically get a trooper and you turn

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.719 
basically get a trooper and you turn
them<00:02:08.440> into<00:02:08.530> your<00:02:08.710> ally<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.310> what<00:02:09.429> he'll<00:02:09.550> do<00:02:09.700> is

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
them into your ally and what he'll do is

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.010 
them into your ally and what he'll do is
you'll<00:02:09.940> turn<00:02:10.119> around<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.570> attack<00:02:10.840> other

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
you'll turn around to attack other

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.660 
you'll turn around to attack other
troopers<00:02:11.470> they<00:02:11.890> actually<00:02:12.070> might<00:02:12.340> get<00:02:12.520> so

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
troopers they actually might get so

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.220 
troopers they actually might get so
confused<00:02:12.910> that<00:02:13.390> they'll<00:02:13.810> try<00:02:13.960> to<00:02:14.020> commit

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
confused that they'll try to commit

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.780 
confused that they'll try to commit
suicide<00:02:16.350> they<00:02:17.350> go<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:17.770> crazy<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.610> can

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
suicide they go so crazy you can

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.220

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
actually have them go into a bunch of

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.750 
actually have them go into a bunch of
other<00:02:20.380> troopers<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:20.950> explode<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.550> they<00:02:21.610> all

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
other troopers and explode and they all

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.430 
other troopers and explode and they all
just<00:02:22.000> fly<00:02:22.420> into<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.810> air<00:02:22.840> because<00:02:23.290> it's

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
just fly into the air because it's

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.220 
just fly into the air because it's
basically<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.890> ball<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:25.720> another<00:02:25.840> way<00:02:26.020> that<00:02:26.200> we

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
basically a ball but another way that we

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.900 
basically a ball but another way that we
really<00:02:26.560> expose<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.220> amped<00:02:27.550> up<00:02:27.640> out<00:02:27.880> of

fury all of your powers go they were 10
now<00:02:34.959> they're<00:02:35.140> 100<00:02:35.590> for<00:02:36.040> example<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:36.610> can

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
now they're 100 for example you can

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.670 
now they're 100 for example you can
actually<00:02:37.150> grab<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:37.390> TS<00:02:37.840> TS<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.230> crush<00:02:38.500> them

actually grab a TS TS and crush them
into<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:38.950> ball<00:02:39.190> then<00:02:39.490> use<00:02:39.670> lightning<00:02:39.940> against

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
into a ball then use lightning against

into a ball then use lightning against
them<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.630> turn<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:41.020> into<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.350> cannonball<00:02:41.890> you

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
them and turn that into a cannonball you

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.520 
them and turn that into a cannonball you
can<00:02:42.280> throw<00:02:42.490> against<00:02:42.880> other<00:02:43.000> enemies<00:02:43.390> or<00:02:44.350> you

can use another power call force repulse

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.810 
can use another power call force repulse
you<00:02:46.720> let<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.170> go<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.709> literally<00:02:48.070> disintegrates

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
you let it go it literally disintegrates

with this force fury mode they really

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.199 
with this force fury mode they really
give<00:02:53.200> this<00:02:53.590> new<00:02:54.040> definition<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.790> what<00:02:55.120> it

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209

give this new definition to what it
feels<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.720> be<00:02:55.750> unleashed<00:02:56.230> in<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.500> game

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
feels to be unleashed in the game

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.190 
feels to be unleashed in the game
another<00:02:58.030> feature<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.450> we<00:02:58.630> really<00:02:58.870> worked<00:02:59.050> on

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
another feature that we really worked on

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.810 
another feature that we really worked on
to<00:02:59.470> improve<00:02:59.620> the<00:03:00.070> interaction<00:03:00.640> with<00:03:00.670> the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
you play through it the choices that you

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.340 
you play through it the choices that you
have<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.489> grip<00:03:09.700> things<00:03:10.000> or<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.480> target<00:03:11.170> things

or<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.739> throw<00:03:12.459> things<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:13.000> much<00:03:13.510> more<00:03:13.750> accurate

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
or to throw things is much more accurate

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.560 
or to throw things is much more accurate
than<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.410> used<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.650> be<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:15.519> tied<00:03:15.910> with<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.269> much

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
than it used to be that tied with a much

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.690 
than it used to be that tied with a much
more<00:03:16.780> improved<00:03:17.019> camera<00:03:17.290> really<00:03:18.220> allows<00:03:18.489> you

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
more improved camera really allows you

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.759 
more improved camera really allows you
to<00:03:18.880> interact<00:03:19.450> with<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.989> environments<00:03:20.650> and

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
to interact with the environments and

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
visual characteristics but also we've

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.630 
visual characteristics but also we've
designed<00:03:32.049> very<00:03:32.470> specific<00:03:32.920> units<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.430> have

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
designed very specific units to have

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
resistances to force powers as you

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.250 
resistances to force powers as you
progress<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:40.180> become<00:03:40.269> more<00:03:40.450> more<00:03:40.780> powerful

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
progress and become more more powerful

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.140 
progress and become more more powerful
you<00:03:41.500> will<00:03:41.650> find<00:03:41.890> more<00:03:42.160> more<00:03:42.370> powerful<00:03:42.790> enemies

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
you will find more more powerful enemies

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.330 
you will find more more powerful enemies
for<00:03:43.690> example<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.140> Gorog<00:03:44.470> this<00:03:44.709> big<00:03:45.040> eight

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
for example the Gorog this big eight

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.729 
for example the Gorog this big eight
monster<00:03:46.120> type<00:03:46.360> creature<00:03:46.570> that<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.410> have<00:03:47.620> to

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
monster type creature that you have to

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.470 
monster type creature that you have to
use<00:03:47.860> very<00:03:48.070> specific<00:03:48.519> force<00:03:48.760> powers<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.269> order

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
use very specific force powers in order

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.960 
use very specific force powers in order
to<00:03:49.570> defeat<00:03:49.900> another<00:03:50.769> one<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.100> note<00:03:51.310> is<00:03:51.730> this

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
to defeat another one to note is this

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.820 
to defeat another one to note is this
big<00:03:52.180> titan<00:03:52.570> spider<00:03:52.870> four-legged<00:03:53.620> creature

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
big titan spider four-legged creature

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.770 
big titan spider four-legged creature
that<00:03:54.130> very<00:03:54.610> much<00:03:54.850> attacks<00:03:55.209> you<00:03:55.420> in<00:03:55.569> ways<00:03:55.750> that

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
that very much attacks you in ways that

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.420 
that very much attacks you in ways that
are<00:03:56.140> very<00:03:56.410> different<00:03:56.590> than<00:03:56.740> the<00:03:56.890> garage<00:03:57.010> so

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
are very different than the garage so

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.949 
are very different than the garage so
you<00:03:57.520> have<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.760> use<00:03:57.970> different<00:03:58.360> force<00:03:58.599> powers

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
you have to use different force powers

00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:59.320 
you have to use different force powers
to

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
to

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.130 
to
defeat<00:03:59.600> him<00:04:01.150> it's<00:04:02.150> amazingly<00:04:02.660> fun<00:04:02.960> to

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
defeat him it's amazingly fun to

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.470 
defeat him it's amazingly fun to
actually<00:04:03.350> grab<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:04.010> force<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.550> play<00:04:05.150> with<00:04:05.360> it

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
actually grab the force and play with it

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:37.290 
actually grab the force and play with it
like<00:04:05.600> it's<00:04:05.780> never<00:04:05.960> been<00:04:06.140> done<00:04:06.200> before

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300
