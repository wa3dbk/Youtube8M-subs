00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello good morning to all 98 we are here 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.379
 in banking to watch a lestÃ³n tutorial 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.880
 quite useful and simple today I will explain 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.710
 how to make a furnace completely 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.570
 2 x 3 automatic 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.610
 surely you're sick of you coming from 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.650
 the mine or to explore and we come with 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.910
 many materials to burn and we have 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.619
 to make several ovens to burn it 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.600
 without individually or wait for not 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.580
 burn and change the manual way this 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.199
 year is completely thematic with one of 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.300
 coal we can burn up to eight objects 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.640
 automatically like here we can 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.650
 see we put the objects and here it goes 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.329
 burning as we can observe now 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.280
 same is going to burn gold bullion 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.620
 of gold and here 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.780
 here it appears and disappears instantly and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.969
 go to the next gold right now it's 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.399
 with gold and finished as moving to 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.129
 next that is the iron how can we 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.500
 observe and put the iron and where the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.449
 gold because here the chest falls the side here 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.070
 the material that burns in the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.780
 oven every time you eat the material 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.410
 will come here as it is going to happen now with the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.260
 iron you can see it is completely very 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.239
 useful and it serves us for many things is 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.550
 super compact as you can see is here 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.500
 hidden now is a mister mechanism 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.330
 and it's pretty easy to build we're going to 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.040
 see it to build this mechanism 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.810
 we will use all these objects worth 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.030
 first we will place two spaces 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.830
 in the place where we want to put what 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.850
 we will put the lopera pointing towards 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.860
 up and a hopper attached to it is worth and 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.260
 above the hopper we will put the oven and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.240
 above the drop in the chest a 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.240
 then we will do here a kind of 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.280
 here we will put the buyer here 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.850
 we will put the pool better stone and a 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.100
 repeater to 4 ticks forgiveness is done 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.050
 the mechanism so simple is how can 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.580
 observe can come here let's catch 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.500
 Well, everything has been burned here 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.100
 you can observe let's take a little bit of 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.479
 which one 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.549
 and same as iron is worth a bit of air 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.190
 as we can see we put here 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.619
 our materials and as soon as it burns 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.270
 will happen in this chest now this is a 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.060
 optional way we can put here a 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.799
 hopper to be able to put more than six 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.230
 different materials ie the gap 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.840
 from here and 6 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.850
 that's optional I recommend putting it 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.900
 here since it will come to us better and as 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.900
 let's observe it works already 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.550
 perfectly surely the only 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.860
 problem is that the system 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.740
 reston thing can only hold a 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.090
 total of 2 items at a time, that is, if 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.430
 here we put two items as you can see 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.530
 absorbs them and puts them in the chest but 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.210
 if we put more than two items at the same time 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.860
 blocks as you see see it's over 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.380
 block and until we break it is 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.930
 answer here is not unlocked is a 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.310
 The only mistake you have is to say is the 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.740
 only thing that can happen to you like this for 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.900
 to break but one thing that is 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.220
 our favor is that this takes a long time and 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.360
 another thing that many things come from 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.450
 hit that we use a mod 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.950
 or something like that will never happen is to say another 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.490
 thing that we force it like 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.490
 we have done now 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.180
 well I hope you liked this 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.709
 reston tutorial if you already know if it has 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.080
 liked to subscribe to the channel for 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.239
 say more material like this and remember 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.080
 give you the favorite lay and see you in 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.080
 the next video goodbye
