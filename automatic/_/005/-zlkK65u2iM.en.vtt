00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
school football team and they have this

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.310

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
history of losing every playoff game so

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.470 
history of losing every playoff game so
they<00:00:28.470> haven't<00:00:28.859> won<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.400> playoff<00:00:29.460> game<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.029> 40

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.479 
years so I'm guessing maybe they win a
playoff<00:00:33.750> game<00:00:33.870> soon<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.770> almost<00:00:35.040> forgot<00:00:35.430> to
