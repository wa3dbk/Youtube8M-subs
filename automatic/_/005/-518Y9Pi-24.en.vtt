00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.699 
y to the edge and I guess I don't know
why<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:14.670> it's<00:02:14.850> cool-looking<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:16.230> know<00:02:16.440> it

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
also kind of feels cheap at the same

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.720 
also kind of feels cheap at the same
time<00:02:18.540> because<00:02:18.780> I've<00:02:19.200> had<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.410> problem<00:02:19.830> which

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
time because I've had a problem which

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.100

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
you can't really see on this one but it

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.660 
you can't really see on this one but it
looks<00:02:22.530> like<00:02:22.620> it's<00:02:22.800> almost<00:02:23.040> starting<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.490> come

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
looks like it's almost starting to come

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.100 
looks like it's almost starting to come
apart<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:24.209> little<00:02:24.360> bit<00:02:24.950> um<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:27.000> microSD<00:02:27.690> this

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.599 
really cool like that line also I don't
have<00:04:11.320> that<00:04:11.350> much<00:04:11.890> time<00:04:12.100> left<00:04:12.160> but<00:04:12.489> it's

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
have that much time left but it's

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:18.550 
have that much time left but it's
confusing<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:13.000> update

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.190 

performance<00:04:19.190> of<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.430> card<00:04:19.700> that's<00:04:20.450> pretty

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
performance of the card that's pretty

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.710 
performance of the card that's pretty
good<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.919> runs<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.730> games<00:04:22.970> are<00:04:23.180> really<00:04:23.300> fast

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
good it runs the games are really fast

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.409 
good it runs the games are really fast
and<00:04:23.990> like<00:04:24.139> a<00:04:24.169> ace<00:04:24.440> card<00:04:24.770> which<00:04:24.980> slowed<00:04:25.730> down<00:04:25.970> a

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
and like a ace card which slowed down a

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.400 
and like a ace card which slowed down a
lot<00:04:26.870> and<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:28.850> loading<00:04:29.330> of<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.630> games<00:04:30.080> took<00:04:30.320> a

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
lot and the loading of the games took a

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.650 
lot and the loading of the games took a
lot<00:04:30.560> of<00:04:30.590> time<00:04:30.740> on<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.130> acekard<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:32.000> had<00:04:32.600> a

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
lot of time on the acekard I had a

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.000 
lot of time on the acekard I had a
problem<00:04:32.870> with<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.110> couple<00:04:33.350> games<00:04:33.500> slowing<00:04:33.860> down

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
problem with a couple games slowing down

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.159 
problem with a couple games slowing down
but<00:04:34.220> that's<00:04:34.310> natural<00:04:34.669> and<00:04:35.660> it<00:04:35.870> doesn't

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
but that's natural and it doesn't

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.280 
but that's natural and it doesn't
basically<00:04:36.230> that<00:04:36.590> old<00:04:36.830> cards<00:04:37.280> but<00:04:38.090> um<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:39.169> can

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
basically that old cards but um you can

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.720 
basically that old cards but um you can
actually<00:04:39.440> slow<00:04:39.919> down<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.250> game's<00:04:40.460> manual

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
actually slow down the game's manual

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.550 
actually slow down the game's manual
which<00:04:41.150> is<00:04:41.270> cool<00:04:41.510> i<00:04:41.570> showed<00:04:41.960> it<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.169> little<00:04:42.350> bit

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
which is cool i showed it a little bit

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:50.110 
which is cool i showed it a little bit
on<00:04:42.710> a<00:04:43.480> shoot<00:04:44.480> a<00:04:44.510> little<00:04:44.840> bit<00:04:45.190> on<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.490> last<00:04:49.120> the

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
on a shoot a little bit on the last the

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.969 
on a shoot a little bit on the last the
last<00:04:50.150> video<00:04:50.810> i<00:04:50.990> just<00:04:51.350> showed<00:04:51.560> you<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.800> menu

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
last video i just showed you the menu

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.150 
last video i just showed you the menu
real<00:04:52.250> quick<00:04:52.280> but<00:04:52.669> uh<00:04:52.700> is<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.750> actual<00:04:54.169> look<00:04:55.010> of

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
real quick but uh is the actual look of

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.719 
real quick but uh is the actual look of
it<00:04:55.310> so<00:04:56.270> I'll<00:04:57.020> slow<00:04:57.470> it<00:04:57.500> down<00:04:57.650> by<00:04:59.560> 50%<00:05:00.560> also<00:05:01.460> dan

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
it so I'll slow it down by 50% also dan

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.969 
it so I'll slow it down by 50% also dan

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
just slows down the game no real use for

just slows down the game no real use for
but<00:05:25.760> it's<00:05:25.940> kind<00:05:26.150> of<00:05:26.210> cool<00:05:26.419> cool<00:05:26.900> little<00:05:27.080> option

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
but it's kind of cool cool little option

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.370
