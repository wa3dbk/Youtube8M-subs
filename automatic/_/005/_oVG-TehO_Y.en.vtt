00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.670 
you simply play it on one of the sides
in<00:02:32.190> front<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.930> on<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.110> different<00:02:34.410> cards

on and so forth

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.580 
on and so forth
and<00:02:40.970> I'm<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.180> randomly<00:02:42.570> playing<00:02:43.230> here

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
and I'm just randomly playing here

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.229 
and I'm just randomly playing here
without<00:02:44.130> even<00:02:44.430> trying<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.760> do<00:02:44.850> any<00:02:45.000> kind<00:02:45.180> of

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
without even trying to do any kind of

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.550 
without even trying to do any kind of
strategy<00:02:45.420> just<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.900> show<00:02:46.079> you<00:02:46.140> what<00:02:46.380> an

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
strategy just to show you what an

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.600 
strategy just to show you what an
endgame<00:02:47.130> setup<00:02:47.610> might<00:02:47.820> look<00:02:47.970> like<00:02:48.500> that

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
endgame setup might look like that

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.920 
endgame setup might look like that
everyone<00:02:50.610> has<00:02:50.760> played<00:02:51.000> cards<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.660> last

everyone has played cards the last
player<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.650> go<00:02:52.859> then<00:02:53.160> it's<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.400> other<00:02:53.519> players

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790

these cards to score let's say for

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.080 
these cards to score let's say for
example<00:02:58.769> they<00:02:58.920> pick<00:02:59.160> this<00:02:59.340> card<00:02:59.700> here<00:02:59.970> to

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
example they pick this card here to

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.960 
example they pick this card here to
score<00:03:00.359> and<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:01.650> I'm<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.280> player<00:03:02.459> who<00:03:02.700> picked

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
score and it I'm the player who picked

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.170 
score and it I'm the player who picked
it<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:03.930> will<00:03:04.260> pick<00:03:04.500> either<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:05.190> mobster

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180

it so I will pick either the mobster
here<00:03:06.420> or<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.810> Dames<00:03:07.079> so<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.620> picked<00:03:07.920> Damien's

here or the Dames so I picked Damien's

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.340 
here or the Dames so I picked Damien's
and<00:03:08.549> that<00:03:09.180> means<00:03:09.390> we're<00:03:09.540> gonna<00:03:09.660> use<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.140> Dame

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
and that means we're gonna use the Dame

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.900 
and that means we're gonna use the Dame
symbols<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.070> have<00:03:11.400> one

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
symbols I have one

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.870 
symbols I have one
my<00:03:12.269> opponent<00:03:12.660> has<00:03:12.720> zero<00:03:13.109> so<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:13.769> win<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.489> card

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
my opponent has zero so I win this card

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.500 
my opponent has zero so I win this card
and<00:03:15.720> it's<00:03:15.900> his<00:03:16.049> turn<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.440> pick<00:03:16.620> one<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:17.880> he

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
and it's his turn to pick one so he

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.840 
and it's his turn to pick one so he
looks<00:03:18.750> around<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.139> he<00:03:19.320> has<00:03:19.769> no<00:03:20.100> symbols<00:03:20.609> here

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
looks around and he has no symbols here

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.010 
looks around and he has no symbols here
so<00:03:21.359> he<00:03:21.510> picks<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:22.019> one<00:03:22.199> here<00:03:22.380> he<00:03:22.590> picks<00:03:22.769> the

so he picks this one here he picks the
mobster<00:03:23.410> but<00:03:23.950> he<00:03:24.010> that's<00:03:24.370> unfortunate<00:03:24.940> for

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
mobster but he that's unfortunate for

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.210 
mobster but he that's unfortunate for
him<00:03:25.150> because<00:03:25.360> he<00:03:25.630> has<00:03:25.750> one<00:03:25.780> gun<00:03:26.290> why<00:03:26.830> I<00:03:26.860> have

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
him because he has one gun why I have

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.910 
him because he has one gun why I have
three<00:03:27.610> guns<00:03:27.820> so<00:03:28.270> I<00:03:28.330> also<00:03:28.540> win<00:03:28.840> this<00:03:28.990> card<00:03:29.320> then

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
have one dollar sign on each side so no

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.700

signs<00:03:46.150> because<00:03:46.810> neither<00:03:47.050> one<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.260> us<00:03:47.410> has

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
signs because neither one of us has

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.260 
signs because neither one of us has
these<00:03:47.980> symbols<00:03:48.460> on<00:03:48.670> our<00:03:48.820> side<00:03:49.030> of<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.120> border

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
these symbols on our side of the border

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.630 
these symbols on our side of the border
the<00:03:49.480> silhouettes<00:03:50.160> alright<00:03:51.160> does<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.520> make

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
the silhouettes alright does that make

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.390 
the silhouettes alright does that make
any<00:03:51.760> sense<00:03:52.120> probably<00:03:52.660> not<00:03:52.840> basically<00:03:53.590> you

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
any sense probably not basically you

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.980 
any sense probably not basically you
want<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:54.820> have<00:03:54.910> these<00:03:55.180> silhouettes<00:03:55.540> on<00:03:55.840> your

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
want to have these silhouettes on your

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.630 
want to have these silhouettes on your
site<00:03:56.200> because<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.620> allows<00:03:56.950> you<00:03:57.190> to<00:03:57.220> pick

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
site because that allows you to pick

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.720 
site because that allows you to pick
that<00:03:58.240> one<00:03:58.630> of<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.810> three<00:03:59.020> different<00:03:59.170> types

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
that one of the three different types

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.860 
that one of the three different types
either<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:01.360> power<00:04:01.600> Dames<00:04:02.290> or<00:04:02.650> money<00:04:03.870> the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
either the power Dames or money the

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.020 
either the power Dames or money the
problem<00:04:05.080> is<00:04:05.410> if<00:04:05.590> you<00:04:05.830> have<00:04:06.010> none<00:04:06.520> and<00:04:06.760> they<00:04:06.970> do

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
problem is if you have none and they do

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.820 
problem is if you have none and they do
have<00:04:07.330> a<00:04:07.450> type<00:04:07.660> you<00:04:07.870> have<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:08.110> pick<00:04:08.380> their<00:04:08.560> type

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
have a type you have to pick their type

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.880 
have a type you have to pick their type
so<00:04:09.520> play<00:04:09.820> these<00:04:10.120> types<00:04:10.450> on<00:04:10.750> your<00:04:11.380> side<00:04:11.650> gives

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
so play these types on your side gives

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.290 
so play these types on your side gives
you<00:04:11.980> more<00:04:12.130> control<00:04:12.490> put<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:12.880> cards<00:04:13.150> with

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
you more control put the cards with

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.970 
you more control put the cards with
types<00:04:13.510> in<00:04:13.660> them<00:04:13.780> usually<00:04:14.290> don't<00:04:14.620> have<00:04:14.740> as<00:04:14.860> many

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
types in them usually don't have as many

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.940 
types in them usually don't have as many
symbols<00:04:15.580> also<00:04:16.450> if<00:04:16.870> your<00:04:17.049> top<00:04:17.320> card<00:04:17.709> is<00:04:17.920> a

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
symbols also if your top card is a

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.800 
symbols also if your top card is a
victory<00:04:18.459> point<00:04:18.730> then<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.150> will<00:04:19.180> get<00:04:19.570> that

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
victory point then you will get that

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.110 
victory point then you will get that
victory<00:04:20.020> point<00:04:20.440> add<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.890> to<00:04:21.010> your<00:04:21.160> side<00:04:21.400> so<00:04:22.090> you

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
victory point add it to your side so you

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.400 
victory point add it to your side so you
might<00:04:22.330> want<00:04:22.510> to<00:04:22.540> put<00:04:22.660> those<00:04:22.780> on<00:04:22.840> top<00:04:23.110> just<00:04:23.290> to

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
might want to put those on top just to

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.350 
might want to put those on top just to
get<00:04:23.560> some<00:04:23.740> more<00:04:23.860> victory<00:04:24.160> points<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:24.760> there

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
get some more victory points and there

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.910 
get some more victory points and there
are<00:04:25.480> even<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.780> few<00:04:25.810> of<00:04:26.140> the<00:04:26.230> cards<00:04:26.560> which<00:04:26.770> are

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
are even a few of the cards which are

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.380 
are even a few of the cards which are
more<00:04:27.070> powerful<00:04:27.130> than<00:04:27.640> others<00:04:27.820> which<00:04:28.210> aren't

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
more powerful than others which aren't

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.960 
more powerful than others which aren't
worth<00:04:28.600> negative<00:04:28.930> victory<00:04:29.470> points<00:04:29.860> so<00:04:30.820> the

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
worth negative victory points so the

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.030 
worth negative victory points so the
game<00:04:31.150> is<00:04:31.330> really<00:04:31.840> kind<00:04:32.380> of<00:04:32.470> mind-bending

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
game is really kind of mind-bending

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.040 
game is really kind of mind-bending
because<00:04:33.580> you're<00:04:33.760> trying<00:04:34.000> to<00:04:34.120> get<00:04:34.270> as<00:04:34.510> many

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
because you're trying to get as many

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.500 
because you're trying to get as many
symbols<00:04:35.530> of<00:04:35.650> each<00:04:35.740> type<00:04:36.070> on<00:04:36.370> your<00:04:37.060> side<00:04:37.300> or<00:04:37.450> at

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
symbols of each type on your side or at

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.510 
symbols of each type on your side or at
least<00:04:37.690> as<00:04:37.840> many<00:04:37.960> symbols<00:04:38.380> of<00:04:38.470> one<00:04:38.680> type<00:04:38.920> but

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
least as many symbols of one type but

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.620 
least as many symbols of one type but
then<00:04:39.610> you<00:04:39.700> want<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:39.910> make<00:04:40.000> sure<00:04:40.030> that's<00:04:40.450> the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
then you want to make sure that's the

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.870 
then you want to make sure that's the
type<00:04:40.810> that's<00:04:41.080> chosen<00:04:41.680> when<00:04:42.100> determining<00:04:42.670> who

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
type that's chosen when determining who

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.390 
type that's chosen when determining who
wins<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.420> asset<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.740> cards<00:04:45.100> usually

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
wins that asset and the cards usually

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.980 
wins that asset and the cards usually
don't<00:04:45.850> match<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.240> type<00:04:46.450> see<00:04:46.750> for<00:04:46.930> example

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
don't match the type see for example

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.800 
don't match the type see for example
here<00:04:47.530> we<00:04:47.680> have<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.280> mobster<00:04:48.760> who<00:04:49.270> works<00:04:49.540> with

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
here we have the mobster who works with

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.050 
here we have the mobster who works with
guns<00:04:50.140> but<00:04:50.650> there<00:04:50.800> are<00:04:50.950> no<00:04:51.160> guns<00:04:51.490> in<00:04:51.700> the<00:04:51.820> card

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
guns but there are no guns in the card

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.030 
guns but there are no guns in the card
instead<00:04:52.420> of<00:04:52.510> just<00:04:52.630> dames<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.140> money<00:04:53.290> so

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
instead of just dames and money so

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.680 
instead of just dames and money so
hopefully<00:04:54.490> you<00:04:54.610> have<00:04:54.640> enough<00:04:55.000> guns<00:04:55.300> on<00:04:55.540> the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
hopefully you have enough guns on the

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.930 
hopefully you have enough guns on the
card<00:04:55.930> already<00:04:56.560> or<00:04:56.800> on<00:04:57.310> your<00:04:57.460> side<00:04:57.670> are<00:04:57.790> ready

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
card already or on your side are ready

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.570 
card already or on your side are ready
to<00:04:58.150> win<00:04:58.330> that<00:04:58.570> card<00:04:59.010> well<00:05:00.010> I<00:05:00.040> said<00:05:00.310> it's<00:05:00.430> a<00:05:00.460> bit

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
to win that card well I said it's a bit

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.400 
to win that card well I said it's a bit
of<00:05:00.670> a<00:05:00.760> mind<00:05:01.090> warp<00:05:01.330> err<00:05:01.540> to<00:05:01.630> play<00:05:01.870> but<00:05:02.170> it's<00:05:02.290> very

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
of a mind warp err to play but it's very

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.800 
of a mind warp err to play but it's very
simple<00:05:02.980> if<00:05:03.070> you<00:05:03.190> think<00:05:03.430> about<00:05:03.520> it<00:05:03.790> there's<00:05:04.420> 12

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
simple if you think about it there's 12

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.530 
simple if you think about it there's 12
cards<00:05:05.200> between<00:05:05.530> two<00:05:05.680> players<00:05:06.010> and<00:05:06.340> each<00:05:06.910> of<00:05:07.060> so

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
cards between two players and each of so

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.780 
cards between two players and each of so
each<00:05:07.690> of<00:05:07.840> you<00:05:07.990> is<00:05:08.110> gonna<00:05:08.260> put<00:05:08.890> out<00:05:09.040> probably

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
each of you is gonna put out probably

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.360 
each of you is gonna put out probably
six<00:05:10.210> cards<00:05:10.600> and<00:05:10.810> then<00:05:11.290> you<00:05:11.320> have<00:05:11.650> two<00:05:12.070> choices

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
six cards and then you have two choices

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.490 
six cards and then you have two choices
out<00:05:12.700> of<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:12.880> four<00:05:13.120> assets<00:05:13.540> to<00:05:13.690> take<00:05:13.870> so<00:05:14.440> you

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
out of the four assets to take so you

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.230 
out of the four assets to take so you
are<00:05:14.680> making<00:05:14.800> eight<00:05:15.160> decisions<00:05:15.850> over<00:05:16.120> the

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
are making eight decisions over the

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.690 
are making eight decisions over the
course<00:05:16.450> of<00:05:16.540> a<00:05:16.660> game<00:05:16.870> it's<00:05:17.500> very<00:05:17.740> simple<00:05:18.400> and

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
course of a game it's very simple and

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.240 
course of a game it's very simple and
yet<00:05:19.150> it<00:05:19.390> seems<00:05:20.020> you<00:05:20.560> know<00:05:20.680> I<00:05:20.710> played<00:05:21.010> it<00:05:21.160> and

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
yet it seems you know I played it and

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:44.229 
try out the game and see what you think
of<00:05:42.529> it<00:05:42.649> I<00:05:42.889> like<00:05:43.129> it<00:05:43.399> it's<00:05:43.550> a<00:05:43.639> two-player<00:05:43.969> game

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:44.239 
of it I like it it's a two-player game

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:46.239 
of it I like it it's a two-player game
it's<00:05:44.389> certainly<00:05:44.599> a<00:05:44.689> quirky<00:05:45.169> one<00:05:45.349> not<00:05:45.979> wanting

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:46.249 
it's certainly a quirky one not wanting

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:47.679 
it's certainly a quirky one not wanting
to<00:05:46.309> bring<00:05:46.580> it<00:05:46.729> all<00:05:46.879> the<00:05:46.969> time<00:05:47.179> but<00:05:47.330> when<00:05:47.449> you<00:05:47.539> do

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:47.689 
to bring it all the time but when you do

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:49.959 
to bring it all the time but when you do
bring<00:05:47.929> it<00:05:48.019> out<00:05:48.169> expect<00:05:48.979> to<00:05:49.099> play<00:05:49.249> several

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:49.969 
bring it out expect to play several

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:51.699 
bring it out expect to play several
games<00:05:50.330> of<00:05:50.539> it<00:05:50.629> in<00:05:50.749> a<00:05:50.839> row<00:05:50.869> theme<00:05:51.529> is

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:51.709 
games of it in a row theme is

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:54.609 
games of it in a row theme is
superfluous<00:05:52.159> of<00:05:52.369> course<00:05:52.839> but<00:05:53.839> the<00:05:53.989> idea<00:05:54.409> is

00:05:54.609 --> 00:05:54.619 
superfluous of course but the idea is

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:57.309 
superfluous of course but the idea is
just<00:05:54.649> a<00:05:54.889> bit<00:05:55.039> wonky<00:05:55.360> trying<00:05:56.360> to<00:05:56.449> place<00:05:56.689> cards

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319

so that they help you but at the same
time<00:06:00.050> a<00:06:00.110> card<00:06:00.439> never<00:06:00.649> helps<00:06:01.039> you<00:06:01.159> as<00:06:01.279> much<00:06:01.489> as
