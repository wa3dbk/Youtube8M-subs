00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:09.330
 my warm hello was both of us and 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.580
 Today it's about what tastes better 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.320
 mcdonald's or burger king 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.340
 we will discuss again today 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.529
 what are you burger king 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:25.619
 the maeckes m stands for masculinity 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.090
 courage massentierhaltung the 40 personally 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.470
 against you but I think you are too 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.960
 one of those probably to the mac 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.450
 is always menus only because of that 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.329
 bought extra large for the whole stick for 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.590
 monopoly winning games to collect everyone 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.180
 and in the end nothing wins 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.219
 because he only has the castle avenue 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.140
 and not the park road you know sooo 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.300
 that you always have the party I have 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.030
 is true yes there are people who 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.510
 Run for it extra and yes we 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.070
 collect it until now pretty much 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.300
 but if you are the same as if the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.879
 you can exchange us times 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.079
 Write if we like the the stickers 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.420
 from center but you can tell it 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.100
 actually totally wise only italy 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.520
 weeks at mcdonald's then burger 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.409
 king 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.689
 rapeseed mcdonald's is now available 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.750
 burger king then it comes to mcdonald's 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.760
 now with burger king 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.530
 can be just a problem 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.119
 celebrities how to work better 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.119
 as of mac is the scare 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:47.700
 how come robots made so well 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.920
 For example McDonald's have Ronald 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.920
 mcdonald steal what burger king has 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.360
 is a crown okay the reason one 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.690
 crown is in my opinion cool as 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.190
 pedophile klaus knows what one of the 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.020
 reasons is why I will someday 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.259
 decided not to go away as 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.660
 I have bad memories 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:12.750
 mac is done i have my happy meal 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.500
 I would probably just issued I 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.390
 not happy with it 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:25.410
 I'm supposed to be happy but I'm not 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:27.720
 happy then where is the consensus 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.340
 at the same time I would always be happy I have 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.720
 heard that burger king no 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.130
 but use meat as the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.989
 shoe soles what is there 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.350
 I have the same thing about max too 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.350
 belongs 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:45.120
 the restaurant to the golden m and in the 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.520
 rap scene by comparison like kool savas 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:53.560
 versus warrant or justin timberlake 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:56.280
 versys justin bieber warrant and 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.750
 fill a lot of the main character 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.330
 Do you actually know the fast food 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.790
 Weltformel know a formula as well as the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.460
 it is the one from Cappenberger you 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.890
 I do not like that I think that my way 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.910
 means mcus plus burger king is the same 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:24.040
 caves into it 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:32.880
 look less facebook this is the 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:35.740
 world of 100 videos logically - 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.910
 So then you have to go back is 100 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.790
 there is a small allusion to the 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:44.590
 world front the guys is such a big mac 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:47.770
 okay, but really juicy 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.780
 arugula salad without dressing there almost 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.320
 No salad comes to eat 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.090
 Okay our question is on now 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.590
 in any case, what you can find better mcus 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.280
