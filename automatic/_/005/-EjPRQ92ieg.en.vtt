unfortunately that drive doesn't work

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.639 
unfortunately that drive doesn't work
anymore<00:01:13.819> so<00:01:14.630> I<00:01:14.659> thought<00:01:14.990> well<00:01:15.229> I'd<00:01:15.469> like<00:01:15.590> to

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
anymore so I thought well I'd like to

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.739 
anymore so I thought well I'd like to
get<00:01:15.859> another<00:01:16.039> LightScribe<00:01:16.700> Drive<00:01:16.999> and<00:01:17.299> put<00:01:17.630> it

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
in my PC build as it turns out

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.539 
in my PC build as it turns out
LightScribe<00:01:21.020> drives<00:01:21.380> aren't<00:01:21.740> as<00:01:22.100> prevalent

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
LightScribe drives aren't as prevalent

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.730 
LightScribe drives aren't as prevalent
as<00:01:22.909> they<00:01:23.209> used<00:01:23.450> to<00:01:23.539> be<00:01:23.749> and<00:01:23.959> some<00:01:24.469> of<00:01:24.619> the

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
as they used to be and some of the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.910 
as they used to be and some of the
lesser<00:01:25.429> expensive<00:01:25.789> ones<00:01:26.270> were<00:01:26.929> around<00:01:27.200> 40<00:01:27.560> 50

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
lesser expensive ones were around 40 50

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.109 
lesser expensive ones were around 40 50
dollars<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.459> I<00:01:28.549> really<00:01:28.759> didn't<00:01:28.939> want<00:01:29.090> to

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
dollars and I really didn't want to

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.160 
dollars and I really didn't want to
spend<00:01:29.389> that<00:01:29.509> kind<00:01:29.569> of<00:01:29.869> money

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
spend that kind of money

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.249 
spend that kind of money
on<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.409> drive<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.399> I<00:01:31.429> just<00:01:31.729> put<00:01:31.969> a<00:01:31.999> regular<00:01:32.539> DVD

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
on a drive so I just put a regular DVD

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.859 
on a drive so I just put a regular DVD
drive<00:01:33.560> in<00:01:33.859> my<00:01:34.009> PC<00:01:34.399> build<00:01:34.639> but<00:01:35.179> now<00:01:35.329> I'm<00:01:35.539> without

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
drive in my PC build but now I'm without

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.870 
drive in my PC build but now I'm without
a<00:01:35.929> LightScribe<00:01:36.590> drive<00:01:36.859> so<00:01:37.099> I<00:01:37.130> looked<00:01:37.399> on<00:01:37.549> eBay

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
a LightScribe drive so I looked on eBay

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.429 
a LightScribe drive so I looked on eBay
and<00:01:38.029> I<00:01:38.119> found<00:01:38.329> this<00:01:38.479> one<00:01:38.539> and<00:01:38.990> I'll<00:01:39.229> probably

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
and I found this one and I'll probably

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.199 
and I found this one and I'll probably
just<00:01:39.709> break<00:01:39.979> it<00:01:40.159> out<00:01:40.249> when<00:01:40.670> I<00:01:40.700> want<00:01:40.999> to<00:01:41.060> do<00:01:41.179> a

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
just break it out when I want to do a

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:43.239 
just break it out when I want to do a
LightScribe<00:01:41.840> label<00:01:42.289> other<00:01:42.529> than<00:01:42.829> that<00:01:43.039> I

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
LightScribe label other than that I

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:46.959 
LightScribe label other than that I
don't<00:01:43.429> really<00:01:43.639> need<00:01:43.939> it<00:01:44.119> now<00:01:44.569> hopefully<00:01:45.969> being

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
don't really need it now hopefully being

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.169 
don't really need it now hopefully being
that<00:01:47.240> this<00:01:47.359> is<00:01:47.539> in<00:01:47.719> an<00:01:47.869> envelope

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
that this is in an envelope

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.730 
that this is in an envelope
hopefully<00:01:50.179> it's<00:01:50.299> packaged<00:01:50.840> well<00:01:51.079> enough<00:01:51.409> the

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
hopefully it's packaged well enough the

glossy plastic now this is a USB 2.0
drive<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:49.389> that<00:04:49.419> should<00:04:50.080> be<00:04:50.199> sufficient<00:04:50.830> for

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889

how<00:04:55.449> this<00:04:55.770> cord<00:04:56.770> situation<00:04:57.729> works<00:04:58.030> as<00:04:58.330> well

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
how this cord situation works as well

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
this computer actually doesn't have a an

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.860 
this computer actually doesn't have a an
optical<00:05:06.370> drive<00:05:06.490> in<00:05:06.759> it<00:05:06.879> even<00:05:07.569> though<00:05:07.659> it<00:05:07.750> has

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
optical drive in it even though it has

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.930 
optical drive in it even though it has
space<00:05:08.199> for<00:05:08.229> it<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:08.800> to<00:05:09.190> be<00:05:09.310> honest<00:05:09.610> I<00:05:09.729> haven't

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
space for it and to be honest I haven't

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.059 
space for it and to be honest I haven't
missed<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.569> but<00:05:11.050> again<00:05:11.259> the<00:05:11.590> reason<00:05:11.830> I<00:05:11.889> bought

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069 
missed it but again the reason I bought

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:13.860 
missed it but again the reason I bought
this<00:05:12.310> drive<00:05:12.610> is<00:05:12.639> because<00:05:13.180> of<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.360> LightScribe

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
this drive is because of the LightScribe

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.010 
this drive is because of the LightScribe
so<00:05:14.110> let's<00:05:14.680> put<00:05:15.069> it<00:05:15.159> over<00:05:15.219> here<00:05:15.509> now<00:05:16.509> I<00:05:16.569> want<00:05:16.990> to

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
so let's put it over here now I want to

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.839 
so let's put it over here now I want to
see<00:05:17.199> if<00:05:17.289> I<00:05:17.409> have<00:05:17.560> to<00:05:17.680> use<00:05:17.830> both<00:05:18.129> of<00:05:18.159> these<00:05:18.400> cords

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
see if I have to use both of these cords

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
assuming I'm going to have to use both

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.459 
assuming I'm going to have to use both

but let's just start with the regular
USB<00:05:26.469> to<00:05:27.400> micro-usb<00:05:30.629> and<00:05:31.710> see<00:05:32.710> if<00:05:32.949> the<00:05:33.370> computer

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.980 
USB to micro-usb and see if the computer
recognizes<00:05:34.690> anything<00:05:35.500> here<00:05:39.539> alright<00:05:40.539> says

the<00:06:47.270> power<00:06:47.659> cord<00:06:48.110> plugged<00:06:48.530> into<00:06:48.740> it<00:06:49.360> so

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
the power cord plugged into it so

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.270 
the power cord plugged into it so
apparently<00:06:50.900> it's<00:06:51.229> drawing<00:06:51.440> enough<00:06:51.650> power<00:06:51.919> off

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 
apparently it's drawing enough power off

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.659 
apparently it's drawing enough power off
of<00:06:52.340> just<00:06:53.240> the<00:06:53.680> USB<00:06:54.680> port<00:06:54.979> here<00:06:55.039> on<00:06:55.400> the

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669 
of just the USB port here on the

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.330 
of just the USB port here on the
computer<00:06:56.289> so<00:06:57.289> that's<00:06:57.470> good<00:06:57.740> I<00:06:57.770> assume<00:06:58.310> that

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
computer so that's good I assume that

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.610 
computer so that's good I assume that
the<00:06:58.759> other<00:06:58.940> cord<00:06:59.270> the<00:06:59.419> power<00:06:59.599> cord<00:06:59.960> portion<00:07:00.470> is

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
the other cord the power cord portion is

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.399 
the other cord the power cord portion is
only<00:07:01.310> necessary<00:07:01.699> if<00:07:02.419> you're<00:07:02.900> plugging<00:07:03.169> it

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:03.409 
only necessary if you're plugging it

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:07.240 
only necessary if you're plugging it
into<00:07:03.860> a<00:07:04.240> underpowered<00:07:05.240> or<00:07:05.719> low<00:07:06.229> powered<00:07:06.770> USB

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
into a underpowered or low powered USB

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.279 
into a underpowered or low powered USB
port<00:07:07.909> but<00:07:08.419> that's<00:07:08.569> going<00:07:08.690> to<00:07:08.750> do<00:07:08.870> it<00:07:08.990> for<00:07:09.199> this

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:09.289 
port but that's going to do it for this

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:10.749 
port but that's going to do it for this
