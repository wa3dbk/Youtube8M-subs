00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.769
 legends of cartoons the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.140
 which study at the university 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.720

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.600
 by box bonnie and the looney tunes the 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.640
 mythical stars of warner bros el

 path to glory is long and sown 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.810
 of obstacles and must resolve 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.460
 funny situations before accessing the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.460
 range of stars as their teachers 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.040
 on September 14, 2015 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.780
 the series will celebrate its 25th anniversary and 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.880
 Today we will discuss what will surely not 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.369
 you had noticed the series in these two 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.600
 decades and a half but that is what 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.600
 I speak with attention 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.650
 with time it on adventures the lord 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.380
 spielberg wanted to put the stick very high 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.630
 for others usually a drawing 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.900
 animated hovered around the 10,000 paintings 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.630
 per episode and he ambitioned 25 thousand 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.240
 frames per episode because of the German 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.280
 of at least 65 episodes for your 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.350
 first season that required the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.540
 television networks to accept 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.030
 program what was really a job 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.220
 titanic that amount of episodes 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.530
 required would take years to complete 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.140
 in a single animation studio but 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.510
 what was the solution the solution for the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.700
 production was to hire six studies 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.040
 of different animation this is the reason 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.130
 whereby chapter by chapter varies 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.380
 the detail animation quality that 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.900
 maybe after 25 years you did not have 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.120
 noticed that medi cartons had the worst 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.890
 quality of all were fired at 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.750
 term of the first season 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.670
 the episodes made by this 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.730
 study have several errors of 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.940
 animation 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.680
 you started to mount the difference and 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.750
 you started to remember that not all 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.730
 episodes look the same in those 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.890
 years you could not share images is 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.080
 as easy as we do it today via 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.519
 internet so that the warner bros 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.260
 entertainment 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.970
 if they want to review the work of the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.849
 other studies should be sent by 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.860
 airmail the images the drawings of 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.390
 startups are characterized by designing 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.700
 the characters with one more tone 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.250

 so you can see how it is that 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.819
 change the quality of the episode in 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.390
