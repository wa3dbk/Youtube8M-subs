is really really small in light and I

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.679 
is really really small in light and I
don't<00:00:22.949> know<00:00:23.100> if<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.430> can<00:00:23.580> really<00:00:23.789> convey<00:00:24.480> how

don't know if I can really convey how
light<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.109> computer<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.650> effectively<00:00:26.430> to

light this computer is effectively to
you<00:00:26.730> over<00:00:27.119> video<00:00:27.420> but<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.380> 2.4<00:00:29.039> pounds<00:00:29.220> I

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
you over video but it's 2.4 pounds I

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.950 
you over video but it's 2.4 pounds I
mean<00:00:29.789> that's<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.240> that's<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.900> thing

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
mean that's it that's all this thing

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.749 
mean that's it that's all this thing
weighs<00:00:31.289> two<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> half<00:00:32.160> pounds

weighs two and a half pounds

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.790 
weighs two and a half pounds
that's<00:00:33.120> less<00:00:33.480> than<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.989> lot<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> netbooks

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
that's less than a lot of the netbooks

graphics<00:01:38.220> chip<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.579> board<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.390> not

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
graphics chip on board so it's not

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.710 
graphics chip on board so it's not
exactly<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.710> be<00:01:40.950> say<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.850> gaming

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
exactly going to be say a gaming

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.899 
exactly going to be say a gaming
workhorse<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.860> graphics<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.399> board<00:01:44.640> are

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
workhorse the graphics on board are

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.969 
workhorse the graphics on board are
comparable<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.990> those<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.530> many<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.890> the

comparable to those in many of the
netbooks<00:01:47.460> out<00:01:47.700> there<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.210> going<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.570> be

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
netbooks out there so it's going to be

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.050 
netbooks out there so it's going to be
really<00:01:49.409> really<00:01:49.560> great<00:01:50.070> at<00:01:50.340> handling<00:01:50.549> all<00:01:51.030> of

3d gaming workhorse at all it has
Gigabit<00:01:59.729> LAN<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.509> board<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.079> if<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.290> plug<00:02:01.439> into

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
Gigabit LAN on board so if you plug into

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.139 
Gigabit LAN on board so if you plug into
Ethernet<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.130> are<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.640> get<00:02:02.759> gigabit

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
Ethernet you are going to get gigabit

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.850 
Ethernet you are going to get gigabit
speeds<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.780> are<00:02:03.869> plugged<00:02:04.110> into<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.409> gigabit

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
speeds if you are plugged into a gigabit

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.449 
speeds if you are plugged into a gigabit
network<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.570> said<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.069> weight<00:02:08.310> on
