00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.260
 After publishing the world’s first electronic piano in 1974, 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.840
 Roland is constantly innovating in the field of digital pianos. 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.320
 The new LX series piano is once again a great masterpiece. 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.660
 The LX-17 is equipped with the latest PHA-50 key mechanism, which is made of plastic and wood. 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.400
 The wood forms a stable weight that is familiar to each key. 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 The durable inner skeleton allows you to enjoy the Roland piano for a longer time. 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:59.220
 Each key is specially designed with a stabilizing bolt to ensure that the vertical movement of the keys is smooth and precise. 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.780
 The LX-17 is equipped with a 4-channel, 8-single audio system and is powered by a 6-channel amplifier. 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.040
 The body speaker produces the most important sound. 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.820
 The speaker unit installed in the upper asymmetric space reproduces the resonance of the piano structure. 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.480
 Near-field speakers and tweeters are used to emit dynamic overtones and hammer noise. 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.760
 This multi-channel sound sound system can reproduce the rich and deep sound of the real platform piano. 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.520
 Opening the top cover also makes the sound brighter, just like a real piano. 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.720
 SuperNATURAL piano model technology fully simulates the process of traditional piano sounding. 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.740
 Including the combination of which sounds are played at the same time, 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.480
 How it will resonate with other components of the piano. 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.240
 A variety of overtone components create a rich, lifelike piano sound 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.500
 – the technique you play will really reflect the change in tone, 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.260
 This is not possible with digital pianos that use traditional sampling techniques. 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.780
 With BLUETOOTH® technology, the LX-17 can be wirelessly connected to your mobile device. 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.360
 It allows you to enjoy the app app. 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.500
 You can also record your performance on a USB flash drive. 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.080
 Combines the traditional shape of a space-saving upright piano with space saving. 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.720
 We offer two high-quality finishes: piano mirror black and piano mirror white. 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.820
 LX-17 – Our most distinguished and versatile home piano.
