00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
to do is just click that and then it

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.760 
to do is just click that and then it
will<00:00:46.890> start<00:00:47.600> recognizing<00:00:48.600> my<00:00:49.110> voice<00:00:49.350> and

where<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:22.760> can<00:02:23.030> just<00:02:23.240> talk<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.380> will<00:02:24.470> type

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
where you can just talk and it will type

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.800 
where you can just talk and it will type
for<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.370> said<00:02:25.730> way<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.000> go<00:02:26.210> sherry<00:02:26.540> I

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
for you so I said way to go sherry I

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.260 
for you so I said way to go sherry I
think<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.770> is<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> great<00:02:28.160> series<00:02:28.550> of<00:02:28.700> keywords

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
think that is a great series of keywords

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.420 
think that is a great series of keywords
we<00:02:29.510> were<00:02:29.600> talking<00:02:29.900> about<00:02:30.130> keyboarding<00:02:31.130> stuff

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
we were talking about keyboarding stuff

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.880 
we were talking about keyboarding stuff
and<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:32.150> said<00:02:32.390> keep<00:02:32.600> up<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.960> great<00:02:33.050> work<00:02:33.170> with

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
and I said keep up the great work with

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.950 
and I said keep up the great work with
the<00:02:34.010> next<00:02:34.190> elimination<00:02:34.580> mark<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.540> then<00:02:35.840> I

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
the next elimination mark and then I

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.780 
the next elimination mark and then I
said<00:02:36.170> talk<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.650> later<00:02:36.770> so<00:02:37.130> I'm<00:02:37.610> going<00:02:37.730> to

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
go ahead and hit reply and just I'll

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.440 
go ahead and hit reply and just I'll
repeat<00:02:41.030> what<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:41.930> said<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.500> you'll<00:02:42.620> see<00:02:42.830> how<00:02:42.980> it

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
repeat what I said and you'll see how it

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.180 
repeat what I said and you'll see how it
literally<00:02:44.450> takes<00:02:44.810> what<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.110> say<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.740> turns<00:02:46.040> it

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
literally takes what I say and turns it

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.080 
literally takes what I say and turns it
into<00:02:46.310> type<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.840> for<00:02:48.080> me<00:02:48.290> on<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.650> Mac<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.430> get<00:02:49.880> this

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
into type so for me on a Mac to get this

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.360 
into type so for me on a Mac to get this
to<00:02:50.270> work<00:02:50.480> all<00:02:51.080> you<00:02:51.320> have<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.590> do<00:02:51.740> is<00:02:51.890> hit<00:02:52.100> the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
to work all you have to do is hit the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.420 
to work all you have to do is hit the
function<00:02:53.150> key<00:02:53.450> which<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.470> in<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.740> lower<00:02:55.040> lower

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
function key which is in the lower lower

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.880 
function key which is in the lower lower
lower<00:02:55.550> left<00:02:56.210> side<00:02:56.720> lower<00:02:57.110> left<00:02:57.440> side<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.860> you

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
lower left side lower left side and you

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.450 
lower left side lower left side and you
just<00:02:58.100> hit<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.400> twice<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:59.090> then<00:02:59.150> you<00:03:00.110> can<00:03:00.260> begin

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
just hit it twice and then you can begin

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.380 
just hit it twice and then you can begin
dictating<00:03:01.460> so<00:03:01.640> watch<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:03.490> way<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.550> go<00:03:04.910> sherry

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
dictating so watch this way to go sherry

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.330 
dictating so watch this way to go sherry
I<00:03:06.550> think<00:03:07.550> that<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:07.940> great<00:03:08.360> series<00:03:09.080> of

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
I think that is a great series of

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.640 
I think that is a great series of
keywords<00:03:10.340> period<00:03:12.100> keep<00:03:13.100> up<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.640> great<00:03:13.850> work

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
keywords period keep up the great work

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.030 
keywords period keep up the great work
exclamation<00:03:15.650> mark<00:03:16.390> talk<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:17.660> later

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
exclamation mark talk to you later

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.970 
exclamation mark talk to you later
period<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:21.610> then<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.700> just<00:03:22.880> had<00:03:23.060> done<00:03:23.300> and

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
period and then I just had done and

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.770 
period and then I just had done and
really<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.220> only<00:03:25.520> problem<00:03:25.910> it<00:03:26.000> had<00:03:26.270> was<00:03:26.540> it

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
really the only problem it had was it

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.360 
really the only problem it had was it
didn't<00:03:27.050> know<00:03:27.170> how<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.350> spell<00:03:27.650> sherry<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.190> she

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
didn't know how to spell sherry and she

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.400 
didn't know how to spell sherry and she
spells<00:03:28.670> it<00:03:28.820> with<00:03:28.850> an<00:03:29.060> eye<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:29.990> all<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.290> would

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
spells it with an eye so all I would

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.870 
spells it with an eye so all I would
really<00:03:30.740> have<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.010> do<00:03:31.280> is<00:03:32.110> change<00:03:33.110> that<00:03:33.440> and

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
really have to do is change that and

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.370 
really have to do is change that and
look<00:03:34.880> at<00:03:35.000> I<00:03:35.210> mean<00:03:35.240> it's<00:03:35.510> just<00:03:35.600> amazing<00:03:35.810> how

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
look at I mean it's just amazing how

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.810 
look at I mean it's just amazing how
well<00:03:36.620> that<00:03:36.740> worked<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.190> could<00:03:37.400> even<00:03:37.640> come

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
well that worked and I could even come

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.500 
well that worked and I could even come
down<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.300> another<00:03:38.450> line<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:40.160> if<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.180> have<00:03:41.270> more

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
down to another line and if I have more

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.020 
down to another line and if I have more
information<00:03:42.320> to<00:03:42.740> say<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.280> can<00:03:43.520> just<00:03:43.700> start<00:03:43.910> it

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
information to say I can just start it

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.600 
information to say I can just start it
again<00:03:44.360> again<00:03:45.110> all<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:45.470> hit<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.860> all<00:03:46.100> I<00:03:46.190> have<00:03:46.459> to

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
again again all I hit the all I have to

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.510 
again again all I hit the all I have to
do<00:03:46.790> is<00:03:46.970> hit<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.390> function<00:03:47.959> key<00:03:48.290> twice<00:03:49.100> and

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
do is hit the function key twice and

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.970 
do is hit the function key twice and
it'll<00:03:50.330> bring<00:03:50.540> up<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:51.020> speech-to-text<00:03:53.980> so

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
it'll bring up the speech-to-text so

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.410 
it'll bring up the speech-to-text so
chary<00:03:55.340> as<00:03:55.610> you<00:03:56.510> will<00:03:56.780> probably<00:03:57.110> see<00:03:57.800> I<00:03:58.420> am

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
chary as you will probably see I am

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.360 
chary as you will probably see I am
recording<00:03:59.930> a<00:04:00.410> video<00:04:01.360> that<00:04:02.360> shows<00:04:02.840> how<00:04:02.870> to

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
recording a video that shows how to

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.190 
recording a video that shows how to
speak<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.720> have<00:04:05.720> your<00:04:07.000> computer<00:04:08.000> type<00:04:08.959> the

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
speak and have your computer type the

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.320 
speak and have your computer type the
text<00:04:09.440> for<00:04:10.070> you<00:04:10.280> period<00:04:11.120> I<00:04:12.790> bet<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:13.940> can<00:04:14.120> hardly

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
text for you period I bet you can hardly

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:21.599 
text for you period I bet you can hardly
wait<00:04:14.660> to<00:04:14.720> get<00:04:15.320> a<00:04:15.380> Mac<00:04:16.690> exclamation<00:04:17.690> mark

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.080 

okay<00:04:22.479> so<00:04:22.539> that's<00:04:23.439> I<00:04:23.770> mean<00:04:24.069> that's<00:04:24.129> just<00:04:24.430> darn

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
okay so that's I mean that's just darn

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.149 
okay so that's I mean that's just darn
near<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.509> mean<00:04:25.750> certainly<00:04:26.409> there's<00:04:26.680> one<00:04:26.979> or<00:04:27.129> two

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:27.159 
near I mean certainly there's one or two

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:31.189 
near I mean certainly there's one or two
little<00:04:27.789> minor<00:04:28.689> problems<00:04:29.199> that<00:04:29.409> I<00:04:29.500> can<00:04:29.680> fix<00:04:29.919> but

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
little minor problems that I can fix but

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.469 
little minor problems that I can fix but
I<00:04:32.199> didn't<00:04:32.740> have<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:32.979> type<00:04:33.189> a<00:04:33.310> lot<00:04:33.490> so<00:04:33.819> the

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
I didn't have to type a lot so the

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.480 
I didn't have to type a lot so the
potential<00:04:34.930> I<00:04:35.439> think<00:04:35.530> for<00:04:36.009> people<00:04:36.370> that

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
potential I think for people that

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.059 
potential I think for people that
haven't<00:04:36.819> been<00:04:37.000> on<00:04:37.180> good<00:04:37.539> on<00:04:37.689> computers<00:04:38.069> is

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:39.069 
haven't been on good on computers is

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:44.339
