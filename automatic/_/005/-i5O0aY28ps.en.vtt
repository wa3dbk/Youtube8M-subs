00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.210
 I showed you different reels to 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.170
 carp so the different 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.430
 characteristics to use it 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:20.340
 so here we have two models to mill a 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.269
 bigger than you can use 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.460
 for the sea ​​also for sea fishing 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.410
 is it a little smaller for 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.179
 pond fishing 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.020
 knowing that at sea seen that fish 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.280
 are more are harder are more alive 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.399
 you need bigger, stronger ones 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:45.570
 so I showed you first the one for 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:50.219
 ponds for carp cards 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.410
 the pikes have here so here I you 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.760
 put thread on the spool 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.800
 just now I'm going to show you 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.510
 how to put the net on the reel 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:06.920
 on the other reel so here we are at the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:10.409
 crank can turn we have the hood 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.830
 for when we start hop we have the rest 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.340
 hood one launches and closes like those 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.810
 this placed the part that comes on the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.110
 cades who comes to put on the cades 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.890
 there we have our weekend here here we have the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.220
 brake so to disengage 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.970
 as for fish as for the dead fish 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.250
 hop we will be able to disengaged here for 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.979
 let the son go because if we 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.590
 leave that risk to break and hop the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.530
 fish of course with your with your 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:52.020
 hook your boil is all so 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:56.820
 this is the first first reel 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:01.490
 second now same principle on 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:05.369
 disengages have taken over here still the hood 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.800
 up crank pad to put in the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.180
 in the can 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.190
 we see it now I'm going to 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.190
 show how to put your son so 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.230
 there I have a reel path spools of wire 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:26.160
 so of the ninon eyelid so you see so 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:29.130
 we will make a knot like these in 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.500
 is normal enough is the time 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.750
 that a fish brings back all your reels 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.410
 from there there is at least already thirty meters 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.930
 of wire then you have the tender sums 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:45.410
 so one is normal I advise you to 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.410
 to make a double knot anyway 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:57.120
 like these and like this or that you 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:03.060
 have your are not now I can 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:09.870
 I can mill and hop you go 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:13.290
 power reel for this you go 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.650
 put your son here and you go 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.650
 die 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:25.280
 so here is the little tip 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.890
 it's good to pass your son in the 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.940
 dough that is here and then you 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.550
 reel all quietly and my 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.310
 little advice besides these two camps 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.070
 you want to put your coil on the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.810
 reel is to do it when the 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.050
 reel and on the can it's easier 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.500
 because the son goes through all the holes of 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.380
 the cad 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.240
 so it's easier so here you go 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.240
 for watching this video and see you soon
