00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:04.200
 Ulrich Tiemann falls ill with leukemia in October 2004 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.260
 The 54-year-old knows the fear with the approximately 11 000 in Germany annually 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.609
 Educate children 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.720
 I was so sad 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.440
 I wonder why I hear why that was the price development 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.649
 Bechtle then let me inquire it is not at all 

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:25.259
 because it was already over 50 years old he was injured are not so 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.090
 good even in older people can leukemia 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.420
 also called blood cancer can be cured by a bone marrow donation 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.750
 Difficulty to find a suitable donor whose blood almost the 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.650
 has the same tissue characteristics 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.330
 sometimes there are only one among more than a million people 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.960
 suitable dispenser 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.510
 The German bone marrow donor database DKMS has set itself the task 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.850
 for hospital patients to find the right donor because no donor too 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.430
 In this respect, the standstill of an employee is completely unknown to Kosovo 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.880
 certain section 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.740
 A similar to finding a genetic twin must be from that donor 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.530
 and patient on the diesel specially traveled 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.850
 all the same features have these features are important to tissue 1% 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.510
 disconcert 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.950
 Montreal to identify 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.480
 among the stem cells in the middle, 10 just did not get percent repelled 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.310
 must be that there is one 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.960
 Over the last 17 years, more than 1 comma have received 7 million Germans at the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.469
 Typify DKMS 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.490
 to be eligible as a donor 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.490
 If a suitable donor is found the sick book can corpse 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.420
 a leukemia patient being replaced by healthy stem cells are my big ones 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.710
 Chance exists that the patient survives 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.979
 Ulrich Tiemann has leukemia with the help of a bone marrow transplant 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:37.700
 defeated 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.680
 It was a very special experience for him the donor four weeks ago 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.980
 to have met in person 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.890
 he visited me visited my family that was good 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.190
 wonderful that was a very national guild aden percent the situation percent 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.750
 that was just heavenly alone to meet people 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.799
 Nevertheless, Zieler 4 2 gave me a new life through the migrants 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.819
 in Germany is still waiting for a donor 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.789
 I hope as lucky as Ulrich Tiemann
