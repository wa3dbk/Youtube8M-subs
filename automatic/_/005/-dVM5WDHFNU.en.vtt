00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.340
 summer is almost here and the bright ocean 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.350
 and hot is full of food 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.380
 in the Hebrides all forms of 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.480
 lives depend on the sea and so is 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.960
 one who better than any other illustrious 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.960
 all his wealth 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.980
 the giants have come off of 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.640
 stick of taillerie these are the sharks 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.649
 pilgrims the greatest of them 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.860
 can measure up to 11 meters 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.860
 long 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.579
 open their jaws can 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.769
 reach a meter in diameter 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.120
 and all the fish of the world alone 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.120
 the whale sharks exceed them 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.290
 a priori to see him approaching 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.310
 make go 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.270
 but seals have nothing to fear 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.380
 tiny in basking sharks 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.619
 these feed by retaining the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.170
 plankton contained in the water every 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.009
 hours they so filter the equivalent 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.009
 an olympic pool 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.940
 when they have amassed enough 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.320
 food they close 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.320
 finally the mouth for the valley 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.819
 plankton are concentrated in the 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.630
 areas where the water is colder tracing 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.880
 furrows where it slows down the current 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.959
 the sharks are found in number and 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.670
 that's where they once were 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.420
 harpoon for huge amounts 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.980
 of oil co-produces their faith today 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.980
 they can feed in peace 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.920
 their lives remain largely 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.020
 mysterious but we discovered there are 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.460
 little that some of these fish across 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.940
 this may be the Atlantic to come 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.940
 so far
