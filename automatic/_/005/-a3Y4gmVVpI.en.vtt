 hi there, this is a hotline video project 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.400
 My name is Vitaly Bogdanov Company 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.049
 fotik continues to develop very successful 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.270
 line of gaming peripherals welfare 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.700
 Today we will talk about two new senior 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.930
 ruler representatives and photo and driver 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.669
 8a and there was one photo 5 a 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.739
 ruler 8a stands out among the outer 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.270
 unassuming colleagues in the lineup and and 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.550
 silver case decorated with black 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.710
 illuminated perforation inserts 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.780
 red diodes unfortunately it all 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.290
 looks a bit coarse somewhat 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.120
 textures 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.399
 chrome-plated glossy inserts 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.469
 scroll wheels and 3 slots attacked 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.719
 this panel is brightly highlighted in red 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.550
 during operation the shape and size of the body 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.370
 recalls such are already familiar to us and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.579
 fotik bloody v5 in front of us symmetrical 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.589
 mouse 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.789
 however side navigation keys 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.190
 located only to the left 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.019
 The muscles are mid-sized and will be comfortable for 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.420
 hands of different size and type tab 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.489
 the case is entirely made of plastic and 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.530
 assembled well liked work with 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.940
 the main mouse keys are temporary 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.490
 surface contributes to improved 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.619
 contact with fingers oklick short report 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.520
 whether to go moderately hard not let down and 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.880
 mouse wheel 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.509
 it is convenient to use 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.310
 and here is located behind the button 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.689
 default lever responsible for 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.189
 switching shooting modes 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.189
 is not the most convenient solution 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.350
 the design was 10 5 and more restrained with 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.270
 fewer screaming items but 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.829
 this with characteristic features 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.929
 manipulators and fortex plastic 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.280
 the body has become somewhat wider with the muscles 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.259
 symmetrical with extra keys 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.259
 located under the thumb 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.090
 as for the side keys when now 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.960
 This is a full-fledged weapons control unit. 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.000
 the joystick has moved to 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.220
 sidebar to use it with this 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.930
 accommodation is also worth considering that 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.729
 the side key block is slightly offset 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.260
 forward to have to reach out 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.910
 interesting feature is 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.530
 dedicated slide button 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.729
 sensor sensitivity for more 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.340
 accurate aiming 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.610
 as befits the older model on the line 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.270
 del 8 ohm and zn5 and equipped with top 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.570
 goa dns 9800 sensors with resolution 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.459
 8200 is now a polling frequency of 1000 hertz and 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.620
 one millisecond response time 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.450
 with moving no 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.239
 there were no problems as well as with slip 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.650
 on the surface for this aspect 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.040
 manipulators are distinguished by 4 metal 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.230
 rounded legs utf-8 a and 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.400
 pointed at zn5 a 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.959
 photo software blady 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.239
 managed to grow to the fifth version 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.760
 allow you to customize the mouse even more 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.680
 wide limits as before version with 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.989
 The prefix in the title comes with 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.190
 activated ultra core 3 with 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.410
 features we already have 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.750
 got acquainted earlier manipulators also 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.030
 support and extreme new hard 4 package 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.769
 even more expanding opportunity 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.930
 setting the parameters of firing and 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.850
 weapon settings as well as in-depth 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.850
 working with macros for rpg lovers 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.700
 if we abstract from the subjective 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.500
 appearance estimates then we end up 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.390
 we receive worthy representatives of photos 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.489
 blade able to compete equally 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.140
 more expensive eminent competitors for 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.480
 rank of high-level weapon for 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.190
 maximum performance on the side 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.900
 both manipulators and not quite bad 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.269
 ergonomics and great modern 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.640
 filling tremendous functionality and 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.000
 the most important thing is still democratic 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.000
 price tag
