00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.200
 agreed together I had the team from Argentina is through 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.940
 send 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.309
 and that must also be 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.839
 i have spanish grandmaster because i don't either 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.239
 got and Germans 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.559
 instead of piers ajax assigned what is still bored as 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.999
 I have an important message for a very short time 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.789
 why the boy addressed the investigation is a guarantee is very 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.999
 motivating 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.259
 it also turned out to be almost in line with the many questions that are not met by its source 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.690
 but in the hand 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.610
 winterberg to 44 years, that's so bad on two courses 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.370
 the dog comes with his doings 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.900
 and what do you think of your response 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.230
 he wants to declare sit down trading 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.540
 be careful not to 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.180
 I don't want to take the action 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.309
 I don't know where you put that situation 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.210
 but maybe even more and better life 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.980
 and if you then change again then you should not go wrong in advance 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.980
 done because if you do everything that lives not as usual 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.300
 That is also the reason that I send these short messages and forward them 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.620
 at least we had to translate what is the story of peter winning it 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.140
 is an answer to the crisis 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.140
 but a person an i want to go that way 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.320
 I started to help people save 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.250
 on the roads 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.780
 it is now an hour 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.780
 every day why four in ten million euros happen 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.130
 at the making is 4 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.530
 ageas 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.530
 fixed link 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.490
 foxes feel a lot 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.340
 people who why 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.700
 to happen according to you 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.570
 he ever came here 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.570
 I already mentioned my blood pressure 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.210
 she also attended one 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.430
 thousand 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.650
 1500 euros 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.100
 the year gagas 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.210
 we have had much longer but still do nothing wrong with it 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.640
 it's a first step to sharing but people do that 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.659
 he opened 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.130
 Tuesday comes the hammer for a good feeling 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.280
 many restaurants where I thought not clear it is not because of that 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.610
 and whatever happens on it 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.529
 2 the commission will also head 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:09.549
 first time 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.240
 Nobody knows that the active condition of cooperation is up to standard 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.449
 then in the group our services go to anp de touran every day 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.239
 that was also my restaurant 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.839
 one day 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:24.849
 an air bag flower shop 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.270
 to the old friends and acquaintances 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.319
 kallio can recommend from pot 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.940
 I can do that arrangement can be much cheaper 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.220
 I can disturb a lot less that will pay 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.220
 good idea 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.639
 or for the first 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.639
 nobody is paid for it and now also translated 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.510
 that's someone who's in congo martine van liere makes it much more interesting 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:50.479
 and that is why i am in the pepper street this week 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.860
 the two were no longer present 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.659
 passively evaluated a colleague on the editorial board 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.519
 chance of rain but also nothing 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.150
 If you check at the counter when it is inherent then you are not going to like me 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.599
 see what bought or was it something being turned on the radio very small 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.509
 percentage 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:09.109
 that's not fair 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.889
 luck every time the ad 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.429
 whether she repeats herself 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.369
 Sunday should have had work ahead at depth 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:18.840
 a ship that took four months of action 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.039
 he stayed there 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.039
 the persecution 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.019
 that passive and columns that believes that you are very important part of them 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.129
 still 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.770
 And that also ensures that in certain cases 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.280
 no longer have to do that, and money pays into my account every month 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.269
 got 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.909
 without you 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.519
 prevention or passive cooling then I also have nothing for it 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.419
 I also saw that we are together 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.809
 more information it is the end made up conversation 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:54.489
 because can be done in a different way, but for that you have to contact them 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.599
 read below you will find all information to contact me 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.399
 and I advise you to do something sensible that can be increased by the advance 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.349
 have you come to passive with the form from principle to build 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.679
 picking up wilders 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:12.349
 but here local bodies may have to be a special disappointment 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:13.969
 makes it special 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:15.840
 and how you treat yourself and others 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.959
 and ensure that you can receive benefits 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.519
 for passive 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.029
 I'm going to hand in government 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.539
 this kind of being refused in his own country can be faster in what he thinks 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.409
 pak that was a short message from ing 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.950
 short and to the point but I think you can pay a lot of truth 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.260
 the stress scenario 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.080
 Germany can change in your life 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.080
 bet that lets that offer contact 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.559
 that everything is not allowed to do and the unrest has collapsed
