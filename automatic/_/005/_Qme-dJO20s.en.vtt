00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.950
 Hello everyone 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.679
 we are at the pro music stand put 2013 e 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.750
 nicola are Zavatta and I wanted to introduce 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.539
 some interesting news we have 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.520
 this year in our stand 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.650
 the novelty certainly more interesting 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.340
 of all is the new v series here 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.910
 you see is a brand new series of systems 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.769
 of speakers in synthetic cabinet e 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.600
 with a very particular design that 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.739
 we have chosen specifically for this 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.559
 series and are systems b amplified with 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.410
 a very light class amplifier 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.120
 d with switching power supply housed 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.910
 in an aluminum module 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.550
 guarantees lightness protection e 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.280
 perfect separation between the environment 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.219
 outside and inside the case i 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.730
 Series models are 3 10 inches 12 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.280
 inches and 15 inches that include it 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.350
 all the same amp and are 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.270
 housed in a cabinet and in polypropylene 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.060
 very robust with a very comfortable one 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.710
 handle in the upper part than ne 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.369
 guarantees a truly transport 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.549
 simple and effortless are systems 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.009
 extremely light only 10 kg per 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.680
 10 inch model and so I'm at 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.970
 reach of any musician and also 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.130
 any professionals whatsoever 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.130
 user who wants a system 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.409
 easy to carry with a nights sea 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.810
 excellent sound performance and also why not 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.240
 a very sophisticated design 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.119
 another important novelty of the fair 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.920
 are the new proell mixers in this one 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.399
 occasion we present two different series 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.680
 the m i series which consists of three 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.390
 models and that are characterized by the 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.090
 having a high number of 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.700
 channels in a very small package 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.640
 and we have a very model indeed 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.159
 simple with six model 10 inputs 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.170
 inputs and the 12 input model i 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.880
 two larger models and include 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.369
 both a brand new digital effect 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.500
 developed by proell laboratories that 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.690
 we called proflex which unites to 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.120
 an extremely high quality of the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.010
 processing algorithms 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.959
 comparable with effects and study 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.330
 an interface is much more expensive 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:23.930
 very easy to use with dayal e 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.299
 lcd screen the mixers include the two 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.760
 Effect models include two channels 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.099
 mono with line microphone input o 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.159
 four in xii and respectively 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.569
 four simplified stereo channels that 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.760
 so they allow you to have a high 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.209
 number of entries in a dimension 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.700
 we have very limited then the band 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.620
 high of the proell mixer where we have 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.709
 completely renewed our series 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.250
 m and which today has three models 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.290
 six-channel model entry model 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.319
 8 input channels is the largest a 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.239
 16 channels was completely 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.510
 renewed the chassis with comfortable 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.640
 hips in abs for protection and are 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.519
 some functions have been introduced 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.290
 particular and innovative like not only 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.810
 the new prosthetic effect that is 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.819
 also used here that combines that 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.889
 also includes effects of her mono tap 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.500
 and stereo but also a very comfortable one 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:22.470
 session for input management e 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.360
 USB output that can be assigned 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.610
 directly to the main mix or to a 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.670
 stereo input channel as input 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.000
 or two-line admonition to two terms 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.550
 aux as an output we also have in the case 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.440
 of the 16-channel model a compressor 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.890
 very easy to use on all 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.410
 mono channels and we added one 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.630
 additional monitor send for a total of 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.280
 three monitor mandates to make them 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.580
 extremely complete use also for 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.460
 band and size 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.050
 of large medium to large size 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.660
 the latest news that we present to you most 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.810
 for 2013 is a monitor line from 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.790
 the wege line dedicated stage 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.270
 includes three different models with storms 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.540
 10 inches 12 inches and 15 inches 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.300
 therefore they are dedicated stage monitors 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.040
 not simply loudspeakers 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.620
 floor composition in which 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.209
 we use coaxial components that 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.820
 guarantee not only dimensions 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.720
 contained but also a dispersion 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:26.880
 optimal of the sound and we have in addition to 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.100
 three different speaker cuts also 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.490
 three different power cuts and the 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.210
 possibility to use the monitor in 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.150
 case of necessity also as a system for 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.310
 main spread in fact 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.540
 the integrated amplifier that has a 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.940
 double amplifier with sessions 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.130
 separated for other low frequencies 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.680
 frequencies includes a selection key 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.410
 of two different present of 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.380
 equalization a preset monitor precisely 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.750
 for the classic standard use as 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.669
 stage monitor where we treated 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.090
 particularly the resistance to the 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.430
 feedback is a present fronto baus that 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.100
 allows you to use the same case 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.640
 also as a main system in case of 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.760
 need 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.560
 and the three monitors are housed in 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.080
 plywood cabinet finished with 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.490
 polyurethane paint is protected by a 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.120
 durable mesh finished with paint 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.980
 scratchproof 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.490
 we thank you for your attention and vi 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:29.540
 we invite you to try proell products 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.540
