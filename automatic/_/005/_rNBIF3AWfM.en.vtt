00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.650
 hello good today we are going to try to give 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.110
 punto dÃ­az is a game that came out in 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.790
 April and that is squeezing the truth 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.890
 It is very addictive and has many 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.570
 followers the first thing we do is 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.670
 point our username to another 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.130
 equivalent and select in which region 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.080
 we want to play in europe then we can 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.300
 choose between two game modes the mode 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.849
 free for all that is the individual or the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.210
 teams that is team mode we are going to 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.370
 choose the individual we give you to play and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.160
 we started being this little ball 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.430
 red that happens the more we eat more 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.110
 we make ourselves and we have the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.380
 ability to eat the little ones 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.390
 that we what happens that the more 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.090
 we grow slower we go and it's easier 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.370
 also that they eat us 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.070
 The question is to keep growing eat everything 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.060
 what we can and obviously avoid that 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.330
 kill us 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.600
 we continue eating and you see how big 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.770
 can be the users 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.290
 the ranking of users with more than 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.540
 our map you can see them in that 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.940
 ranking that is on the right of the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.890
 screen on the top by 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.979
 example if I would like to eat now 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.700
 America could not do it because I know 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.190
 they just ate 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.860
 the other balls 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.880
 so 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.880
 we keep eating 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.760
 the balls that you see that have been divided 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.960
 in several is because they have tightened the 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.150
 space bar and that allows you 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.130
 divide you and therefore go faster than 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.550
 it happens when you split you become 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.540
 in something smaller like I just did 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.210
 to get to eat a 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.040
 Macedonia but I have not got it 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.890
 now I go faster I also have a 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.630
 wider view of the universe but it is 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.390
 easier to eat me to be more 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.290
 little one seems confused when saying it but 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.409
 too easy 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.270
 I'm slower 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.810
 but if I divide I can eat it 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.470
 it is advisable but divide more than 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.450
 twice because then it 's easier 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.930
 that they eat you but good so that it looks 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.930
 now it is OK 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.629
 we must continue to eat normally 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.580
 users with more mass are not interested in 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.700
 tiny cells like mine so 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.470
 in principle there would not be much danger in 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.290
 a while after dividing you go back to 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.660
 your original form automatically but 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.280
 the bigger you are the slower in 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.049
 return to your way of eating the ball 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.420
 blue one to one is first to start is 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.000
 that you my original form our 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.460
 size was too much for this I go back to 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.060
 go slower had a vision 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:54.010
 more reduced map 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.010
 or what happened 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.810
 this is exactly what needs to be done 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.880
 to be received so much 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.260
 We will try to go through Turkey 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.510
 the turkey we see that we have arrived 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.580
 when the balls finish and we have 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.680
 come to what would be the limit of 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.349
 our map and this is useful when 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.610
 you want to run now well but someone 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.610
 has had the same idea with us 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.420
 the little yellow ball keeps growing 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.090
 eating eating eating they go for me 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.700
 you will not be able to because I am faster than 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.280
 you and I could eat the other yellow 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.270
 because 1 turkey does not 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.270
 that is a competition 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.790
 the green yes I could eat it but 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.110
 obviously it's wonderful that I but 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.300
 I could not 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:46.060
 calmly keep growing 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.280
 life 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.580
 sometimes you do not have to divide to be able 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.250
 escape 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.310
 a little in extremis is not ideal but 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:00.360
 obviously you have to keep living 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.319
 Turkey tries to corner us 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.579
 we are in a situation a bit 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.579
 we were able to save ourselves 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.600
 In a little while we will meet again in 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.670
 our original form because now 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.120
 we are quite small therefore not 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.120
 let's take 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.070
 and we keep eating 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.480
 very well 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.480
 what's up yoke what obsession 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.440
 we also have the Islamic state 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:38.110
 Ã¡lex that should take a little while 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:41.460
 playing seems to go for my division 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.460
 at the last moment 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.180
 well do not you think that too much but 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.180
 less survive 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:05:00.600
 to for kurdistan 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.600
 if the left and the limit of the map 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.479
 good good scoop 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.330
 a good try but they have not eaten 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.330
 you ready 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.190
 we continue good it seems that portugal is going 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.190
 by me 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.840
 to corral me so we're going to 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.840
 get out of there 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.289
 what obsession 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.199
 OK 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.779
 so we put ourselves inside one of the 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.729
 balls with green skewers in principle 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:50.339
 nobody is going to bother killing us 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.309
 because balls bigger than 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:54.659
 green spiked balls explode and they 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:56.200
 they turn into many mini balls and the 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:06:00.249
 they touch 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.769
 and we continue to feed for example d 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:06.929
 now now as welcome I 'm not what 

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:06.929
 big enough to eat it 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:15.490
 in this case I should have 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.490
 maintained in a single unit 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.420
 what you can do is eat the moon 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.340
 if you do not overtake me 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.490
 good to sacrifice one half of 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.490
 my 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.090
 and die
