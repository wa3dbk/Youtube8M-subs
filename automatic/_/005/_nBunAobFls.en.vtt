00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.310
 tnt 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.500
 but the main thing is not what we have to 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.290
 teach good if they know how to make a 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.750
 door that kills zombies and is something strange 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:30.140
 but it serves too much and well 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.140
 hundreds of extra grade and a half
