00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
whole idea when you come in your sort of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.889 
whole idea when you come in your sort of
in<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.469> low<00:00:52.469> ceiling<00:00:53.360> sort<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.480> smaller

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
in this low ceiling sort of smaller

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.490 
in this low ceiling sort of smaller
space<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.800> has<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.010> lot<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.730> eye<00:00:56.910> candy

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
space that has a lot of like eye candy

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.229 
space that has a lot of like eye candy
but<00:00:58.500> then<00:00:58.800> when<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.370> flow<00:00:59.609> out<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> main

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
but then when you flow out to the main

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.479 
but then when you flow out to the main
space<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.079> goes<00:01:01.260> boom<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.070> opens<00:01:02.340> up

to<00:02:40.180> want<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.420> go<00:02:40.480> up<00:02:40.630> here<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:40.870> I'll<00:02:41.050> start

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
to want to go up here and I'll start

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.770 
to want to go up here and I'll start
dancing<00:02:41.739> their<00:02:41.890> party<00:02:42.280> in<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.519> tree<00:02:42.700> so<00:02:42.940> it

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
dancing their party in the tree so it

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.910 
dancing their party in the tree so it
becomes<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.470> stage<00:02:45.100> for<00:02:45.940> dancing<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:47.620> fun

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
becomes a stage for dancing and a fun

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.500 
becomes a stage for dancing and a fun
like<00:02:48.190> sculptural<00:02:48.820> element<00:02:49.300> as<00:02:49.450> well<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:51.510> we

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
like sculptural element as well and we

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.240 
like sculptural element as well and we
think<00:02:52.660> it'll<00:02:52.900> be<00:02:52.989> super<00:02:53.230> duper<00:02:53.590> fun<00:02:53.799> and<00:02:54.070> this

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
think it'll be super duper fun and this

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.280 
think it'll be super duper fun and this
probably<00:02:54.519> one<00:02:54.850> of<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.030> hottest<00:02:55.239> like<00:02:55.720> areas

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
probably one of the hottest like areas

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.580 
probably one of the hottest like areas
