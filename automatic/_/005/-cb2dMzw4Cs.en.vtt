00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.990
 Welcome to this new tutorial with the 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.059
 Photoshop program we are the version 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.910
 cs6 but serves any mission that 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.210
 let's have for this tutorial where we're going 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.369
 to create the orton effect the orton effect 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.680
 formerly it was created in the laboratory 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.700
 and now with the photoshop program 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.400
 let's see how in just a minute 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.980
 scarce we can create the effect of orton 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.010
 it's simply about creating two 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.649
 images from it and that 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.199
 expose them a the blur we have and 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.640
 we will create the effect then a tea that 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.800
 we have open the image with which 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.249
 we want to create this effect can 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.980
 duplicate the layer fusion layer and I'm going 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:51.829
 to put in frame I put myself in the layer of 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.429
 up and I'll combine visible 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:00.340
 then how do we see the image be 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:03.280
 about exposed I will duplicate the image 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.680
 now I come to filter 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:11.120
 blur and let's give it a blur 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.610
 Gauss no longer depends on the blurring that 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.260
 we give him then that he can create 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:22.280
 more or less effect orton but on a 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.870
 15 to 50 you can fit once 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.430
 we have the blur in the layer of 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:33.170
 up we come to layers and put it in 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.330
 way to multiply and we combine the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.360
 visible layers and here we would have the 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.600
 cut effect a created I hope what 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.920
 you can appreciate well from the computer 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.259
 that is from the video but it would be this 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.830
 effect to see the before and the after 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:55.759
 let's go to history and if we take it away 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:59.030
 the effect we see the original image and if 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.530
 we see the effect already created we can 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.440
 appreciate it here 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.140
 this way very well this is the 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.899
 tutorial as you see is very simple they are 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.020
 two very simple steps but the effect 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.960
 it's very interesting about all this we 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.790
 It serves for professional photographers 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.680
 and good and also fans that 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.410
 want to create this effect in their 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.010
 pictures very well see you soon in 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.010
