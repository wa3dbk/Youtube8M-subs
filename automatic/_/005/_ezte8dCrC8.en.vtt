00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.020
 many two kids here we are high 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.660
 arms race jacket as you see 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.230
 for a small gameplay with one of the 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.829
 new camouflage the dragon camouflage 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.629
 good 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:16.640
 you know that before yesterday the 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.699
 set of receipt I commented then what 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.070
 it seemed to me and such and I had to play a 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.110
 departure with the dragon camouflage 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.390
 I do not like it at all I have to say it 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.580
 probably for me it seems to me 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.960
 one of the worst camouflage there is 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.580
 right now in whites 2 I really 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.010
 I 'm sorry to everyone who rocks you 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.379
 but my opinion is that it is an authentic 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.690
 potato besides I find it ugly 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.720
 eggs just to see it are about 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.910
 very ugly colors it seems to me that 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.610
 scales and that also gives me a lot 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.720
 no, and honestly, I do not like it 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.400
 nothing I put it on just to 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.960
 record this video if I get to know 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.219
 that I was going to be like that I would not have 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.480
 bought but when they did what 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.309
 ask what 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.200
 what camouflage there are to people I 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.450
 I have friends who voted for stage 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.590
 they have repented as soon as they have seen 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.340
 because the only thing that is cool is the title 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.990
 title of the title of this as yes 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.670
 that is very cool yes that is very handsome 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.470
 of more than the fire moves and everything 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.660
 he is quite handsome but what is the 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.009
 camouflage itself and the colors are supposed 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.479
 what should be to make the weapon 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.720
 pretty and this nice thing has nothing 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.110
 so 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.600
 honestly very ugly fetid but gender 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.770
 I was completely lucky that he picked up 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.030
 a ground sniper and in addition 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.350
 he also wore the camouflage now all 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.330
 the world is with the cyborg that with this 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.800
 camouflage since it just came out but 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.480
 I have to tell you that what I do not 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.910
 like nothing so what I would have 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.500
 fact is before putting to vote then 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.810
 how to give two days of test like 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.400
 have given two days of testing the dlc the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.720
 first dlc to prove it for having given 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.180
 two days of testing to test the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.130
 camouflage free and then already that the 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.450
 people voted not to know what they thought 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.940
 each one but of course I would not have 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.590
 come out profitable but now it's like me 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.050
 I think it should should have been 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.970
 done all this since many people then 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.410
 simply by putting a picture on it 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.840
 You can know how the weapon will fit 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.970
 at the end or how it will be all not one 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.440
 once all done the civilian that the cyborg 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.910
 follows is an authentic pass to the guy me 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.679
 love the truth that the cyborg that is 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.110
 very handsome with double action c4 when 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.120
 the cyborg was coming through the door 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.680
 is very handsome is a camouflage that of 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.610
 the most beautiful I've seen all the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.500
 contrary to the dragon so nothing 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.760
 tell you that more kids have seen 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.170
 that starting with the shotgun instead of 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.459
 put me any gun they started sorry 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.090
 starting with 8 but the finished 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.709
 putting me the shotgun because 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.420
 since lately I do not know what happens 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.660
 they are giving me a lot with the shotgun uncle 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.920
 I really get on this map 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.709
 comes someone with the shotgun method 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.090
 three bullets and they kill me attention here 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.459
 you have realized as a shot what to be 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.590
 jerk what's wrong as I'm not lame was going to 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.599
 throw the bone and I did not realize that 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.599
 killing one more had to be at 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.830
 throw the thing to be lame and I'm left without 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.330
 throw the dogs when I wanted to since 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.069
 only killed one or two more and had 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.269
 the dogs and I have lost have the 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.610
 dogs while pulling extra value a 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.080
 There are a lot of me left over from 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.970
 stand with him what to be in this eat 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.950
 somewhere to not be caught but 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.140
 it does not matter a lot of enough 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.670
 so what are you seeing 32 to 2 if 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.200
 I'm not wrong, a pretty man 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.459
 quickie I wanted to bring that to the channel 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.019
 to explain you then a little about the 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.879
 dragon since I said it would go up a 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.440
 gameplay talking about this camouflage of 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.360
 how did one rise talking about the cyborg 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.530
 they follow kids with telling me in the 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.790
 comments what do you think of the 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.680
 camouflage and what do you think about the 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.489
 cyborg and see you in the next video 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.489
 goodbye
