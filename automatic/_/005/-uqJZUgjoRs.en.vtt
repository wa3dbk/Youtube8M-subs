so here's the webinar hand this is it

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.850 
so here's the webinar hand this is it
and<00:05:06.280> then<00:05:06.460> this<00:05:06.610> is<00:05:06.729> sort<00:05:07.000> of<00:05:07.150> that<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:08.710> don't

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
and then this is sort of that you don't

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.860 
and then this is sort of that you don't
have<00:05:08.949> to<00:05:09.039> use<00:05:09.310> this<00:05:09.520> one<00:05:09.789> in<00:05:10.060> particular<00:05:10.240> this

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
have to use this one in particular this

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.760 
have to use this one in particular this
is<00:05:11.050> just<00:05:11.259> one<00:05:11.500> that<00:05:11.650> I<00:05:11.770> made<00:05:12.900> so<00:05:13.900> like<00:05:14.110> example

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
is just one that I made so like example

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:27.250 
is just one that I made so like example
of<00:05:14.830> purposes<00:05:15.400> so

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.940 

so<00:05:27.920> I<00:05:27.950> think<00:05:28.070> that's<00:05:28.490> it<00:05:29.380> so<00:05:30.380> I<00:05:30.410> think<00:05:30.530> that's

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
so I think that's it so I think that's

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.930 
so I think that's it so I think that's
it<00:05:31.130> this<00:05:31.550> is<00:05:31.730> like<00:05:32.240> I'm<00:05:32.450> a<00:05:32.630> player<00:05:32.930> I<00:05:33.140> guess

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
it this is like I'm a player I guess

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.880 
it this is like I'm a player I guess
this<00:05:34.940> is<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.150> sort<00:05:35.840> of<00:05:35.930> it's<00:05:36.050> sort<00:05:36.380> of<00:05:36.590> it's

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
this is it sort of it's sort of it's

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.870 
this is it sort of it's sort of it's
sort<00:05:37.190> of<00:05:37.370> like<00:05:37.520> Newtown<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.960> same<00:05:39.230> shape<00:05:39.880> are

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880

wanna copy this and then slaps the
mannequins<00:05:55.190> everywhere<00:05:56.060> rubber<00:05:56.720> on<00:05:56.930> the

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
mannequins everywhere rubber on the

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.710 
mannequins everywhere rubber on the
actual<00:05:57.590> not<00:05:57.910> then<00:05:58.910> you<00:05:59.030> can<00:05:59.210> go<00:05:59.330> ahead<00:05:59.360> and<00:05:59.540> do

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
actual not then you can go ahead and do

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.440 
actual not then you can go ahead and do
that<00:05:59.750> I<00:05:59.990> didn't<00:06:00.350> put<00:06:00.500> any<00:06:00.650> mannequin<00:06:01.250> for<00:06:02.210> time

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
that I didn't put any mannequin for time

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:11.850 
that I didn't put any mannequin for time
purposes<00:06:02.750> that<00:06:03.710> what<00:06:04.460> that<00:06:05.030> is<00:06:05.360> it

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:22.469 

I<00:06:12.689> think<00:06:13.689> that's<00:06:13.900> it<00:06:20.219> that's<00:06:21.219> it<00:06:21.460> so<00:06:21.939> see<00:06:22.419> you
