00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
now like I said I know this is a low

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.960 
now like I said I know this is a low
level<00:03:54.269> base<00:03:54.680> but<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:56.040> principles<00:03:56.700> are<00:03:56.820> all

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
level base but the principles are all

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.330 
level base but the principles are all
there<00:03:57.209> even<00:03:58.049> if<00:03:58.170> this<00:03:58.320> was<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.560> near<00:03:58.859> max<00:03:59.100> town
