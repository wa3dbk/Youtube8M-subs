a<00:00:35.880> six-speed<00:00:36.420> allison<00:00:36.960> training<00:00:37.350> let's<00:00:37.890> go

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
a six-speed allison training let's go

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.900 
a six-speed allison training let's go
ahead<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.550> stick<00:00:38.730> around<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.390> block

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
ahead and do the stick around the block

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.069 
ahead and do the stick around the block
I'm<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.120> go<00:00:42.180> ahead<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> drop<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.930> down

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
I'm going to go ahead and drop it down

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.100 
I'm going to go ahead and drop it down
into<00:00:43.350> manual<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.680> right<00:00:46.860> now<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.489> m2

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
into manual so right now this is m2

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.340 
into manual so right now this is m2
manual<00:00:49.110> 2

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.440 

in<00:00:51.800> second<00:00:52.489> gear<00:00:52.700> it's<00:00:52.940> going<00:00:53.090> to<00:00:53.180> stay<00:00:53.390> in

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
in second gear it's going to stay in

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
in second gear it's going to stay in
second<00:00:53.930> gear<00:00:54.110> until<00:00:54.530> I<00:00:54.710> switch<00:00:55.160> it<00:00:55.340> right<00:00:55.489> now

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
second gear until I switch it right now

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.210 
second gear until I switch it right now
now<00:00:57.470> are<00:00:57.650> in<00:00:57.710> third

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
now are in third

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.000 
now are in third
so<00:00:58.640> now<00:00:58.760> I<00:00:58.790> can<00:00:59.059> drop<00:00:59.210> it<00:00:59.420> back<00:00:59.540> to<00:00:59.720> second<00:01:00.200> and

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
so now I can drop it back to second and

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.869 
so now I can drop it back to second and
into<00:01:01.280> first

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
into first

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.179 
into first
I<00:01:02.989> was<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> stay<00:01:04.379> at<00:01:04.559> first<00:01:04.739> until<00:01:05.129> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
I was going to stay at first until I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.700 
I was going to stay at first until I
switch<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.700> out<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:05.970> first<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.380> I'll<00:01:07.439> keep<00:01:07.619> it

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
switch it out at first so I'll keep it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.950 
switch it out at first so I'll keep it
in<00:01:07.770> first<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.369> second<00:01:08.759> here<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.840> know<00:01:09.900> I'm

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
in first for a second here you know I'm

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.240 
in first for a second here you know I'm
not<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> get<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.619> too<00:01:10.799> hard<00:01:11.070> it's

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
not going to get on it too hard it's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:22.660 
not going to get on it too hard it's
just<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.490> little<00:01:11.580> bit<00:01:11.759> to<00:01:11.909> it

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.209 

the<00:01:23.670> ships<00:01:23.939> are<00:01:24.060> nice<00:01:24.299> smooth<00:01:24.950> slightly<00:01:25.950> fur

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
the ships are nice smooth slightly fur

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.219 
the ships are nice smooth slightly fur
it<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.939> depends<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.329> how<00:01:27.509> you're<00:01:27.659> driving<00:01:28.049> -

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it just depends on how you're driving -

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.230 
it just depends on how you're driving -
it's<00:01:28.770> an<00:01:28.890> adaptive<00:01:29.340> transmission<00:01:29.970> what<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
it's an adaptive transmission what that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.050 
it's an adaptive transmission what that
means<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.920> you're<00:01:32.250> driving<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.000> to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
means is as you're driving it's going to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.060 
means is as you're driving it's going to
sense<00:01:33.390> kind<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:34.320> type<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> style<00:01:34.890> you're

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
sense kind of what type of style you're

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.800 
sense kind of what type of style you're
driving<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.909> right<00:01:36.090> now<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.390> getting<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.630> little

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
driving so right now is getting a little

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.080 
driving so right now is getting a little
bit<00:01:37.049> aggressive<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.679> the<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.039> the<00:01:38.280> back<00:01:38.670> end<00:01:38.970> on

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
bit aggressive on the on the back end on

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.719 
bit aggressive on the on the back end on
that<00:01:39.240> higher<00:01:39.810> third<00:01:40.200> gear<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.159> shifted<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
that higher third gear so it shifted a

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.639 
that higher third gear so it shifted a
little<00:01:41.819> bit<00:01:41.970> firmer<00:01:42.299> for<00:01:42.630> me<00:01:42.750> which<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.289> what

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
little bit firmer for me which is what

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.100 
little bit firmer for me which is what
you<00:01:43.770> want<00:01:44.329> say<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.390> I'm<00:01:45.539> going<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.750> get<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:45.929> it<00:01:46.049> a

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
you want say so I'm going to get on it a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.050 
you want say so I'm going to get on it a
little<00:01:46.350> bit<00:01:46.500> here<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.920> probably<00:01:47.909> see<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
little bit here it's a probably see the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.910 
little bit here it's a probably see the
traction<00:01:48.420> control<00:01:48.750> light<00:01:48.780> come<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.140> I'll

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
traction control light come on I'll

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.109 
traction control light come on I'll
shift<00:01:50.159> through<00:01:50.369> them<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.579> first<00:01:50.819> right<00:01:51.060> now

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
shift through them in first right now

00:01:51.119 --> 00:02:00.650 
shift through them in first right now
the<00:01:51.509> manual<00:01:51.840> mode<00:01:53.899> sideways<00:01:54.899> there

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.120 

kicked<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.260> to<00:02:01.410> fifth<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:01.830> it'll<00:02:02.100> actually

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
kicked it up to fifth so it'll actually

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.950 
kicked it up to fifth so it'll actually
shift<00:02:02.580> through<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.000> as<00:02:03.120> its<00:02:03.330> necessary<00:02:03.810> but

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
shift through it as its necessary but

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.200 
shift through it as its necessary but
you<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.200> keep<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:04.650> a<00:02:04.770> higher<00:02:05.310> rpm<00:02:05.850> range<00:02:06.090> a

you can keep it in a higher rpm range a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.050 
you can keep it in a higher rpm range a
little<00:02:06.450> bit<00:02:06.540> longer<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:06.990> want<00:02:07.260> to<00:02:08.000> so<00:02:09.000> I've

from<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.519> factory<00:04:02.910> set<00:04:03.120> up<00:04:03.239> it's<00:04:03.359> a<00:04:03.389> little

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
from the factory set up it's a little

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.259 
from the factory set up it's a little
bit<00:04:03.690> taller<00:04:03.840> here<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.440> little<00:04:04.709> bit<00:04:04.919> thicker

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
bit taller here a little bit thicker

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.670 
bit taller here a little bit thicker
reason<00:04:06.269> for<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.660> is<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.199> has<00:04:07.319> a<00:04:07.349> finger

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
reason for that is it has a finger

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.069 
reason for that is it has a finger
radiators<00:04:08.280> get<00:04:08.790> your<00:04:08.909> inner<00:04:09.090> cooler<00:04:09.389> and<00:04:09.780> a

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
radiators get your inner cooler and a

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.369 
radiators get your inner cooler and a
bigger<00:04:10.260> transmission<00:04:10.889> cooler<00:04:11.099> on<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:12.379> so

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
bigger transmission cooler on it and so

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.599 
bigger transmission cooler on it and so
we<00:04:13.470> have<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.739> have<00:04:13.859> a<00:04:13.889> little<00:04:14.159> bit<00:04:14.220> more<00:04:14.370> room

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
we have to have a little bit more room

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.000 
we have to have a little bit more room
so<00:04:14.819> we<00:04:14.909> modify<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.449> whole<00:04:15.720> front<00:04:16.079> end<00:04:16.229> here<00:04:16.530> we

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
so we modify the whole front end here we

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.229 
so we modify the whole front end here we
have<00:04:17.159> this<00:04:17.310> new

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
have this new

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.039 
have this new
cooling<00:04:18.690> stack<00:04:18.989> cover<00:04:19.530> here<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:20.400> mount<00:04:20.549> and

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
cooling stack cover here and mount and

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.730 
cooling stack cover here and mount and
that's<00:04:22.049> pretty<00:04:22.289> much<00:04:22.410> it

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
that's pretty much it

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.090 
that's pretty much it
again<00:04:23.100> very<00:04:23.699> factory<00:04:24.360> fit<00:04:24.600> and<00:04:24.750> finish<00:04:25.110> the

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
again very factory fit and finish the

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.710 
again very factory fit and finish the
only<00:04:26.340> difference<00:04:26.729> is<00:04:26.940> it<00:04:27.060> says<00:04:27.270> predator

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
only difference is it says predator

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.659 
only difference is it says predator
cross<00:04:27.990> here<00:04:28.350> from<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.919> factory<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.370> probably

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
cross here from the factory you probably

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.120 
cross here from the factory you probably
wouldn't<00:04:29.970> say<00:04:30.090> predator<00:04:30.710> although<00:04:31.710> probably

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
wouldn't say predator although probably

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.370 
wouldn't say predator although probably
should<00:04:32.570> but<00:04:33.570> that<00:04:34.190> that's<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.430> Duramax

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
should but that that's the Duramax

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:46.490 
should but that that's the Duramax
