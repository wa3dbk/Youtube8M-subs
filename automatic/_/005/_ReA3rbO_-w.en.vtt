look at the where here is broken the
reason<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.920> why<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:02.980> spinning<00:02:03.670> ways<00:02:03.940> was<00:02:04.480> a

trade follow the fish crank rested on

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:16.950 
trade follow the fish crank rested on
the<00:02:09.220> round<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:11.160> then<00:02:12.160> turn<00:02:15.630> right<00:02:16.630> can<00:02:16.930> we

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
the round and then turn right can we

please not loosen wherever the fish fall

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.760 
please not loosen wherever the fish fall
very<00:02:30.190> hard<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.970> because<00:02:31.690> fishing<00:02:32.170> wire<00:02:32.380> is

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
very hard and because fishing wire is

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.120 
very hard and because fishing wire is
very<00:02:33.130> deaf<00:02:33.490> driver<00:02:33.960> so<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.230> girls<00:02:35.560> must<00:02:35.980> be
