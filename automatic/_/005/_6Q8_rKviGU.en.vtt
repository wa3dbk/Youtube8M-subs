00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
and the different cameras that I use and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.140 
and the different cameras that I use and
we're<00:01:39.900> starting<00:01:40.259> out<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:41.150> the

we're starting out with this one the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.170 
we're starting out with this one the
reason<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.899> all<00:01:43.259> Canon<00:01:43.890> cameras<00:01:44.399> is

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
reason I like all Canon cameras is

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.130 
reason I like all Canon cameras is
mainly<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.890> they<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.460> feature<00:01:47.700> of

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.200 

having<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.520> touch<00:01:53.520> screen<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:55.340> reverses<00:01:56.340> so

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
having a touch screen that reverses so

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.959 
having a touch screen that reverses so
that<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.659> see<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.130> oftentimes<00:01:59.130> I'm<00:01:59.670> doing

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
that you can see it oftentimes I'm doing

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.940 
that you can see it oftentimes I'm doing
the<00:02:00.119> shooting<00:02:00.450> myself<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.290> need<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.680> be<00:02:01.799> able

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the shooting myself so I need to be able

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.840 
the shooting myself so I need to be able
to<00:02:02.100> see<00:02:03.229> with<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.380> camera<00:02:04.829> what<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> shot<00:02:05.670> is

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
to see with the camera what the shot is

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.330 
to see with the camera what the shot is
gonna<00:02:06.030> look<00:02:06.270> like<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.409> really<00:02:07.680> I've<00:02:07.890> always

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.970 
that's why I keep it in fact that's the
default<00:02:39.380> way<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:39.890> use<00:02:40.190> this<00:02:40.430> camera<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:42.680> by

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
default way that I use this camera is by

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.880 
default way that I use this camera is by
having<00:02:43.489> that<00:02:44.330> wide-angle<00:02:45.110> lens<00:02:45.320> right<00:02:45.680> on

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
having that wide-angle lens right on

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.210 
having that wide-angle lens right on
there<00:02:46.130> just<00:02:46.280> like<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:51.050> takes<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.950> lot

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
there just like that and it takes a lot

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.570 
there just like that and it takes a lot
better<00:02:52.519> pictures<00:02:53.650> because<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.950> don't<00:02:55.220> have<00:02:55.400> to

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
better pictures because I don't have to

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.190 
better pictures because I don't have to
worry<00:02:55.820> about<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.209> focus<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.840> stuff<00:02:57.050> like

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
worry about the focus and stuff like

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.800 
worry about the focus and stuff like
that<00:02:57.440> when<00:02:57.860> you<00:02:57.950> have<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.130> wide-angle<00:02:58.489> lens<00:02:58.880> it

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
that when you have a wide-angle lens it

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.509 
that when you have a wide-angle lens it
hangul<00:03:00.410> it<00:03:00.620> handles<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:03.680> much<00:03:03.950> more<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:04.370> don't

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
hangul it handles so much more you don't

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.890 
hangul it handles so much more you don't
have<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.730> worry<00:03:04.910> about<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.269> it's<00:03:05.360> just<00:03:05.480> almost

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
have to worry about it it's just almost

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.570 
have to worry about it it's just almost
like<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.290> point-and-shoot<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.400> that's

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
like a point-and-shoot and that's

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.160 
like a point-and-shoot and that's
another<00:03:07.850> reason<00:03:08.269> that<00:03:08.300> I<00:03:08.450> like<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:08.930> camera

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
another reason that I like this camera

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:17.050 
another reason that I like this camera
so<00:03:09.530> much<00:03:12.220> it<00:03:13.220> has<00:03:13.459> dual<00:03:15.010> SD<00:03:16.010> cards<00:03:16.489> I<00:03:16.610> can<00:03:16.640> put

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
so much it has dual SD cards I can put

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.160 
so much it has dual SD cards I can put
two<00:03:17.510> SD<00:03:17.959> cards<00:03:18.829> in<00:03:18.980> there<00:03:19.220> it's<00:03:20.209> just<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.810> great

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
two SD cards in there it's just a great

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.250 
two SD cards in there it's just a great
camera<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:21.890> that's<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.940> first<00:03:23.209> camera<00:03:23.690> in

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
camera and that's the first camera in

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.740 
camera and that's the first camera in
our<00:03:24.530> series<00:03:25.040> of<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.880> different<00:03:26.269> cameras<00:03:26.720> that

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
our series of the different cameras that

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.120 
our series of the different cameras that
I<00:03:26.959> use<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.799> that<00:03:28.549> is<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.560> camera<00:03:30.560> of<00:03:30.950> the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
I use and that is the camera of the

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.710 
I use and that is the camera of the
canon<00:03:31.670> h<00:03:32.030> FS<00:03:33.280> 2-0<00:03:34.280> now<00:03:34.940> let's<00:03:35.180> do<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.540> next

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
canon h FS 2-0 now let's do the next

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.400

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
because I use it probably 80% of the

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.500 
because I use it probably 80% of the
time<00:03:44.510> of<00:03:45.200> what<00:03:45.530> you<00:03:45.709> see<00:03:45.950> in<00:03:45.980> my<00:03:46.310> films<00:03:46.820> is<00:03:47.030> with
