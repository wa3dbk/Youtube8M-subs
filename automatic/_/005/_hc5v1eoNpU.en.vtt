automatic<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.840> if<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.019> hold<00:00:31.260> down<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
automatic so if you hold down the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.200 
automatic so if you hold down the
trigger<00:00:31.650> they<00:00:32.219> will<00:00:32.399> continue<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.880> shoot<00:00:33.059> so

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
trigger they will continue to shoot so

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.790 
trigger they will continue to shoot so
you<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.420> play<00:00:33.540> defense<00:00:33.840> with<00:00:34.110> them<00:00:34.320> but<00:00:34.710> you

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
you can play defense with them but you

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.410 
you can play defense with them but you
can<00:00:34.920> also<00:00:34.950> rush<00:00:35.520> with<00:00:35.730> them<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.030> still<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
can also rush with them and still have a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.060 
can also rush with them and still have a
good<00:00:36.630> chance<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.899> winning<00:00:36.989> gunfights<00:00:37.320> which

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
good chance of winning gunfights which

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.619 
good chance of winning gunfights which
is<00:00:38.190> especially<00:00:38.520> nice<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.180> an<00:00:39.300> assault

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
is especially nice to have an assault

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.030 
is especially nice to have an assault
rifle<00:00:39.660> since<00:00:40.410> they<00:00:40.530> tend<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.950> an

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
rifle since they tend to be an

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.889 
rifle since they tend to be an
all-purpose<00:00:41.489> weapon<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:42.390> if<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> look

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
all-purpose weapon but if we have a look

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.360 
all-purpose weapon but if we have a look
at<00:00:43.020> what<00:00:43.170> levels<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> guns<00:00:43.829> are<00:00:43.920> unlocked<00:00:44.190> at

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
at what levels the guns are unlocked at

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.639 
at what levels the guns are unlocked at
we<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:44.910> say<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> m27<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.260> unlocked<00:00:46.530> at

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
we can say that the m27 is unlocked at

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.369 
we can say that the m27 is unlocked at
level<00:00:46.680> 31<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.940> an-94<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.809> all<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> way<00:00:49.320> up

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
level 31 and the an-94 is all the way up

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.100 
level 31 and the an-94 is all the way up
at<00:00:49.469> level<00:00:49.559> 55<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.969> an-94<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> gun<00:00:51.960> you

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
at level 55 so if the an-94 is a gun you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.600 
at level 55 so if the an-94 is a gun you
really<00:00:52.350> enjoy<00:00:52.590> using<00:00:52.829> or<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.280> really<00:00:53.460> well

really enjoy using or do really well
with<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.420> well<00:00:54.660> worth<00:00:54.690> using<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
with and it's well worth using a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.020 
with and it's well worth using a
permanent<00:00:55.530> unlock<00:00:56.039> talking<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.610> since

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
permanent unlock talking on it since

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.220 
permanent unlock talking on it since
you'll<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.210> unlocking<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:57.899> an<00:00:57.960> extra

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
you'll be unlocking it for an extra

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.500 
you'll be unlocking it for an extra
fifty<00:00:58.559> four<00:00:58.770> levels<00:00:59.160> now<00:01:00.059> moving<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
fifty four levels now moving on the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.389 
fifty four levels now moving on the
damage<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.230> can<00:01:01.320> already<00:01:01.710> see<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.190> guns

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
damage we can already see that the guns

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.380 
damage we can already see that the guns
are<00:01:02.550> starting<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:03.000> some<00:01:03.180> big

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
are starting to have some big

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.539 
are starting to have some big
differences<00:01:03.690> since<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> air<00:01:04.739> 94<00:01:05.339> has<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
differences since the air 94 has a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.570 
differences since the air 94 has a
damage<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.970> between<00:01:06.240> 24<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.990> 40<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> m27

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
damage of between 24 and 40 but the m27

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.060 
damage of between 24 and 40 but the m27
has<00:01:08.850> only<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.180> damage<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.659> between<00:01:09.960> 22<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.560> 33

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
has only a damage of between 22 and 33

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.280 
has only a damage of between 22 and 33
and<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.210> puts<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> m27<00:01:13.049> at<00:01:13.229> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
and this really puts the m27 at a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.840 
and this really puts the m27 at a
disadvantage<00:01:13.619> because<00:01:14.010> even<00:01:14.610> when<00:01:14.729> it's

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
disadvantage because even when it's

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.310 
disadvantage because even when it's
dealing<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.210> maximum<00:01:15.659> amount<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.110> damage

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
dealing the maximum amount of damage

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.350 
dealing the maximum amount of damage
it's<00:01:16.979> still<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> take<00:01:17.820> at<00:01:17.909> least<00:01:18.000> 4

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
it's still going to take at least 4

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.580 
it's still going to take at least 4
shots<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.750> completely<00:01:19.170> kill<00:01:19.350> an<00:01:19.470> enemy

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
shots to completely kill an enemy

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.399 
shots to completely kill an enemy
whereas<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> an-94<00:01:21.180> all<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.720> needs<00:01:21.840> 3<00:01:22.140> shots

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
whereas the an-94 all it needs 3 shots

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.440 
whereas the an-94 all it needs 3 shots
to<00:01:22.530> do<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> same<00:01:22.979> thing<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.240> worth

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
to do the same thing now it's worth

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.149 
to do the same thing now it's worth
mentioning<00:01:24.479> recoil<00:01:25.470> at<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.680> point<00:01:25.920> since

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
mentioning recoil at this point since

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.940 
mentioning recoil at this point since
the<00:01:26.280> air<00:01:26.460> 94<00:01:27.030> has<00:01:27.240> more<00:01:27.509> recoil<00:01:27.840> than<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> m27

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the air 94 has more recoil than the m27

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.550 
the air 94 has more recoil than the m27
and<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.610> add<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.240> m27<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> very

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
and to add to that the m27 is a very

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.380 
and to add to that the m27 is a very
accurate<00:01:31.770> gun<00:01:32.159> which<00:01:32.579> means<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:32.909> very<00:01:33.090> easy

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
accurate gun which means it's very easy

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.910 
accurate gun which means it's very easy
to<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> 4<00:01:34.020> shots<00:01:34.259> needed<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
to get the 4 shots needed to get the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.130 
to get the 4 shots needed to get the
kill<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.729> damage<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.210> air<00:01:36.420> 94<00:01:36.960> is

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
kill so the damage of the air 94 is

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.380 
kill so the damage of the air 94 is
higher<00:01:37.409> but<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> m27<00:01:38.729> offers<00:01:39.150> better

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
higher but the m27 offers better

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.539 
higher but the m27 offers better
accuracy<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.560> trade-off<00:01:40.829> over<00:01:41.189> damage

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
accuracy so it's a trade-off over damage

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.370 
accuracy so it's a trade-off over damage
and<00:01:41.729> accuracy<00:01:42.240> however<00:01:42.930> something<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and accuracy however something that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.109 
and accuracy however something that
makes<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> easier<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> deal<00:01:44.399> with<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
makes it easier to deal with is the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.450 
makes it easier to deal with is the
headshot<00:01:45.570> multiplier<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> an-94<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
headshot multiplier for the an-94 and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.100 
headshot multiplier for the an-94 and
this<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.850> because<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> air<00:01:48.390> 94<00:01:48.930> has<00:01:49.079> a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
this is because the air 94 has a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.130 
this is because the air 94 has a
multiplier<00:01:49.619> headshot<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.450> 1.2<00:01:51.450> whereas<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
multiplier headshot of 1.2 whereas the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.010 
multiplier headshot of 1.2 whereas the
m27<00:01:52.770> has<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> 1.1<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.390> basically<00:01:54.840> means

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
m27 has a 1.1 and this basically means

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.359 
m27 has a 1.1 and this basically means
that<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.259> few<00:01:55.470> should<00:01:55.649> anenome<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> head

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
that a few should anenome in the head

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.670 
that a few should anenome in the head
the<00:01:56.790> air<00:01:56.969> 94<00:01:57.509> will<00:01:57.659> deal<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.840> larger<00:01:58.259> factor<00:01:58.560> of

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
the air 94 will deal a larger factor of

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.889 
the air 94 will deal a larger factor of
damage<00:01:58.979> than<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.219> m27<00:01:59.909> which<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.630> really

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
damage than the m27 which is really

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.600 
damage than the m27 which is really
powerful<00:02:01.049> when<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.500> think<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.950> air<00:02:02.100> 94

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
powerful when you think that the air 94

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.399 
powerful when you think that the air 94
already<00:02:03.360> starts<00:02:03.659> off<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.960> higher<00:02:04.110> base

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
already starts off with a higher base

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.980 
already starts off with a higher base
down<00:02:04.590> which<00:02:04.740> then<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.950> m27<00:02:05.640> now<00:02:06.299> moving<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.810> if

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
down which then the m27 now moving on if

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.690 
down which then the m27 now moving on if
we<00:02:07.170> take<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.380> look<00:02:07.560> at<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.710> clip<00:02:07.950> size<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.580> can

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
we take a look at the clip size we can

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.339 
we take a look at the clip size we can
say<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:08.970> they<00:02:09.060> both<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.539> 30<00:02:09.869> default

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
say that they both have a 30 default

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.740 
say that they both have a 30 default
clip<00:02:10.560> size<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.190> both<00:02:11.489> are<00:02:11.790> boosted<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.270> 40

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
clip size and both are boosted to a 40

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.950 
clip size and both are boosted to a 40
clip<00:02:12.930> size<00:02:13.140> with<00:02:13.590> X<00:02:13.739> 10

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
clip size with X 10

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.990 
clip size with X 10
mugs<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:14.800> there<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.010> no<00:02:15.250> difference<00:02:15.490> there<00:02:15.790> at

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
mugs so there is no difference there at

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.640 
mugs so there is no difference there at
all<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:16.480> that's<00:02:16.690> pretty<00:02:16.990> much<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.320> standard

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
all and that's pretty much the standard

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.740 
all and that's pretty much the standard
for<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.830> holistic<00:02:18.040> for<00:02:18.520> class<00:02:18.730> two<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:19.630> they

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
for the holistic for class two so they

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.090 
for the holistic for class two so they
aren't<00:02:19.900> anything<00:02:20.080> special<00:02:20.560> because<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.920> that

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
aren't anything special because of that

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.430 
aren't anything special because of that
but<00:02:21.550> what<00:02:21.700> does<00:02:21.880> affect<00:02:22.270> this<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.990> reload

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
but what does affect this is the reload

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.100 
but what does affect this is the reload
time<00:02:23.470> now<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.130> m27<00:02:24.730> can<00:02:25.060> reload<00:02:25.420> in<00:02:25.630> two<00:02:25.840> point

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
time now the m27 can reload in two point

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.500 
time now the m27 can reload in two point
five<00:02:26.260> seven<00:02:26.590> seconds<00:02:27.130> but<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.580> an-94<00:02:28.330> is

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
five seven seconds but the an-94 is

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.480 
five seven seconds but the an-94 is
right<00:02:28.780> behind<00:02:28.960> at<00:02:29.530> three<00:02:29.860> point<00:02:30.100> one<00:02:30.280> two

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
right behind at three point one two

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.790 
right behind at three point one two
seconds<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.270> fully<00:02:31.510> reload<00:02:31.960> and<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.650> good

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
seconds to fully reload and this is good

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.500 
seconds to fully reload and this is good
if<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:32.980> like<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.250> m27<00:02:33.760> because<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.300> have<00:02:34.420> the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
if you like the m27 because you have the

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.090 
if you like the m27 because you have the
advantage<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:34.990> reloading<00:02:35.320> faster<00:02:35.770> over<00:02:36.010> the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
advantage of reloading faster over the

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.850 
advantage of reloading faster over the
an-94<00:02:36.850> but<00:02:37.390> because<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.870> m27<00:02:38.350> does<00:02:38.650> less

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
an-94 but because the m27 does less

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.770 
an-94 but because the m27 does less
damage<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.700> kind<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.120> need<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.420> extra

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
damage you kind of need that extra

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.870 
damage you kind of need that extra
reload<00:02:41.170> time<00:02:41.410> in<00:02:41.650> order<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.340> keep<00:02:42.490> on<00:02:42.640> track

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
reload time in order to keep on track

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.070 
reload time in order to keep on track
with<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.150> other<00:02:43.240> guns<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.750> game<00:02:43.780> because

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
with the other guns in the game because

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.230 
with the other guns in the game because
a<00:02:44.200> four-shot<00:02:44.740> kill<00:02:44.770> is<00:02:45.130> really<00:02:45.820> going<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.090> take

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
a four-shot kill is really going to take

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.820 
a four-shot kill is really going to take
up<00:02:46.360> your<00:02:46.480> ammunition<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:47.320> being<00:02:47.560> able<00:02:47.650> to

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
up your ammunition so being able to

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.530 
up your ammunition so being able to
reload<00:02:48.160> faster<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.730> definitely<00:02:49.330> going<00:02:49.480> to

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
reload faster is definitely going to

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.330 
reload faster is definitely going to
help<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.840> out<00:02:49.990> but<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:50.950> nightly<00:02:51.160> fall

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
help you out but the and nightly fall

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.250 
help you out but the and nightly fall
can<00:02:51.490> deal<00:02:51.610> more<00:02:51.850> damage<00:02:52.060> per<00:02:52.240> bullet<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:53.140> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
can deal more damage per bullet so the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.870 
can deal more damage per bullet so the
chances<00:02:53.590> are<00:02:53.740> that<00:02:53.950> you're<00:02:54.460> going<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.670> kill

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
chances are that you're going to kill

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.550 
chances are that you're going to kill
just<00:02:55.150> as<00:02:55.240> many<00:02:55.420> people<00:02:55.690> with<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.900> an-94<00:02:56.500> in

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
just as many people with the an-94 in

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.580 
just as many people with the an-94 in
one<00:02:56.710> clip<00:02:56.980> as<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.220> would<00:02:57.880> with<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.120> m27<00:02:58.810> now

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
one clip as you would with the m27 now

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.260 
one clip as you would with the m27 now
the<00:02:59.650> quicker<00:02:59.980> reload<00:03:00.280> times<00:03:00.550> are<00:03:00.730> also<00:03:00.880> very

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
the quicker reload times are also very

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.030 
the quicker reload times are also very
important<00:03:01.810> for<00:03:01.990> when<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.230> comes<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.560> our<00:03:02.650> final

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
important for when it comes to our final

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.680 
important for when it comes to our final
start<00:03:03.280> which<00:03:03.640> is<00:03:03.670> rounds<00:03:04.180> per<00:03:04.360> minute<00:03:04.450> which

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
start which is rounds per minute which

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.420 
start which is rounds per minute which
is<00:03:04.720> all<00:03:04.990> about<00:03:05.200> how<00:03:05.380> fast<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.800> gun<00:03:06.010> shoots<00:03:06.280> its

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
is all about how fast the gun shoots its

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.700 
is all about how fast the gun shoots its
bullets<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.330> m27<00:03:07.900> has<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.170> fire<00:03:08.410> rate<00:03:08.590> of

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
bullets so the m27 has a fire rate of

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.050 
bullets so the m27 has a fire rate of
seven<00:03:09.040> hundred<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.400> twenty<00:03:09.670> rounds<00:03:09.790> per

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
seven hundred and twenty rounds per

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.120 
seven hundred and twenty rounds per
minute<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.750> an-94<00:03:11.440> has<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.620> fire<00:03:11.860> rate<00:03:12.010> of

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
minute and the an-94 has a fire rate of

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.950 
minute and the an-94 has a fire rate of
six<00:03:12.460> hundred<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.150> these<00:03:13.300> fire<00:03:13.570> rates<00:03:13.780> help

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
six hundred and these fire rates help

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.720 
six hundred and these fire rates help
both<00:03:14.260> of<00:03:14.440> these<00:03:14.530> guns<00:03:14.830> out<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.010> lot<00:03:15.280> because

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
both of these guns out a lot because

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.100 
both of these guns out a lot because
they<00:03:15.970> help<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.300> take<00:03:16.450> advantage<00:03:16.840> of<00:03:16.990> their

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
they help to take advantage of their

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.230 
they help to take advantage of their
weaker<00:03:17.410> points<00:03:17.800> and<00:03:17.950> what<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.460> mean<00:03:18.730> by<00:03:18.880> this<00:03:18.940> is

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
weaker points and what I mean by this is

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.080 
weaker points and what I mean by this is
that<00:03:19.300> it's<00:03:19.510> good<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:20.020> m27<00:03:20.560> shoots<00:03:20.890> at

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
that it's good that the m27 shoots at

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.610 
that it's good that the m27 shoots at
720<00:03:22.090> rounds<00:03:22.330> per<00:03:22.450> minute<00:03:22.570> because<00:03:23.020> it<00:03:23.290> has<00:03:23.470> to

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
720 rounds per minute because it has to

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.500 
720 rounds per minute because it has to
be<00:03:23.740> able<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:24.070> in<00:03:24.280> order<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.910> get<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.120> four<00:03:25.360> shot

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
be able to in order to get a four shot

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.720 
be able to in order to get a four shot
killing<00:03:25.870> time<00:03:26.140> otherwise<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.100> would<00:03:27.460> become

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
killing time otherwise it would become

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.030 
killing time otherwise it would become
very<00:03:28.000> underpowered<00:03:28.360> in<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:29.050> game<00:03:29.230> but<00:03:29.800> on<00:03:29.950> the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
very underpowered in the game but on the

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.340 
very underpowered in the game but on the
flip<00:03:30.280> side<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.940> an-94<00:03:31.720> has<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:31.870> more<00:03:32.140> difficult

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
flip side the an-94 has a more difficult

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.470 
flip side the an-94 has a more difficult
recoil<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.400> by<00:03:33.520> eight<00:03:33.670> having<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.030> low<00:03:34.210> fire

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
recoil so by eight having a low fire

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.360 
recoil so by eight having a low fire
rate<00:03:34.510> of<00:03:34.810> 600<00:03:35.350> rounds<00:03:35.470> per<00:03:35.620> minute<00:03:35.830> you're

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
rate of 600 rounds per minute you're

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.980 
rate of 600 rounds per minute you're
able<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.670> have<00:03:36.820> much<00:03:37.150> better<00:03:37.180> control<00:03:37.840> over

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
able to have much better control over

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.110 
able to have much better control over
the<00:03:38.230> recoil<00:03:38.590> over<00:03:38.890> distance<00:03:39.340> which<00:03:39.850> then

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
the recoil over distance which then

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.400 
the recoil over distance which then
allows<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.600> take<00:03:40.780> advantage<00:03:40.810> of<00:03:41.290> the

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
allows you to take advantage of the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.640 
allows you to take advantage of the
extra<00:03:41.710> damage<00:03:41.890> that<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.520> an-94<00:03:43.300> has<00:03:43.480> so<00:03:44.410> after

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
extra damage that the an-94 has so after

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.290 
extra damage that the an-94 has so after
looking<00:03:44.770> through<00:03:44.920> these<00:03:45.190> gun<00:03:45.400> stats<00:03:45.730> which

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
looking through these gun stats which

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.970 
looking through these gun stats which
gun<00:03:46.570> is<00:03:46.780> better<00:03:46.960> between<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.470> two<00:03:47.620> is<00:03:47.800> it<00:03:47.920> the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
gun is better between the two is it the

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.850 
gun is better between the two is it the
air<00:03:48.160> 94<00:03:48.700> or<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:48.940> m27<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.380> answer<00:03:50.620> that

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
air 94 or the m27 and the answer that

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.830 
air 94 or the m27 and the answer that
kind<00:03:51.070> of<00:03:51.250> depends<00:03:51.580> on<00:03:51.670> one<00:03:51.910> main<00:03:52.120> thing<00:03:52.150> which

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
kind of depends on one main thing which

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.360 
kind of depends on one main thing which
is<00:03:52.990> how<00:03:53.170> you<00:03:53.230> intend<00:03:53.680> to<00:03:53.710> use<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:54.040> weapon

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
is how you intend to use the weapon

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.950 
is how you intend to use the weapon
because<00:03:54.880> if<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.120> need<00:03:55.270> an<00:03:55.390> assault<00:03:55.630> rifle

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
because if you need an assault rifle

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.480 
because if you need an assault rifle
that<00:03:55.990> can<00:03:56.170> be<00:03:56.290> all-purpose<00:03:56.890> and<00:03:56.920> used<00:03:57.160> really

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
that can be all-purpose and used really

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.160 
that can be all-purpose and used really
well<00:03:57.610> in<00:03:57.730> close<00:03:57.910> quarters<00:03:58.210> combat<00:03:58.420> then<00:03:59.080> the

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
well in close quarters combat then the

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.920 
well in close quarters combat then the
m27<00:03:59.920> is<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.340> best<00:04:00.580> choice<00:04:00.880> as<00:04:01.330> it's<00:04:01.510> fire<00:04:01.720> rate

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
m27 is the best choice as it's fire rate

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.040 
m27 is the best choice as it's fire rate
is<00:04:01.960> the<00:04:02.170> same<00:04:02.320> as<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.560> PDW<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.910> MSMC<00:04:04.360> but

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
is the same as the PDW and the MSMC but

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.150 
is the same as the PDW and the MSMC but
if<00:04:05.140> you're<00:04:05.290> looking<00:04:05.560> for<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.710> higher<00:04:05.920> damage

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
if you're looking for a higher damage

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.950 
if you're looking for a higher damage
assault<00:04:06.550> rifle<00:04:06.820> which<00:04:07.270> will<00:04:07.450> dominate<00:04:07.870> a

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
assault rifle which will dominate a

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.780 
assault rifle which will dominate a
medium<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.380> long<00:04:08.530> range<00:04:08.740> but<00:04:09.160> also<00:04:09.370> drop

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
medium to long range but also drop

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.940 
medium to long range but also drop
targets<00:04:10.210> effectively<00:04:10.840> at<00:04:10.930> close<00:04:11.200> range<00:04:11.590> then

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
targets effectively at close range then

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.920 
targets effectively at close range then
the<00:04:12.130> air<00:04:12.280> 94<00:04:12.850> is<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.030> better<00:04:13.300> choice<00:04:13.510> to<00:04:13.570> take

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
the air 94 is a better choice to take

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.020 
the air 94 is a better choice to take
because<00:04:14.380> of<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.770> higher<00:04:15.010> damage<00:04:15.340> now

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
because of the higher damage now

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.700 
because of the higher damage now
personally<00:04:16.510> with<00:04:16.630> me<00:04:16.810> I<00:04:16.989> find<00:04:17.350> that<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.560> air

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:17.710 
personally with me I find that the air

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.010 
personally with me I find that the air
94<00:04:18.250> suits<00:04:18.520> me<00:04:18.670> better<00:04:18.850> because<00:04:19.420> of<00:04:19.540> the<00:04:19.630> extra

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
94 suits me better because of the extra

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.539 
94 suits me better because of the extra
damage<00:04:20.320> because<00:04:20.590> I<00:04:20.680> can<00:04:20.859> turn<00:04:21.130> on<00:04:21.160> an<00:04:21.400> enemy

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
damage because I can turn on an enemy

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.100 
damage because I can turn on an enemy
and<00:04:21.820> still<00:04:22.270> stand<00:04:22.510> a<00:04:22.570> chance<00:04:22.600> of<00:04:22.870> getting<00:04:22.900> the

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
and still stand a chance of getting the

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.380 
and still stand a chance of getting the
kill<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:23.680> I<00:04:24.100> also<00:04:24.250> found<00:04:24.610> that<00:04:24.700> the<00:04:24.820> m27

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
kill and I also found that the m27

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.510 
kill and I also found that the m27
suffers<00:04:25.930> too<00:04:26.169> much<00:04:26.350> at<00:04:26.500> range<00:04:26.740> because<00:04:27.310> there

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
suffers too much at range because there

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.830 
suffers too much at range because there
too<00:04:27.669> many<00:04:27.849> guns<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.240> can<00:04:28.360> kill<00:04:28.569> it<00:04:28.660> by<00:04:28.780> the

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
too many guns that can kill it by the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.839 
too many guns that can kill it by the
time<00:04:29.139> you've<00:04:29.319> landed<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.680> 4<00:04:29.889> shot<00:04:30.130> kill<00:04:30.160> which

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
time you've landed a 4 shot kill which

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.029 
time you've landed a 4 shot kill which
is<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.000> massive<00:04:31.449> disadvantage<00:04:31.720> so<00:04:32.560> for<00:04:32.710> me<00:04:32.830> I'd

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
is a massive disadvantage so for me I'd

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.159 
is a massive disadvantage so for me I'd
suggest<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.550> end<00:04:33.699> 94<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.419> I<00:04:34.569> also<00:04:34.690> recommend

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
suggest the end 94 and I also recommend

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.839 
suggest the end 94 and I also recommend
using<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.590> permanent<00:04:36.039> unlock<00:04:36.280> talking<00:04:36.639> on<00:04:36.729> it

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
using the permanent unlock talking on it

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.730 
using the permanent unlock talking on it
for<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.090> as<00:04:37.210> well<00:04:37.449> if<00:04:37.780> you<00:04:38.199> feel<00:04:38.440> like<00:04:38.620> you

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
definitely a powerful gun if you can get

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.469 
definitely a powerful gun if you can get
