00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
the imagery that he creates it is an

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.810 
the imagery that he creates it is an
inspiration<00:05:37.930> to<00:05:38.260> all<00:05:38.500> of<00:05:38.530> us<00:05:38.860> to<00:05:39.280> walk<00:05:39.520> through

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
inspiration to all of us to walk through

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.850 
inspiration to all of us to walk through
our<00:05:39.850> halls<00:05:40.150> and<00:05:40.450> to<00:05:40.540> see<00:05:40.750> Trent's<00:05:41.140> artwork<00:05:41.590> I

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
our halls and to see Trent's artwork I

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.250 
our halls and to see Trent's artwork I
walk<00:05:42.160> by<00:05:42.190> certain<00:05:42.670> ones<00:05:42.880> and<00:05:43.150> I<00:05:43.360> know<00:05:43.630> that's

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
walk by certain ones and I know that's

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.990 
walk by certain ones and I know that's
one<00:05:44.530> of<00:05:44.620> my<00:05:44.710> favorites<00:05:45.130> I<00:05:45.310> have<00:05:45.520> about<00:05:45.700> four

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
one of my favorites I have about four

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.080 
one of my favorites I have about four
that<00:05:46.240> are<00:05:46.270> my<00:05:46.510> favorite<00:05:46.870> here<00:05:47.080> so<00:05:47.970> Trent<00:05:48.970> is

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
that are my favorite here so Trent is

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.360 
that are my favorite here so Trent is
driven<00:05:49.390> to<00:05:49.540> paint<00:05:49.960> and<00:05:50.320> he<00:05:50.560> gets<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.890> lot<00:05:51.070> out<00:05:51.130> of

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
driven to paint and he gets a lot out of

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.090 
driven to paint and he gets a lot out of
it<00:05:51.640> I<00:05:51.880> think<00:05:52.870> he<00:05:52.990> gets<00:05:53.140> a<00:05:53.290> lot<00:05:53.470> out<00:05:53.710> of<00:05:53.800> being

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
it I think he gets a lot out of being

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.280 
it I think he gets a lot out of being
able<00:05:54.280> to<00:05:54.430> come<00:05:54.640> to<00:05:54.850> the<00:05:54.970> studio<00:05:55.180> and<00:05:55.570> be<00:05:56.080> in<00:05:56.200> a
