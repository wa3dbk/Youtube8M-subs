00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.679
 hello everyone, you are transferring b the game 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.669
 or leading Vladislav shafts 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.949
 today's review will be a bit 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.419
 unusual since my attention got 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.699
 director drift opi 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.189
 I'm not a big fan of arcade racing and 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 even more so racing simulators 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.039
 the game attracted the fact that this is the first 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.690
 franchise project fritupley director 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.940
 can q deal with the frituple model 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.539
 and whether the game is worthy of attention, we learn in 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.539
 this release 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.610
 so 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.290
 the interface in the game is simple but not because 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.660
 it is well executed but because 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.510
 wins back some inherent minimalism 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.130
 most console games 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.810
 menu items are quite standard in 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.750
 in any case will not be able to enter into 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.880
 delusion in the in-game store 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.550
 you are offered to buy packages with 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.870
 Rome car kits and boosters 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.870
 or all of this separately 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.290
 directly on the gameplay can be little 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.119
 what to say at the very beginning of the game to you 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.920
 suggest to choose one of the simple ones 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.890
 cars and try yourself on 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.050
 test track after a successful finish 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.330
 will win the lottery with which you can 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.540
 get different boost and repair kits 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.820
 and other goodies when you get comfortable in 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.700
 the game you can take part in races on 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.160
 time and here you get the fattest 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.660
 rewards depending on time 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.460
 passing the track you have 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.170
 opportunity to get new cars 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.820
 environment in the game is destructible and there is 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.819
 the ability to cut a path using 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.619
 different shortcuts but the experience gained in 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.750
 end of each race affect such 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.619
 indicators like drift being in 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.690
 airborne and eliminate opponents with 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.640
 physics game is absolutely not friendly machine 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.100
 behave unrealistic but it's not 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.289
 simulator arcade race so cars 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.789
 surrounded by feelings that weigh 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:09.530
 like a box absolutely not confused 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.660
 crashing into a wall or another car you 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.140
 must take into account your strength indicators 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.180
 auto 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.130
 because the cars break down here and you 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.850
 risk ending the race earlier than 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.250
 I would like the developers well 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.630
 took care of the soundtracks he attached yet 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.150
 plus 50 dynamic game 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.220
 graphics by modern standards tangibly 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.850
 the lack of competition with 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.050
 other riders are not happy either 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.180
 the only competitive moment in 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.000
 the game is the time of passing the tracks but 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.040
 I would like to see pvp I think that in 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.460
 each game should be competitive 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.330
 moment 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.310
 otherwise, I see no reason to do it online. 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.500
 As for the shop for real in it, I, too 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.710
 I see no reason for other than repair kits 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.320
 the rest is not necessarily in general 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.490
 we have an unremarkable product and 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.860
 carrying nothing innovative on this 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.130
 I say goodbye the registration link will be in 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.930
