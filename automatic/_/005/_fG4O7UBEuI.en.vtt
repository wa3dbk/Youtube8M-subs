what we got to do is all this fish we
got<00:00:30.150> four<00:00:30.449> pounds<00:00:30.929> we<00:00:31.650> got<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.890> cut<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.160> up<00:00:32.279> into

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
got four pounds we got to cut it up into

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.479 
got four pounds we got to cut it up into
one-inch<00:00:32.759> chunks<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.450> then<00:00:34.320> add<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> couple

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
one-inch chunks and then add a couple

we<00:00:38.250> switch<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.730> into<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.210> new<00:00:39.329> solution

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
we switch it out into the new solution

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.470 
we switch it out into the new solution
so<00:00:40.710> there<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.399> got<00:00:41.520> our<00:00:41.550> five<00:00:41.820> pounds<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.300> a
