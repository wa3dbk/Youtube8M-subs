00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.140 
you're going to need an application
called<00:00:32.940> adb<00:00:33.660> wireless<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.400> program<00:00:35.910> that

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.300 
called adb wireless it is a program that
requires<00:00:36.570> root<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.440> your<00:00:37.650> phone<00:00:37.830> does<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.220> to
