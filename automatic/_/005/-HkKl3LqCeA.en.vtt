00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.700
 We want to show you the perfect ny 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.849
 option of our flat hooks to all of you 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.240
 famous points bmw series 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.910
 just flat hooks their main range 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.380
 applications it was of course a window opening 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.529
 since it was most convenient to work 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.869
 in the window opening due to the fact that the body 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.359
 tool has conditional quenching 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.400
 can you press down here in this 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.000
 tool we went a little further 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.920
 means and applied the opportunity applied 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.649
 movable sliders well this is everything 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.309
 famous own design 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:46.620
 Here is the first and and applied forces Gunter Here in 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.809
 her instrument now many hers 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.140
 apply well-known tools 2 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.870
 Tallinn Anaconda 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.870
 many people use it to his love 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.670
 worthy instrument means here 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.629
 actually say the difference from all 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.640
 other similar tools is 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.390
 again in that body of it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.850
 tool you 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.290
 has conditional hardening which allows 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.720
 raise it situationally and 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.600
 correspondingly use it more widely 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.460
 Means previous hooks twist thickness 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.590
 there were five millimeters here we are and 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.540
 increased made 6 millimeter bars 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.939
 actually giving the instrument has become more 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.909
 elastic also endings 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.280
 has mean threaded any and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.380
 hole under use on the gardens but also 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.710
 accordingly the main difference again 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.460
 two sliders that allow enough 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.340
 make full use of the potential of this 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.470
 hook means well at the expense of these two 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.470
 baits we have the opportunity to work 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.360
 inside parts to be able to 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.180
 use a wider tool 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.000
 due to such a spacer it means 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.570
 functions yes well, you can use any type 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.520
 nozzles can use extension cords 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.469
 can apply 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.399
 soft packing tight ie any 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:06.079
 which will be convenient for you 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.969
 accordingly, fixation of movable 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.970
 elements is carried out by 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.849
 the nozzles themselves up conveniently enough 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.700
 since the nozzle is quite male not 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.260
 expands with some additional 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.160
 fixing devices therefore it is 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.709
 Comfortable enough I hope the tool is it 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.200
 like it too, and empower 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.540
 already loved means a tool 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.209
 nozzles as I become can use any 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.209
 as who are in the arsenal and in this
