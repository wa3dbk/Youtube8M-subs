00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
what's up everyone Arctic here giving

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.200 
what's up everyone Arctic here giving
you<00:00:12.480> part<00:00:12.780> two<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.380> my<00:00:13.830> commentary<00:00:14.639> asking

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
you part two of my commentary asking

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.730 
you part two of my commentary asking
whether<00:00:15.450> or<00:00:15.630> not<00:00:15.719> years<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.170> war<00:00:16.320> three<00:00:16.590> will

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
whether or not years of war three will

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.790 
whether or not years of war three will
be<00:00:16.859> on<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.160> pro<00:00:17.400> circuit<00:00:17.869> next<00:00:18.869> season<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.439> get

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
be on the pro circuit next season I get

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.370 
be on the pro circuit next season I get
that<00:00:19.890> question<00:00:19.949> quite<00:00:20.820> frequently<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.810> lot

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
that question quite frequently a lot

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.710 
that question quite frequently a lot
more<00:00:22.560> than<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.430> would<00:00:23.519> think<00:00:23.580> especially<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
more than you would think especially the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.009 
more than you would think especially the
last<00:00:24.900> couple<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.289> months<00:00:26.720> just<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.810> quick

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
last couple of months just a quick

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.540 
last couple of months just a quick
rehash<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.800> part<00:00:29.429> one<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.029> talked<00:00:30.990> about<00:00:31.550> some

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
rehash on part one I talked about some

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.979 
rehash on part one I talked about some
of<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> reasons<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.000> gears<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.390> war<00:00:33.540> two<00:00:33.570> was

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
of the reasons that gears of war two was

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.010 
of the reasons that gears of war two was
removed<00:00:34.380> from<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> circuit<00:00:35.300> I<00:00:36.300> don't<00:00:36.930> know

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
removed from the circuit I don't know

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.780 
removed from the circuit I don't know
all<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.200> reasons<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:37.980> some<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> ones

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
all the reasons but some of the ones

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.750 
all the reasons but some of the ones
that<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.059> know<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:40.460> obviously<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.640> were

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that I do know one obviously we were

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.910 
that I do know one obviously we were
playing<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.300> different<00:00:42.450> game<00:00:42.660> from<00:00:43.590> online

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
playing a different game from online

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.560 
playing a different game from online
tool<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:47.309> title<00:00:47.610> updates<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.329> didn't

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
tool and the title updates really didn't

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.560 
tool and the title updates really didn't
affect<00:00:48.660> land<00:00:49.440> play<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.239> basically<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.449> were

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
affect land play so basically you were

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.200 
affect land play so basically you were
playing<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> game<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.920> rag<00:00:53.309> doll<00:00:53.550> stuns<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
playing the game with rag doll stuns and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.060 
playing the game with rag doll stuns and
online<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.260> were<00:00:55.379> playing<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.739> game<00:00:55.920> with

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
online you were playing a game with

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.549 
online you were playing a game with
smoke<00:00:56.340> stones<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.480> little<00:00:57.899> bit<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> practice

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
smoke stones so a little bit of practice

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.160 
smoke stones so a little bit of practice
discrepancies<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.280> hurt<00:01:00.050> obviously<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
discrepancies that hurt obviously the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.619 
discrepancies that hurt obviously the
game<00:01:01.489> from<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.609> viewer<00:01:02.879> standpoint<00:01:03.480> because

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
game from a viewer standpoint because

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.820 
game from a viewer standpoint because
people<00:01:04.080> didn't<00:01:04.290> understand<00:01:04.650> what<00:01:04.799> was

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
people didn't understand what was

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.219 
people didn't understand what was
happening<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.970> why<00:01:06.510> there<00:01:06.689> was<00:01:06.810> ragdoll

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
happening and why there was ragdoll

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.170 
happening and why there was ragdoll
stuns<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.860> from<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> practice<00:01:08.490> standpoint<00:01:09.000> for

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
stuns and from a practice standpoint for

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
stuns and from a practice standpoint for
players<00:01:10.159> other<00:01:11.159> thing<00:01:11.490> obviously<00:01:12.479> was<00:01:12.900> hosted

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
players other thing obviously was hosted

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.020 
players other thing obviously was hosted
managed<00:01:13.500> think<00:01:14.070> that's<00:01:14.220> always<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.970> be

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
managed think that's always going to be

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.670 
managed think that's always going to be
a<00:01:15.119> factor<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.540> years<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.840> war<00:01:16.020> no<00:01:16.170> matter<00:01:16.380> what

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
a factor in years of war no matter what

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.109 
a factor in years of war no matter what
and<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.990> last<00:01:19.140> thing<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.820> i'll<00:01:20.820> talk<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and the last thing and i'll talk a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.730 
and the last thing and i'll talk a
little<00:01:21.270> bit<00:01:21.420> more<00:01:21.570> about<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.350> second

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
little bit more about that in a second

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.219 
little bit more about that in a second
here<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.490> stream<00:01:24.299> numbers<00:01:24.630> weren't<00:01:24.930> very

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
here is that stream numbers weren't very

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.510 
here is that stream numbers weren't very
good<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:27.380> obviously<00:01:28.380> if<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.009> stream<00:01:29.250> numbers

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
good and obviously if the stream numbers

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.520 
good and obviously if the stream numbers
aren't<00:01:29.670> good<00:01:30.049> even<00:01:31.049> with<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> other

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
aren't good even with all the other

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
aren't good even with all the other
things<00:01:31.829> i<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.070> they<00:01:32.369> might<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.759> kept<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
things i think they might have kept the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.580 
things i think they might have kept the
game<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.720> circuit<00:01:34.020> had<00:01:34.140> they<00:01:34.229> been<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.409> lot

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
game on the circuit had they been a lot

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
game on the circuit had they been a lot
higher<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:35.909> got<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.119> get<00:01:36.210> people<00:01:36.509> watching

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
higher so we got to get people watching

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.390 
higher so we got to get people watching
Gears<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.650> War<00:01:37.799> 3<00:01:37.890> next<00:01:38.340> season<00:01:39.590> now<00:01:40.590> answering

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
Gears of War 3 next season now answering

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.630 
Gears of War 3 next season now answering
the<00:01:41.579> question<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.659> think<00:01:43.340> Gears<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.399> War<00:01:44.520> 3

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the question do I think Gears of War 3

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.450 
the question do I think Gears of War 3
will<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> pro<00:01:45.329> circuit<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:46.369> want<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
will be on the pro circuit I want to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.880 
will be on the pro circuit I want to
take<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.640> from<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.479> standpoint<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:49.290> what

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
take this from the standpoint of what

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.130 
take this from the standpoint of what
I've<00:01:50.399> seen<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.030> far<00:01:51.479> from<00:01:52.430> Sundance<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:54.479> other

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
I've seen so far from Sundance and other

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.969 
I've seen so far from Sundance and other
people<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> MLG<00:01:56.130> community<00:01:56.869> obviously<00:01:57.979> he

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
people in the MLG community obviously he

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.010 
people in the MLG community obviously he
seems<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.369> he's<00:01:59.549> cautiously<00:02:00.180> optimistic

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
seems like he's cautiously optimistic

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.969 
seems like he's cautiously optimistic
I'm<00:02:01.710> cautiously<00:02:02.399> optimistic<00:02:03.469> right<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:04.530> I

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
I'm cautiously optimistic right now I

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.510 
I'm cautiously optimistic right now I
think<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.670> gears<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.090> war<00:02:06.210> 3<00:02:07.039> won't<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.280> on

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
think that gears of war 3 won't be on

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.270 
think that gears of war 3 won't be on
the<00:02:08.550> circuit<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.330> way<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:09.780> think<00:02:10.280> if

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
the circuit and the way that we think if

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.559 
the circuit and the way that we think if
you<00:02:11.520> want<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> compare<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.239> game<00:02:12.450> like

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
you want to compare to a game like

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.790 
you want to compare to a game like
Starcraft<00:02:13.170> or
