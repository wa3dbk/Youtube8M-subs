 Hi, I'm Luis Martin and this is my 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.120
 project no more you wonder what is 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.700
 a love my mother also asks 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.860
 that's why I know it's not easy to 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.650
 explain but in two minutes I'm going to 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.570
 try in the world its more than seven 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.820
 one billion people and if only 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.730
 we talk about diabetes more than 5% the 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.619
 seems to us seems little if they all 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.480
 They would give their hands in the equator 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.940
 the return to earth more than a hundred times 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.920
 the worst of all is that every year two 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.060
 millions of children are diagnosed with 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.940
 this sickness 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.500
 you know that each one of those people 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.469
 trikinis is six times a day with this 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.300
 gadget during the 365 days of the year 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.500
 during all the years of the rest of his 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.390
 life no more punctures we have not 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.750
 solved this problem with our 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.750
 product 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.650
 I could tell you for example that blue ccoo 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.290
 is a printed circuit board with a 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.140
 chip arm cortex m 0 with technology 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.330
 bluetooth 4.0 a gyorgy and sensors 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.650
 Near infrared spectrometry for 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.540
 the same measure jonah of sugar in 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.250
 blood but other than that we 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.470
 I would be very interested in just lifting 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.360
 engineer could also tell you that it is 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.040
 a telemedicine monitoring system 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.380
 of the levels of monosaccharides in 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.910
 blood for patients affected by 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.180
 metabolic disorder of diabetes 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.280
 merits but users are not doctors 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.750
 however, what is really important is 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.340
 that the group is a drive that goes to 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.350
 help people not to have to 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.420
 depend on your disease monitoring 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.070
 constantly the blood glucose and 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.120
 warning them of critical levels is their 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.910
 mobile phone 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.250
 - Pricks less worries more 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.420
 freedom but we're not going to stop here 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.310

 we will be able to help many more people 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.710
 affected by other pathologies
