00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.540
 holland should explain how to unlock the 480 electric singsong on the 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.189
 Latin American region the European official continues not interested 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.719
 The first thing we do is turn on the cell phone if a sim card door 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:18.140
 with the cell phone turned on we put the sim card from another provider 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.189
 But be careful, change my card, otherwise it will not be unlocked 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.310
 they are going to feel very frustrated 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.650
 what we have to do now card 50 is to dial a code to 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.790
 Restart the cell phone and return it to factory status 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.650
 we mark fas theory 27 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.290
 67 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.680
 theoretical fas 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.140
 38 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 55 and we mark 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.580
 I every day and that I'm not going to make sources of the serenissima not have 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.220
 configured with results 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.710
 configure it most and we press this middle button 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.490
 and then the one on the left 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.220
 the cell phone will support this unlocking but once they pay it and return it to 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.310
 learning is going to ask for a network code which they do not have and they will not get 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.310
 Nowhere do you have to change that code 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.410
 to change that code 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.010
 after they caught him the simulate they did all the quilombo is him and they 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.950
 said 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.260
 asterisk 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.140
 74 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.960
 65 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.370
 62 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.610
 5 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.030
 pathetic 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.640
 63 8 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.840
 asterisk and make eight stamps 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.000
 athletic and eight more zeros 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.330
 it's going to look like a sign that says 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.330
 code you must customize it 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.170
 mark back 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.420
 numeral 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.190
 74 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.750
 65 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.950
 62 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.280
 5 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.780
 asterisk 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.190
 63 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.400
 8 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.010
 pathetic and dial 800 returned and at the end with the number 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.460
 a poster that says 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.780
 code the network is what I do and from now on they have cell totally 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.780
 locked you can put the chip that you sing 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:16.479
 and your life will change for your 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:17.309
 but that it serves him
