00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
a little bit him I guess that would be

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.940 
a little bit him I guess that would be
enough<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:07.390> here<00:01:08.200> we<00:01:08.229> go<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:09.430> is<00:01:09.549> how<00:01:09.670> you<00:01:09.729> do
