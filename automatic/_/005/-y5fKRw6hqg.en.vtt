00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.720
 hello welcome to the new tutorial 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:10.690
 crafts for all 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.690
 today we are going to make a bowl of buttons 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.060
 materials that we are going to need 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.060
 foil 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.449
 a container 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.539
 transparent school glue and buttons 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.539
 of colors 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.829
 let's start 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.280
 let's take the aluminum foil and what 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.199
 we are going to place inside the container 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.730
 trying to make it as close as possible 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:55.649
 to the inside of the container 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.649
 we arrange it well in this way 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.430
 We leave the leftovers out 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.089
 and we cover the entire inner part of 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.399
 container 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.740
 let's use the school glue 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.710
 transparent and we are going to dump it inside 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.940
 of the container 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.930
 and we are going to begin to adhere the buttons 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.930
 in this way 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.720
 this is the time to think maybe of 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.410
 some color combination 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.410
 interesting that we want to use 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.350
 one of the most important things is 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:36.670
 try to stick the buttons as close 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.670
 possible one from others 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.360
 let's go adding more glue to 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.430
 As we are going to go up through the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.840
 sides of the container add the 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.600
 buttons 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.460
 every now and then we are going to bring a little 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.720
 more the buttons with each other 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.550
 so there are no free spaces 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.010
 as you can see here I added 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.300
 some buttons smaller and we're going to 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.300
 keep adding glue 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.959
 We can give you the height we want 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.239
 inside the container we can make 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.239
 shorter or get to the top 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.390
 in this case I also took a few beads 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.830
 wooden heart - shaped like 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.050
 I will adhere to the top of the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.810
 bowl the decorated part of the heart 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.340
 I saw it to be placed outwards, so 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.050
 at this moment I see only the part 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.900
 from behind the heart 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:46.299
 and I'm arranging it and sticking around 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.610
 down in the description of the video has 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.560
 a link to my facebook page enter 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.930
 do like and you can see and share 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.200
 photos or consult me ​​any kind of 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.200
 Doubts 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.740
 It can also be placed inside 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.990
 a little bit of glue to strengthen a 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.670
 little bit more the bowl 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.870
 once we throw it away we go with the 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.560
 fingers or with a brush review 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.980
 and now if we let it dry between a day 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.980
 or two 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.890
 once it's dry just what 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.880
 we will remove from the container with the paper 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.880
 in this way 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.690
 and we are going to start to take off the paper 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.090
 aluminum bowl itself this what 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.370
 I make a being slowly trying not to 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.130
 break because it is very possible that 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.620
 still not completely dry 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.390
 since the paper prevents the air from passing 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.500
 and it takes longer to dry 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.500
 we are going to take it out 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.960
 as we can see right in the part 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.700
 from below still actively has not 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.349
 drying all 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.640
 but once we take out the paper from 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.349
 aluminum we're going to let it dry 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.349
 little bit more and it will be finished 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:05.069
 We finished remove the remains until 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:05.069
 it's clean in this way 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.940
 once dry ready we have a beautiful 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.500
 colorful bowl 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.140
 in this bowl you can place 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.160
 Candies can be placed the keys 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.160
 the occasional fruit 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.600
 Here I show you also other examples 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.670
 with other designs for example you 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.680
 some plastic beads 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.680
 little eyes of these that move 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:40.750
 we can also use it as a beautiful 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.850
 base for a candle 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.990
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.990
 in the next craft
