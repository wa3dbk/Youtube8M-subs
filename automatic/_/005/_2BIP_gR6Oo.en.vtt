kind<00:02:05.869> of<00:02:05.959> deal<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:07.700> was<00:02:07.819> pretty<00:02:08.030> stressful<00:02:08.269> in

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
kind of deal it was pretty stressful in

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.170 
kind of deal it was pretty stressful in
the<00:02:08.569> sense<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:08.869> if<00:02:09.679> we<00:02:10.340> don't<00:02:10.880> want<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.090> make

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
the sense that if we don't want to make

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.430 
the sense that if we don't want to make
a<00:02:11.239> comparison<00:02:11.750> people<00:02:12.349> that<00:02:12.470> come<00:02:12.620> see<00:02:12.829> us

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
a comparison people that come see us

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.710 
a comparison people that come see us
so<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:16.040> saw<00:02:16.250> our<00:02:16.430> best<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.330> put

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
so you saw our best and you put

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.120 
so you saw our best and you put
everything<00:02:17.960> that<00:02:18.170> we<00:02:18.290> could<00:02:18.470> ensure<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.980> we

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
everything that we could ensure that we

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.860 
everything that we could ensure that we
thought<00:02:19.310> would<00:02:19.550> make<00:02:19.610> an<00:02:19.820> impact<00:02:20.150> no<00:02:20.420> actually

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
thought would make an impact no actually

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.450 
thought would make an impact no actually
all<00:02:20.990> people<00:02:21.560> at<00:02:21.620> sea<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.900> we<00:02:23.930> also<00:02:24.230> had<00:02:24.770> I

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
all people at sea and we also had I

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.480 
all people at sea and we also had I
think<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.030> projection<00:02:26.600> makes<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.490> complete

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
think the projection makes a complete

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.340 
think the projection makes a complete
other<00:02:29.080> environment<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.710> set<00:02:31.010> was

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
other environment that the set was

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.980 
other environment that the set was
percept<00:02:33.350> is<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.710> when<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:34.640> stop<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.780> is

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
percept is that when you stop it this is

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.470 
percept is that when you stop it this is
totally<00:02:36.380> different<00:02:36.410> from<00:02:36.830> circa<00:02:37.820> ambient<00:02:38.300> day

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
totally different from circa ambient day

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.620 
totally different from circa ambient day
so<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.200> think<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.560> was<00:02:39.740> we<00:02:40.010> try<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.280> push<00:02:40.940> the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
so I think that was we try to push the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.590 
so I think that was we try to push the
projection<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.920> we<00:02:43.070> try<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.250> change<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.390> act

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
projection and we try to change the act

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.390 
projection and we try to change the act
and<00:02:44.900> playing<00:02:45.260> interacts<00:02:45.860> that<00:02:46.100> wasn't

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
and playing interacts that wasn't

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.120 
and playing interacts that wasn't
comparable<00:02:46.940> to
