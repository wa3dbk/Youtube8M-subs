00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.670
 although my work that is if it is a thing as common and applicable held 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.950
 you can apply a sustained hike

 and if one uses it that way 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.299
 let's say you need this 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.589

 it was death 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:11.339
 not to say the first 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:15.309
 Icarus to protect for me was like a kind of power mecca 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:18.889
 and work there and in fact it was known as the first day 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.209
 VerdÃº the first door that was 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.589
 the order berenguer illustrating in all sections of the king 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.699
 for 11 years 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:36.239
 until I get to my current situation which is a weekly collaboration cladea 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.079
 have more in 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.930
 the Sunday this is one of the parties 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.769
 really the things that I do that more 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.120
 what I like the most satisfies me because it's like a version 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.120
 free of 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.279
 of the present or of what the agencies so I remember that I was 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:57.279
 it goes through your head 

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:14.209
 - I certainly think that in my life the work of the enthusiastic illustrator has 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.090
 revalued 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.430
 in new Mississippi 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.430
 since last Saturday to be 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.240
 we meet 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.039
 the transgenic 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.439
 sometimes the protagonist 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:30.699
 what happens to me is that there 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.289
 of the desire to leave a lunge 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.060
 the minister 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.059
 the wildest 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:39.819
 I was outraged and mean I can not imagine 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:41.139
 there is no other case 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.029
 that's one thing but things happen to me 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:47.029
 have a past and if they happen to me 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:51.730
 although he knows the people that I have met and have no homicide 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.620
 in as much the future a world 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.620

 the one that is titled the behind for his study 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:21.089
 that's why it exceeds an amateur who lives in the country of the fairies and wants 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:24.749
 you are not happy with him 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:30.069
 what happens there will decide the land to learn how things happen 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.330
 in the third series pretty 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.789
