00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
and his main struggle I would say is his

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.500 
and his main struggle I would say is his
social<00:02:58.530> skills<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.640> really<00:03:00.090> I'm<00:03:00.329> always

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
social skills so I really I'm always

looking<00:03:00.959> for<00:03:00.989> something<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.620> can<00:03:01.829> do<00:03:01.950> not

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
looking for something that I can do not

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.039 
looking for something that I can do not
only<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.489> increases<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.780> know<00:03:03.810> academic

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
only to increases you know academic

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.050 
only to increases you know academic
skills<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.010> speech<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.489> things<00:03:05.730> like<00:03:05.849> that

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
skills and speech and things like that

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.809 
skills and speech and things like that
but<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:07.319> social<00:03:07.739> is<00:03:07.859> a<00:03:07.889> really<00:03:08.250> big<00:03:08.459> part<00:03:08.730> of

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
but the social is a really big part of

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.479 
but the social is a really big part of
it<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.209> don't<00:03:09.389> want<00:03:09.540> him<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.900> be<00:03:10.190> left<00:03:11.190> playing

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
it I don't want him to be left playing

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.030 
it I don't want him to be left playing
alone<00:03:11.930> for<00:03:12.930> really<00:03:13.139> long<00:03:13.260> periods<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.680> time<00:03:13.889> I

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
alone for really long periods of time I

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.500 
alone for really long periods of time I
think<00:03:14.069> that<00:03:14.340> that's<00:03:14.489> counterproductive<00:03:14.880> to

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
think that that's counterproductive to

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.470 
think that that's counterproductive to
what<00:03:15.900> his<00:03:16.079> needs<00:03:16.230> are<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.850> when<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:17.880> saw<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.299> I

probably say most most play I think

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.409 
probably say most most play I think
something<00:03:51.329> like<00:03:51.480> this<00:03:51.840> would<00:03:52.700> be<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:54.209> little

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
something like this would be a little

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.080 
something like this would be a little
bit<00:03:54.599> more<00:03:54.840> engaging<00:03:55.609> you<00:03:56.609> know<00:03:56.700> when<00:03:56.819> you<00:03:56.910> have

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
bit more engaging you know when you have

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.370 
bit more engaging you know when you have
a<00:03:57.230> like<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.430> small<00:03:59.430> device<00:03:59.880> that<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:00.720> space

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
a like a small device that that space

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.500 
a like a small device that that space
between<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:02.220> individual<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:02.940> device<00:04:03.329> is

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
between the individual and the device is

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.479 
between the individual and the device is
kind<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.780> like<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:03.930> private<00:04:04.169> space<00:04:04.650> and

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
kind of like a private space and

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.349 
kind of like a private space and
engaging<00:04:06.299> someone<00:04:06.870> in<00:04:07.139> that<00:04:07.769> is<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.970> little

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
engaging someone in that is a little
