00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.340
 the skulls have become a 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.290
 Mexican symbol we find them in 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.020
 different places the Lord putting together 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.180
 Guzm치n is an artisan and for 30 years has 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.900
 been crafting paper skulls a 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.930
 unique old craft work in my 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.939
 roots since I was a kid I started to see the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.470
 relationship that we had between the holidays 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.320
 and the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.860
 and the funerals then when I 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.070
 I started producing to work on paper 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.380
 I charged myself to make skulls myself 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.380
 charge to the skulls because in my 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.260
 family we were going to where I was born to a 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.850
 party or a wake then I always 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.640
 It drew a lot of attention how was the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.070
 courtship towards the pantheon the process of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.660
 bury and everything and the relationship between 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.200
 life and death then there when 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.809
 I started doing this to translate ideas 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.550
 different and this afternoon of doing 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:14.040
 people are the ones who are pushing us to 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:15.830
 do more there are other things that I do that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.680
 They are according to the seasons not 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.229
 we make births christos angels is 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.360
 what people are asking us in the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.780
 way there are people who ask for weird things 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.970
 like heads like people thinking or 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.770
 writers and we try to make them to the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.220
 they way they are us 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.220
 asking 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.900
 i 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.900
 has about 4 or 5 years that the trend 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.880
 has been stronger more than anything here in 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.610
 the border because here was not not so much 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.750
 since calaveras was more than another kind of 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.820
 customs more more American type but 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.640
 the Chicano people those who were born there 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.290
 in the USA, our countrymen 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.630
 they started to lean a lot for the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.880
 skull with so many years of experience 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.920
 perform those skulls is something natural 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.130
 for Mr. Guzm치n he is always 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.080
 looking for how to make new designs on 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.080
 process can start from the morning 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.670
 to finish about six or seven pieces 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.390
 for in the course of the day already 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.730
 have them finished here are two 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.550
 people we do and one gets 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.980
 I ordered the assembly and I gave them the 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.110
 finished the end it makes me laugh because 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.970
 times more hard thinking about how to do it 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.210
 sometimes I think so much that I do not do anything 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.160
 there are days that I am asleep and awake 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.470
 in the early morning and I say this is what 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.050
 I'm going to wake up my wife and 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.300
 I'm going to do right now I'm 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.410
 asleep but that's when it is born then or 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.270
 I was born the next 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.270
 I get up and put it into practice 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.750
 then this kind of finish that 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.640

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.640
 modeled but people know him 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.740
 commonly as part of papier mache and 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.380
 in themselves they are not so wrong because it is 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.700
 Our many types carry bond paper 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.380
 Chinese paper light paper in fact there 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.230
 very few people there must have 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.850
 some people who also work in 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.970
 paper 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.140
 there are more pi침atas and other things 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.140
 people there we are giving way 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.690

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.690

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.299
 bathroom of a plastic resin that is base 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.440
 water since it is well dried is given a 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:07.200
 patina that we make with pitch 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.910

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.890
 rustic finish

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.390

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.430
 artisans like Mr. guzm치n who 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.700
 our traditions are still alive and that 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.260
