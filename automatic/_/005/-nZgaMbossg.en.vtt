 architects architects and 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.920
 builders 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.380
 architectural architects and 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.320
 architect architects builders 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.029
 and builders 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.460
 hello florent and singing architects 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.410
 I am architects and builders 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.269
 on this ground ten thousand square meters 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.320
 with local regulations 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.050
 we realized 17 houses with garden for 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.360
 children with all equipment 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.850
 necessary road lighting and others 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.700
 all the houses were sold 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.980
 in six months we commit ourselves from the first 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.890
 go to a global price with 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.660
 options and guaranteed deadlines 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.489
 the whole project the 17 houses have 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.800
 been made since the earthworks 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.649
 until the finishing workouts the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.930
 house was finished anyway but we 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.989
 also had options in terms of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.000
 painting to perfect the sanitary is 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.960
 different from the finish option for 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.640
 go more or less far 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.589
 the exterior layout also 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.360
 can have an architect's performance 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.670
 interior to determine the choices of 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.490
 colors and materials or the customer the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.890
 do it 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.079
 with a craftsman the water the project was 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.990
 realized in collaboration with via 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:19.270
 positive and sal novak off and who has 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.759
 many participated in the choice of 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.430
 report of a product based on 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.110
 recycled glass bottles that form 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.090
 a kind of pumice very very 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.820
 light and who has the abilities to be 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.340
 draining and being insulating removes it 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.950
 the foundations and that allows us 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.409
 to also save an insulator on the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.640
 to be written off on the floor of the ground floor 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.890
 since it is below and allows 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.640
 to beautify the product is very 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.030
 ecological 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.039
 it saves energy 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.409
 important for the building with a real 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.200
 summer comfort in all situations 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.020
 or challenge the project was still 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.090
 to integrate these seventeen very homes 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.069
 contemporary in a word there was 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.860
 than fifty inhabitants 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.869
 today obviously the welcome has 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.090
 well done there was a hamlet party 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.500
 which took place at the beginning of July which 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.780
 went well with all 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.220
 locals newcomers and 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.250
 the elders who were there since very 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.250
 long time 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.040
 right here
