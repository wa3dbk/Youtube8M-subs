that hear the motor running inside but
the<00:00:32.790> mass<00:00:33.329> won't<00:00:33.660> go<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.079> down<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.530> then

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
the mass won't go up and down and then

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.280 
the mass won't go up and down and then
of<00:00:35.460> course<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.210> get<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.750> get<00:00:36.930> some<00:00:37.170> of

robust<00:01:59.899> motor<00:02:00.899> drive<00:02:01.170> assembly<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:01.890> tell

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
robust motor drive assembly I can tell

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.590 
robust motor drive assembly I can tell
by<00:02:02.159> looking<00:02:02.189> at<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.880> little<00:02:03.090> bit<00:02:03.210> heavier

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
by looking at it's a little bit heavier

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.929 
by looking at it's a little bit heavier
some<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> features<00:02:05.070> are<00:02:05.250> different<00:02:05.460> from

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
some of the features are different from

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.359 
some of the features are different from
the<00:02:06.119> older<00:02:06.540> ones<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.170> used<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.649> so

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
the older ones that they used to so

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.100 
the older ones that they used to so
we're<00:02:08.610> really<00:02:08.819> happy<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.390> get<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.929> we're

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
we're really happy to get this in we're

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.500 
we're really happy to get this in we're
going<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.289> be<00:02:10.410> able<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.619> provide<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.510> along

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
going to be able to provide this along

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.230 
going to be able to provide this along
it<00:02:12.750> has<00:02:12.900> some

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
it has some

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.820 
it has some
really<00:02:13.480> good<00:02:13.750> factory<00:02:14.170> instructions<00:02:14.680> I'm

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
really good factory instructions I'm

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.190 
really good factory instructions I'm
going<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.100> add<00:02:15.310> some<00:02:15.760> tips<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.450> there<00:02:16.630> on<00:02:16.900> how

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
going to add some tips in there on how

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.440 
going to add some tips in there on how
to<00:02:17.230> how<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:18.100> wire<00:02:18.460> it<00:02:18.640> in<00:02:18.760> because<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.180> wiring

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
to how to wire it in because the wiring

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.570 
to how to wire it in because the wiring
obviously<00:02:20.200> isn't<00:02:20.560> going<00:02:20.710> to<00:02:20.770> plug<00:02:21.010> directly

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
obviously isn't going to plug directly

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.270 
obviously isn't going to plug directly
in<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:22.600> do<00:02:22.840> have<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.230> advantage<00:02:23.320> though<00:02:23.980> that

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
in you do have the advantage though that

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.320 
in you do have the advantage though that
the<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:25.300> screw<00:02:25.660> in<00:02:25.780> connection<00:02:27.510> for<00:02:28.510> your

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
the the screw in connection for your

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.420 
the the screw in connection for your
antenna<00:02:31.330> wire<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.200> radio<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.890> going<00:02:33.280> to

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
antenna wire to the radio is going to

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.860 
antenna wire to the radio is going to
work<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:33.940> at<00:02:34.060> least<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.450> don't<00:02:34.600> have<00:02:34.720> to

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
work so at least you don't have to

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.600 
work so at least you don't have to
modify<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:35.950> are<00:02:36.070> going<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.310> have<00:02:36.460> to

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
modify that but you are going to have to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.000 
modify that but you are going to have to
modify<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.150> wiring<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.470> kind<00:02:38.710> of<00:02:38.800> need

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
modify the wiring and you kind of need

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.820 
modify the wiring and you kind of need
to<00:02:39.040> know<00:02:39.340> what<00:02:39.610> wiring<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.300> hook<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.830> inside

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
to know what wiring to hook to inside

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.530 
to know what wiring to hook to inside
the<00:02:42.040> trunk<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.460> get<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:43.360> work<00:02:43.390> properly

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
the trunk to get this to work properly

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.120 
the trunk to get this to work properly
but<00:02:44.050> I<00:02:44.080> just<00:02:44.320> want<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.590> encourage<00:02:44.710> you<00:02:44.980> you

you one or more of these sections have
frozen<00:03:21.160> up<00:03:21.280> together<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:22.600> learned<00:03:23.380> that's<00:03:23.530> like

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
frozen up together I learned that's like

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.920 
frozen up together I learned that's like
about<00:03:24.250> 20<00:03:24.700> years<00:03:24.850> ago<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.390> I've<00:03:25.480> used<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.870> a

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
about 20 years ago and I've used it a

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.750 
about 20 years ago and I've used it a
number<00:03:25.960> of<00:03:26.230> times<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.620> works<00:03:26.740> great<00:03:27.040> you

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
number of times it works great you

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.170 
number of times it works great you
really<00:03:27.940> if<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.570> don't<00:03:28.810> if<00:03:29.050> you<00:03:29.260> can't<00:03:29.560> get<00:03:30.180> the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
really if you don't if you can't get the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.450 
really if you don't if you can't get the
antenna<00:03:31.660> tail<00:03:31.990> all<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.260> way<00:03:32.410> out<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:33.010> can

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
antenna tail all the way out you can

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.050 
antenna tail all the way out you can
loose<00:03:33.880> it<00:03:34.030> like<00:03:34.240> this<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:35.190> do<00:03:36.190> this<00:03:36.370> but<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.820> lot

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
loose it like this and do this but a lot

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.430 
loose it like this and do this but a lot
of<00:03:37.120> times<00:03:37.330> you'll<00:03:37.450> have<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.690> hook<00:03:37.840> power<00:03:38.140> up

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
of times you'll have to hook power up
