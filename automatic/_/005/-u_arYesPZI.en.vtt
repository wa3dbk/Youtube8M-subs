00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.620
 Omsk did a lot of pressure against us 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.920
 in our zone we had a problem 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:58.769
 free from this pressure there is not 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.979
 skip first break anyone more often 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.199
 Utyagin virus today against such 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.979
 Omsk good game, we, too, must also 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.590
 say what mi 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.070
 heroes have the same mistakes forgotten several times 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.340
 the player behind and 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.560
 also did not want to but it happened that even 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:23.280
 counter attack there rival for whites scored 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:27.409

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.380
 today not only please yourself and me 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.950
 fans guys played with huge 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.840
 by desire 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.569
 all vision is ready to sheet moments well again 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.130
 say a lot because on the strands and 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.130
 missed such bad goals 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.649
 concentration lost a little bit but in 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.899
 the ending I'm glad and practically this year 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.969
 the city itself is not forgotten 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.450
 so I am very glad that we were so lucky 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:00.079
 and we will try further and getting ready 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.079
 for the next match 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:32.600
 I think we have someone to do to 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:44.510
 didn't relax didn't tell me 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:46.490
 relaxed i think that at the moment u 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.090
 which Minsk was beaten 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.920
 he showed that he was not standing still 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.200
 panic no panic he had 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.520
 you can see the whole flock almost all 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:03.560
 urban cut off the blue line and i 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:07.330
 I think the first match showed us what can 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.330
 he is our stable brother 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.769
