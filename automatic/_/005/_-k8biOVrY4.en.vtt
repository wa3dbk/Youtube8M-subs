00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.370
 this is a book by peter reekmans 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.059
 meaning was over 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.110
 flor still had a slight pain in her nose 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.049
 first 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.539
 forest opposite the white paper 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.119
 he inspired in the snow 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.460
 nice hear his interrogation 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.329
 I just can't draw it 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.519
 do you know what it manages 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.909
 just put 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.470
 a dot somewhere 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.559
 and then I get it 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.559
 what happens 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.880
 a felt-tip pen last week 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.880
 firmly on the paper in Dublin 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.660
 who the package that that on 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.660
 I watched it in time 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.900
 they advanced to feyenoord and they 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.020
 never 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.020
 don't just post on Monday after this 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.540
 lost shrugged 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.540
 I can't draw, but I can write in particular 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.380
 then lost the week after the sign came in already 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.450
 she is not what she saw 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.530
 immediately after more than an hour 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.380
 that was the dot 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.980
 signed that 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.090
 the dot 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.090
 in and reads large curls 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.960
 10 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.480
 he sends that is not entirely me 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.080
 that helped one to be able 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.950
 they took the board too far 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.210
 which she had never used I went to work 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.580
 sea â€‹â€‹turtles and painted 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.950
 forget is this 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.490
 a green dot 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.310
 and though the dot 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.730
 a blue dot 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.510
 some blue in the red 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.620
 nevertheless questioned what she could make a purple piece 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.480
 they always try the news 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.480
 I got stitches in all sorts of colors 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.000
 but if I can make the little one stronger 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.730
 can I also make a large sticker 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:14.270
 she studied paint from a larger pot with a larger cupboard on a large paper 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.279
 to make violence 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:19.659
 even lost the spot 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.369
 know this is to paint 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.209
 at the school's exhibition 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.209
 that the punctuality of floors was a great success 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.979
 a boy approached 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:34.619
 did you make that 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:35.759
 how great 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:38.629
 I wish I could draw 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.629
 I think you can change the language she lost 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.130
 I can't get a straight line yet 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.079
 people who don't attract 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.449
 presentations 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.459
 she gave the boy a lot of food 4 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.559
 let's see then 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.559
 and did you back the boy pulled 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:02.629
 stood staring for a long time after the boy's scribbles 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.479
 and then she said 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.399
 beautiful 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:11.399
 some time in amerongen 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:14.379
