on<00:02:18.050> skis<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.890> point<00:02:19.100> where<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.090> know

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
on skis to the point where the you know

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.460 
on skis to the point where the you know
they<00:02:20.300> had<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.570> N<00:02:20.690> number<00:02:20.959> painted<00:02:21.260> on<00:02:21.350> the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
they had the N number painted on the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.840 
they had the N number painted on the
actual<00:02:21.800> gear<00:02:21.980> lake<00:02:22.130> so<00:02:22.280> they<00:02:22.370> could<00:02:22.520> find<00:02:22.700> them

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
actual gear lake so they could find them

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.550 
actual gear lake so they could find them
again<00:02:22.940> because<00:02:23.570> it's<00:02:23.870> on<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.140> off<00:02:24.230> them<00:02:24.380> so

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
again because it's on and off them so

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.750 
again because it's on and off them so
much<00:02:25.120> it's<00:02:26.120> truly<00:02:26.510> been<00:02:26.630> used<00:02:27.260> as<00:02:27.500> per<00:02:28.130> Cessna

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760

developed and designed as airplane
backcountry<00:02:30.410> right<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:31.549> that's<00:02:31.670> all<00:02:31.880> been

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
backcountry right so that's all been

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.610 
backcountry right so that's all been
cleaned<00:02:32.269> out<00:02:32.450> yeah<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:32.870> see<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.200> panel<00:02:33.500> we

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
point where when you get in it you'll

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.140 
point where when you get in it you'll
think<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.360> was<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.510> restart

right later centrioles basically rebuild
it<00:03:39.030> as<00:03:39.150> though<00:03:39.299> it<00:03:39.420> says<00:03:39.569> yeah<00:03:39.689> new<00:03:39.900> air

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
it as though it says yeah new air

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.809 
it as though it says yeah new air
planning<00:03:40.470> but<00:03:40.799> quieter<00:03:41.220> airplane<00:03:41.519> of<00:03:41.610> course

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
planning but quieter airplane of course

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.309 
planning but quieter airplane of course
with<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.120> installation<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.659> soundproofing

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
with the installation the soundproofing

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.860 
with the installation the soundproofing
yes<00:03:43.530> okay<00:03:44.159> well<00:03:44.549> let<00:03:44.670> me<00:03:44.700> do<00:03:44.849> this<00:03:45.000> we<00:03:45.780> would

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
yes okay well let me do this we would

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.089 
yes okay well let me do this we would
like<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.049> take<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.319> look<00:03:46.409> at<00:03:46.560> some<00:03:46.680> specific

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
like to take a look at some specific

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.080 
like to take a look at some specific
areas<00:03:47.220> because<00:03:47.640> it's<00:03:47.790> actually<00:03:47.939> quite

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
areas because it's actually quite

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.509 
areas because it's actually quite
impressive<00:03:48.590> how<00:03:49.590> far<00:03:50.010> you've<00:03:50.159> taken<00:03:50.310> this

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
impressive how far you've taken this

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.059 
impressive how far you've taken this
airplane<00:03:50.939> apart<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:52.439> we'll<00:03:52.590> jump<00:03:52.799> in<00:03:52.950> there

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
airplane apart so we'll jump in there

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.349 
airplane apart so we'll jump in there
we'll<00:03:53.250> take<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.459> look<00:03:53.670> at<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.790> few<00:03:53.970> things<00:03:54.000> maybe

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
we'll take a look at a few things maybe

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.460 
we'll take a look at a few things maybe
you<00:03:54.480> can<00:03:54.599> point<00:03:54.810> them<00:03:54.930> out<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.049> us<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.409> just
