00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.269 

we're<00:00:04.230> studying<00:00:04.500> how<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.830> nervous<00:00:05.130> system

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
we're studying how the nervous system

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.639 
we're studying how the nervous system
generates<00:00:05.910> behavior<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:07.259> nervous<00:00:07.529> system

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
generates behavior and a nervous system

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.919 
generates behavior and a nervous system
has<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.250> process<00:00:08.730> sensory<00:00:09.120> information<00:00:09.360> and

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
has to process sensory information and

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.200 
has to process sensory information and
translate<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.530> sensory<00:00:10.950> information<00:00:11.059> in<00:00:12.059> a

now<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.160> touch<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.670> animal<00:00:42.030> just<00:00:42.270> behind

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
now if you touch the animal just behind

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.900 
now if you touch the animal just behind
the<00:00:42.809> head<00:00:42.840> with<00:00:43.379> an<00:00:43.530> eyelash<00:00:43.829> then<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.520> animal

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
the head with an eyelash then the animal

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.940 
the head with an eyelash then the animal
will<00:00:45.149> start<00:00:45.450> backing<00:00:45.809> up<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.500> during<00:00:46.710> this

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
will start backing up and during this

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.400 
will start backing up and during this
backing<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:48.000> will<00:00:48.149> actually<00:00:48.300> suppress<00:00:49.050> these

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
backing it will actually suppress these

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.410 
backing it will actually suppress these
head<00:00:49.649> movements<00:00:50.219> at<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.879> end<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.270> the

head movements at the end of the
reversal<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.590> will<00:00:52.920> turn<00:00:53.489> around<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.059> move

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
reversal it will turn around and move

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.060 
reversal it will turn around and move
away<00:00:54.360> from<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.780> stimulus<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.440> resume<00:00:55.860> these

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
away from the stimulus and resume these

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.459 
away from the stimulus and resume these
head<00:00:56.280> movements<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.170> there<00:00:58.170> are<00:00:58.230> also<00:00:58.320> other

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
head movements and there are also other

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.110 
head movements and there are also other
mutants<00:00:59.160> actually<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.760> we've<00:00:59.910> identified

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
mutants actually that we've identified

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.170 
mutants actually that we've identified
that<00:01:01.020> fail<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.219> suppress<00:01:02.670> these<00:01:02.940> head

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
that fail to suppress these head

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.039 
that fail to suppress these head
movements<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.989> response<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.040> touch<00:01:06.049> great

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
movements in response to touch great

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.539 
movements in response to touch great
thing<00:01:07.229> about<00:01:07.320> C<00:01:07.590> elegans<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.340> know

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
thing about C elegans is that we know

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.820 
thing about C elegans is that we know
tremendous<00:01:09.119> amount<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.450> detail<00:01:09.659> about<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
tremendous amount of detail about the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.700 
tremendous amount of detail about the
neural<00:01:11.159> circuit<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.840> know<00:01:12.960> exactly<00:01:13.470> how

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
neural circuit and we know exactly how

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.830 
neural circuit and we know exactly how
all<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> neurons<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:14.760> connected<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:15.630> kind

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
all the neurons are connected what kind

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.810 
all the neurons are connected what kind
of<00:01:15.869> synapses<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.680> gap<00:01:16.860> junctions<00:01:17.369> they<00:01:17.549> make

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
of synapses and gap junctions they make

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.510 
of synapses and gap junctions they make
so<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.659> know<00:01:18.900> how<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.009> sensory<00:01:20.369> information

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
so we know how the sensory information

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.810 
so we know how the sensory information
flows<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.750> nervous<00:01:21.990> system<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:23.670> C

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
flows in the nervous system and the C

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.190 
flows in the nervous system and the C
elegans<00:01:23.909> touch<00:01:24.270> response<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.780> actually<00:01:24.869> one

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
elegans touch response is actually one

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.649 
elegans touch response is actually one
of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.439> very<00:01:25.470> few<00:01:26.159> examples<00:01:26.460> where<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.390> know

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
of the very few examples where we know

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.319 
of the very few examples where we know
the<00:01:27.869> complete<00:01:28.380> path<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:29.250> sensory<00:01:29.759> neuron<00:01:30.090> to

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the complete path of sensory neuron to

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.260 
the complete path of sensory neuron to
inter<00:01:30.659> neuron<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.619> motor<00:01:31.860> neuron<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:33.030> know

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
inter neuron to motor neuron so we know

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.780 
inter neuron to motor neuron so we know
exactly<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> underlying<00:01:34.829> structures<00:01:35.520> that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
exactly the underlying structures that

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.300 
exactly the underlying structures that
control<00:01:36.240> behavior<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:37.799> thing<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.220> we

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
control behavior the one thing that we

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.910 
control behavior the one thing that we
actually<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:38.970> know<00:01:39.270> very<00:01:39.299> well<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
actually do not know very well is the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.100 
actually do not know very well is the
why<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> behavior<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.270> why<00:01:42.600> would<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
why of the behavior so why would the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.170 
why of the behavior so why would the
animal<00:01:43.560> suppress<00:01:44.070> these<00:01:44.250> head<00:01:44.460> movements<00:01:45.000> in

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
animal suppress these head movements in

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.770 
animal suppress these head movements in
response<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:46.200> touch<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:47.009> behind<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.520> head

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
response to touch just behind the head

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.300 
response to touch just behind the head
but<00:01:48.780> actually<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.259> does<00:01:49.500> not<00:01:49.740> suppress<00:01:50.189> these

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
but actually it does not suppress these

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.889 
but actually it does not suppress these
head<00:01:50.520> movements<00:01:51.060> when<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.360> touch<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.570> at<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
head movements when you touch it at the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.080 
head movements when you touch it at the

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
know the molecular and neuronal basis of

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.050 
know the molecular and neuronal basis of
this<00:04:04.600> behavior<00:04:04.780> in<00:04:05.200> C<00:04:05.530> elegans<00:04:05.800> we<00:04:06.730> can<00:04:06.910> now

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
this behavior in C elegans we can now

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.060 
this behavior in C elegans we can now
look<00:04:07.690> at<00:04:08.020> these<00:04:08.230> receptors<00:04:08.920> and

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
look at these receptors and

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.580 
look at these receptors and
neurotransmitters<00:04:09.880> and<00:04:10.090> other<00:04:10.330> species<00:04:10.990> to

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
neurotransmitters and other species to

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.449 
neurotransmitters and other species to
get<00:04:11.709> an<00:04:11.860> idea<00:04:12.220> maybe<00:04:12.520> how<00:04:12.880> this<00:04:13.330> behavior<00:04:13.750> has

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
get an idea maybe how this behavior has

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.459 
get an idea maybe how this behavior has
evolved
