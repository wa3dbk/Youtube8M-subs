of those those guys and see where your
speed<00:02:49.580> is<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:49.970> that's<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.690> whole<00:02:50.780> reason

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
speed is so that's the whole reason

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.240 
speed is so that's the whole reason
we're<00:02:51.140> out<00:02:51.200> here<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.920> really<00:02:52.130> awesome

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
we're out here and it's really awesome

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.350 
we're out here and it's really awesome
to<00:02:52.490> be<00:02:52.520> able<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.730> ride<00:02:52.850> with<00:02:52.970> all<00:02:53.060> those<00:02:53.180> guys

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
to be able to ride with all those guys

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.360 
to be able to ride with all those guys
and<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:54.020> think<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.770> hard<00:02:54.950> work<00:02:55.100> is<00:02:55.250> definitely

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
and I think the hard work is definitely

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.440 
and I think the hard work is definitely
paying<00:02:55.730> off

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
paying off

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.330 
paying off
I<00:02:56.480> think<00:02:57.440> we're<00:02:57.560> packing<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:57.980> little<00:02:58.160> bit<00:02:58.250> of

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
I think we're packing a little bit of

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.500 
I think we're packing a little bit of
speed<00:02:58.580> right<00:02:58.760> now<00:02:58.820> and<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.120> think<00:02:59.180> we'll<00:02:59.390> be

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
speed right now and I think we'll be
