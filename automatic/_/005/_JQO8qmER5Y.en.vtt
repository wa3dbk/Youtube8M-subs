00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.370
 the argentinian player nicolÃ¡s wants 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.379
 share my method without form of 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.049
 prepare the shakes or make calories 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.089
 Many of you asked me about 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.950
 this topic and they told me to talk a 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.390
 little about this so good 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.650
 especially to make it useful 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.650
 they did this 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.180
 well first I'll start with the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.619
 acronyms what are the ingredients that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.960
 you need to get to do this 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.660
 milkshake in the galleries 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.800
 fundamental if this is to gain weight 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.780
 but good if you're whoever 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.000
 protein can do it will have less 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.719
 that had been logically beaten but 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.579
 good according to your caloric needs 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.559
 can choose between one and another if I 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.800
 I am are gaining the weight of that 8 that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.920
 the tf-21 that need dry fruit 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.629
 how to hang up I'm using some 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.449
 cashews I am also using 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.479
 almonds if the hollow other webs too 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.929
 there is the measure we have a good handful and what 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:03.719
 pulled from osasuna a compostera is not going to 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.550
 need asoleche milk burned and if 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.850
 you want to use whole milk too 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.380
 two bananas can make it look 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.110
 now they will see why the tupper and 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.910
 also nothing because the knife itself and a 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.240
 glass on 11 to measure the amount of 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.429
 Milk 200 milliliters 250 milliliters 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.340
 which is more or less the step friend 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.990
 conventional good people the first thing that 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.130
 you have to do is paste the bananas and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.130
 cut them into small cubes 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.479
 we are going to 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.850
 leave them in the tupper and then try 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.950
 but it was the freezer for the freezer some 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.650
 two or three hours until they are well 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.410
 frozen 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.270
 because the idea of this shake is that it 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.160
 very creamy and the banana when the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 we move to a blender if it's okay 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.780
 cool, it has a shape with a 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.159
 consistency as if it were ice cream and 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.710
 it's pretty busy so 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.359
 swim and they try it obviously you do not 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.240
 they are interested in doing that was sent to the 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.759
 banana in the same shake without status 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.200
 natural fiber so creamy nothing 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.470
 appears recently share this form 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.420
 do it the part can speak cut it 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.970
 so they put it in the freezer before it says 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.620
 gym and nothing when good are already 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.209
 many list comparisons so 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.209
 I'm pretty practical 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.970
 I have to give two cubes so that it 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.520
 we close 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.990
 and we send the Frisian good people and 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.960
 now I go to the freezer to search 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.540
 the bananas that I previously left cyan 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.310
 I had the gym check out they're 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.200
 completely frozen so this is the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.700
 idea to be able to get this 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.940
 creamy consistency that told them 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.110
 when we put elda in the blender 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.570
 as we want to apologize 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.430
 and I'm going a bit fast in the video but 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.010
 I finish in the gym if I'm 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.450
 dying of hunger so let's put 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:59.870
 the leg with this shake I need it 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.870
 well now that we have the second step 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.989
 take them out and putting a came out of the 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.989
 marijuana 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.989
 Y 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.620
 in a door but the video 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.420
 the more we write it, the more 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.420
 consistency when 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:31.219
 well the second step let's see and 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.219
 We are going to use 250 milliliters of milk 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.330
 we do not throw 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.470
 and now if dad 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.060
 and we mix 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.420
 Y 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.590
 Y 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.069
 but if it were 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:41.699
 the second step is to reopen almost 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.699
 all 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.430
 we already saw 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.570
 for him 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:16.800
 once and that if now the last step 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:21.409
 would be with the weight cattle foam or 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.409
 protein according to you want 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.650
 if they use chocolate like I'm doing 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.699
 imagine that you will have a taste 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.699
 as a colleague 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:42.760
 we have the scoop again 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.979
 good people who wanted to show you a 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.900
 little how was very rich smell the 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:14.009
 consistency is also good if a 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.680
 you will get to be a bit 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.629
 of banana or some dried fruit without 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.099
 grind well what they can do is 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.650
 push a little with a fork a 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:24.569
 knife to the bottom then when 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.449
 go back to beat the propellers hit you yes 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:28.409
 and in that way writing but good 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.650
 now I'm going to serve 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:33.860
 I'm very hungry and well I'm going 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.860
 to count 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.080
 all right 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.190
 oracle is very rich good consistency 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.740
 that's how I as a kind of 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:05.590
 ice cream and although this one is not so hard 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.009
 but it 's about right now that the 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.680
 delicious 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:12.139
 and I tell them to approve the successor 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.460
 chocolate is going to stay like that 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:17.990
 outside mantecol and nothing that can be another 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.059
 I also like yes but I recommend it 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.279
 the chocolate so good people this 

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:23.930
 was the tutorial on how to make a 

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:25.879
 batterer aunts I hope that I have 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.419
 liked but see it and we're going to 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:28.419
 next video
