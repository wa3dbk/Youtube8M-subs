00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
be on a lot of times in the small center

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.420 
be on a lot of times in the small center
area<00:03:01.140> here<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:03.540> you've<00:03:03.660> got<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.840> chop<00:03:04.049> off<00:03:04.430> the

area here so you've got to chop off the
outsides<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.000> then<00:03:06.150> chop<00:03:06.390> in<00:03:06.569> in<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.750> middle

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
outsides and then chop in in the middle

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.360 
outsides and then chop in in the middle
to<00:03:07.230> get<00:03:07.590> your<00:03:08.540> moisturize<00:03:09.540> would<00:03:10.220> during<00:03:11.220> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
let's just jump off first off small kind

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.960 
let's just jump off first off small kind
of<00:03:22.590> section<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.190> will<00:03:23.519> take<00:03:23.700> small

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
of section of that will take small

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.500
