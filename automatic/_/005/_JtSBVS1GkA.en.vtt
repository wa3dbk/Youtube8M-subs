the band's more progressive edge was

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.330 
the band's more progressive edge was
executed<00:02:29.760> much<00:02:30.510> more<00:02:30.750> tastefully<00:02:31.379> on<00:02:31.590> their

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
past few albums quite literally a lot of

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
past few albums quite literally a lot of
tracks<00:02:35.160> on<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:35.519> LP<00:02:35.700> are<00:02:36.030> just<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.390> barrage<00:02:36.870> of

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
tracks on this LP are just a barrage of

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.240 
tracks on this LP are just a barrage of
ideas<00:02:38.910> just<00:02:39.599> being<00:02:39.870> thrown<00:02:40.260> one<00:02:40.620> after<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
ideas just being thrown one after the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.860 
ideas just being thrown one after the
other<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.489> quickly<00:02:42.060> it's<00:02:42.180> hard<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.450> keep<00:02:42.569> track

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
other so quickly it's hard to keep track

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.839 
other so quickly it's hard to keep track
of<00:02:43.019> them<00:02:43.170> however<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:44.190> lot<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.430> these<00:02:44.610> ideas

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
of them however a lot of these ideas

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.020 
of them however a lot of these ideas
whether<00:02:45.750> they're<00:02:46.019> riffs<00:02:46.769> or<00:02:47.130> drum<00:02:47.640> beats<00:02:47.819> are

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
whether they're riffs or drum beats are

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.330 
whether they're riffs or drum beats are
so<00:02:48.269> similar<00:02:48.599> in<00:02:48.930> scope<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.590> kind<00:02:50.099> of<00:02:50.160> feels

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
so similar in scope it kind of feels

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.500 
so similar in scope it kind of feels
like<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.549> track<00:02:50.880> isn't<00:02:51.090> even<00:02:51.360> really

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
like the track isn't even really

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.259 
like the track isn't even really
progressing<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.319> think<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:53.370> biggest<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
first violator of this is the track

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
throughout this track the band kind of

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.349 
throughout this track the band kind of
distracts<00:03:46.560> from<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:47.609> fact<00:03:47.849> that<00:03:47.940> there's<00:03:48.209> not

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
distracts from the fact that there's not

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409 
expect in a metal record despite the

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:54.869 
expect in a metal record despite the
fact<00:05:53.620> that<00:05:53.710> there<00:05:53.889> is<00:05:53.979> stuff<00:05:54.159> on<00:05:54.339> this<00:05:54.520> half<00:05:54.789> of

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:54.879 
fact that there is stuff on this half of

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.110 
fact that there is stuff on this half of
the<00:05:54.969> record<00:05:55.240> like<00:05:55.449> a<00:05:55.719> 12<00:05:56.379> bar<00:05:56.680> blues<00:05:56.819> solo<00:05:57.819> and

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
the record like a 12 bar blues solo and

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.589 
the record like a 12 bar blues solo and
a<00:05:58.629> flute<00:05:58.990> solo<00:05:59.349> I<00:05:59.860> do<00:06:00.190> think<00:06:00.759> that<00:06:01.000> these<00:06:01.300> songs

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
a flute solo I do think that these songs

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:03.629 
a flute solo I do think that these songs
rely<00:06:02.050> a<00:06:02.080> little<00:06:02.469> bit<00:06:02.710> more<00:06:02.919> on<00:06:03.129> the<00:06:03.250> merits<00:06:03.550> of

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 
rely a little bit more on the merits of

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:05.820 
rely a little bit more on the merits of
their<00:06:03.789> songwriting<00:06:04.389> as<00:06:04.659> opposed<00:06:05.289> to<00:06:05.440> just<00:06:05.710> the

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
their songwriting as opposed to just the

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.519 
their songwriting as opposed to just the
the<00:06:06.159> barrage<00:06:06.490> and<00:06:06.789> detour<00:06:07.300> tactic<00:06:07.960> that<00:06:08.409> the

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:08.529 
the barrage and detour tactic that the

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:09.809 
the barrage and detour tactic that the
band<00:06:08.680> has<00:06:08.800> been<00:06:08.830> using<00:06:09.159> up<00:06:09.400> until<00:06:09.490> this<00:06:09.729> point

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819 
band has been using up until this point

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:11.399 
band has been using up until this point
and<00:06:10.240> while<00:06:10.449> I<00:06:10.479> am<00:06:10.750> catching<00:06:11.259> more

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:11.409 
and while I am catching more

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:14.129 
and while I am catching more
memorability<00:06:12.009> in<00:06:12.279> fluidity<00:06:12.759> with<00:06:13.509> the<00:06:13.930> latter

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
memorability in fluidity with the latter

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.430 
memorability in fluidity with the latter
half<00:06:14.409> of<00:06:14.589> this<00:06:14.740> LP<00:06:15.159> still<00:06:16.089> I<00:06:16.360> mean<00:06:16.629> the<00:06:17.199> lack<00:06:17.409> of

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
half of this LP still I mean the lack of

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.769 
half of this LP still I mean the lack of
variation<00:06:18.099> with<00:06:18.219> the<00:06:18.310> screen<00:06:18.639> vocals<00:06:19.210> the

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:19.779 
variation with the screen vocals the

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.869 
variation with the screen vocals the
cleans<00:06:20.319> that<00:06:20.889> are<00:06:21.009> not<00:06:21.190> really<00:06:21.430> sitting<00:06:21.789> with

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:21.879 
cleans that are not really sitting with

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:23.760 
cleans that are not really sitting with
me<00:06:22.180> all<00:06:22.330> too<00:06:22.569> well<00:06:22.750> plus<00:06:23.169> the<00:06:23.349> fact<00:06:23.560> that<00:06:23.680> the

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
me all too well plus the fact that the

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.980 
me all too well plus the fact that the
band's<00:06:24.009> very<00:06:24.279> monotonous<00:06:24.729> and<00:06:25.210> technical

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
band's very monotonous and technical

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.589 
band's very monotonous and technical

Rivage combined with the production here

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:30.930 
Rivage combined with the production here
has<00:06:29.050> made<00:06:29.709> a<00:06:30.009> series<00:06:30.459> of<00:06:30.490> metal

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
has made a series of metal

gets more and more tiring which is weird
because<00:06:41.020> it's<00:06:41.260> like<00:06:41.320> only<00:06:41.680> an<00:06:41.800> hour<00:06:42.100> you<00:06:42.580> know

for me personally it's not really a

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.370 
for me personally it's not really a
lengthy<00:06:45.220> piece<00:06:45.940> of<00:06:46.180> music<00:06:46.690> you<00:06:46.900> know<00:06:47.140> I<00:06:47.170> just

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400

just<00:07:01.030> kind<00:07:01.330> of<00:07:01.800> flabbergasted<00:07:02.800> at<00:07:02.950> how<00:07:03.250> a<00:07:03.280> band

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
just kind of flabbergasted at how a band

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.790 
just kind of flabbergasted at how a band
can<00:07:03.820> just<00:07:04.000> basically<00:07:04.180> make<00:07:05.050> an<00:07:05.170> album<00:07:05.500> that<00:07:05.530> is

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
can just basically make an album that is

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.060 
can just basically make an album that is
so<00:07:06.040> dense<00:07:06.520> with<00:07:07.360> musical<00:07:07.870> ideas<00:07:08.320> and<00:07:08.590> phrases

so dense with musical ideas and phrases
and<00:07:09.250> riffs<00:07:09.730> and<00:07:09.910> melodies<00:07:10.000> but<00:07:10.870> not<00:07:11.200> one<00:07:11.680> of

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:11.830 
and riffs and melodies but not one of

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.620 
and riffs and melodies but not one of
them<00:07:11.980> comes<00:07:12.580> off<00:07:12.820> as<00:07:13.030> like<00:07:13.210> feeling

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:13.630 
them comes off as like feeling

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.380
