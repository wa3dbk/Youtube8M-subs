the<00:01:38.759> year<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.229> goalkeepers<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the year and the goalkeepers in the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.730 
the year and the goalkeepers in the
defenders<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.689> you<00:01:42.689> know<00:01:42.810> good<00:01:43.079> open<00:01:43.350> pack<00:01:43.560> so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
so i think there's a limit of one with

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.899 
so i think there's a limit of one with
these<00:01:49.229> 15<00:01:49.619> k's<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.220> there's<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.430> limited<00:01:50.700> term

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
these 15 k's and there's a limited term

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.260 
these 15 k's and there's a limited term
under<00:01:51.060> 25k<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:52.079> we<00:01:52.860> could<00:01:53.009> open<00:01:53.369> them<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.610> hope
