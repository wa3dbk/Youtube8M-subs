00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.530 
so on and people hold them at higher
levels<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.340> high<00:02:02.700> expectations<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> think

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
levels and high expectations so I think

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.300 
levels and high expectations so I think
they<00:02:03.750> need<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.930> already<00:02:04.320> start<00:02:04.590> reflecting<00:02:04.979> on

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
they need to already start reflecting on

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.310 
they need to already start reflecting on
those<00:02:05.430> things<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.759> their<00:02:05.880> own<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.540> tell<00:02:07.200> them

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
those things on their own we tell them

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.229 
those things on their own we tell them
about<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.829> orientation<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.700> freshman<00:02:09.060> year

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
about that orientation of freshman year

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.960 
about that orientation of freshman year
they<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.709> if<00:02:10.890> you're<00:02:11.099> on<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.340> pre-med<00:02:11.790> track

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
they that if you're on the pre-med track

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.850 
they that if you're on the pre-med track
you<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.540> selected<00:02:12.810> yourself

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
you have selected yourself

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.360 
you have selected yourself
to<00:02:14.100> be<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.580> pre<00:02:15.060> profession<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:17.190> are<00:02:17.340> a

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
to be a pre profession and you are a

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.370 
to be a pre profession and you are a
tribe<00:02:17.670> apart<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.210> you<00:02:18.540> are<00:02:18.630> not<00:02:18.780> held<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
tribe apart and you are not held to the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.080 
tribe apart and you are not held to the
same<00:02:19.560> standards<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.370> general<00:02:20.700> society

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
same standards of the general society

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.090 
same standards of the general society
you're<00:02:21.210> held<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.600> higher<00:02:21.810> standard<00:02:21.840> s<00:02:22.440> and

you're held to a higher standard s and

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.190 
you're held to a higher standard s and
so<00:02:23.280> start<00:02:23.580> behaving<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.690> is<00:02:24.840> somewhat

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
so start behaving it this is somewhat

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.870 
so start behaving it this is somewhat
related<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.280> think<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.760> good

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
related to the so I think it's a good

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.880 
related to the so I think it's a good
time<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.090> mention<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:28.080> know<00:02:28.200> on<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.770> am

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
time to mention it you know on the am

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.950 
time to mention it you know on the am
cast<00:02:29.220> application<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:29.970> list<00:02:30.270> up<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.420> 15

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
that area and they find out your answers

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.660 
that area and they find out your answers
are<00:03:05.880> rather<00:03:06.300> shallow<00:03:07.220> that<00:03:08.220> can<00:03:08.400> reflect

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
are rather shallow that can reflect

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.760 
are rather shallow that can reflect
negatively<00:03:08.910> on<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:10.020> know<00:03:10.140> so<00:03:10.320> some

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
negatively on you you know so some

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.990 
negatively on you you know so some
people<00:03:11.070> do<00:03:11.220> have<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.400> time<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.760> do<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.910> little

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
people do have a time to do a little

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.930 
people do have a time to do a little

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
you know my looking up sessions we give

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.550 
you know my looking up sessions we give
them<00:03:17.130> their<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:18.090> names<00:03:18.360> several<00:03:19.230> days<00:03:19.380> in

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
them their the names several days in

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.470 
them their the names several days in
advance<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.130> their<00:03:20.280> interview<00:03:20.790> we<00:03:21.180> give<00:03:21.330> the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
applications several days in advance so

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.560 
applications several days in advance so
they<00:03:25.500> actually<00:03:25.830> can<00:03:26.190> do<00:03:26.730> some<00:03:26.940> research<00:03:27.120> about

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
they actually can do some research about

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.180 
they actually can do some research about
who<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.560> they're<00:03:28.830> about<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.910> interview
