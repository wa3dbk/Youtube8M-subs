00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:14.112
 Welcome to Nespresso Assistance Video with water hardness setting instructions for Lattissima Pro Coffee Maker. 

00:00:15.138 --> 00:00:21.771
 To optimize the descaling intervals and the proper functioning of your coffee machine, which ensures quality coffee in the cup, 

00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:26.100
 we recommend setting your water hardness on your coffee machine. 

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:31.823
 Depending on your capsule consumption and water hardness you've set, 

00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:37.422
 then the coffee maker displays a descaling message on the display. 

00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:43.791
 First enter the Menu by pressing the gear button 

00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:47.248
 Select «WATER HARDNESS». 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.966
 You will be guided through the entire programming process. 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.616
 Simply follow the instructions on the coffee machine display. 

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:59.664
 Immerse the water test strip supplied with the coffee machine in water for 1 second. 

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:04.128
 The number of red fields indicates the degree of water hardness. 

00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:08.021
 The result may range from 0 to 4 red fields: 

00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:12.216
 0 red fields mean degree 1, very soft water 

00:01:12.527 --> 00:01:17.049
 4 red fields mean level 5, very hard water 

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:20.942
 Set the appropriate value 

00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:27.386
 and confirm. 

00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:31.480
 A short text on the display indicates that a new value has been saved. 

00:01:32.093 --> 00:01:35.138
 Confirm the message to exit the "WATER HARDNESS" option. 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.582
 To exit the Menu, press and hold the gear button for 2 seconds. 

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:45.878
 The Lattissima Pro coffee machine is now ready. 

00:01:47.195 --> 00:01:50.476

00:01:50.585 --> 00:01:55.074
