00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.920
 the thermometer steadily keeps on 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.110
 30 degrees someone is saved in the waters 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.900
 Well, poor motorists have to 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.180
 be many kilometers of traffic jams form 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.590
 cabin temperature rises to 50 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.269
 degrees Novosibirsk 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.060
 many entrepreneurs immediately appeared 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.740
 who fill the air conditioners 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.590
 right on the side of the road some 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.810
 charge air conditioners 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.510
 by their methods simply by 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.059
 rule drove and this service will cost 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.700
 so let's say a little money in 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.220
 garages 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.290
 a little more expensive but naturally we 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.180
 make sure you need to go to the car wash 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.190
 anyways because what happens is very 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.710
 many important procedures that we 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.560
 we carry out diagnostics 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.900
 several operations are required first stage 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.850
 diagnose remove remaining system 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.470
 hladogen ie 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.290
 specially equipped which 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.210
 determined by how much we download 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.940
 refrigerant from the air conditioning system 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.869
 and again it is determined by how much we 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.130
 have to fill there with the second stage 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.930
 this whole process appears 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.420
 vacuuming system 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.600
 It also happens with the help of the apparatus 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.360
 which must be carried out unequivocally 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.970
 because we have to really 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.509
 make sure that the system is normal that there is no 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.000
 no evacuation leaks we can 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.420
 detect leaks in the system 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.720
 conditioning so as 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.610
 damaged damaged tubing 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.490
 also cuffs that can pass 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.530
 through the refrigerant if systems 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.530
 air conditioning enjoy long 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.350
 time there appears very not and particles 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.350
 molecules that will destroy the system 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.659
 conditioning and will lead this 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.880
 breakdowns of the compressor itself we need 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.429
 it will be necessary to change the filter 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.649
 dehumidifier we definitely need to change 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.899
 there will be a condenser itself 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.060
 will need to flush the system 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.440
 air conditioning to continue to use 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.239
 ok i heard that in the system 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.100
 air conditioners and accumulate various 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.470
 pathogenic bacteria that are bad 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.090
 affect our well-being in a group 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.280
 risk also turn out to be our children 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.810
 which is still a weak immune system and 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.390
 they are most exposed 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.010
 and the beneficial effects of whether we 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.900
 always advise while refueling 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.329
 air conditioner and use it 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.680
 carry out several more procedures for 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.980
 order to disinfect 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.310
 protect yourself is 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.530
 we have disinfection applied to 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.989
 the vaporizer itself that kills itself 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.120
 bacteria and germs pathogenic 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.220
 so we are always under after refueling 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.849
 air conditioners recommend doing such 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.069
 procedures 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.140
 to preserve your health you need though 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.069
 once a year disinfection system case 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.830
 conditioning 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.830
 take care but good luck on the roads yet
