 are just the products I have 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.509
 just really used every day if 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.889
 I then stop but so yes without 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.179
 I just can not do that if 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.440
 I want to take care of my skin and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.600
 I feel that you are simply the best 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.609
 Products from the drugstore and the wanted 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.320
 I'll show you today if you mean mine 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.820
 top 5 make up products from the drugstore 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.170
 interest then switch quietly 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.240
 Saturday one I would video 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.490
 Upload and as I show you my 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.289
 top 5 make-up drugstore products but 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.289
 Now I wish you much fun at 1 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.680
 Munich 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.850
 I once have a cream that is 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.830
 von kickin probably knows 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.570
 everyone i find the world of the 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.390
 Packaging has always been totally 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.580
 on a drugstore the ritz the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.640
 Cream office service and I love these 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.460
 Cream, especially now in spring 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.260
 and when the summer comes on it for 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.640
 me the perfect cream also from the smell 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.490
 I think she just smells like that 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.230
 very good and it's just that 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.520
 media conference than it ultimately 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.650
 really good on it too 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.600
 distribute and pulls really fast too 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.630
 which I of course very important 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.100
 At Krems she finds and takes care of the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.600
 So you do not need it 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.610
 First I talk but I think 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.890
 the smell is the decisive because 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.479
 this cream and also the packaging too 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.250
 with this boom up here so that 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.140
 I just think I'm perfect for one 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.510
 cream then it goes on with a 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.220
 I'll give you this product last time 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.290
 that was from nivea one 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.970
 fresh the facial water that is 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.590
 now for normal skin and looked at the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.630
 But there are also still in pink for 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.920
 dry skin and then you can 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.320
 depending on what already the captain 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.640
 has to choose and I just love 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.440
 that face water I had yes 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.090
 really many tested and somehow 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.560
 I do not have that right for me 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.970
 found and thought a human 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.290
 there are certainly better and now 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.180
 I have just this facial water 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.970
 found 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.440
 really getting it buy more is the 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.970
 go sometime it really is 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.710
 really really much better 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.650
 but with this face water I am 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.020
 Quite satisfied, I told you yes 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.630
 in the last or some video does 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.220
 that was not the last video before that 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.780
 that a tingle on the skin yet 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.730
 So it's really refreshing 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.430
 the skin on the skin really looks like it 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.590
 just cleaned a lot and dodges 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.540
 and most of all it removes it 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.910
 So the last remnants of makeup right 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.380
 good and so i really can 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.850
 recommend if you are still looking for a good one 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.700
 face water seeks the face water 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.770
 from me who here then a cream the 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.390
 probably everyone knows it too 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.670
 will just come to my favorite 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.230
 care product that us the merchant 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.750
 cream to skin and written children 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.640
 So that's actually for babies 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.650
 but they have such a great creamy too 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.180
 still a little on the go always and 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.950
 especially this cream is really right 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.489
 long I've just always only this corner 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.930
 and I really use them every night 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.220
 sometimes even for the face 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.630
 if i put it in the right place 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.790
 I have no face from it 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.350
 pimple I usually do that to me 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.390
 just on the lips and lips 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.160
 are the next day for some of them, or 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.959
 if I break properly, too 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.400
 Tear the dealer then I do 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.810
 me as a hand cream on easy 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.370
 the skin so you can the cream 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.430
 really use for anything that is 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.810
 really great and above all 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.070
 just right for dry house suitable 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.260
 You can tell that from the 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.350
 consistency this a bit thicker but not 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.200
 so much much to the pirates cream 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.330
 better to distribute and yes what natural 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.310
 not good is spotty one 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.690
 but if I stop this dry 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.340
 then you do not mind 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.180
 out of it then a little longer on the 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.980
 stay lips 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.599
 it does not have to move in immediately and 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.500
 especially flies the skin is right 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.750
 ingenious 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.849
 Then I have a face cream which I 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.560
 Can you really recommend this now 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.670
 Almost empty with me so only 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.959
 a little later I have them 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.859
 upset and I will get it back to me 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.079
 buy more 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.780
 that's the cream of garnier vital 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.430
 come up 8 is on it and that is 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.659
 just a really great cream so 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.750
 I always had to go to the 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.549
 go to sleep on the face and to 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.079
 I judge your own well then 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.030
 she also pulls very well on the skin 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.739
 and you even notice the next 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.139
 tomorrow something of the cream than you already have 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.090
 now moisture will be the closest 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.310
 Tomorrow the skin will be totally soft and 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.959
 So it really feels smooth 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.180
 Wonderful for me , this cream is effective 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.500
 overnight so i have the feeling you 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.269
 somehow tightens the skin like this 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.449
 So it's really funny 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.099
 What this cream can do but feel the skin 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.870
 Just super groomed afterwards 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:21.609
 and just use it properly right 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.190
 like and that is my favorite 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.520
 bedtime then still get as 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.070
 Finally, a dark circles cream is 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.300
 that of bmw july of students of 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.699
 eye care by the brand now bw moral 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.830
 and I just wanted that cream for you 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.990
 Count because I think they can somehow 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.880
 Really what I have a lot of creams on 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.979
 formal and so tested for the eyes 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.780
 and I have, for example, among the 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.190
 eyes a really sensitive skin 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.590
 So my skin is really fast 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.810
 dry and really eye under the 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.030
 and if I then eg. Council or so on 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.950
 then that's it for me then then 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.870
 you can see just as individual 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.120
 console tears from make up and so on 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.290
 and that looks really shitty when 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.050
 I may say so 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.240
 but the problem was also who 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.500
 other eyes krems with me if I the 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.370
 First of all they did not use it 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.530
 they have really brought me a lot 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.240
 moisturizes and then bursts 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.470
 totally burned under the eyes what 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.850
 of course, should not be 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.410
 if I have made it for myself to have 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.640
 that really totally burned and me 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.860
 I had the feeling I had to first 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.290
 wash it off again and it at this 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.580
 Chandler not at all so I know 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.410
 open to me and I feel that they 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.510
 really cares for the eyes so the skin 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.430
 under the eyes not the eyes and 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.950
 since then she also stops regularly 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.300
 used to go to sleep 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.770
 Since then it's just like that 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.240
 these concealer rest no longer 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.480
 So you see no questions ever 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.250
 more under the eyes and the skin is 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.140
 just not so irritated and everything 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.180
 as before and it has really hold 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.790
 my dark circles skin picture in the 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.290
 totally improved and what I am 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.270
 just think that's great 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.440
 somehow so shimmering particles in it and 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.940
 if you now on eyes makes 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.490
 immediately afterwards the eyes are fresher 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.290
 out so that really so in his 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.940
 agree with both hold so the effect 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.980
 Do not make them look so tired anymore 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.690
 or at least that looks like that and 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.100
 that's why it's definitely like that 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.350
 my savior for the eyes 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.460
 yes him that's already the country 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.560
