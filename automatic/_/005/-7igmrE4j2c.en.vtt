00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 m 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.740
 so we end up today to 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.169
 a video hall I decided to do 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.910
 several in quotation marks categories and 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.550
 all gathered in the same flight because 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.020
 that otherwise you will have had several and 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.880
 here I do not know how easy to do 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.080
 like that I 'm sorry for my hair that 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.460
 are still wet but it is doing too much 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.529
 hot so I'm going to always get wet 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.570
 the head and / or that's where I was 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.130
 decided in this hall to do my 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.780
 supplies back to school because I 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.360
 know that I'm not going to do a role that 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.370
 it y'en are in pole outright 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.260
 what pen I bought so suddenly 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.269
 here I was in the first part of that 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.879
 and then another part a little bit more 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.070
 random I have a little echo I 'm going 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.830
 have my own at no I'm going first 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.839
 start with the budget shoes that 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.699
 father's going to go fast first pair 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.140
 I had sales at h &amp; m for 12 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.960
 euros instead of I do not know how much 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.670
 these are heels like these they 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.030
 are in 37 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.409
 here is the heel is not very that's the 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.879
 heel is not very very high but it's 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.500
 and stiletto heels so I galley more 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.900
 to walk with bag with thought pros 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.189
 logical second father a little more classy 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.539
 and that may not please everyone 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.460
 world I emitted in pictures on 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.609
 instagram and there are many who have 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.969
 liked moreover the vein of the swan more 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:22.249
 luc traps him u for less than 30 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.590
 euros a simple and she looks like that 

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:26.390
 in fact I adore them they are like 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.880
 these always heel stil I try 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.200
 to change some of the compensated there are 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.100
 a little closure behind which you 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.109
 do not need to remove all 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.329
 laces there to set foot what is 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.770
 a very good thing and she's her sharp 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.030
 it's not my usual style at all 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.490
 but I do not know when I saw them 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.840
 I cracked I put it to you without 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.950
 helmsman must the links of all that I 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.200
 you presented that we can find 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.270
 again then I'll go to the 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.619
 back to school part so that I know 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.780
 there are some who are waiting for this video 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.060
 not that they love to see what I'm buying 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.439
 noises run so that's so this 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.110
 year I go to college which I still 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.790
 no idea how I'm going 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.680
 and all I will wait for it 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.210
 bought some little stuff but not 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.560
 a lot and do not worry about them 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.630
 go-anywhere school videos arrived week 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.310
 next but here I wanted to do 2000 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.740
 back to school to not rush 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.509
 in the fall and just like mom I 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.130
 I took a beautiful sister shine like 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.370
 these transparent and in fact it's 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.990
 simply to put the cards 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.330
 bristol like those who are white 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.130
 and not perforated because in fact I have 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.410
 tired of having my workbooks and saying but 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.360
 fish like that I prefer to read them as 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.340
 a book so basically I took myself 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.350
 the cards and bought me also a 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.430
 puncher like these from mapei 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.550
 so I'm going to do my own 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.110
 little holes is here and not here to for 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.020
 the first three articles and I have everything 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.820
 bought at leclerc if you ever 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.709
 then interested me I took 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.050
 criteria like these celik so 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.959
 it's the basic criterium but I 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.300
 prefer to write with bag with pencils 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.440
 paper and at least it avoids me the eraser 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.120
 and the pencil size of that are on it 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.440
 I then took the same what 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.560
 is on the last keyboard which is at 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.769
 say the 4 colors not far from at 10 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.810
 and the rings jobs at apple but 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.400
 I listen with a lot with the colors 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.200
 you know that I deprived myself of a 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.890
 line at I have a hard time showing you with 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.690
 the light 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.030
 so there are all the colors in fact 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.320
 and it's pen- shaped pens of 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.959
 tokens it's a practice to put in 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.560
 a kit I am then taken a lot 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.820
 of fine felt like this here always 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.940
 that we close the son I like having 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.489
 colors and the little box and 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.400
 portable and then always post 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.019
 it you do not see anything at all I 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.150
 then changed holes on then 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.590
 find one at ema for 3 euros he me 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.600
 seems like it's pretty small so 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.510
 like that I can take him 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.690
 all the time and she's Belgian 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.860
 with darker closing I love him 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.310
 a lot that I would not have bought by 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.720
 logic 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.150
 it's very simple and that's what I 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.980
 were looking for it and finally I caught myself 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.720
 a notebook I think I'm going to take 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.580
 the first day since I have no idea 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.050
 what to take so that's enough 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.270
 comes from home hema jellies for two 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.550
 fifty euros so inside you 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.200
 do not see too much but he is lineage and 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.470
 not with tiles and in fact there are some 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.550
 time dividers they are 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.870
 movable so here I do not know in 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.680
 did I just wanted a notebook all 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.030
 simple to go first day of mourning 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.140
 for my haircut too but 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.830
 when it's too hot like that I have 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.290
 then too lazy to do my hair for 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.620
 sechin formerly at inside machin 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.140
 thingy 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.880
 I received two dresses so the first and 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.380
 like this so a beige color 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.540
 quite done 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.130
 and like this so no sleeves are 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.980
 there and you have the shoulders of the myths 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.210
 holidays were short and sudden 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.980
 I just think of putting it on top of 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.920
 jersey of another like that because 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.070
 if not, we will have all and second 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.600
 dress from China is a blue dress 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.710
 marine that I found canonge already 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.630
 worn here she has braces all 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.840
 fine is behind you see a little 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.680
 go cross and so she is all blue 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.730
 is long 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.620
 here are longer than I have 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.200
 used to wear and she is super 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.460
 super rebel class and that's it I was 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.830
 pretty surprised the quality when I have them 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.090
 received then level fran this hall is 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.420
 anything that goes in all 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.340
 meaning 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.040
 I just took two tops that are 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.570
 exactly the same at h &amp; m so here is 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.280
 they are like these here you see no 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.620
 at all the right color it is really 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.360
 Bordeaux and here we were tops all 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.750
 simple so the prices in Bordeaux and I 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.120
 pray them laugh again is simple 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.520
 it costs only 4 euros 95 and are really 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.100
 a material that is too pleasant and 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.470
 the summer well here it is tom I love it 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.880
 then I found myself on amazon 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.920
 this enclosure that you saw in my 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.340
 last video 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.600
 unfortunately I believe she is 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.830
 no longer available I try to you 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.600
 find a link but basically she 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.120
 was sold at 10 euros instead of 70 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.590
 and honestly she walks but hyper 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.870
 I'm really happy with 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.810
 then bought it from a site 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.880
 noah I do not know which one I received 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.150
 you already know something like that 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.850
 and in fact it's a fisheye lens 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.690
 for the iphone so we want to think like 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.010
 that on your phone 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.650
 it works especially I was women in 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.690
 party and you see in card at and lo and 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.790
 it's a little gadget but I wanted 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.190
 to try and it works great 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.110
 I love to take pictures with and here 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.790
 I'm really happy to have found 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.620
 especially since it costs up to date 3 dollars 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.990
 I believe and you have the little pouch 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.690
 to put it in 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:18.420
 then from ema for 5 euros each 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.190
 I had little boxes like this 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.460
 so they are hermetic and I 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.110
 cannon canon cannon I do not know 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.630
 still what I put in but they 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.600
 are hyper hyper from her then from home 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.920
 ikea i got these three little 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.490
 cactus for 5 euros 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:38.430
 I saw that you buzz had bought them 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.890
 I do not know who and here I find them 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.090
 so cute I buy everything in case 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.470
 for my apartment but I'm not going to everything 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.790
 show you because clearly I 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:49.110
 think you do not care about the wooden spoon 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:52.380
 or marble his fiat and at h &amp; m for 3 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.460
 euros the three stuff instead of 15 so 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.680
 I'm happy I made the pair of 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.140
 phew I took two candlesticks like this 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.480
 so at 1 euros each and I caught myself 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.240
 a basket like that for 15 euros 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.370
 when you listen for a euro instead 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.480
 of fifteen so the conti this game it's 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.340
 more favorable because in all the time
