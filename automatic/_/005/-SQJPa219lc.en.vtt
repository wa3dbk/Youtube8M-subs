laser<00:03:39.370> fanned<00:03:39.700> as<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:40.150> all<00:03:40.300> may<00:03:40.510> know

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
laser fanned as you all may know

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.729 
laser fanned as you all may know
typically<00:03:42.100> when<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.519> have<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.730> regular<00:03:43.180> gun<00:03:43.739> I

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
typically when you have a regular gun I

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.830 
typically when you have a regular gun I
see<00:03:45.730> I<00:03:45.790> don't<00:03:45.880> even<00:03:46.120> have<00:03:46.269> one<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.600> show<00:03:46.780> you

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
see I don't even have one to show you

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.160 
see I don't even have one to show you
but<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.709> lot<00:03:47.890> of<00:03:47.920> times<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.610> can<00:03:48.640> I<00:03:49.239> put<00:03:50.049> the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
but a lot of times you can I put the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.780 
but a lot of times you can I put the
screw<00:03:50.380> right<00:03:50.530> inside<00:03:50.860> this<00:03:51.010> area<00:03:51.430> here

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
screw right inside this area here

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.530 
screw right inside this area here
obviously<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.959> laser<00:03:53.200> bumps<00:03:54.040> it<00:03:54.220> out<00:03:54.390> so<00:03:55.390> much

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
obviously the laser bumps it out so much

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.840 
obviously the laser bumps it out so much
that<00:03:55.600> when<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:55.989> cut<00:03:56.320> this<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.890> have<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.610> leave<00:03:57.790> a

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
that when I cut this I have to leave a

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.479 
that when I cut this I have to leave a
little<00:03:58.030> bit<00:03:58.180> of<00:03:58.239> a<00:03:58.360> bump<00:03:58.600> out<00:03:58.780> for<00:03:59.350> material<00:04:00.130> so

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
little bit of a bump out for material so

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.729 
little bit of a bump out for material so
i<00:04:00.519> can<00:04:00.820> actually<00:04:01.180> put<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.840> retention<00:04:02.230> screw<00:04:02.590> and

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
i can actually put a retention screw and

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.630 
i can actually put a retention screw and
that's<00:04:02.860> very<00:04:03.549> minimal<00:04:04.299> as<00:04:05.049> far<00:04:05.380> as<00:04:05.590> kydex<00:04:06.580> i

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
that's very minimal as far as kydex i

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.400 
that's very minimal as far as kydex i
