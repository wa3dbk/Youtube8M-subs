seven nine which is unbelievable

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.840 
seven nine which is unbelievable
knowing<00:01:27.930> IPL<00:01:28.380> runs<00:01:28.710> knowing<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.579> was<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
knowing IPL runs knowing that I was the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.789 
knowing IPL runs knowing that I was the
highest<00:01:30.000> score<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.810> nine<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.320> his<00:01:31.470> batting

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
highest score and nine is his batting

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.440 
highest score and nine is his batting
average<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.280> guess<00:01:32.490> he's<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> number<00:01:33.090> 10<00:01:33.299> or

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
average so I guess he's a number 10 or

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.550 
average so I guess he's a number 10 or
11<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.710> back<00:01:35.040> there<00:01:35.310> he<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.460> 5<00:01:35.880> star<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:37.380> that's

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
11 in back there he is 5 star so that's

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.270 
11 in back there he is 5 star so that's
a<00:01:37.650> superb<00:01:38.250> start<00:01:39.650> then<00:01:40.650> let's<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.009> look<00:01:41.159> at
