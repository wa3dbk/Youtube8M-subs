00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.319 
apprehensive offices the whole day but
the<00:03:06.109> dam<00:03:06.319> didn't<00:03:06.650> have<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:06.859> same<00:03:07.329> passion

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
that I had Brian giant waves what's it

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:12.449 
that I had Brian giant waves what's it
sound<00:03:11.870> like

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
sound like

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.080 
sound like
sound<00:03:13.780> it's<00:03:14.780> funny<00:03:15.049> at<00:03:16.040> 30<00:03:16.280> miles<00:03:16.489> an<00:03:16.579> hour<00:03:16.700> an

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
sound it's funny at 30 miles an hour an

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.650 
sound it's funny at 30 miles an hour an
open<00:03:17.450> car<00:03:17.659> you<00:03:17.930> can<00:03:18.049> realize

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
open car you can realize

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.020 
open car you can realize
when<00:03:18.750> there<00:03:18.960> is<00:03:19.160> now<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.220> add<00:03:20.490> the<00:03:20.670> speed<00:03:20.910> of

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
when there is now you add the speed of

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.910 
when there is now you add the speed of
the<00:03:21.090> wave<00:03:21.240> and<00:03:21.480> then<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.720> wind<00:03:22.470> coming<00:03:22.710> up<00:03:22.830> the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
the wave and then the wind coming up the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.010 
the wave and then the wind coming up the
face<00:03:23.240> because<00:03:24.240> it<00:03:24.360> probably<00:03:24.630> trade<00:03:24.810> winds

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
face because it probably trade winds

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.170 
face because it probably trade winds
probably<00:03:25.170> offshore<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.790> probably<00:03:27.030> have<00:03:27.150> a

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
probably offshore so you probably have a

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.640 
probably offshore so you probably have a
70<00:03:27.600> mile<00:03:27.750> an<00:03:27.780> hour<00:03:27.870> wind<00:03:28.170> probably<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.560> very

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
70 mile an hour wind probably the very

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.870 
70 mile an hour wind probably the very
crest<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.190> way<00:03:29.280> sometimes

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
crest of the way sometimes

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.350 
crest of the way sometimes
definitely<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.450> 40<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.810> 50<00:03:31.050> mile<00:03:31.200> wind<00:03:32.090> so<00:03:33.090> the

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
definitely a 40 to 50 mile wind so the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.570 
definitely a 40 to 50 mile wind so the
wind<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.230> always<00:03:34.350> constant<00:03:35.100> they've<00:03:35.280> always<00:03:35.460> a

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
wind is always constant they've always a

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.580 
wind is always constant they've always a
roller<00:03:35.880> from<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.150> wind<00:03:36.360> they<00:03:37.170> do<00:03:37.230> have<00:03:37.470> the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
roller from the wind they do have the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.370 
roller from the wind they do have the
Thunder<00:03:38.070> of<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:40.190> shaking<00:03:41.190> of<00:03:42.140> shock<00:03:43.140> waves
