this regulatory mechanism of proteins

this regulatory mechanism of proteins
which<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.380> protein<00:01:17.040> phosphorylation<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
which is protein phosphorylation and

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.719 
which is protein phosphorylation and

two morrow's phosphorylation and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.819 
two morrow's phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation<00:01:27.360> plays<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> crucial<00:01:28.530> role

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
dephosphorylation plays a crucial role

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.190 
dephosphorylation plays a crucial role
in<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.430> cell<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.390> linked<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.930> cell

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
in the cell and it's linked to cell

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.130 
in the cell and it's linked to cell
growth<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.159> if<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> communication

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140

phosphorylation is like a molecular

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.080 
phosphorylation is like a molecular
switch<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:44.040> phosphorylation<00:01:44.670> or<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
protein may activate it and then

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.649 
protein may activate it and then
dephosphorylation<00:01:50.070> or<00:01:50.820> removal<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.450> this

then they are diagnosed as leopard
patients<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:38.989> are<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.590> interesting<00:03:39.950> thing

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
patients and are the interesting thing

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.640 
patients and are the interesting thing
is<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.280> both<00:03:41.060> Noonan<00:03:41.660> patients<00:03:42.139> and<00:03:42.290> leopard

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
is that both Noonan patients and leopard

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.500 
is that both Noonan patients and leopard
patients<00:03:43.130> have<00:03:43.310> mutations<00:03:43.940> in<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.239> same

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
patients have mutations in the same

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.550 
patients have mutations in the same
enzyme<00:03:45.340> shp2<00:03:46.569> but<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:47.720> nooner<00:03:48.049> patients<00:03:48.440> have

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
enzyme shp2 but the nooner patients have

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.440 
enzyme shp2 but the nooner patients have
an<00:03:48.680> activating<00:03:49.310> mutation<00:03:49.819> and<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.299> leopard

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
an activating mutation and the leopard

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.390 
an activating mutation and the leopard
patients<00:03:50.959> have<00:03:51.049> an<00:03:51.169> inactivating<00:03:51.950> mutation

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
patients have an inactivating mutation

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.270 
patients have an inactivating mutation
so<00:03:52.970> this<00:03:53.120> is<00:03:53.239> quite<00:03:53.389> interesting<00:03:53.690> that

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
so this is quite interesting that

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.949 
so this is quite interesting that
mutations<00:03:55.280> in<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.519> same<00:03:55.760> gene<00:03:56.060> 1<00:03:56.389> activating

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959
