this<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:00.900> probable<00:00:01.350> one<00:00:01.380> 7:01<00:00:02.250> with<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.550> review

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
this is probable one 7:01 with a review

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.010 
this is probable one 7:01 with a review
of<00:00:03.030> my<00:00:03.360> phantom<00:00:04.020> staff<00:00:04.910> it's<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.120> stunt<00:00:06.660> staff

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
of my phantom staff it's a stunt staff

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.020 
of my phantom staff it's a stunt staff
actually<00:00:07.560> it's<00:00:07.919> really<00:00:08.130> just<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.460> Dominic's

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
actually it's really just to Dominic's

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.209 
actually it's really just to Dominic's
but<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.050> can<00:00:10.170> order<00:00:10.440> them<00:00:10.559> as<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> staff<00:00:11.070> and

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
but you can order them as a staff and

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.690 
but you can order them as a staff and
it's<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.429> little<00:00:11.639> cheaper<00:00:12.030> now<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.700> I'd

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
it's a little cheaper now this is a I'd

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.730 
it's a little cheaper now this is a I'd
gotten<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.210> stunt<00:00:15.570> saber<00:00:15.870> as<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> prize<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.590> one

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
gotten a stunt saber as a prize and one

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.439 
gotten a stunt saber as a prize and one
of<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.890> raffles<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.550> liked<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:17.970> much

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
of the raffles and I liked it so much

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.450 
of the raffles and I liked it so much
because<00:00:18.930> usually<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.410> get<00:00:19.500> sound<00:00:19.859> sabers<00:00:20.310> if

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
because usually I get sound sabers if

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.099 
because usually I get sound sabers if
you<00:00:20.550> see<00:00:20.699> my<00:00:20.760> other<00:00:20.850> reviews<00:00:21.270> most<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.990> them

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
you see my other reviews most of them

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.750 
you see my other reviews most of them
are<00:00:22.199> silent<00:00:22.500> sabers<00:00:22.769> but<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.250> really<00:00:23.490> wanted<00:00:23.699> to

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
are silent sabers but I really wanted to

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.250 
are silent sabers but I really wanted to
do<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> staff<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.480> liked<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> idea<00:00:24.810> of

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
do the staff and I liked the idea of

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.769 
do the staff and I liked the idea of
being<00:00:26.039> able<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.430> get<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.699> as<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> stunt<00:00:27.510> saber

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
being able to get in as a stunt saber

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.960 
being able to get in as a stunt saber
it's<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.680> one<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> lot<00:00:29.189> cheaper<00:00:29.250> too

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
it's just one it's a lot cheaper too

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.179 
it's just one it's a lot cheaper too
I've<00:00:30.210> noticed<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.810> used<00:00:31.439> stunt<00:00:31.830> sabers

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
I've noticed I used stunt sabers

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.530 
I've noticed I used stunt sabers
differently<00:00:32.579> when<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.759> practice<00:00:33.210> like<00:00:33.420> when

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
differently when I practice like when

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.819 
differently when I practice like when
I'm<00:00:33.630> practicing<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.380> sounds<00:00:34.710> they

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
I'm practicing with the sounds they

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.479 
I'm practicing with the sounds they
wrote<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:36.110> tune<00:00:37.110> my<00:00:37.440> swings<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.100> practice

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
wrote in to tune my swings and practice

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.280 
wrote in to tune my swings and practice
form<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.360> sound<00:00:39.570> whereas<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.989> stunt

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
form in with the sound whereas a stunt

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.840 
form in with the sound whereas a stunt
saber<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.649> just<00:00:40.829> kind<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:40.980> get<00:00:41.129> lost<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
saber I just kind of get lost in the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.310 
saber I just kind of get lost in the
exercise<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> practice<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.050> wanted<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
exercise in the practice so I wanted to

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.860 
exercise in the practice so I wanted to
go<00:00:43.410> with<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.590> stunt<00:00:43.860> saber<00:00:44.100> they<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.360> really<00:00:45.750> do

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
go with a stunt saber they I really do

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.560 
go with a stunt saber they I really do
like<00:00:46.020> them<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.410> well<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.890> wanted<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.910> go<00:00:48.000> sit<00:00:48.300> for

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
like them as well I wanted to go sit for

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.029 
like them as well I wanted to go sit for
my<00:00:48.690> staff<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.920> got<00:00:50.219> them<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.460> blazing<00:00:50.969> read

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
my staff and I got them in blazing read

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.080 
my staff and I got them in blazing read
and<00:00:53.039> see<00:00:53.250> right<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> know<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.879> looks<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and see right here I know it looks a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.459 
and see right here I know it looks a
little<00:00:54.180> worn<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> camera

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
little worn just because the camera

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.979 
little worn just because the camera
tends<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.239> overexpose<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.270> light<00:00:57.719> because

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
tends to overexpose the light because

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.810 
tends to overexpose the light because
there's<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.320> there<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.829> write<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.640> over

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
there's it's there so write it over

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.029 
there's it's there so write it over
exposes<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.750> they're<00:01:00.930> actually<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.469> very<00:01:01.739> deep

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
exposes but they're actually a very deep

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.260 
exposes but they're actually a very deep
red<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:04.850> blazing<00:01:05.850> red<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
red I really like the blazing red in the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.600 
red I really like the blazing red in the
mid<00:01:06.420> grade<00:01:06.659> as<00:01:06.900> opposed<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.560> Holt<00:01:07.710> reg<00:01:07.950> so

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
mid grade as opposed to the Holt reg so

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.050 
mid grade as opposed to the Holt reg so
I<00:01:08.640> wanted<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.909> mid<00:01:09.030> grade<00:01:09.210> blades<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.750> them

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
I wanted the mid grade blades for them

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.600 
I wanted the mid grade blades for them
you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.150> see<00:01:12.270> right<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.689> got<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
you can see right here I got the

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.740 
you can see right here I got the
standard<00:01:14.610> switch<00:01:14.909> most<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.330> mine<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.600> 80

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
standard switch most of mine have 80

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.109 
standard switch most of mine have 80
switches<00:01:16.229> but<00:01:16.380> stunt<00:01:16.740> sabers<00:01:17.100> don't<00:01:17.909> really

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
switches but stunt sabers don't really

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.240 
switches but stunt sabers don't really
offer<00:01:18.270> those<00:01:18.540> much<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.020> got<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.799> standard

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
offer those much so I got the standard

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.399 
offer those much so I got the standard
switch<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:20.810> policies<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.930> course<00:01:22.080> are<00:01:22.200> twin

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
switch here policies of course are twin

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.260 
switch here policies of course are twin
sabers<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.950> since<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.580> ordered<00:01:23.820> them<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
sabers and since I ordered them as a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.789 
sabers and since I ordered them as a
staff<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.750> even<00:01:25.110> tend<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.040> use<00:01:26.220> them<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> pair

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
staff I even tend to use them as a pair

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.590 
staff I even tend to use them as a pair
even<00:01:28.799> when<00:01:29.369> I'm<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.490> duel<00:01:29.850> wielding<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.390> tend

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
even when I'm just duel wielding I tend

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.940 
even when I'm just duel wielding I tend
to<00:01:30.630> use<00:01:30.840> them<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> pair<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.920> I

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
to use them as a pair I like that I

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.649 
to use them as a pair I like that I
don't<00:01:32.070> really<00:01:32.340> use<00:01:32.490> them<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> single<00:01:33.270> saver

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
don't really use them as a single saver

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.020 
don't really use them as a single saver
I<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.650> lot<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> times<00:01:35.220> I'll<00:01:35.520> use<00:01:35.549> my<00:01:35.880> other

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
I do a lot of times I'll use my other

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.670 
I do a lot of times I'll use my other
sabers<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.630> by<00:01:36.750> themselves<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.560> to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
sabers just by themselves but I like to

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.859 
sabers just by themselves but I like to
do<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> wheel<00:01:38.009> these<00:01:38.220> they're<00:01:38.490> really<00:01:38.670> fun<00:01:38.880> see

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
do a wheel these they're really fun see

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.830 
do a wheel these they're really fun see
if<00:01:39.930> we<00:01:40.079> oh<00:01:40.320> yes<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.220> coupler<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.820> got<00:01:42.720> this

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
if we oh yes the coupler I got this

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.690 
if we oh yes the coupler I got this
coupler<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.350> opposed<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> regular<00:01:44.250> couple

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
coupler as opposed to the regular couple

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.810 
coupler as opposed to the regular couple
the<00:01:44.939> regular<00:01:45.270> coupler<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.430> much<00:01:47.430> smaller

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
the regular coupler is a much smaller

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.490 
the regular coupler is a much smaller
it's<00:01:48.270> actually<00:01:48.689> when<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.899> thread<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.409> to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
it's actually when you thread it in to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.810 
it's actually when you thread it in to
form<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.770> staff<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:49.979> can't<00:01:50.250> even<00:01:50.369> see<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
form the staff you can't even see the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.480 
form the staff you can't even see the
regular<00:01:51.119> coupler<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.170> ends

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
regular coupler it's just the two ends

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.789 
regular coupler it's just the two ends
kind<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.640> meeting<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.229> really<00:01:55.439> like

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
kind of meeting but I like I really like

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.789 
kind of meeting but I like I really like
this<00:01:56.040> coupler<00:01:56.570> it's<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.780> longer<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.619> think

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
this coupler it's a longer and I think

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.630 
this coupler it's a longer and I think
it<00:01:58.890> adds<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.340> little<00:02:00.180> bit<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.600> design<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
it adds a little bit to the design of

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:13.090 
it adds a little bit to the design of
the<00:02:02.640> staff<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.750> set<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.829> over<00:02:04.979> here

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.010 

the<00:02:13.490> Daleks<00:02:13.910> really<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.330> just<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.750> longer

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
the Daleks really is just a longer

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.010 
the Daleks really is just a longer
version<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:16.280> dark<00:02:16.610> initiative<00:02:17.270> I<00:02:17.450> like<00:02:17.870> it

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
version of the dark initiative I like it

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.570 
version of the dark initiative I like it
because<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.350> has<00:02:18.470> these<00:02:18.650> two<00:02:18.709> choke<00:02:19.130> points

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
because it has these two choke points

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.640 
because it has these two choke points
which<00:02:19.730> are<00:02:19.850> perfect<00:02:20.330> for<00:02:20.450> gripping<00:02:20.720> it's

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
which are perfect for gripping it's

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.229 
which are perfect for gripping it's
actually<00:02:22.040> quite<00:02:22.370> possibly<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.090> most

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
actually quite possibly the most

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.570 
actually quite possibly the most
comfortable<00:02:23.870> saver<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.220> tough

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
comfortable saver that I have is a tough

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.449 
comfortable saver that I have is a tough
time<00:02:25.760> between<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.300> my<00:02:26.510> mission<00:02:26.959> but<00:02:27.459> I

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
time between it and my mission but I

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.699 
time between it and my mission but I
really<00:02:28.670> liked<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.270> Sabre<00:02:29.780> my<00:02:30.170> first<00:02:30.470> gun

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
really liked it the Sabre my first gun

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.080 
really liked it the Sabre my first gun

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
saver is also at Dominic's it's a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.300 
saver is also at Dominic's it's a

these<00:03:33.019> come<00:03:33.230> out<00:03:33.320> pretty<00:03:33.500> easily<00:03:33.650> every<00:03:34.070> now

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
these come out pretty easily every now

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.460 
these come out pretty easily every now
and<00:03:34.280> then<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.489> may<00:03:34.609> get<00:03:34.820> one<00:03:35.060> but<00:03:35.410> it's<00:03:36.410> a

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
and then you may get one but it's a

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.870 
and then you may get one but it's a

little harder to get out they clamp a

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.130 
little harder to get out they clamp a
little<00:03:37.910> tighter<00:03:38.329> so<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.720> might<00:03:38.870> want<00:03:38.989> to<00:03:39.049> get

screws right in so yeah again one of the
things<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.530> liked<00:03:54.739> about<00:03:55.299> this<00:03:57.880> coupler<00:03:58.880> is<00:03:59.120> it

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
things I liked about this coupler is it

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.420 
things I liked about this coupler is it
extends<00:04:00.019> out<00:04:00.290> as<00:04:00.739> you<00:04:00.859> can<00:04:00.980> see<00:04:01.100> here<00:04:01.340> it

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
extends out as you can see here it

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.190 
extends out as you can see here it
extends<00:04:01.910> further<00:04:02.390> out<00:04:02.570> where<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.870> regular

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
extends further out where the regular

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.050 
extends further out where the regular
one<00:04:03.380> it<00:04:04.190> doesn't<00:04:04.459> when<00:04:04.700> they're<00:04:04.819> screwed

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
one it doesn't when they're screwed

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.580 
one it doesn't when they're screwed
together<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.510> two<00:04:05.660> ends<00:04:05.840> of<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.079> savers<00:04:06.410> just

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
together the two ends of the savers just

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.640 
together the two ends of the savers just
mean<00:04:06.799> but<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.069> adds<00:04:07.250> a<00:04:07.400> little<00:04:08.260> design<00:04:09.260> I<00:04:09.620> just

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
mean but it adds a little design I just

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:18.770 
mean but it adds a little design I just
think<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:10.130> looks<00:04:10.310> better<00:04:10.519> personally

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780

inch blades on these and as you can see

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.810 
inch blades on these and as you can see
it's<00:04:39.880> massive<00:04:40.780> it's<00:04:41.140> very<00:04:41.410> long<00:04:42.450> I'm<00:04:43.450> 5<00:04:43.900> foot<00:04:44.110> 6

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.510 
it's massive it's very long I'm 5 foot 6
when<00:04:45.820> I<00:04:45.850> measured<00:04:46.210> this<00:04:46.360> out<00:04:46.570> it's<00:04:46.980> 86<00:04:47.980> inches

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
when I measured this out it's 86 inches

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.270 
when I measured this out it's 86 inches
it<00:04:48.700> almost<00:04:49.090> hits<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.450> roof<00:04:49.950> see<00:04:50.950> doing<00:04:51.190> the

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
it almost hits the roof see doing the

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.430 
it almost hits the roof see doing the
math<00:04:51.430> it's<00:04:51.610> about<00:04:51.670> 7<00:04:52.360> feet<00:04:52.690> 2<00:04:52.930> inches<00:04:52.960> I

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
math it's about 7 feet 2 inches I

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.150 
math it's about 7 feet 2 inches I
believe<00:04:53.760> that's<00:04:54.760> a<00:04:54.850> big<00:04:55.030> step<00:04:55.270> it's<00:04:56.040> not<00:04:57.040> the

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
believe that's a big step it's not the

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.660 
believe that's a big step it's not the
easiest<00:04:57.490> thing<00:04:57.640> for<00:04:57.760> me<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.120> twirl<00:04:59.490> but<00:05:00.490> I<00:05:00.520> do

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
easiest thing for me to twirl but I do

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.640
