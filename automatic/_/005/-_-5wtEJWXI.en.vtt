00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.350 
paid much attention to this at first but
well<00:04:51.560> I<00:04:51.590> thought<00:04:51.830> was<00:04:52.010> just<00:04:52.160> a<00:04:52.370> so<00:04:52.850> cosmetic

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
here out in the weather I think

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.990 
here out in the weather I think
something<00:04:58.100> really<00:04:58.130> Bad's<00:04:58.520> happened<00:04:58.850> to<00:04:58.910> this

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
something really Bad's happened to this

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.350 
something really Bad's happened to this
wheel<00:04:59.680> there's<00:05:00.680> deep<00:05:01.190> gouges<00:05:01.760> there<00:05:02.060> and

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
wheel there's deep gouges there and

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.800 
wheel there's deep gouges there and
definitely<00:05:02.870> there<00:05:03.230> probably<00:05:04.190> fractures<00:05:04.810> or

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
definitely there probably fractures or

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.260 
definitely there probably fractures or
at<00:05:05.900> least<00:05:06.080> a<00:05:06.260> bend<00:05:06.740> and<00:05:07.580> it<00:05:07.700> looks<00:05:07.820> like<00:05:07.880> even

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
at least a bend and it looks like even

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.700 
at least a bend and it looks like even
something<00:05:08.540> like<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.750> nut<00:05:09.080> or<00:05:09.260> something<00:05:09.590> has

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
something like a nut or something has

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.650 
something like a nut or something has
rolled<00:05:10.100> around<00:05:10.370> inside<00:05:10.850> here<00:05:11.150> caught<00:05:11.450> between

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
rolled around inside here caught between

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.770 
rolled around inside here caught between
the<00:05:11.990> brake<00:05:12.230> rotor<00:05:12.560> or<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.370> caliper<00:05:13.820> so<00:05:14.720> it

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
the brake rotor or the caliper so it

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.300 
the brake rotor or the caliper so it
goes<00:05:14.900> all<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.169> way<00:05:15.290> around<00:05:15.560> along<00:05:16.040> with<00:05:16.220> this

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
goes all the way around along with this

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.960 
goes all the way around along with this
Grey's<00:05:16.760> mark

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
Grey's mark

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.760 
Grey's mark
so<00:05:18.970> something<00:05:19.539> something<00:05:20.380> Horrible's

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
happened there and these things

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.900 
happened there and these things
definitely<00:05:22.090> not<00:05:22.240> serviceable<00:05:23.820> didn't<00:05:24.820> know

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
definitely not serviceable didn't know

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.240 
definitely not serviceable didn't know
about<00:05:25.000> that<00:05:25.360> I<00:05:25.800> was<00:05:26.800> given<00:05:26.979> a<00:05:27.009> bit<00:05:27.130> of<00:05:27.190> a

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
about that I was given a bit of a

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.330 
about that I was given a bit of a
cleanup<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:28.740> see<00:05:29.740> if<00:05:29.800> there<00:05:29.979> are<00:05:30.039> any<00:05:30.130> cracks

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
cleanup to see if there are any cracks

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.420 
cleanup to see if there are any cracks
in<00:05:30.639> it<00:05:30.729> and<00:05:30.910> yeah<00:05:31.740> that's<00:05:32.740> a<00:05:32.830> bit<00:05:32.919> more<00:05:33.070> extreme

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
in it and yeah that's a bit more extreme

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.219 
in it and yeah that's a bit more extreme
than<00:05:33.610> I<00:05:33.699> thought<00:05:33.910> the<00:05:34.690> interesting<00:05:35.110> would

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
than I thought the interesting would

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:36.779 
than I thought the interesting would
peal<00:05:35.440> this<00:05:35.590> tire<00:05:35.830> off<00:05:36.100> one<00:05:36.310> day<00:05:36.490> and<00:05:36.639> see

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
peal this tire off one day and see

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.070 
peal this tire off one day and see
what's<00:05:36.970> in<00:05:37.120> what<00:05:37.360> it<00:05:37.449> looks<00:05:37.570> like<00:05:37.660> in<00:05:37.810> size

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
what's in what it looks like in size

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.689 
what's in what it looks like in size
probably<00:05:38.380> York<00:05:38.590> raised<00:05:38.860> and<00:05:39.160> cracked<00:05:39.430> on<00:05:39.610> the

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
probably York raised and cracked on the

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.999 
probably York raised and cracked on the
powder<00:05:39.910> coating<00:05:40.440> it<00:05:41.440> needs<00:05:41.710> actually

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:42.009 
powder coating it needs actually

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.120 
powder coating it needs actually
fractured<00:05:42.250> the<00:05:42.520> rim<00:05:42.759> but<00:05:43.270> yeah<00:05:44.169> and<00:05:44.410> the<00:05:44.919> tire

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
fractured the rim but yeah and the tire

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.710 
fractured the rim but yeah and the tire
is<00:05:45.340> flat<00:05:45.550> but<00:05:45.880> that's<00:05:46.210> probably<00:05:46.539> those<00:05:46.630> are

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
is flat but that's probably those are

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.529 
is flat but that's probably those are
the<00:05:46.810> two<00:05:46.960> nails<00:05:47.229> that<00:05:47.470> are<00:05:47.560> in<00:05:47.620> it<00:05:47.740> and<00:05:48.539> oddly

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
the two nails that are in it and oddly

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:55.350 
the two nails that are in it and oddly
enough<00:05:52.949> there's<00:05:53.949> one<00:05:54.099> there<00:05:54.370> and<00:05:55.090> there's<00:05:55.330> one

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
enough there's one there and there's one

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.200 
enough there's one there and there's one
directly<00:05:55.750> opposite<00:05:56.590> it<00:05:56.940> that's<00:05:57.940> kind<00:05:58.150> of

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
directly opposite it that's kind of

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.310 
directly opposite it that's kind of
unusual<00:05:58.360> I<00:05:59.220> mean<00:06:00.539> to<00:06:01.539> speculate<00:06:02.050> I'd<00:06:02.169> say

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
unusual I mean to speculate I'd say

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.620 
unusual I mean to speculate I'd say
somebody<00:06:02.680> cracked<00:06:02.919> the<00:06:03.039> shits<00:06:03.280> with<00:06:03.430> him<00:06:03.630> and

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
somebody cracked the shits with him and

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.939 
somebody cracked the shits with him and
now<00:06:04.840> you've<00:06:04.990> tried<00:06:05.169> to<00:06:05.289> puncture<00:06:05.620> their<00:06:05.740> tires

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
now you've tried to puncture their tires

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.800 
now you've tried to puncture their tires
and<00:06:06.099> succeeded<00:06:06.729> and<00:06:07.150> probably<00:06:07.479> even<00:06:07.630> dropped

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
and succeeded and probably even dropped

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.629 
and succeeded and probably even dropped
something<00:06:08.199> through<00:06:08.470> one<00:06:08.889> of<00:06:08.919> the<00:06:09.070> spokes<00:06:09.340> and

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
something through one of the spokes and

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.960 
something through one of the spokes and
got<00:06:10.360> a<00:06:10.389> caught<00:06:10.630> between<00:06:10.810> the<00:06:11.110> brake<00:06:11.289> rotor

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
got a caught between the brake rotor

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.420 
got a caught between the brake rotor
it's<00:06:12.970> almost<00:06:13.169> vandalism<00:06:14.169> case<00:06:14.380> but<00:06:15.280> then

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
it's almost vandalism case but then

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.710 
it's almost vandalism case but then
there<00:06:15.580> could<00:06:15.699> have<00:06:15.729> been<00:06:15.820> a<00:06:15.910> loose<00:06:16.120> nut<00:06:16.449> off

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
there could have been a loose nut off

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.150 
there could have been a loose nut off
the<00:06:18.360> caliper<00:06:19.360> but<00:06:19.599> I<00:06:19.870> think<00:06:20.650> you'd<00:06:20.770> hear<00:06:20.949> about

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
the caliper but I think you'd hear about

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.610 
the caliper but I think you'd hear about
that<00:06:21.400> this<00:06:21.669> is<00:06:21.820> an<00:06:21.940> OEM<00:06:22.690> wheel<00:06:23.020> and<00:06:23.260> tire<00:06:23.409> from

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
that this is an OEM wheel and tire from

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.250 
that this is an OEM wheel and tire from
a<00:06:23.740> Mazda<00:06:24.070> Tribute<00:06:24.250> and<00:06:24.729> it<00:06:25.539> will<00:06:25.780> if<00:06:26.050> brake

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
a Mazda Tribute and it will if brake

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.810 
a Mazda Tribute and it will if brake
calipers<00:06:26.710> were<00:06:26.830> falling<00:06:27.159> apart<00:06:27.430> you'd<00:06:27.669> think

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
calipers were falling apart you'd think

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.589 
calipers were falling apart you'd think
you'd<00:06:27.970> hear<00:06:28.150> about<00:06:28.360> it<00:06:29.159> now<00:06:30.159> who<00:06:30.340> knows

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
you'd hear about it now who knows

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.820 
you'd hear about it now who knows
something<00:06:31.599> bad<00:06:31.810> happened<00:06:32.199> that<00:06:32.500> one<00:06:32.620> can<00:06:32.710> go

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
something bad happened that one can go

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.640 
something bad happened that one can go
in<00:06:32.889> the<00:06:33.010> scrap<00:06:33.280> bin<00:06:33.720> hell<00:06:34.720> I<00:06:34.750> might<00:06:34.930> even<00:06:35.110> find

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
in the scrap bin hell I might even find

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.649 
in the scrap bin hell I might even find
a<00:06:36.130> way<00:06:36.220> to<00:06:36.280> evacuate<00:06:36.610> all<00:06:37.090> of<00:06:37.210> the<00:06:37.330> years<00:06:37.479> from

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:37.659 
a way to evacuate all of the years from

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:39.570 
a way to evacuate all of the years from
the<00:06:37.750> tire<00:06:37.960> and<00:06:38.199> do<00:06:38.289> a<00:06:38.320> hydrostatic<00:06:38.740> test<00:06:39.250> on<00:06:39.430> it

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
the tire and do a hydrostatic test on it

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.930 
the tire and do a hydrostatic test on it
and<00:06:40.479> see<00:06:40.599> what<00:06:40.750> it<00:06:40.810> takes<00:06:40.990> to<00:06:41.139> pop<00:06:41.380> it<00:06:41.940> hadn't

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
and see what it takes to pop it hadn't

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.010 
and see what it takes to pop it hadn't
done<00:06:43.060> anything<00:06:43.240> like<00:06:43.419> that<00:06:43.479> for<00:06:43.750> a<00:06:43.810> while<00:06:43.960> I

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
done anything like that for a while I

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.110 
done anything like that for a while I
think<00:06:44.199> I'm<00:06:44.320> the<00:06:44.530> first<00:06:44.710> and<00:06:45.010> only<00:06:45.120> hydrostatic

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
think I'm the first and only hydrostatic

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.719 
think I'm the first and only hydrostatic
cop<00:06:46.300> we<00:06:46.479> did<00:06:46.659> was<00:06:46.810> with<00:06:46.930> the<00:06:47.430> washing<00:06:48.430> machine
