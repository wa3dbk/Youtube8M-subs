down based on your desired stitch length

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.880 
down based on your desired stitch length
one<00:00:17.600> beam<00:00:17.840> all<00:00:18.020> the<00:00:18.050> way<00:00:18.230> down<00:00:18.439> here<00:00:18.710> at<00:00:18.770> the

one beam all the way down here at the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.880 
one beam all the way down here at the
bottom<00:00:19.250> then<00:00:19.789> two<00:00:20.150> three<00:00:20.480> and<00:00:20.689> four<00:00:21.019> so<00:00:21.560> what

start at four I'm going to just kind of
do<00:00:25.820> this<00:00:25.970> little<00:00:26.150> sideways<00:00:26.660> here<00:00:27.050> now<00:00:27.500> when<00:00:27.710> we

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
do this little sideways here now when we

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.189 
do this little sideways here now when we
stitch<00:00:28.279> we're<00:00:29.060> gonna<00:00:29.179> notice<00:00:29.660> that<00:00:29.689> the

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
stitch we're gonna notice that the

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.350 
stitch we're gonna notice that the
stitch<00:00:31.099> length<00:00:31.340> that's<00:00:31.550> really<00:00:31.910> long<00:00:32.029> why<00:00:32.300> do

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
stitch length that's really long why do

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.060 
stitch length that's really long why do
you<00:00:32.570> need<00:00:32.720> a<00:00:32.750> longer<00:00:33.020> stitch<00:00:33.350> length<00:00:33.380> when<00:00:33.950> you

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
you need a longer stitch length when you

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.940 
you need a longer stitch length when you
work<00:00:34.280> on<00:00:34.430> heavier<00:00:34.940> fabrics<00:00:35.660> so<00:00:35.960> like<00:00:36.230> fleeces

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
work on heavier fabrics so like fleeces

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.580 
work on heavier fabrics so like fleeces
denims<00:00:37.520> you<00:00:38.060> don't<00:00:38.240> want<00:00:38.570> to<00:00:38.720> have<00:00:38.960> those

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
denims you don't want to have those

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.530 
denims you don't want to have those
stitches<00:00:39.830> piled<00:00:40.460> up<00:00:40.730> so<00:00:41.000> close<00:00:41.240> together

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
stitches piled up so close together

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.270 
stitches piled up so close together
you're<00:00:41.720> just<00:00:41.900> using<00:00:42.080> up<00:00:42.350> a<00:00:42.440> lot<00:00:42.710> more<00:00:42.890> thread

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
you're just using up a lot more thread

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.910 
you're just using up a lot more thread
then<00:00:43.820> as<00:00:44.090> you<00:00:44.420> adjust<00:00:44.540> it<00:00:45.020> here<00:00:45.440> let's<00:00:45.620> go<00:00:45.740> all

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
then as you adjust it here let's go all

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.250 
then as you adjust it here let's go all
the<00:00:45.950> way<00:00:46.070> down<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:46.580> two<00:00:46.880> that<00:00:47.630> would<00:00:47.930> be<00:00:48.080> more

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
the way down to two that would be more

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.080 
the way down to two that would be more
for<00:00:48.500> like<00:00:48.650> lighter<00:00:48.980> weight<00:00:49.310> fabrics<00:00:49.820> you<00:00:49.940> want

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
for like lighter weight fabrics you want

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.320 
for like lighter weight fabrics you want
a<00:00:50.150> little<00:00:50.360> bit<00:00:50.450> closer<00:00:51.080> together<00:00:51.880> stitch<00:00:52.880> now

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
a little bit closer together stitch now

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.600 
a little bit closer together stitch now
I<00:00:53.390> will<00:00:53.690> tell<00:00:53.930> you<00:00:54.050> on<00:00:54.200> a<00:00:54.260> four<00:00:54.650> thread<00:00:55.100> stitch

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
I will tell you on a four thread stitch

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.030 
I will tell you on a four thread stitch
length<00:00:56.180> of<00:00:56.450> one<00:00:56.900> is<00:00:57.230> not<00:00:57.590> going<00:00:57.830> to<00:00:57.890> look

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
length of one is not going to look

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.800 
length of one is not going to look
pretty<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:58.640> I'll<00:00:58.700> just<00:00:58.850> sew<00:00:59.030> just<00:00:59.060> a<00:00:59.510> little

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
pretty so I'll just sew just a little

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.050 
pretty so I'll just sew just a little
bit<00:00:59.930> it's<00:01:00.560> it's<00:01:00.920> okay<00:01:01.340> but<00:01:01.550> it's<00:01:01.700> nothing

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.060 
bit it's it's okay but it's nothing

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.509 
bit it's it's okay but it's nothing
great<00:01:02.210> you<00:01:02.870> will<00:01:03.020> find<00:01:03.350> about<00:01:03.650> a<00:01:03.710> two<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:04.430> a

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
great you will find about a two and a

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.030 
great you will find about a two and a
half<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:05.570> in<00:01:05.720> between<00:01:06.080> two<00:01:06.290> two<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:06.740> three

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
half so in between two two and three

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.690 
half so in between two two and three
here<00:01:07.310> will<00:01:07.760> be<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:07.910> nice<00:01:08.300> medium<00:01:09.290> length<00:01:09.860> for

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
here will be a nice medium length for

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.540 
here will be a nice medium length for
your<00:01:10.940> stitch<00:01:11.360> for<00:01:11.990> most<00:01:12.320> of<00:01:12.560> your<00:01:12.740> cotton

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
your stitch for most of your cotton

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.510 
your stitch for most of your cotton
fabrics<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.480> such<00:01:14.690> and<00:01:15.080> then<00:01:16.010> you<00:01:16.130> can<00:01:16.280> see

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
fabrics and such and then you can see

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.910 
fabrics and such and then you can see
right<00:01:16.700> here<00:01:16.760> where<00:01:17.420> we<00:01:17.660> have<00:01:17.900> we<00:01:18.410> started<00:01:18.800> it

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
right here where we have we started it

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.470 
right here where we have we started it
forward<00:01:19.370> then<00:01:19.550> we<00:01:19.700> were<00:01:19.820> at<00:01:19.940> two<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.330> that

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
forward then we were at two so that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.570 
forward then we were at two so that
one's<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:20.750> little<00:01:20.780> bit<00:01:21.230> too<00:01:21.440> close<00:01:21.650> for<00:01:22.460> this

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
one's a little bit too close for this

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.940 
one's a little bit too close for this
particular<00:01:22.940> fabric<00:01:23.480> but<00:01:24.020> it<00:01:24.140> does<00:01:24.380> keep<00:01:24.770> a

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
particular fabric but it does keep a

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.240 
particular fabric but it does keep a
nice<00:01:25.280> seam<00:01:25.850> as<00:01:26.240> I<00:01:26.630> open<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:27.050> up<00:01:27.230> very<00:01:27.800> tight

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
nice seam as I open that up very tight

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.520 
nice seam as I open that up very tight
but<00:01:28.880> with<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.090> heavier<00:01:29.690> fabric<00:01:29.900> remember

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
but with a heavier fabric remember

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.600 
but with a heavier fabric remember
you're<00:01:30.680> going<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.830> use<00:01:31.040> up<00:01:31.220> some<00:01:31.400> of<00:01:31.460> the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
you're going to use up some of the

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.520 
you're going to use up some of the
height<00:01:31.880> for<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:32.659> length<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.230> this<00:01:33.350> will

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
height for the length so this will

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.010 
height for the length so this will
probably<00:01:33.740> add<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.700> three<00:01:35.150> or<00:01:35.270> four<00:01:35.630> stitch

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
probably add a three or four stitch

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.720 
probably add a three or four stitch
length<00:01:36.290> on<00:01:36.440> a<00:01:36.470> heavier<00:01:36.860> fabric<00:01:37.010> will<00:01:37.370> probably

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
length on a heavier fabric will probably

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.750 
length on a heavier fabric will probably
look<00:01:37.970> more<00:01:38.120> like<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.750> middle<00:01:39.110> section<00:01:39.680> at<00:01:40.190> two

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
look more like the middle section at two

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.550 
look more like the middle section at two
and<00:01:40.940> a<00:01:41.000> half<00:01:41.270> when<00:01:41.540> you're<00:01:41.690> done<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.110> no

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
and a half when you're done and no

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.290 
and a half when you're done and no
there's<00:01:42.890> no<00:01:43.100> place<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.520> would<00:01:43.670> use<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:43.880> stitch
