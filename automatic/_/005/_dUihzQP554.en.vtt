particular<00:00:18.449> trains<00:00:18.900> don't<00:00:19.619> run<00:00:19.740> all<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.100> time

I<00:00:20.340> think<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> tone<00:00:21.060> right<00:00:21.330> poses<00:00:21.779> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
I think that the tone right poses a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.990 
I think that the tone right poses a
change<00:00:22.140> or<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.740> change<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.519> safety<00:00:23.760> risk
