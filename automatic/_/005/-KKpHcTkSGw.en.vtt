encompasses the entire calendar and

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.520 
encompasses the entire calendar and
what's<00:01:30.910> going<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.119> happen<00:01:31.479> is<00:01:31.630> they<00:01:32.110> say<00:01:32.350> the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
what's going to happen is they say the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.200 
what's going to happen is they say the

going<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.539> die<00:01:34.720> which<00:01:35.500> is<00:01:35.710> very<00:01:36.100> similar<00:01:36.460> to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
going to die which is very similar to

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.270 
going to die which is very similar to
the<00:01:37.270> mines<00:01:37.570> so<00:01:38.050> we<00:01:38.200> have<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.410> Chinese<00:01:38.800> one

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
the mines so we have the Chinese one

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.690 
the mines so we have the Chinese one
culture<00:01:39.820> one<00:01:40.450> area<00:01:40.960> one<00:01:41.289> time<00:01:41.560> but<00:01:42.430> then<00:01:42.580> you

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
culture one area one time but then you

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.999 
culture one area one time but then you
throw<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.030> Mayans<00:01:43.509> into<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.899> mix<00:01:44.140> creating<00:01:44.950> a

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
throw the Mayans into the mix creating a

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.609 
throw the Mayans into the mix creating a
completely<00:01:45.340> different<00:01:46.030> solar<00:01:46.539> calendar<00:01:47.140> this

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
completely different solar calendar this

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.710 
completely different solar calendar this
calendar<00:01:47.680> is<00:01:48.160> so<00:01:48.430> precise<00:01:48.820> at<00:01:49.090> it<00:01:49.210> it

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
calendar is so precise at it it

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.230 
calendar is so precise at it it
literally<00:01:50.080> predicted<00:01:50.830> moon<00:01:51.610> cycles

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
literally predicted moon cycles

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.420 
literally predicted moon cycles
thousands<00:01:53.140> of<00:01:53.200> years<00:01:53.320> twelve<00:01:53.680> thousand<00:01:54.280> years

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
thousands of years twelve thousand years

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.980 
thousands of years twelve thousand years
into<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.790> future<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:55.360> they<00:01:55.600> came<00:01:55.780> up<00:01:55.840> with

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
into the future and they came up with

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.060 
into the future and they came up with
the<00:01:56.170> same<00:01:56.439> exact<00:01:57.100> date<00:01:57.689> December<00:01:58.689> 21st<00:01:59.170> 2012

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
the same exact date December 21st 2012

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.670 
the same exact date December 21st 2012
so<00:02:00.430> that<00:02:00.549> means<00:02:00.790> that<00:02:01.060> China<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.290> Mayans

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
so that means that China and the Mayans

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.980 
so that means that China and the Mayans
came<00:02:03.369> up<00:02:03.490> with<00:02:03.670> both<00:02:03.880> of<00:02:03.909> these<00:02:04.119> calendars<00:02:04.689> and

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
came up with both of these calendars and

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.499 
came up with both of these calendars and
coincide<00:02:05.409> and<00:02:05.590> on<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.799> same<00:02:06.009> date<00:02:06.400> based<00:02:07.210> on

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
coincide and on the same date based on

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.039 
coincide and on the same date based on
their<00:02:08.320> own<00:02:08.440> calculation<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:10.690> brings<00:02:10.810> us

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
their own calculation and that brings us

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:47.080 
their own calculation and that brings us
to<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.230> next<00:02:11.260> thing<00:02:11.560> revelations
