00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
you to do it because I don't know

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.970 
you to do it because I don't know
whether<00:00:33.720> or<00:00:33.840> not<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.739> seal

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
whether or not it's going to seal

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.110 
whether or not it's going to seal
properly<00:00:35.600> back<00:00:36.600> again<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.859> seems<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.579> be<00:00:38.730> fine

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
properly back again it seems to be fine

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.560 
properly back again it seems to be fine
but<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.590> never<00:00:40.800> know<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.239> can

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
actually talk to down make them replace

your<00:00:47.399> outside<00:00:47.730> nimi<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.000> think<00:00:48.269> that's<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
your outside nimi I think that's the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.220 
your outside nimi I think that's the
best<00:00:48.870> option<00:00:49.339> okay<00:00:50.339> so<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.570> got<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.170> is

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
best option okay so what I got here is

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.169 
best option okay so what I got here is

it in proportion for you
this<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:33.080> its<00:01:34.080> size<00:01:34.740> here<00:01:35.130> okay

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
this is its size here okay

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.719 
this is its size here okay
it<00:01:36.360> should<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.810> no<00:01:37.680> more<00:01:39.229> greater<00:01:40.229> than<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.920> CD

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
it should be no more greater than a CD

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.660 
it should be no more greater than a CD
in<00:01:42.200> height<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.619> okay<00:01:44.190> so<00:01:46.100> let's<00:01:47.100> get<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.580> it

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
in height here okay so let's get to it

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.130 
in height here okay so let's get to it
okay<00:01:48.170> this<00:01:49.460> this<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> process<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.869> come

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
okay this this is the process you come

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.840 
okay this this is the process you come
here<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:53.899> in<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.110> lower<00:01:55.320> quality<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.340> you

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
here in in the lower quality and you

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.710 
here in in the lower quality and you
push<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.300> back<00:01:57.710> with<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.600> mantle

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
push it back with the mantle

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.230 
push it back with the mantle
you<00:02:00.840> insert<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.410> model<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.190> sure<00:02:02.429> to<00:02:02.490> insert

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
you insert the model be sure to insert

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.820 
you insert the model be sure to insert
it<00:02:04.340> all<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.610> way<00:02:05.759> through<00:02:05.789> because<00:02:06.590> if<00:02:07.590> you

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
it all the way through because if you

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.219 
it all the way through because if you
don't<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.450> come<00:02:09.660> out<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.869> little

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
don't it's going to to come out a little

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.550 
don't it's going to to come out a little
bit<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:11.190> blue<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:12.000> because<00:02:12.360> there's<00:02:13.290> more

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
bit of a blue that because there's more

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.280 
bit of a blue that because there's more
than<00:02:13.620> one<00:02:13.980> layer<00:02:14.280> okay<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.420> it's<00:02:15.810> one<00:02:16.110> layer

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
than one layer okay that it's one layer

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.110 
than one layer okay that it's one layer
that<00:02:16.820> sticks<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.090> edge<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.569> edge<00:02:18.690> plastic

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
that sticks the edge to edge plastic

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.759 
that sticks the edge to edge plastic
with<00:02:21.120> some<00:02:21.390> glue<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.900> then<00:02:22.500> there's

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
with some glue and then there's

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.940 
with some glue and then there's
something<00:02:23.069> that<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:24.000> hopes<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:25.350> thing

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
something that that hopes the this thing

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.420 
something that that hopes the this thing
together<00:02:26.100> it's<00:02:26.610> not<00:02:26.880> like<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:28.049> screw<00:02:28.709> but<00:02:31.430> let

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
together it's not like a a screw but let

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.500 
together it's not like a a screw but let
me<00:02:32.519> show<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.090> you're<00:02:33.450> gonna<00:02:33.600> see<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.930> okay

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:49.780

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.430 

it's<00:02:50.270> tricky<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.599> do<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:51.640> very<00:02:52.640> calmly

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
it's tricky to do this very calmly

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:01.500 
it's tricky to do this very calmly
slowly<00:02:55.180> okay<00:02:56.319> it's<00:02:57.319> going<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.650> come<00:02:57.830> out
