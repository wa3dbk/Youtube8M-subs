my custom like a lizard minifigure I've
always<00:00:17.080> wanted<00:00:17.290> to<00:00:17.500> have<00:00:17.650> the<00:00:17.920> lizard<00:00:18.250> in<00:00:18.369> Lego

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
always wanted to have the lizard in Lego

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.660 
always wanted to have the lizard in Lego
form<00:00:19.080> ever<00:00:20.080> since<00:00:20.500> lighter<00:00:20.980> released<00:00:21.460> the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670

I<00:00:26.610> think<00:00:27.610> the<00:00:27.700> lizard<00:00:28.090> would<00:00:28.239> have<00:00:28.360> to<00:00:28.480> be<00:00:28.570> one

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
I think the lizard would have to be one

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.229

Ock<00:00:39.730> and<00:00:41.039> that's<00:00:42.039> mainly<00:00:42.250> because<00:00:42.519> he's<00:00:42.850> one

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
Ock and that's mainly because he's one

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.090 
Ock and that's mainly because he's one
