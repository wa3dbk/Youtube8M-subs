00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello hello today is November 27th 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.139
 8:30 AM I'll show you my time again 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.299
 tree and squee gut sleeps under it like in 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.430
 my face is good here on the beach today 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:24.300
 I didn't go yesterday and hung out there 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:27.599
 flags and jellyfish here about once a month 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.219
 on a new moon swims the jellyfish 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.590
 so transparent and not recommended 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:40.320
 swim because the touch of these 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:44.040
 jellyfish causes burns and pretty 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.260
 painful tourists anyway swims but 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.120
 I try not to do it yesterday 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.739
 just a quick dip today 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.050
 decided not to walk at all and instead I 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.859
 decided to make a hair mask today 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.100
 I found a recipe on the internet I knew 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.010
 this recipe to me mom once upon a time 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.119
 gave him here he writes one spoon 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.340
 castor oil on a spoonful of onion juice 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.549
 tincture of calendula peppers but 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.830
 so they every current I will not all 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.049
 ingredients add i will see what u 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:26.270
 I already have it all 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.270
 fed up and cooked and now I'll show 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.950
 what do I have here 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.950
 castor oil I will add it 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.560
 I will add for such not full tea 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.600
 spoons because i have a teaspoon 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.890
 very huge she is almost like 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.230
 dining room but you can depending on who 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.240
 what hair long thick add 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.930
 I have more short hair and 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.680
 absolutely liquid so i will 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:07.030
 add smaller 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.860
 capsicum I have left is what I 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.590
 somewhere once bought in Russian 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.600
 the store and somehow I even tried 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:21.000
 make the tincture of chilli pepper itself 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:25.210
 soaked for a month or how much is there in 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.840
 alcohol and then used well it even 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.990
 still on 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.810
 in Alaska was here from the fact that there 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.140
 I wrote the oil calendula tincture 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:41.280
 I have no calendula tincture, but u 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:47.400
 I have what it is called burdock 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.400
 burdock tincture and now I'll add it too 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:03:02.620
 serve the tea on the yolk 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:06.550
 yolk now i'll show how i do it 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.450
 the egg should be broken neatly like this 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:16.380
 in half so as not to damage the yolk and 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.380
 drain the protein here and so rolling 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.320
 yolk can be drained into some 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.160
 a plate or cup for later 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.880
 use somewhere in cooking 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.010
 I don't know anything like to cook from 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:38.470
 squirrel and so I just throw it in 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:43.320
 I helped the sink to the maximum 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:46.330
 principle you can of course add with 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:53.110
 protein but just a mask will be more 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:56.410
 liquid then it will be harder to apply 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.480
 hair and protein they are what are useful 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.480
 does not have hair properties 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.459
 farther 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:19.380
 a teaspoon of honey and you need brandy but 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.830
 me to nikone you here I have a mash 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.830
 so I pour 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.070
 a teaspoon of rum 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:43.900
 I still have it, I just got it all 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.910
 their reserves have long been a year long probably 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.990
 I did not do any masks now 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:55.620
 It became very much losing his hair I'm 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.620
 decided something like butter 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.289
 alif it 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.669
 olives and tea tree 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.740
 I will not be very much oil 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.720
 add and so added castor 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.400
 next time you can basically instead 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.810
 castor oil take this here 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.460
 oils and i still have this 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:21.120
 Castor oil is not liquid and the like 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.610
 will affect it, too, can be added if 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.150
 make a mask if mashka turns 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:32.490
 very liquid not to make 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.669
 You can add such a fat one 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.210
 oils 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:40.990
 Well, that's all I mixed can of course 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.940
 add a teaspoon of onion if desired 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.330
 and probably even very good and and 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:49.990
 add but I do n't feel like messing with me 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:54.639
 no squeezer juice to 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:56.530
 make squeeze juice and sound and will i 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.949
 I do not want to add because then very 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:03.150
 hard to get rid of the smell of the shaft from the hair 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:07.389
 so I do without no sound though if 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:11.610
 you want you can add a bow about what 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:16.300
 very useful for hair all mask ready 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:19.060
 now i cooked i will have to 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.590
 I put it on my hair here 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:25.360
 such a hat after I put 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:29.020
 I will put a mask on my hair and a hat 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:32.199
 I wrap up with a towel and leave it like this 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:36.699
 on the longer the better you can leave and 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:38.349
 by 2 and 3 and 4 hours but better than 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.360
 the longer the better but no such 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:43.030
 possibilities of course to walk in this mask 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.550
 whole day someone for an hour is enough 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:48.940
 you can wash it in an hour 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:52.300
 hair and wash off this mask well that's it 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:55.360
 I paid a mask affair shook cap 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.550
 on top of a towel and go now 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.420
 make breakfast and go about your own 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.510
 affairs 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:04.540
 at least an hour of time this mask should 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.480
 I have on my hair and when I have her 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:11.250
 I will remove my hope that my hair will be 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.250
 look like this
