00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.520

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.750
 that we play the first round 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.000
 first circle cube cracow but unfortunately 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.809
 the team would have been assembled two minutes before 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.809
 fucking start 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.320
 I'm not with us by the way only two replacements for 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.630

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:21.110
 I know a predator but we need you 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:24.369

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.600
 Well 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.930
 but it's much shorter understandable 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.869
 the attitude of our kurak I think amid 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:17.910

 and what is there for the teams looked profit 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.420
 the opponent studied them before the match 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.260
