00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.660

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.259

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.279

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.730
 so apple shows 9:41 so on these 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.369
 products 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.060
 so I'm going to explain you through a 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.170
 little slideshow that I made 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.090
 by my care 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.920
 so the different products and 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.739
 the evolution of their gifts klein 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.180
 so start with the iphone range 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.510
 so the very first iphone so 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.269
 presented by steve jobs cent in 2007 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.929
 present at 9:42 after if we continue 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:53.809
 on the 3g and the 3gs still 9:40 2 and 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:56.379
 only from the iphone 4 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.449
 so during the long time there 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.100
 were there had come so the 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.410
 presentation of the first ipad 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.610
 generation so there can only see that 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.850
 the iphone is at 9:41 and a follow up 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.240
 today's time so the iphone 4s 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.860
 9:41 like the iPhone 5 still 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.979
 9h41 so the iphone 5 the 5c or 5 pieces 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.380
 so here's so for here so I'm going 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.119
 so show you the ipod range so 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.670
 just here you can see 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.619
 on the first or second ipad 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.149
 generation I do not know exactly anymore 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.799
 you can see that the time is at 9:41 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.259
 same so now on the ipad mini to 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.969
 9:41 so I do not know if you see very 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.729
 well and the same so on the iPad of 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.399
 fourth generation 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.289
 9:41 also so especially the visuals 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.630
 of apple so simply 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:59.210
 apple had decided so two meters to 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.580
 9:41 or forty two so apple estimated 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.270
 simply that 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.160
 product presentation will arrive 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.460
 will arrive 40 minutes after the start of 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.900
 the presentation of which therefore notes a son 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.770
 like it's a bit hard so sometimes 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.230
 so fall 40 minutes forty minutes 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.460
 pile so Apple has decided to 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.390
 add one to two minutes 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.070
 additional 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.770
 so here is so I will show you 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.330
 so on the presentation so the first 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.050
