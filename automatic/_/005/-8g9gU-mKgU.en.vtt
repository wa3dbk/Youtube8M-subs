extremely pale skin stay away from this

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.830 
extremely pale skin stay away from this
product<00:01:32.759> because<00:01:32.820> you'll<00:01:33.119> find<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
product because you'll find this a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.020 
product because you'll find this a
little<00:01:34.500> bit<00:01:34.890> too<00:01:35.070> dark<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.610> skin<00:01:35.820> I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
little bit too dark for your skin I

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.490 
little bit too dark for your skin I
think<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.659> about<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.960> primers<00:01:37.380> you

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
think I like about this primers you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.990 
think I like about this primers you
don't<00:01:37.680> actually<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.159> put<00:01:38.400> too<00:01:38.610> much<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
don't actually have to put too much of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.660 
don't actually have to put too much of
it<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.110> 1.7<00:01:40.740> ounces<00:01:41.009> will<00:01:41.220> last<00:01:41.430> quite

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
it on so the 1.7 ounces will last quite

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.609 
it on so the 1.7 ounces will last quite
a<00:01:41.729> while<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.240> lot<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.899> people<00:01:42.990> don't<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
a while a lot of people don't like the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.620 
a while a lot of people don't like the
heavy<00:01:43.829> silicon<00:01:44.460> II<00:01:44.490> feel<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.970> certain<00:01:45.240> primers

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
heavy silicon II feel of certain primers

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.200 
heavy silicon II feel of certain primers
again<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.500> primer<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.070> not<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.000> it's

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
again this primer is not like that it's

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.300 
again this primer is not like that it's
just<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.960> kind<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:49.740> feels<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.220> bit

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
just it kind of just feels a bit

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.389 
just it kind of just feels a bit
fixative<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.750> sort<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.680> more<00:01:53.130> water

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
fixative and I sort of it's more water

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.859 
fixative and I sort of it's more water
based<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.939> you're<00:01:54.450> not<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.720> get<00:01:54.840> that

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
based so you're not going to get that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.359 
based so you're not going to get that
heavy<00:01:55.170> silicone<00:01:55.680> II<00:01:55.710> feel<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.250> would

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
heavy silicone II feel that you would

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.830 
heavy silicone II feel that you would
get<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.520> other<00:01:56.670> primers<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:57.719> you're

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
get with other primers and if you're

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.149 
get with other primers and if you're
somebody<00:01:58.049> who<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.350> using<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.710> primer<00:01:58.920> because

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
somebody who is using a primer because

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.639 
somebody who is using a primer because
you<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.700> oily<00:01:59.909> skin<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.780> primer<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.320> going

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
to provide you with a good deal of

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.719 
to provide you with a good deal of
mattifying<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.710> again<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.520> all

mattifying and again this is for all
skin<00:02:05.969> types<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.689> not<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.049> cause

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320

you issue it cause any issues if you had

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.580 
you issue it cause any issues if you had
very<00:02:09.239> very<00:02:09.360> dry<00:02:09.599> skin<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:10.349> if<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.500> have

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
very very dry skin but if you have

very very dry skin but if you have
extreme

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
extreme

extreme
oily<00:02:11.520> skin<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:11.970> probably<00:02:12.120> not<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.390> best

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
oily skin this is probably not the best

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.120 
oily skin this is probably not the best
one<00:02:12.870> but<00:02:13.020> if<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.170> have<00:02:13.320> a<00:02:13.350> little<00:02:13.620> bit<00:02:13.740> of<00:02:13.830> oily

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
one but if you have a little bit of oily

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.070 
one but if you have a little bit of oily
skin<00:02:14.370> perhaps<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.880> t-zone<00:02:15.240> this<00:02:15.840> really

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
skin perhaps in the t-zone this really

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.420 
skin perhaps in the t-zone this really
will<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.440> good<00:02:16.650> option<00:02:16.800> because<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.250> does

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
will be a good option because it does

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.340 
will be a good option because it does
provide<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.150> bit<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.480> mattifying<00:02:19.020> effect

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
provide a bit of that mattifying effect

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.720 
provide a bit of that mattifying effect
now<00:02:19.680> I've<00:02:19.770> had<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.010> primer<00:02:20.250> for<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.490> couple

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
now I've had this primer for a couple

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.010 
now I've had this primer for a couple
months<00:02:20.850> already<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.300> I've<00:02:21.480> only<00:02:21.540> used<00:02:21.720> it

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
months already and I've only used it

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.720 
months already and I've only used it
under<00:02:22.230> liquid<00:02:22.620> foundation<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.280> under<00:02:23.460> cream

under liquid foundation and under cream
foundation<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:25.170> have<00:02:25.350> noticed<00:02:25.710> that<00:02:25.800> it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
foundation and I have noticed that it

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.220 
foundation and I have noticed that it
does<00:02:26.130> seem<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.700> extend<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.390> longevity<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:28.020> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230

where it it seems to extend the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.940 
where it it seems to extend the
desirability<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.110> where<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.470> terms<00:02:31.710> of

desirability of the where in terms of

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.430 
desirability of the where in terms of
evenness<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.330> terms<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.290> actual

finish of the foundation while of course
providing<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> bit<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.460> candlelight

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
providing you a bit of that candlelight

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
glow effect from from within but for me

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.680 
glow effect from from within but for me
I<00:02:41.160> would<00:02:41.340> be<00:02:41.370> totally<00:02:41.670> confident<00:02:42.300> wearing<00:02:42.540> a

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
again it has a very very low level

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.780 
again it has a very very low level
concealing<00:03:01.770> effect<00:03:02.070> which<00:03:02.490> is<00:03:02.610> another

concealing effect which is another
