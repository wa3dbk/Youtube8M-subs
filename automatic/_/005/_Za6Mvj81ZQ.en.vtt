puzzle is extremely smooth however for

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.990 
puzzle is extremely smooth however for
me<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:30.630> very<00:00:30.750> very<00:00:31.050> sluggish<00:00:31.650> I'm<00:00:32.579> someone

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
me it's very very sluggish I'm someone

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.389 
me it's very very sluggish I'm someone
who<00:00:33.090> prefers<00:00:33.300> faster<00:00:34.140> cubes<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.040> when<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.190> first

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
who prefers faster cubes so when I first

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.459 
who prefers faster cubes so when I first
tried<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.270> took<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> lot<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.870> getting<00:00:37.140> used

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
tried this it took a lot of getting used

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.560 
tried this it took a lot of getting used
to<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.890> be<00:00:37.920> able<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.219> get<00:00:38.430> somewhat<00:00:39.329> decent

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
to to be able to get somewhat decent

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.209 
to to be able to get somewhat decent
times<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.430> it<00:00:41.430> also<00:00:41.579> has<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> slight<00:00:42.329> clicking

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
times on it also has a slight clicking

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.850 
times on it also has a slight clicking
in<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> mechanism<00:00:44.640> but<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:46.050> not<00:00:46.469> very

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
in the mechanism but it's not very

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.060 
in the mechanism but it's not very
dramatic<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.510> easy<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.930> look<00:00:49.079> past<00:00:49.350> as

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
dramatic so it's easy to look past as

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.889 
dramatic so it's easy to look past as
far<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.370> locking<00:00:50.640> goes<00:00:50.969> there's<00:00:51.360> very<00:00:51.629> little

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
far as locking goes there's very little

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.529 
far as locking goes there's very little
on<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.320> puzzle<00:00:52.559> which<00:00:53.219> makes<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.640> very<00:00:53.820> very

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
on this puzzle which makes it very very

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.950 
on this puzzle which makes it very very
easy<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.199> execute<00:00:55.500> out<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.660> don't<00:00:57.660> think<00:00:57.840> I've

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
easy to execute out I don't think I've

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.189 
easy to execute out I don't think I've
had<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.590> simple<00:00:59.550> block<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.030> puzzle<00:01:00.239> since

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
had a simple block on this puzzle since

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.229 
had a simple block on this puzzle since
I've<00:01:01.320> gotten<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.430> very<00:01:02.730> very<00:01:03.030> very

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I've gotten it and it's very very very

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.660 
I've gotten it and it's very very very
nice<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:06.510> corner<00:01:06.840> cutting<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:08.720> well<00:01:09.720> over<00:01:10.020> 45

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
nice the corner cutting is well over 45

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.969 
nice the corner cutting is well over 45
but<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.000> go<00:01:12.090> too<00:01:12.150> far<00:01:12.650> obviously<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.770> locks

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
but if you go too far obviously it locks

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.870 
but if you go too far obviously it locks
up<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.340> bit<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.119> reverse<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.750> puzzle

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
up a bit and the reverse on this puzzle

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.999 
up a bit and the reverse on this puzzle
is<00:01:17.880> over<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> half<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.630> piece<00:01:18.900> which<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.229> amazing

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
is over a half a piece which is amazing

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.179 
is over a half a piece which is amazing
but<00:01:20.970> again<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.570> go<00:01:21.689> too<00:01:21.750> far<00:01:22.170> locks<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
but again if you go too far locks up a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.460 
but again if you go too far locks up a
bit<00:01:23.479> one<00:01:24.479> reason<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.990> think<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.259> this

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
bit one reason that I think that this

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.410 
bit one reason that I think that this
cube<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.830> very<00:01:25.950> self<00:01:26.340> sluggish<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.030> because

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
cube is very self sluggish is because

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.210 
cube is very self sluggish is because
there's<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.720> lot<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.930> contact<00:01:28.470> points<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.009> here

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
there's a lot of contact points in here

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.569 
there's a lot of contact points in here
and<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> plastic<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.710> quite

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and because the plastic is quite

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.800 
and because the plastic is quite
interesting<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.180> don't<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:33.450> how<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.659> describe

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
interesting I don't know how to describe

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.359 
interesting I don't know how to describe
it<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.350> I'm<00:01:34.590> not<00:01:34.770> someone<00:01:35.009> who<00:01:35.189> knows

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
it and I'm not someone who knows

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.700 
it and I'm not someone who knows
plastics<00:01:35.909> very<00:01:36.090> well<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> different

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
plastics very well but it is a different

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.359 
plastics very well but it is a different
plastic<00:01:38.130> than<00:01:38.340> most<00:01:39.030> puzzles<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.369> have

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
plastic than most puzzles that I have

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.270 
plastic than most puzzles that I have
had<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.750> mechanism<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.470> quite<00:01:43.649> interesting

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
had the mechanism is quite interesting

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.920 
had the mechanism is quite interesting
with<00:01:44.610> these<00:01:45.079> notches<00:01:46.079> right<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:47.930> but

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
with these notches right here but

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.870 
with these notches right here but
besides<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:49.890> really<00:01:50.159> nothing<00:01:50.490> too

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
besides that it's really nothing too

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.749 
besides that it's really nothing too
special<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.570> there<00:01:52.220> overall<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.610> would

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
special in there overall I would

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.460 
special in there overall I would
recommend<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.270> puzzle<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:55.079> someone<00:01:55.380> who

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
likes a slower cube it is very cheap at

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.590 
likes a slower cube it is very cheap at
