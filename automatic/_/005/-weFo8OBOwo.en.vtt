absence was constantly in the back of my

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.460 
absence was constantly in the back of my
mind<00:01:04.400> if<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.549> had<00:01:05.670> been<00:01:05.790> during<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> day

pod and seal the edge but I don't have
any<00:05:02.020> idea<00:05:02.380> this<00:05:02.710> will<00:05:02.890> even<00:05:03.040> work<00:05:03.150> but<00:05:04.150> it's

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
any idea this will even work but it's

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.300 
any idea this will even work but it's
looking<00:05:04.510> promising<00:05:07.470> this<00:05:08.470> is<00:05:08.620> what<00:05:08.770> I<00:05:08.800> have<00:05:09.070> so

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
looking promising this is what I have so

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.970 
looking promising this is what I have so
far<00:05:12.420> but<00:05:13.420> next<00:05:13.570> time<00:05:13.840> we'll<00:05:14.560> mount<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:14.830> nav

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
far but next time we'll mount the nav

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.860 
far but next time we'll mount the nav
pod<00:05:15.250> to<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.490> hard<00:05:15.670> top<00:05:15.880> and<00:05:16.120> then<00:05:16.450> install<00:05:16.750> the

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
pod to the hard top and then install the

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.600 
pod to the hard top and then install the

receiver we'll also install a new
12-volt<00:05:22.810> panel<00:05:23.170> then<00:05:24.040> we'll<00:05:24.160> take<00:05:24.310> a<00:05:24.340> stab<00:05:24.640> and

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
12-volt panel then we'll take a stab and
