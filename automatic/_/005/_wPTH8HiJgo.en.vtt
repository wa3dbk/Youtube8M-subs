00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
through these two loops and you get a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.300 
through these two loops and you get a
single<00:01:31.650> crochet<00:01:33.320> so<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.829> take<00:01:35.100> this

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
single crochet so then you take this

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.230 
single crochet so then you take this
short<00:01:35.640> strand<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> front<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:39.030> will

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240

hidden<00:01:43.110> afterwards

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.060 

so<00:01:47.689> we're<00:01:47.840> crushing<00:01:48.020> all<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.439> time<00:01:48.680> these

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.570 

stretch<00:02:15.760> your<00:02:16.760> elastic<00:02:18.010> because<00:02:19.010> we<00:02:19.340> need

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
stretch your elastic because we need

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.509 
stretch your elastic because we need
more<00:02:20.269> stitches<00:02:22.930> then<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.620> will<00:02:25.160> be<00:02:25.280> possible

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
more stitches then it will be possible

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.559 
more stitches then it will be possible
it<00:02:26.030> would<00:02:26.269> be<00:02:26.450> possible<00:02:26.630> in<00:02:27.019> this<00:02:28.030> way<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:29.510> you

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
it would be possible in this way so you

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.890 
it would be possible in this way so you
see<00:02:29.900> this<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.200> just<00:02:30.769> a<00:02:30.890> normal<00:02:31.160> elastic<00:02:31.880> way<00:02:32.090> it

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
see this is just a normal elastic way it

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.350 
see this is just a normal elastic way it
is<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.140> stretch<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:34.069> we<00:02:34.280> need<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:34.790> number<00:02:35.330> of

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
is a stretch so we need the number of

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.870 
is a stretch so we need the number of
stitches<00:02:35.720> if<00:02:36.170> it's<00:02:36.709> stretched<00:02:37.099> or<00:02:37.430> when<00:02:37.700> it's

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
stitches if it's stretched or when it's

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.610 
stitches if it's stretched or when it's
stretched<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.790> always<00:02:44.060> stretch<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:45.140> then

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
stretched so you always stretch and then

00:02:45.620 --> 00:03:42.520 
stretched so you always stretch and then
crochet

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.259 

if<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.739> think<00:03:44.069> that<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:44.669> have<00:03:44.909> enough

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
if you think that you have enough

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.319 
if you think that you have enough
stitches<00:03:46.010> make<00:03:47.010> sure<00:03:47.040> they<00:03:47.700> are<00:03:47.819> not<00:03:48.120> twisted

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
stitches make sure they are not twisted

00:03:50.329 --> 00:04:01.280 
stitches make sure they are not twisted
so<00:03:51.329> we<00:03:51.569> have<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.959> untwist<00:03:52.650> them<00:03:59.840> yeah<00:04:00.840> this

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
so we have to untwist them yeah this

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.619 
so we have to untwist them yeah this
looks<00:04:01.560> good<00:04:02.209> so<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.479> then<00:04:04.010> we<00:04:05.010> join<00:04:05.629> this

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
looks good so and then we join this

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.240 
looks good so and then we join this
round<00:04:08.840> tighten<00:04:09.840> this<00:04:10.019> stitch<00:04:10.409> and<00:04:10.769> then<00:04:10.799> I<00:04:11.040> go

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
round tighten this stitch and then I go

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.250 
round tighten this stitch and then I go
