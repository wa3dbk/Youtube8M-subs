more than paper for an orange peel you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.220 
more than paper for an orange peel you
can't<00:02:25.440> fold<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.460> twice<00:02:26.640> like<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.330> like

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
can't fold it twice like this like

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.310 
can't fold it twice like this like
what's<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.590> piece<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:28.860> paper<00:02:29.300> because<00:02:30.320> the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
what's the piece of paper because the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.410 
what's the piece of paper because the
orange<00:02:31.620> peel<00:02:31.890> rips<00:02:32.220> in<00:02:32.430> half<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:34.790> if<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:36.180> rips

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
orange peel rips in half and if it rips

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.820 
orange peel rips in half and if it rips
in<00:02:36.540> half<00:02:36.630> you're<00:02:36.930> not<00:02:37.050> gonna<00:02:37.200> launch<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.680> so

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
in half you're not gonna launch it so

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.830 
in half you're not gonna launch it so
what<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.100> need<00:02:38.220> for<00:02:38.400> an<00:02:38.490> orange<00:02:38.730> peel<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.150> you

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
what you need for an orange peel is you

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.290 
what you need for an orange peel is you
get<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.170> with<00:02:40.380> only<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:40.950> strand<00:02:41.370> instead<00:02:42.150> of

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
get it with only one strand instead of

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.600 
get it with only one strand instead of
both<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.780> them<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.040> get<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.430> like<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:46.610> you

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
both of them so you get it like this you

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.720 
both of them so you get it like this you
pull<00:02:47.940> back<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.690> let<00:02:49.230> go<00:02:49.410> all<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.610> one

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
pull back and you let go all that one

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.910 
pull back and you let go all that one
backfired<00:02:50.910> but<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.290> get<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.620> with<00:02:52.710> one

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
backfired but so you get it with one

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.200 
backfired but so you get it with one
piece<00:02:53.240> pull<00:02:54.240> it<00:02:54.360> back<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:54.960> let<00:02:55.380> go<00:02:56.210> this

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
piece pull it back and you let go this

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.030 
piece pull it back and you let go this
actually<00:02:57.690> hurts<00:02:57.840> but<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.350> takes<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.650> longer

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
actually hurts but it takes a longer

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.000 
actually hurts but it takes a longer
time<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.340> master<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.780> would<00:03:01.080> suggest<00:03:01.440> you

practice like your aim what you can do

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.720 
practice like your aim what you can do
is<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:15.960> can<00:03:16.080> just<00:03:16.140> set<00:03:16.500> up<00:03:16.620> one<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.310> these<00:03:17.430> a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
is you can just set up one of these a

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.110 
is you can just set up one of these a
little<00:03:21.170> backboard<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:23.220> then<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.910> get

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
little backboard so and then you get

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.670 
little backboard so and then you get
some<00:03:24.450> water<00:03:25.250> just<00:03:26.250> water<00:03:26.460> in<00:03:26.730> there<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.680> you

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
some water just water in there and you

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.560 
some water just water in there and you
just<00:03:28.710> slightly<00:03:29.430> dip<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.090> tip<00:03:30.270> of<00:03:30.450> your<00:03:30.510> paper

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
just slightly dip the tip of your paper

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.240 
just slightly dip the tip of your paper
so<00:03:33.570> when<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.230> shoot<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.800> could<00:03:34.980> tell

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
so when you shoot it you could tell

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:43.040 
so when you shoot it you could tell
where<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:36.360> hit<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:38.970> load<00:03:39.300> it<00:03:41.660> all<00:03:42.660> right<00:03:42.870> so

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
where it hit so you load it all right so

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.770 
where it hit so you load it all right so
this<00:03:43.200> one<00:03:43.820> it's<00:03:44.820> not<00:03:45.000> sure<00:03:45.240> if<00:03:45.330> you<00:03:45.420> guys<00:03:45.540> can

you keep using the same piece of paper
and<00:03:57.570> you<00:03:57.660> keep<00:03:57.810> wetting<00:03:58.110> it<00:03:58.410> then<00:03:58.920> it's

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
and you keep wetting it then it's

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.720 
and you keep wetting it then it's

lead<00:04:40.860> pencil<00:04:41.250> gun<00:04:41.430> that<00:04:41.699> i<00:04:41.789> said<00:04:42.000> in<00:04:42.090> the

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
lead pencil gun that i said in the

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.360 
lead pencil gun that i said in the
beginning<00:04:42.330> so<00:04:43.289> i<00:04:43.319> have<00:04:43.620> videos<00:04:43.949> on<00:04:44.130> how<00:04:44.310> to

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
beginning so i have videos on how to

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.460 
beginning so i have videos on how to
make<00:04:44.580> those<00:04:44.819> and<00:04:45.150> how<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.300> solve<00:04:45.539> them<00:04:45.660> so<00:04:46.349> go

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
make those and how to solve them so go

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.600 
make those and how to solve them so go
check<00:04:46.710> them<00:04:46.860> out<00:04:46.979> if<00:04:47.190> you<00:04:47.280> guys<00:04:47.400> are
