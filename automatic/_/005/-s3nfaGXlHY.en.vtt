explain<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:23.000> dollar<00:02:23.180> sign<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.720> have<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:23.930> little

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
explain the dollar sign I have a little

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.020 
explain the dollar sign I have a little
bit<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.500> theory<00:02:24.739> behind<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.220> but<00:02:25.489> moving<00:02:25.910> to

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
bit of a theory behind it but moving to

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.479 
bit of a theory behind it but moving to
the<00:02:26.120> next<00:02:26.329> tweet<00:02:26.690> we<00:02:27.140> have<00:02:27.320> a<00:02:27.350> play<00:02:27.829> a<00:02:27.860> stop<00:02:28.340> and

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
the next tweet we have a play a stop and

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.159 
the next tweet we have a play a stop and
a<00:02:28.549> play<00:02:28.760> button<00:02:28.970> or<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.180> fast<00:02:29.390> forward<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.959> guess

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:30.169 
a play button or a fast forward I guess

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:31.599 
a play button or a fast forward I guess
more<00:02:30.410> like<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.650> fast<00:02:30.889> forward<00:02:31.220> button<00:02:31.370> it's

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
more like a fast forward button it's

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.039

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
kinks in it that they claimed said I

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.660

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
slowed down the game and made it lag a

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.310 
slowed down the game and made it lag a
little<00:03:44.060> bit<00:03:44.180> which<00:03:44.360> I'm<00:03:44.540> not<00:03:44.750> under<00:03:45.050> wasn't

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
little bit which I'm not under wasn't

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.780 
little bit which I'm not under wasn't
sure<00:03:45.560> on<00:03:45.590> that<00:03:45.830> I<00:03:46.100> don't<00:03:46.280> really<00:03:46.370> know<00:03:46.580> if<00:03:46.640> that
