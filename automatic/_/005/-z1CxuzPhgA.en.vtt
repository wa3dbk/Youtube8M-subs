00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.289 
compare her to Kristen Stewart from
twigs<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.489> think<00:02:37.640> it's<00:02:37.730> two<00:02:37.879> totally<00:02:38.239> different

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
twigs I think it's two totally different

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.349 
twigs I think it's two totally different
kind<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.780> roles<00:02:39.019> um<00:02:39.650> she<00:02:40.280> won<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.790> personality

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
kind of roles um she won a personality

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.569 
kind of roles um she won a personality
and<00:02:41.720> one<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.019> dead<00:02:42.260> she<00:02:42.680> can<00:02:42.859> carry<00:02:43.250> this

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
and one is dead she can carry this

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.720 
and one is dead she can carry this
franchise<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:45.290> film<00:02:45.620> can<00:02:46.220> if<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.459> film

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
franchise if the film can if the film

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.789 
franchise if the film can if the film
overall<00:02:47.090> quality<00:02:47.480> can<00:02:47.870> improve<00:02:48.230> then<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.530> think

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
overall quality can improve then I think

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.050 
overall quality can improve then I think
that<00:02:48.890> she<00:02:49.040> can<00:02:49.190> be<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.430> leader<00:02:49.609> of<00:02:49.730> this<00:02:49.819> and

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
that she can be the leader of this and

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.789 
that she can be the leader of this and
