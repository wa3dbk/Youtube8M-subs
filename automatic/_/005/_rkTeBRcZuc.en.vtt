00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.250 
twenty six stitches and after casting on
you<00:00:16.440> start<00:00:16.770> with<00:00:17.130> five<00:00:18.119> rows<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.630> reverse

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
you start with five rows of reverse

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.450

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
which means you purl the right side so

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.990 
which means you purl the right side so
purl<00:00:28.019> stitches<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.920> right<00:00:29.099> side<00:00:29.429> only<00:00:29.730> and
