 the company announced under van marwijk 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.029
 nevertheless the rabobank remains 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.819
 it could have something to do with keeping this story 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.369
 now I am the best listened to, the channel is really on 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.170
 unfortunately road safety swov 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.230
 these last parts are being processed 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.830
 He says that he himself has a nice weather 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.830
 anyway some nice things are out in one place 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 after 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.040
 it then becomes work 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.380

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.910
 the jaw 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.980
 nevertheless he thinks it is entering the field in this match 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.530
 the union also wants thieves to be thieves 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.020
 that's it then 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.930
 that's pure coincidence 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.030
 that was downstairs 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.790
 in the event of a tie 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.340
 on the envelope 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.040

 another country 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.700

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.940
 the order 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.550

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.239

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.629
 it examines the collision witnesses is asked who 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.019
 but you also have to be nice, but that is the only one that is piling up 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.899
 then the cities beat me like breda de stopera that I marco 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:26.849

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.049
 there is criticism 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.619
