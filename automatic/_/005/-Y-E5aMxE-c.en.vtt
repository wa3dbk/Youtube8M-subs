is something that nobody's talked about
and<00:02:16.920> we're<00:02:17.459> in<00:02:17.550> 4k<00:02:18.090> 100<00:02:18.630> megabits<00:02:19.020> per<00:02:19.080> second

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
and we're in 4k 100 megabits per second

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.510 
and we're in 4k 100 megabits per second
what<00:02:19.740> I'm<00:02:19.800> going<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.950> do<00:02:20.069> is<00:02:20.160> I'm<00:02:20.250> going<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.430> go

ahead<00:02:20.550> i'm<00:02:20.819> going<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.060> zoom<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.600> all<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.050> way

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
ahead i'm going to zoom this all the way

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.559 
ahead i'm going to zoom this all the way
in<00:02:22.500> now<00:02:23.459> what<00:02:23.700> we're<00:02:23.910> doing<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.270> we're<00:02:24.480> in

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
in now what we're doing is we're in

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.710 
in now what we're doing is we're in
Clear<00:02:24.900> Image<00:02:25.020> Zoom<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:26.670> we're<00:02:26.880> maximum<00:02:27.569> at

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
Clear Image Zoom so we're maximum at

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.309 
Clear Image Zoom so we're maximum at
Clear<00:02:27.959> Image<00:02:27.989> Zoom<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:31.220> we<00:02:32.569> should<00:02:33.569> have<00:02:33.810> lost

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
Clear Image Zoom and we should have lost

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.920 
Clear Image Zoom and we should have lost
a<00:02:34.620> little<00:02:34.860> bit<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.069> resolution<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.420> take<00:02:36.900> a

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
a little bit of resolution so take a

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.750 
a little bit of resolution so take a
look<00:02:37.230> at<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.470> images<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:39.320> go<00:02:40.320> up<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.860> Hat

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.160 

and<00:02:44.760> Sony's<00:02:45.180> done<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.330> great<00:02:45.630> job<00:02:45.660> with<00:02:45.930> this

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
and Sony's done a great job with this

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.220 
and Sony's done a great job with this
clear<00:02:46.470> image<00:02:46.739> zoom<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.750> my<00:02:48.930> first

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
clear image zoom so this is my first

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.280 
clear image zoom so this is my first
time<00:02:49.440> taking<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.920> look<00:02:50.100> at<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.050> can<00:02:52.170> see

time taking a look at it so you can see

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.949 
time taking a look at it so you can see
from<00:02:52.410> those<00:02:52.620> samples<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:54.540> looks<00:02:54.750> pretty

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
from those samples that it looks pretty

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.479 
from those samples that it looks pretty
good<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.739> know<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:56.010> looks<00:02:56.160> pretty<00:02:56.400> good

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
they'll be more samples daylight samples

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.920

on the wall you know the video that the
camera<00:03:06.269> looks<00:03:06.510> pretty<00:03:06.810> good<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.200> know<00:03:07.230> you

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
camera looks pretty good you know you

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.380 
camera looks pretty good you know you
can<00:03:07.560> make<00:03:07.769> your<00:03:07.890> own<00:03:07.950> judgment<00:03:08.280> on<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.760> but

can make your own judgment on it but
it's<00:03:09.420> pretty<00:03:09.780> cool<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.430> one<00:03:11.430> other<00:03:11.459> little

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
it's pretty cool and one other little

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.509 
it's pretty cool and one other little
hidden<00:03:12.030> feature<00:03:12.360> here<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:13.680> does<00:03:13.980> have<00:03:14.220> this

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
hidden feature here is it does have this

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.000 
hidden feature here is it does have this
you<00:03:15.239> can<00:03:15.390> see<00:03:15.570> here<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.900> finders<00:03:16.320> mechanical

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
you can see here the finders mechanical

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.610 
you can see here the finders mechanical
you<00:03:17.579> turn<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:18.000> like<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.750> also<00:03:19.049> turns<00:03:19.410> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
you turn it like that it also turns the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.220 
you turn it like that it also turns the
camera<00:03:19.799> on<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.640> then<00:03:21.360> all<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:21.690> have<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:22.019> do

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
camera on and then all you have to do

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.170 
camera on and then all you have to do
kind<00:03:22.799> of<00:03:22.829> hard<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.070> do<00:03:23.280> one-handed<00:03:23.670> but<00:03:24.060> you

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
kind of hard to do one-handed but you

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.970 
kind of hard to do one-handed but you
can<00:03:24.329> pull<00:03:24.660> out<00:03:24.870> this<00:03:26.209> this<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:27.980> viewfinder

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
can pull out this this this viewfinder

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.240 
can pull out this this this viewfinder
so<00:03:29.489> now<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:30.120> viewfinder<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:30.720> engaged<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.860> has

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
so now the viewfinder is engaged it has

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.810 
so now the viewfinder is engaged it has
a<00:03:32.299> corrective<00:03:33.299> diopter<00:03:33.810> on<00:03:33.989> here<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.820> believe

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
a corrective diopter on here I believe

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.960 
a corrective diopter on here I believe
it's<00:03:36.030> like<00:03:36.269> minus<00:03:37.260> three<00:03:37.739> or<00:03:38.070> plus<00:03:38.340> three<00:03:38.730> I

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
it's like minus three or plus three I

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.509 
it's like minus three or plus three I
don't<00:03:39.690> have<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.900> exact<00:03:40.290> specs<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:40.799> but

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
don't have the exact specs on that but

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.729 
don't have the exact specs on that but
if<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:42.030> wear<00:03:42.180> glasses<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.900> lot<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.440> times<00:03:43.650> you

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
if you wear glasses a lot of times you

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.530 
if you wear glasses a lot of times you
can<00:03:43.799> adjust<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:45.150> can<00:03:45.329> look<00:03:45.480> through

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
can adjust this so you can look through

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.180 
can adjust this so you can look through
that<00:03:45.720> viewfinder<00:03:46.290> because<00:03:46.440> kind<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:46.950> hard<00:03:47.160> to

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
that viewfinder because kind of hard to

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.380 
that viewfinder because kind of hard to
look<00:03:47.370> through<00:03:47.549> a<00:03:47.610> little<00:03:47.820> viewfinder<00:03:48.000> like

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
look through a little viewfinder like

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.080 
look through a little viewfinder like
this<00:03:48.540> with<00:03:48.720> glasses<00:03:48.989> but<00:03:49.950> when<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.640> have<00:03:50.940> it

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
this with glasses but when I have it

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.090 
this with glasses but when I have it
kind<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.540> over<00:03:51.810> on<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.109> end<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.530> works<00:03:52.709> for<00:03:52.920> me

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
kind of over on this end it works for me

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.960 
kind of over on this end it works for me
so<00:03:54.060> anyway<00:03:54.480> um<00:03:54.769> but<00:03:55.769> you<00:03:56.400> can<00:03:56.519> see<00:03:56.700> from<00:03:56.760> those

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
so anyway um but you can see from those

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.550 
so anyway um but you can see from those
video<00:03:57.209> samples<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:57.810> this<00:03:58.079> is<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.290> pretty

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
video samples that this is a pretty

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.870 
video samples that this is a pretty
little<00:03:58.859> camera<00:03:59.070> you<00:03:59.310> can<00:03:59.340> see<00:03:59.579> it's<00:03:59.700> pretty

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
little camera you can see it's pretty

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.090 
little camera you can see it's pretty
tiny<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.870> know<00:04:00.959> even<00:04:01.109> with<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.410> lens<00:04:01.590> erected

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
tiny you know even with the lens erected

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.610 
tiny you know even with the lens erected
you<00:04:02.250> can<00:04:02.400> see<00:04:02.549> in<00:04:02.670> my<00:04:02.700> hand<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.840> pretty<00:04:04.170> small

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
you can see in my hand is a pretty small

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.400 
you can see in my hand is a pretty small
little<00:04:05.010> camera<00:04:05.519> so<00:04:06.480> we'll<00:04:06.840> take<00:04:06.989> another<00:04:07.019> look

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
little camera so we'll take another look

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.470 
little camera so we'll take another look
at<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.650> videos<00:04:07.950> again<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:09.060> like<00:04:09.150> I<00:04:09.209> said<00:04:09.329> we

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
at the videos again and like I said we

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.830 
at the videos again and like I said we
are<00:04:09.660> still<00:04:10.019> in<00:04:10.170> Clear<00:04:10.410> Image<00:04:10.440> Zoom<00:04:11.690> so<00:04:12.690> we're

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
are still in Clear Image Zoom so we're

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.940 
are still in Clear Image Zoom so we're
looking<00:04:12.959> at<00:04:13.200> everything<00:04:13.440> in<00:04:13.680> Clear<00:04:13.920> Image

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
looking at everything in Clear Image

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.289 
looking at everything in Clear Image
Zoom

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.789 

and<00:04:18.299> I'm<00:04:18.390> going<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.570> pull<00:04:18.840> back<00:04:19.049> again<00:04:19.500> I'm

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
and I'm going to pull back again I'm

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.340 
and I'm going to pull back again I'm
going<00:04:19.890> to<00:04:19.950> take<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.310> out<00:04:20.489> of<00:04:20.519> Clear<00:04:20.850> Image<00:04:20.880> Zoom

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
going to take it out of Clear Image Zoom

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.090 
going to take it out of Clear Image Zoom
so<00:04:22.850> right<00:04:23.850> now<00:04:23.880> we<00:04:24.840> are<00:04:25.050> out<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:25.650> Clear<00:04:26.070> Image

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
so right now we are out of Clear Image

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.710 
so right now we are out of Clear Image
Zoom<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:27.270> this<00:04:27.540> is<00:04:28.160> just<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.400> maximum<00:04:30.090> on<00:04:30.390> the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
Zoom so this is just the maximum on the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.030 
Zoom so this is just the maximum on the
lens<00:04:30.960> itself<00:04:31.110> no<00:04:31.890> clear<00:04:32.280> image<00:04:32.520> zoom<00:04:32.730> so<00:04:32.940> 4k

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
lens itself no clear image zoom so 4k

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.880 
lens itself no clear image zoom so 4k
24p<00:04:35.040> hundred<00:04:35.400> megabits<00:04:35.730> per<00:04:35.790> second<00:04:36.260> and<00:04:37.260> it

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
24p hundred megabits per second and it

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.480 
24p hundred megabits per second and it
will<00:04:37.980> take<00:04:38.130> a<00:04:38.160> look<00:04:38.400> at<00:04:38.550> that<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:40.490> obviously

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
will take a look at that and obviously

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.030 
will take a look at that and obviously
it<00:04:42.060> should<00:04:42.420> look<00:04:42.630> a<00:04:42.750> little<00:04:42.900> softer<00:04:43.530> when<00:04:43.800> we

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
it should look a little softer when we

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.530 
it should look a little softer when we
were<00:04:44.190> in<00:04:44.340> using<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.060> Clear<00:04:45.270> Image<00:04:45.300> Zoom

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
were in using the Clear Image Zoom

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.380 
were in using the Clear Image Zoom
because<00:04:46.080> you<00:04:46.710> know<00:04:46.830> we<00:04:47.130> are<00:04:47.240> there<00:04:48.240> is<00:04:48.360> a

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
because you know we are there is a

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.170 
because you know we are there is a
little<00:04:48.690> bit<00:04:48.780> of<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.960> crop<00:04:49.290> on<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.590> sensor<00:04:50.180> to

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
little bit of a crop on the sensor to

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.690 
little bit of a crop on the sensor to
make<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.540> work<00:04:51.600> but<00:04:52.170> like<00:04:52.830> I<00:04:52.860> say<00:04:53.160> on<00:04:53.430> my

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
make that work but like I say on my

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.960 
make that work but like I say on my
monitor<00:04:54.000> it's<00:04:54.510> looking<00:04:54.900> really<00:04:55.200> clean<00:04:56.660> so<00:04:57.660> but

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
monitor it's looking really clean so but

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
you know have to go over the images

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.740 
you know have to go over the images
really<00:05:01.410> take<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.620> look<00:05:01.860> at<00:05:01.980> them<00:05:02.160> so<00:05:02.660> like<00:05:03.660> I
