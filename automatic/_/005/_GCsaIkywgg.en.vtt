that<00:02:13.250> aiming<00:02:13.849> point<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.300> can<00:02:14.450> see<00:02:14.659> here<00:02:14.959> and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
that aiming point you can see here and

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.240 
that aiming point you can see here and
one<00:02:15.140> thing<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.379> talked<00:02:15.620> during<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.950> little<00:02:16.099> bit

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
one thing I talked during a little bit

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.640 
one thing I talked during a little bit
is<00:02:16.489> wear<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.819> hair<00:02:17.060> bit<00:02:17.300> left<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:18.140> center<00:02:18.440> line

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
is wear a hair bit left of center line

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.380 
is wear a hair bit left of center line
then<00:02:18.980> right<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.400> center<00:02:19.670> line<00:02:19.819> we're<00:02:19.970> kind<00:02:20.239> of

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
then right of center line we're kind of

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.510 
then right of center line we're kind of
making<00:02:21.019> s<00:02:21.230> turns<00:02:21.560> out<00:02:21.800> here<00:02:21.980> on<00:02:22.069> final<00:02:22.460> I

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.340 
making s turns out here on final I
really<00:02:22.760> wanted<00:02:23.060> him<00:02:23.210> to<00:02:23.240> get<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.720> honed<00:02:24.080> in

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
really wanted him to get that honed in

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.600 
really wanted him to get that honed in

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
it

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.640 
it
starting<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.030> bring<00:02:25.210> that<00:02:25.330> in<00:02:25.480> here<00:02:25.750> but<00:02:25.900> the

starting to bring that in here but the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.900 
starting to bring that in here but the
one<00:02:26.830> thing<00:02:27.040> I'm<00:02:27.160> telling<00:02:27.400> them<00:02:27.670> throughout

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
one thing I'm telling them throughout

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.240 
one thing I'm telling them throughout
this<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.360> hey<00:02:28.480> fix<00:02:28.840> your<00:02:29.080> eyes<00:02:29.260> on<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.710> point

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
this is hey fix your eyes on that point

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.400 
this is hey fix your eyes on that point
we<00:02:30.670> are<00:02:30.700> watching<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.510> beginning<00:02:31.660> of<00:02:32.200> that

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
we are watching the beginning of that

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.560 
we are watching the beginning of that
second<00:02:32.950> satellite<00:02:33.160> strike<00:02:33.580> aiming<00:02:34.240> for<00:02:34.420> it

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
second satellite strike aiming for it

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.020 
second satellite strike aiming for it
and<00:02:34.810> knowing<00:02:35.050> we're<00:02:35.320> gonna<00:02:35.470> float<00:02:35.980> just<00:02:36.730> a

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
and knowing we're gonna float just a

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.510 
and knowing we're gonna float just a
little<00:02:37.390> bit<00:02:37.600> we're<00:02:38.440> clearing<00:02:38.770> our<00:02:38.950> obstacles

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
little bit we're clearing our obstacles

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.040 
little bit we're clearing our obstacles
we've<00:02:39.910> established<00:02:40.090> we're<00:02:40.690> clear<00:02:40.930> this

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
we've established we're clear this

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.450 
we've established we're clear this
obstacle<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.710> can<00:02:41.800> see<00:02:41.950> Darren's<00:02:42.280> just

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
obstacle so you can see Darren's just

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.670 
obstacle so you can see Darren's just
smoothly<00:02:42.790> bringing<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:43.390> power<00:02:43.660> all<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.650> way

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
smoothly bringing that power all the way

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.190 
smoothly bringing that power all the way
back<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.280> idle<00:02:45.730> now<00:02:46.240> that<00:02:46.480> we<00:02:46.600> know<00:02:46.870> we've

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
back to idle now that we know we've

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.290 
back to idle now that we know we've
actually<00:02:47.470> got<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.190> runway<00:02:48.640> made<00:02:48.910> as<00:02:49.120> we're

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
actually got that runway made as we're

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.840 
actually got that runway made as we're
now<00:02:49.360> crossing<00:02:49.840> over<00:02:50.080> this<00:02:50.170> little<00:02:50.500> bit<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:51.459> the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
now crossing over this little bit of the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.420 
now crossing over this little bit of the
bay<00:02:52.030> here<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:53.560> we're<00:02:53.709> got<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:54.070> power<00:02:54.250> back

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
bay here so we're got that power back

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.390 
bay here so we're got that power back
we're<00:02:55.150> looking<00:02:55.570> at<00:02:55.780> our<00:02:56.020> aiming<00:02:56.590> point<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.100> we

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
we're looking at our aiming point and we

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.970 
we're looking at our aiming point and we
are<00:02:57.430> just<00:02:57.790> smoothly<00:02:58.330> bringing<00:02:59.110> that<00:02:59.290> airplane

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
are just smoothly bringing that airplane

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.770 
are just smoothly bringing that airplane
on<00:03:00.220> in<00:03:01.060> over<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.020> displaced<00:03:02.500> threshold<00:03:02.830> and

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
on in over the displaced threshold and

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.720 
on in over the displaced threshold and
just<00:03:04.780> smoothly<00:03:05.200> transition<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.340> nose<00:03:06.700> to

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
just smoothly transition that nose to

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.660 
just smoothly transition that nose to
level<00:03:07.600> flight<00:03:08.170> trying<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.470> flight<00:03:08.650> level<00:03:08.680> down

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
level flight trying to flight level down

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.490 
level flight trying to flight level down
the<00:03:10.030> runway<00:03:10.330> we<00:03:10.420> get<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.570> little<00:03:10.870> bit<00:03:11.020> left<00:03:11.320> of

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
the runway we get a little bit left of

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.229 
the runway we get a little bit left of
center<00:03:11.890> line<00:03:12.100> here<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.580> then<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:13.000> kind<00:03:13.180> of

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
center line here and then you kind of

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.400 
center line here and then you kind of
over<00:03:13.540> corrects<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.989> little<00:03:14.170> bit<00:03:14.260> with<00:03:14.380> some

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
over corrects a little bit with some

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.080 
over corrects a little bit with some
rudder<00:03:14.770> we<00:03:15.040> actually<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.400> can<00:03:15.520> see<00:03:15.670> touched<00:03:15.940> a

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
rudder we actually you can see touched a

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.940 
rudder we actually you can see touched a
little<00:03:16.209> bit<00:03:16.330> right<00:03:16.600> of<00:03:16.660> center<00:03:17.140> line<00:03:17.350> but

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
little bit right of center line but

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.790 
little bit right of center line but
overall<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.760> decent<00:03:19.239> approach<00:03:20.230> some<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.620> things

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
overall a decent approach some of things

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.590 
overall a decent approach some of things
I<00:03:21.040> would<00:03:21.220> have<00:03:21.250> fine-tuned<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:21.910> worked<00:03:22.239> on<00:03:22.420> I

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
I would have fine-tuned to worked on I

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.080 
I would have fine-tuned to worked on I
like<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.410> nice<00:03:23.680> stable<00:03:24.100> approach<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.820> don't<00:03:24.970> like

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
like a nice stable approach I don't like

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.670 
like a nice stable approach I don't like
all<00:03:25.270> that<00:03:25.390> s<00:03:25.570> turn<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:25.989> swinging<00:03:26.320> out<00:03:26.500> there

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
all that s turn and swinging out there

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.800 
all that s turn and swinging out there
and<00:03:26.800> final<00:03:27.100> I<00:03:27.250> want<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.730> nice<00:03:27.880> stable<00:03:28.270> approach

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
and final I want a nice stable approach

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.440 
and final I want a nice stable approach
