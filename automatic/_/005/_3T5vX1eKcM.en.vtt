00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
could kind of guess as to what they

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.770 
could kind of guess as to what they
wanted<00:04:03.990> to<00:04:04.110> do<00:04:04.640> and<00:04:05.640> then<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.090> know<00:04:06.210> up<00:04:06.510> again

wanted to do and then you know up again

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.360 
wanted to do and then you know up again
after<00:04:07.050> a<00:04:07.080> while<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.440> became<00:04:07.680> familiar<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:08.220> mean

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
after a while it became familiar I mean

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.710 
after a while it became familiar I mean
for<00:04:08.520> me<00:04:08.730> it's<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.910> little<00:04:08.970> bit<00:04:09.150> more<00:04:09.270> difficult

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
for me it's a little bit more difficult

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.270 
for me it's a little bit more difficult
because<00:04:09.780> we<00:04:10.110> drive<00:04:10.320> never<00:04:10.560> started<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:10.920> road<00:04:11.100> in

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
because we drive never started a road in

because we drive never started a road in
London<00:04:11.580> as<00:04:11.700> loss<00:04:11.880> after<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.570> take<00:04:13.230> that<00:04:13.380> into

London as loss after and take that into

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.650 
London as loss after and take that into
consideration<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:14.730> also<00:04:15.030> acutely<00:04:15.360> is<00:04:15.480> on<00:04:15.570> the

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
consideration and also acutely is on the

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:18.990 
and that was a little bit more difficult

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.540
