00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
ago I'm actually no I didn't lose it it

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.259 
ago I'm actually no I didn't lose it it
just<00:04:12.709> broke<00:04:12.979> and<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.579> doesn't<00:04:13.879> work<00:04:14.060> at<00:04:14.209> all

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
just broke and it doesn't work at all

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.420 
just broke and it doesn't work at all
like<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:14.959> doesn't<00:04:15.229> work<00:04:15.349> anywhere<00:04:15.799> but<00:04:15.979> an<00:04:16.099> ATM

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
like it doesn't work anywhere but an ATM

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.560 
like it doesn't work anywhere but an ATM
it<00:04:16.639> doesn't<00:04:16.880> it<00:04:17.000> doesn't<00:04:17.150> make<00:04:17.299> sense<00:04:17.329> it

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
it doesn't it doesn't make sense it

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.000 
it doesn't it doesn't make sense it
doesn't<00:04:17.720> work<00:04:17.870> online<00:04:18.019> it<00:04:18.500> isn't<00:04:18.859> working

anyway<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:19.669> I<00:04:19.699> guess<00:04:20.150> my<00:04:20.299> insurance<00:04:20.780> can<00:04:21.169> told

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
anyway so I guess my insurance can told

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.230 
anyway so I guess my insurance can told
my<00:04:21.560> theme<00:04:21.769> they<00:04:22.010> didn't<00:04:22.280> decide<00:04:22.729> to<00:04:22.880> call<00:04:23.090> me

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
my theme they didn't decide to call me

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.020 
my theme they didn't decide to call me
at<00:04:23.539> all<00:04:23.780> they<00:04:24.380> decided<00:04:24.770> to<00:04:24.800> cancel<00:04:25.220> it<00:04:25.520> that's

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
at all they decided to cancel it that's

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.629 
at all they decided to cancel it that's
pretty<00:04:26.240> cool<00:04:26.479> so<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.289> waited<00:04:27.830> for<00:04:28.220> like<00:04:28.340> four

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
pretty cool so I waited for like four

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.719 
pretty cool so I waited for like four
hours<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:30.050> get<00:04:30.860> told<00:04:31.099> that<00:04:31.220> I<00:04:31.310> don't<00:04:31.520> even<00:04:31.610> have
