we don't really say an app is bad we let

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.330 
we don't really say an app is bad we let
it<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> side<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.560> physicist<00:01:14.070> so

for<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.890> make<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> decision<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.700> maybe

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
for you to make a decision and maybe

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.249 
for you to make a decision and maybe
it's<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:20.369> could<00:01:20.640> change<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.939> world<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.570> how

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it's it could change the world in how

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.960 
it's it could change the world in how
and<00:01:22.470> why<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.369> enough<00:01:23.700> users

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and why it's because if enough users

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.999 
and why it's because if enough users
think<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.630> an<00:01:24.780> app<00:01:24.960> should<00:01:25.229> not<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.799> access

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
think that an app should not have access

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.580 
think that an app should not have access
to<00:01:26.340> certain<00:01:27.119> kind<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.479> information<00:01:28.080> maybe

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
to certain kind of information maybe

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.590 
to certain kind of information maybe
they<00:01:28.860> will<00:01:28.979> make<00:01:29.549> changes<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> system<00:01:30.509> of

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
they will make changes in the system of

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.510 
they will make changes in the system of
the<00:01:30.720> way<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.079> abs<00:01:31.350> get<00:01:31.619> developed<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.250> such<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the way that abs get developed in such a

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.090 
the way that abs get developed in such a
way<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.759> developers<00:01:33.360> would<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:34.110> hiding

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
way that developers would not be hiding

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.399 
way that developers would not be hiding
this<00:01:35.369> information<00:01:35.430> from<00:01:36.119> users<00:01:36.360> or<00:01:36.810> they'll

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
this information from users or they'll
