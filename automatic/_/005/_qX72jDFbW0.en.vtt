00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 and we are with 1 and 5 in this 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.330
 case we are playing a new career 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.880
 with subscribers and good guys we're going 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.139
 to do one lap I do not know exactly 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.570
 how it's going to be complicated but it was coming 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.279
 predetermined one lap and I've seen the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.529
 miniature and uf uf uf because it is a which 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.920
 raid of these that are like infinities is 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.310
 say where it starts ends so we go 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.779
 let's see let's see how we get san 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.480
 xian very difficult very complicated and so 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.520
 we got going through the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.590
 first that would be very very good a 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.530
 little bit perfect, we can fit at the moment 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.270
 well let's go there or was I passed this point 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.950
 challenges we are taking a great advantage 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.230
 that's fine although we're all going to 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.370
 find the same place but good the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.950
 if it's normal, let's go 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.329
 getting better start we do not have what 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.309
 We more or less believe it 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.320
 you have to climb up inside the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.810
 Montana 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.170
 it's quite the car can not be very 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.910
 fast you have to be careful you have to go 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.150
 carefully here 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.720
 we take this jump worth 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.580
 to see if the car 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.060
 that I doubt enough here you to me 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.360
 falls off 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.220
 that is complicated the less you cojones 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.950
 or because they bathe all the time 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.979
 The good thing is to live all the time 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.899
 fast and if there is somewhere 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.620
 Well I hope that time was so 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.460
 Quick, give me some advantage 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.590
 OK 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:40.230
 OK 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:41.490
 and we're here this way over there and 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.230
 we have here a point we have there a 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.510
 point that this has to be 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.960
 close because we are already very high 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:54.100
 ok here is another point we are going to take it 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.150
 here you want to serve to get there 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.850
 my mother is going to make us at night 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:06.030
 climbing the mountain 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:08.820
 Ojito Ojito hello here and continue to 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.510
 first moments to me and to follow the 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.960
 line is that go there is no 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.810
 mountaineer today hey knew we were going to 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.260
 make a career and have said today not 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.240
 we are going to climb the mountain since there 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.160
 we have and what until then see you later 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.250
 do not work not work has arrived 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.640
 appear like this 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.550
 now I still step up because 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.010
 it's going to take safer so that's 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.390
 faster as I say today there is no 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.920
 mountaineer because as I knew we are going to 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.920
 come us then with ten milestones 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.690
 luxury of madryn and we are still going to 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.890
 run over insurance some will be bad 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.310
 people are actually going to leave them 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.940
 very well 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.220
 and will let live 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.220
 little wheaton vale 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.810
 and this is being more complicated than 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.239
 doubter up but maybe that 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.739
 I still do not give them much of an advantage 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.960
 the others except for one that I do not have here 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.320
 very close there is a missile because yes 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.670
 in that what was left over sir creator son 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.920
 My mother, I have you to follow me. 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.360
 around here of everything that I do I put is one 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.090
 on each side 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.600
 ok we have it here this is going to be a 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.520
 bit 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.680
 and I have for the first and first 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.659
 tried 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.459
 as it happens the first one is going to be mega 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.670
 epic the most and I'm going super 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:34.400
 convinced what happened the first of guys 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:37.750
 did not happen to the first one because of us 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.750
 I will not catch the point so 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.530
 do not 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.850
 mother mine kid first try what 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:50.750
 we went to the first one this is amazing 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.340
 incredible seriously amazing is that what 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.490
 I was imagining is that its time in tone 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.200
 seriously I do not know very well if with him in you 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.760
 also and it is also but when I have 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.280
 caught antithesis to walk drive 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.020
 I did not choose it too with the center 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.670
 not in the center not lately I'm 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.470
 catching a lot for the white lies and 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.840
 for the races and I'm going super 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.720
 super good since the t20 and the signs 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.390
 I have them but they have told me that the t20 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.579
 mind you saw me that the mind is going 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:21.129
 super super good for racing worth 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.389
 for nothing one day to turn it over there 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:24.520
 we have it 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.960
 but since I do not get the money or 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.800
 nor the level to have it to the maximum 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.229
 so together with this stroller 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.699
 is what I say I'm more taken in his 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.379
 life in going down that in what is the 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.110
 race that is what is the best guard 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.580
 said my mother anything someone days for 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.870
 go down 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:48.729
 ok we're good 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:53.939
 we are going down the line you this is super 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.939
 110 to lower 110 to reach the goal 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.880
 Ojito, we do not have a mother of mine. 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.009
 molado this same root let's see if 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.240
 some will be passed if they are still up there 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.889
 but I think some he has had to 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.080
 I'm super convinced 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.979
 a charge load screen is worth we go to 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.539
 see this vale 100 x well no no because 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.639
 he has to go with a lot of tact x 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.819
 giving it very short touches very little 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.000
 little bit little by little upwards up 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.120
 what 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.040
 It does well to see if not it 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.770
 as they give you very fast the car is going to 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.970
 go and it is not worth more complicated so 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.410
 the boys the truth that the race has 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.850
 talked a lot I hope caused too 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.530
 you liked it would be very much appreciated 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.670
 if you have videos subscribe where 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.510
 I'm to lose none and we do not see in 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.510
 the next goodbye
