00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.460
 it is very common to observe children 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.480
 that after having completed four years and stop using the seats of 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.649
 security 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:17.089
 that is something that happens is because many cases 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:22.409
 they have exceeded the weight and size allowed by conventional seats 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:27.649
 and they think like many parents who are already fit to wear the belts 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.649
 automobile safety 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.990
 and that's a mistake ' 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.320
 because its size is not yet adequate for such belts simply because 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.560
 the belts of the cars have been designed basically to accommodate 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.840
 the adults 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.520
 in the next video they will be able to see the difference between an adult and 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.550
 a young man who does not yet have the necessary size to be able to use 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.550
 correctly two belts that the car brings 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.760
 what we can observe 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.490
 is that the passenger on the left 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.620
 I should be using a woman 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.850
 as we do not realize 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.710
 just observing the way his neck is let's say attacked 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.710
 by the seatbelt 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460
 the images are quite clear 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.640
 imagine the damage that could inflict that seatbelt 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.950
 instead we see that the adult has a correctly placed belt 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.840
 and it passes right over the shoulder which is where it has to pass 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.090
 but this kind of problem 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.580
 it has a solution 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.420
 and that solution is given precisely by women 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.270
 the woman is a type of armchair 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.010
 that accommodates domain in such a way 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.340
 that the belts of the car serve to retain it without hurting it 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.100
 beyond the height offered by a firm of its own 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.520
 most of them come equipped with 20 7 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.909
 groove 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.909
 through which you have to pass the upper belt 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.469
 instead the lower zinc 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.469
 must go under the coasters 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:26.709
 in this way when placing the child this is correctly located 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:33.909
 In most cases 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.290
 the headrests are adjusted up and down 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:44.009
 allowing in this way to also regulate the position of the upper belt 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:52.069
 that's exactly how a child should be sitting on a buster 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.069
 with the belts well placed
