hmm they're all oxygen absorbers that's

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.900 
hmm they're all oxygen absorbers that's
right

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
right

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.630 
right
these<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.210> iron<00:00:54.510> filings<00:00:55.289> inside<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
these have iron filings inside with a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.729 
these have iron filings inside with a
mixture<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.180> salt<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.899> some<00:00:58.649> denatured<00:00:59.280> clay

although<00:01:01.739> all<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.280> stuff<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.760> there<00:01:02.879> does<00:01:03.120> is

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
although all that stuff in there does is

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.429 
although all that stuff in there does is
the<00:01:03.480> clay<00:01:03.690> holds<00:01:04.199> moisture<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:06.390> salt<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the clay holds moisture the salt and the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.840 
the clay holds moisture the salt and the
moisture<00:01:08.119> accelerate<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.360> rust<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.850> when

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
moisture accelerate the rust and when

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.880 
moisture accelerate the rust and when
the<00:01:12.000> iron<00:01:12.470> filings<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:14.040> these<00:01:14.250> little<00:01:14.430> things

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
the iron filings and these little things

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.140 
the iron filings and these little things
rust<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.450> turn<00:01:18.450> into<00:01:18.720> iron<00:01:19.049> oxide<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:20.850> is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
rust and turn into iron oxide that is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.289 
rust and turn into iron oxide that is
what<00:01:21.570> sucks<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.170> oxygen<00:01:22.200> out<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.630> air<00:01:26.299> and

what sucks the oxygen out of the air and

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.480 
what sucks the oxygen out of the air and
you<00:01:27.420> know<00:01:27.570> what<00:01:30.110> these<00:01:31.110> hot<00:01:31.409> hands<00:01:32.600> are

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
you know what these hot hands are

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.600 
you know what these hot hands are
super-sized<00:01:35.570> oxygen<00:01:36.570> absorbers<00:01:37.310> they<00:01:38.310> have

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
super-sized oxygen absorbers they have

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.100 
super-sized oxygen absorbers they have
the<00:01:38.820> exact<00:01:39.420> same<00:01:39.750> ingredients<00:01:41.450> as<00:01:42.649> these<00:01:45.110> so

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the exact same ingredients as these so

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.700 
the exact same ingredients as these so

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
mmm 89 cents for two that will do two

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.030 
mmm 89 cents for two that will do two
five-gallon<00:02:15.720> buckets<00:02:16.310> easily<00:02:17.310> easily<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:18.510> two

five-gallon buckets easily easily do two

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.160 
five-gallon buckets easily easily do two
five-gallon<00:02:20.040> buckets<00:02:20.690> now<00:02:21.690> why<00:02:21.900> have<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.140> got

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
five-gallon buckets now why have I got

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.990 
five-gallon buckets now why have I got
the<00:02:22.440> file<00:02:22.709> out<00:02:22.980> here<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.400> old<00:02:23.610> rusty<00:02:23.970> file

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
the file out here this old rusty file

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.110 
the file out here this old rusty file
basically<00:02:27.000> if<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.680> wanted<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.190> bust<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.700> up<00:02:29.910> in

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
basically if I wanted to bust this up in

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.960 
basically if I wanted to bust this up in
a<00:02:30.209> bunch<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.690> tiny<00:02:30.900> little<00:02:31.200> pieces<00:02:31.730> put<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.850> in

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
a bunch of tiny little pieces put it in

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.130 
a bunch of tiny little pieces put it in
a<00:02:33.060> cloth<00:02:33.330> bag

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
a cloth bag

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.850 
a cloth bag
well<00:02:35.130> first<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.000> want<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.330> wet<00:02:36.540> wet<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.620> file

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
well first you want to wet wet the file

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.630 
well first you want to wet wet the file
down<00:02:38.280> if<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.640> wet<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:39.030> down<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:40.310> then<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.430> put

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
down if you wet it down and then you put

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.690 
down if you wet it down and then you put
it<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:42.030> bag<00:02:42.780> full<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.350> salt<00:02:43.680> which<00:02:44.489> would

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
it in a bag full of salt which would

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.170 
it in a bag full of salt which would
cause<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.270> iron<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:46.110> rust<00:02:46.410> really<00:02:46.800> fast<00:02:47.180> you

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
cause the iron to rust really fast you

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.699 
cause the iron to rust really fast you
know<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.450> file<00:02:48.690> would<00:02:48.900> be<00:02:48.959> wet<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.500> then<00:02:49.680> you

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
know the file would be wet and then you

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.740 
know the file would be wet and then you
throw<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.130> salt<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.700> could<00:02:51.540> actually

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
throw it in the salt you could actually

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.880 
throw it in the salt you could actually
throw<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.500> in<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.800> bucket<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.739> would

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
throw that in the bucket and it would

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.340 
throw that in the bucket and it would
absorb<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.489> oxygen<00:02:57.060> in<00:02:57.180> there<00:02:57.360> although<00:02:57.630> it

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
absorb the oxygen in there although it

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.979 
absorb the oxygen in there although it
wouldn't<00:02:58.709> do<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:58.920> as<00:02:59.040> fast<00:02:59.370> as<00:02:59.730> these<00:03:00.540> because

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
wouldn't do it as fast as these because

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.350 
wouldn't do it as fast as these because
it<00:03:01.140> has<00:03:01.320> powder<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:02.040> all<00:03:02.760> right<00:03:03.000> these<00:03:03.150> have

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
it has powder that all right these have

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.479 
it has powder that all right these have
powdered<00:03:04.200> iron<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.800> them<00:03:04.920> they're<00:03:05.070> they're

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
powdered iron in them they're they're

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.710 
powdered iron in them they're they're
like<00:03:06.200> somebody<00:03:07.200> took<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:08.580> ground<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.450> all<00:03:09.600> up

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
like somebody took and ground it all up

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.259 
like somebody took and ground it all up
into<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.050> powder<00:03:10.350> it's<00:03:10.860> iron<00:03:11.190> powder<00:03:11.640> or<00:03:12.000> iron

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269

filings<00:03:13.140> in<00:03:13.350> these<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.799> then<00:03:14.610> they<00:03:14.760> add<00:03:14.910> salt

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
filings in these and then they add salt

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.830 
filings in these and then they add salt
to<00:03:15.570> it<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:17.400> other<00:03:17.850> thing<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.329> hold<00:03:18.630> the

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
to it and the other thing to hold the

to it and the other thing to hold the
moisture<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:21.450> won't<00:03:21.690> rust<00:03:22.019> as<00:03:22.380> long<00:03:22.560> as

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
moisture and it won't rust as long as

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.110 
moisture and it won't rust as long as
it's<00:03:22.920> airtight<00:03:23.160> in<00:03:23.519> this<00:03:23.670> air<00:03:23.850> tight

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
the iron turn into iron oxide so I just

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.860 
the iron turn into iron oxide so I just
wanted<00:03:32.340> y'all<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.579> know<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:33.060> little<00:03:33.420> secret

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
wanted y'all to know this little secret

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.120 
wanted y'all to know this little secret
about<00:03:34.640> oxygen<00:03:35.640> absorbers<00:03:36.260> in<00:03:37.260> case<00:03:37.799> you<00:03:37.980> don't

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
about oxygen absorbers in case you don't

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.930 
about oxygen absorbers in case you don't
want<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.400> have<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:38.670> buy<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:38.850> whole<00:03:39.090> 50<00:03:39.450> pack

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
want to have to buy a whole 50 pack

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.350 
want to have to buy a whole 50 pack
these<00:03:41.940> here<00:03:42.239> say<00:03:42.480> they're<00:03:42.690> 500<00:03:43.230> CC's<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:44.360> don't

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
these here say they're 500 CC's I don't

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.160 
these here say they're 500 CC's I don't
see<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.570> size<00:03:45.930> on<00:03:46.380> this<00:03:47.030> but<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.269> am<00:03:48.780> going<00:03:48.810> to

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
see a size on this but I am going to

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.210 
see a size on this but I am going to
guesstimate<00:03:49.769> if<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.579> is<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.820> 500cc<00:03:52.220> these

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
guesstimate if this is a 500cc these

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.100 
guesstimate if this is a 500cc these
here<00:03:53.579> are<00:03:53.820> almost<00:03:55.610> 5000<00:03:56.610> cc's<00:03:57.239> because<00:03:57.930> it's

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
here are almost 5000 cc's because it's

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.550 
here are almost 5000 cc's because it's
got<00:03:59.150> probably<00:04:00.150> 10<00:04:00.390> times<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:01.049> amount<00:04:01.200> of<00:04:01.320> iron

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
got probably 10 times the amount of iron

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.880 
got probably 10 times the amount of iron
filings<00:04:02.220> as<00:04:02.430> one<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.120> these<00:04:03.440> little<00:04:04.440> packages

fairly fresh one they got a looks like
they<00:04:23.819> have<00:04:24.000> a<00:04:24.030> Julian<00:04:24.659> date<00:04:24.930> on<00:04:25.169> there<00:04:26.930> but<00:04:27.979> hey

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
they have a Julian date on there but hey

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.149 
they have a Julian date on there but hey
I<00:04:30.319> just<00:04:31.319> thought<00:04:31.439> I'd<00:04:31.590> let<00:04:31.800> that<00:04:31.949> little
