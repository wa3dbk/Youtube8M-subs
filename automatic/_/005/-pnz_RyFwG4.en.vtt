00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
them in mice and what I call it really

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.060 
them in mice and what I call it really
it's<00:01:02.880> graham<00:01:03.120> cracker<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.470> actually<00:01:04.680> came

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
it's graham cracker but I actually came

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.400 
it's graham cracker but I actually came
up<00:01:05.130> with<00:01:05.520> this<00:01:05.670> idea<00:01:05.729> because<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.690> had<00:01:07.080> tried

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
up with this idea because I had tried

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.520 
up with this idea because I had tried
using<00:01:07.740> brown<00:01:08.190> sugar<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.899> just<00:01:10.110> didn't

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
using brown sugar and it just didn't

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.620 
using brown sugar and it just didn't
look<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.830> sand<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.910> figured<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.509> know

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
look like sand so I figured you know

look like sand so I figured you know
let's<00:01:13.470> try<00:01:13.710> something<00:01:14.100> else<00:01:14.399> so<00:01:14.940> what<00:01:15.119> I'm

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
let's try something else so what I'm

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.520 
let's try something else so what I'm
