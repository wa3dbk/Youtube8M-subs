00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
that I figured out how to do was these

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.940 
that I figured out how to do was these
buttons<00:01:18.570> also<00:01:19.850> light<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.600> these<00:01:21.780> are<00:01:22.110> LED

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
buttons also light up so these are LED

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.390 
buttons also light up so these are LED
lit<00:01:23.159> buttons<00:01:24.110> you<00:01:25.110> can't<00:01:25.830> see<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.100> very<00:01:26.130> well

lit buttons you can't see it very well

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.819 
lit buttons you can't see it very well
on<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> video<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.180> don't<00:01:27.479> think<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.650> did

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.010 
on the video I don't think but you did
notice<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.430> one<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.970> yellow<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

then of course the 1 2 player buttons
are<00:01:36.770> white<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.430> I'll<00:01:38.729> turn<00:01:38.880> off<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.299> lights

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479

are white but I'll turn off the lights
here<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.930> moment<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.350> see<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.369> see

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
here in a moment to see if you can see

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.840 
here in a moment to see if you can see
that<00:01:41.670> any<00:01:41.759> better<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.329> then<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> other

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
that any better and then the other

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.870 
that any better and then the other
really<00:01:44.850> nice<00:01:45.149> thing<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:46.220> he<00:01:47.220> wanted<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.759> we

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
really nice thing that he wanted and we

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.230 
really nice thing that he wanted and we
I<00:01:48.149> was<00:01:48.689> able<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.930> find<00:01:49.520> find<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> cable<00:01:50.909> out

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
I was able to find find the cable out

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.600 
I was able to find find the cable out
there<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.320> make<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.530> work<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.430> is

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
there to make it work is that this is

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.990 
there to make it work is that this is
the<00:01:53.759> arcade<00:01:54.240> SD<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:56.130> all<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.759> games

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
the arcade SD and so all the games

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.840 
the arcade SD and so all the games
everything<00:01:57.649> is<00:01:58.649> programmed<00:01:58.950> from<00:01:59.280> an<00:01:59.430> SD<00:01:59.610> card

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
everything is programmed from an SD card

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.389 
everything is programmed from an SD card
so<00:02:00.719> right<00:02:00.930> here's<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> power<00:02:01.500> obviously<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
so right here's the power obviously and

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.209 
so right here's the power obviously and
then<00:02:02.579> you've<00:02:02.880> got<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.840> test<00:02:04.110> switch<00:02:04.439> but

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219
