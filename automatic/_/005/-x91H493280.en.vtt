 receive here in the group study 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.450
 formula to the graduate in computing 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.700
 felipe de jesus bonilla sanchez who is 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.830
 development undergraduate advisor 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.480
 of software of the Mexican university 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.070
 of distance education how it's doing 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.839
 welcome how about good many afternoons 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.890

 good afternoon before the audience 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.259
 to tell us that precisely 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.539
 they are opening a degree in the uned 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.159
 and it's about this that has to do with 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.529
 the software development of what is 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:33.000
 treat like this after we are at the gala 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.989
 Mexican university education 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.250
 distance corresponding to those 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.649
 prerogatives that we have of modernity 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.449
 technology and innovation is that we are 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.219
 offering now in this new cycle 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.129
 school the undergraduate degree in 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.780
 software basically the degree of 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.300
 software development corresponds to 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.519
 train a professional that has to 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.579
 see with the skills to propose 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.010
 develop and implement solutions that 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.449
 meet the needs of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.379
 information processing that 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.510
 currently have the organizations 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.240
 today truly in this society 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.970
 digital, there are many needs with 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.830
 regarding the generation of 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.490
 of a new way of organizing the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.590
 data well and if you can comment us a 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.360
 little please in what areas of 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.640
 knowledge is divided this 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.410
 bachelor's degree basically the areas of 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.360
 knowledge where we are divided 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.160
 in this degree it would be in the part 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.980
 of computer networks the part of 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.440
 software the social environment there is a part 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.210
 important math and also the 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.100
 part of information processing and in 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.540
 where we want to highlight our plan of 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.480
 Studies is in the part of the languages 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.650
 of programming if we are going to 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.020
 develop a graduate in 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.400
 software development what is important is 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.260
 that this graduate has the 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.200
 skills to be able to produce that 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.430
 software therefore we need 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.440
 strengthen it in the use of languages 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.210
 of programming 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.369
 based on the educational model that has the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.020
 Mexican university education 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.540
 distance for us that is the great 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.770
 challenge to be able to get that based on 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.470
 our educational model 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.610
 the student comes out with this strength 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.560
 to say I consider myself a specialist in 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.720
 certain programming languages ​​and 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.580
 I am able to develop on 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.770
 Well, it sounds pretty good for 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.290

 modalities in which you can study 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.250
 this new degree in development of 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.350
 software yes well based on the model 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.480
 educational that manages the university 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.430
 Mexican distance education 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.780
 we can offer the degree 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.410
 in software development in the 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.720
 online mode 100% online and 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.760
 this possibility of 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.950
 take it on either Saturday or between 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.569
 week 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.640
 highlight the benefits of the model to 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.700
 distance of the online model that 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.950
 obviously it avoids us many avoids 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.689
 many expenses also when the student 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.280
 avoid displacement when the 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.349
 student avoids even the purchase of 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.810
 materials because you have to remember that 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.430
 much of the material that is offered inside 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.859
 of the degrees offered by the 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.720
 university as they are hung we are going to 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.310
 be mounted on a server where 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.409
 the student can make the consultation to 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.909
 through electronic means that 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.799
 have at your fingertips as long as 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.260
 have internet then there are many 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.269
 benefits offered by the system as 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.189
 I repeat you are is a degree 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.409
 innovative that corresponds to the new 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.419
 offer also of employment that is being 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.489
 generating therefore in the state in the country and 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:04.859
 globally remember us once 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.599
 plus the portal on the internet of the uned and 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.919
 Of course, if there is a telephone where 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.109
 they can also have more information 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:14.010
 course of course the page of the 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.359
 university is www.uned.es punto mx el 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.739
 phone to which you can communicate 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:21.840
 would be 3 17 62 04 if they are talking 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.250
 from here in a local way from Cuernavaca and 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.470
 for those who listen to us outside the 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.419
 state may be through a 01 800
