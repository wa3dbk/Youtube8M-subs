00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.929
 this video I will explain 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:13.019
 how to make this necklace there the parcel goes 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.340
 be composed of five reasons so three 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:22.369
 that I call an eight integer and 2d 2008 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.369
 to the cloud will start with the 2008 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.269
 so we put a son are two needles 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.380
 so here we will put four facets of 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.380
 2000 meters 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.010
 and locks up passing the eel in the 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.010
 first pearl 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.120
 it 's a little round 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:15.479
 so the army a 2 mm to the right and two 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.479
 2 mm to the left 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.869
 so we pass the right way in 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.869
 the pearl of the left 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.070
 now we will put a 3 mm facet 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.240
 on the right eight 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:57.970
 left but a 2 mm he thinks guess 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.890
 we put a 3000 is right 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:38.620
 a 2 mm to the left a 3 mm it goes back the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.620
 right son not the loss of left 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 be careful that both 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:49.569
 millimeters always on the left 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.120
 because they will be in the center of the circle 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.120
 so here we will put a 4 mm to the right 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:12.700
 two millimeters left a 3 mm and one 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.700
 pass the eight of right in 23 mm 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:29.310
 so we do that to have five facets 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.310
 4 mm outward 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.489
 that's when the ring us five facets 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.349
 4 mm 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:47.660
 we can see that his form the luron 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:50.560
 so that's the two millimeters the always 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.560
 that she is inside 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:04:05.290
 so now we put a 3 mm to the right 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:05.290
 2 mm left and 3 mm 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.690
 in Lyon passes the right buses in the 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.690
 left file in the left pearl 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:29.040
 one 3 mm on the right two of 2 mm on the left 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.490
 I 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.819
 stop right guides in the pearl 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.819
 from the left 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:58.770
 now we will close the 2008 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:05:01.909
 so we put a 2000 meters right a 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.909
 2000 meters left 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:20.740
 and we will pass the left thread here the 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:23.450
 first pair of the 2 mm towards the hanger 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.640
 and we will take our son we will 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:35.260
 crossed the other way in the same 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:38.980
 shit like that 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.980
 the 2008 is done 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:55.340
 so now we're going to put tunes 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.590
 3:15 or 11 air is the size of the 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.960
 pearl so it's rock and 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:04.330
 sharks what are we going to put in the middle 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.330
 between each 2 mm 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.480
 adorns it next door 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.950
 undefeated until then chaos 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.420
 and we do the same with our son for 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:53.830
 dig april help the two needles 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:56.380
 at the top in the smes of which only elected 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:59.940
 from right a sheet left them from 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:03.130
 left right will become right 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:09.790
 so when we crossed our 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:14.050
 needle one highlights that's the 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:17.320
 right or left here is in the 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:20.320
 second three millimeters in tulle and 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:24.490
 4mm two-way and mint 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.760
 come out like this and there we put an area 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.760
 11 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.000
 here 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.400
 and we do the same on the other side 

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:55.610
 I pass in the second below 

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:55.610
 of the 4 mm and in May a 11 

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:08.100
 So here it is only to return 

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:11.850
 the wire to cut and after we redid 

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:15.710
 a second like this and after we 

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.710
 attack the entire eight
