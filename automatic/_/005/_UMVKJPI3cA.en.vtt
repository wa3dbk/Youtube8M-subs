00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.470 
perhaps after the first race preble
doesn't<00:04:13.130> have<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.280> ride<00:04:13.519> in<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.910> opening<00:04:14.239> race

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
doesn't have a ride in the opening race

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.279 
doesn't have a ride in the opening race
but<00:04:15.079> what<00:04:15.650> and<00:04:15.889> Chadwick<00:04:16.579> do<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:17.120> if<00:04:17.750> they<00:04:17.959> win

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
but what and Chadwick do and if they win

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.460 
but what and Chadwick do and if they win
or<00:04:18.850> register<00:04:19.850> points<00:04:20.289> certainly<00:04:21.289> you'd

or register points certainly you'd

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.740
