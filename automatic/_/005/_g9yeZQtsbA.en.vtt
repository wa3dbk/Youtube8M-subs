I believe still tekmoto or something
like<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.540> still<00:02:07.500> take<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:08.399> will<00:02:08.580> still<00:02:08.759> take

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970

like that still take you will still take
you'll<00:02:09.300> figure<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.929> out<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:10.349> anyway<00:02:10.790> so

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
you'll figure it out but anyway so

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.850 
you'll figure it out but anyway so
that's<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.239> ocean<00:02:12.420> Mira<00:02:12.780> Cinderella

definitely recommend it got that from
RevZilla<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.460> believe<00:02:17.760> for<00:02:18.030> like<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.450> hundred

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
RevZilla I believe for like a hundred

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.400 
RevZilla I believe for like a hundred
and<00:02:18.930> four<00:02:19.080> dollars<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:21.350> pretty<00:02:22.350> easy

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
and four dollars and pretty easy

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.270 
and four dollars and pretty easy
installation<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.490> just<00:02:23.670> got<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.910> cut<00:02:24.060> off<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
installation you just got to cut off the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.600 
installation you just got to cut off the
the<00:02:26.280> original<00:02:26.520> license<00:02:27.420> plate<00:02:27.660> light<00:02:27.870> wires

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
the original license plate light wires

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.260 
the original license plate light wires
and<00:02:30.380> splice<00:02:31.380> them<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.770> LED<00:02:32.130> ones<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.060> only

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
and splice them to the LED ones the only

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.440 
and splice them to the LED ones the only
thing<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:34.740> up<00:02:34.830> probably<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.490> now

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
thing that I up probably is now

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.180 
thing that I up probably is now
my<00:02:36.630> rear<00:02:36.930> turntables<00:02:37.470> don't<00:02:37.650> work<00:02:37.800> as<00:02:37.950> running

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
my rear turntables don't work as running

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.500 
my rear turntables don't work as running
lights<00:02:38.430> they<00:02:38.580> still<00:02:38.760> work<00:02:38.880> as<00:02:39.030> turn<00:02:39.180> signals

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
lights they still work as turn signals

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.150 
lights they still work as turn signals
but<00:02:39.690> not<00:02:39.810> running<00:02:40.050> lights<00:02:40.230> probably

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
but not running lights probably

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.580 
but not running lights probably
