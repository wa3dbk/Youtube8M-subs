00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
hmm i think the foam nozzles are a

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:46.770 
hmm i think the foam nozzles are a
little<00:03:45.730> gunked<00:03:46.030> up<00:03:46.239> on<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.569> right<00:03:46.719> side

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
though the foam is like not really

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.490 
though the foam is like not really
coming<00:03:50.019> out<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.409> hitting<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.739> car<00:03:51.989> it's<00:03:52.989> sort

and<00:04:55.740> how<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.340> figure<00:04:56.640> out<00:04:56.880> this<00:04:57.060> thrust<00:04:57.510> pro

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
and how to figure out this thrust pro

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:11.940 
and how to figure out this thrust pro
here<00:05:04.340> 0.2<00:05:05.340> okay

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950

gone yeah I may have gone through it a

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:50.189 
gone yeah I may have gone through it a
little<00:05:48.429> faster<00:05:48.819> than<00:05:49.330> I<00:05:49.419> needed<00:05:49.659> to<00:05:49.989> because

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
little faster than I needed to because
