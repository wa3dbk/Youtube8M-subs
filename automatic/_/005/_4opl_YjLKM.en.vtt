00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.350 
motion sensor and how it works with
gaming<00:02:16.520> on<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.270> sony<00:02:17.960> ericsson<00:02:18.380> w<00:02:18.650> 760<00:02:19.360> you

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
gaming on the sony ericsson w 760 you

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.380 
gaming on the sony ericsson w 760 you
can<00:02:20.510> see<00:02:20.630> here<00:02:20.960> i<00:02:21.110> turn<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.070> phone<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:23.060> steer

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
can see here i turn the phone the steer

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.870 
can see here i turn the phone the steer
and<00:02:23.680> pretty<00:02:24.680> off<00:02:24.860> course

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
and pretty off course

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.510 
and pretty off course
and<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.510> tilt<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.840> phone<00:02:28.020> forward<00:02:28.560> to

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
and you tilt the phone forward to

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.060 
and you tilt the phone forward to
accelerate<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.900> here<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.110> am<00:02:31.200> accelerating

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
accelerate so here I am accelerating

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.300 
accelerate so here I am accelerating
through<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.280> curve<00:02:32.580> on<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:33.630> game

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
through a curve on this game

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.030 
through a curve on this game
so<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.940> demonstration<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.750> how<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
so that is a demonstration of how the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.440 
so that is a demonstration of how the
accelerometer<00:02:38.040> works<00:02:38.280> with<00:02:38.760> gaming<00:02:39.209> on<00:02:39.330> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
accelerometer works with gaming on the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.500 
accelerometer works with gaming on the
w7<00:02:39.930> 16
