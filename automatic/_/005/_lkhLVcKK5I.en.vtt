00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the details at 250 GTO I imagine it's a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.880 
the details at 250 GTO I imagine it's a
rear-wheel<00:01:23.040> drive<00:01:23.070> car<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:25.110> imagine<00:01:25.770> it

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
rear-wheel drive car and I imagine it

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.590 
rear-wheel drive car and I imagine it
understeers<00:01:26.430> quite<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> bit<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.210> again

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
understeers quite a bit but again

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.390 
understeers quite a bit but again
without<00:01:27.780> all<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.229> assists<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.799> don't<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.189> I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
without all the assists I don't know I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.249 
without all the assists I don't know I
don't<00:01:29.520> know<00:01:29.670> what<00:01:29.850> sister<00:01:30.210> turned<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.960> I

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
don't know what sister turned on so I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.469 
don't know what sister turned on so I
don't<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.650> much<00:01:31.890> knowledge<00:01:31.920> about<00:01:32.479> about

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
don't have much knowledge about about

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.510 
don't have much knowledge about about
that<00:01:33.720> if<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.079> was<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.439> turn<00:01:34.619> everything<00:01:34.950> off<00:01:35.220> I

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
that if I was to turn everything off I

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.219 
that if I was to turn everything off I
think<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.210> would<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.509> tricky<00:01:36.900> car<00:01:37.079> to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
think this would be a tricky car to

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:37.960 
think this would be a tricky car to
handle<00:01:37.530> put

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
handle put

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.900 
handle put

so yeah we raced on this truck already

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.640

but in this one we're in this kind of

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.910 
but in this one we're in this kind of

it<00:01:51.090> handily<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.990> been<00:01:52.140> taking<00:01:52.440> it<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
it handily but I have been taking it a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.380 
it handily but I have been taking it a
little<00:01:52.620> bit<00:01:52.980> easy<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.370> kind<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:54.150> kind

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
little bit easy just kind of just kind

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.670 
little bit easy just kind of just kind
of<00:01:54.450> encouraging<00:01:55.050> it<00:01:55.170> around<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.470> bends

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
of encouraging it around the bends

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.050 
of encouraging it around the bends
without<00:01:56.010> pushing<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.430> too<00:01:56.640> much

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
without pushing it too much

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.790 
without pushing it too much
I<00:01:57.090> imagine<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.930> thing<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.290> wants<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.680> go

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
I imagine this thing just wants to go

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.030 
I imagine this thing just wants to go
off<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.040> track<00:01:59.250> at<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.490> moment's<00:01:59.880> notice<00:02:01.040> that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
off the track at a moment's notice that

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.940 
off the track at a moment's notice that
guy<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.760> you<00:02:02.940> can<00:02:03.120> see<00:02:03.590> obviously<00:02:04.590> even

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
guy that like you can see obviously even

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.550 
guy that like you can see obviously even

even<00:02:35.850> got<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.090> low-level<00:02:36.510> wispy<00:02:36.959> clouds<00:02:36.990> as

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
even got the low-level wispy clouds as

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.960 
even got the low-level wispy clouds as
well<00:02:39.320> automatic<00:02:40.320> gear<00:02:40.500> changing<00:02:40.980> which<00:02:41.700> means

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
well automatic gear changing which means

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.060 
well automatic gear changing which means
I<00:02:42.150> can't<00:02:42.390> control<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:43.140> know<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.290> can't<00:02:43.650> sort<00:02:43.950> of

heel-and-toe it or anything like that
just<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.230> thumb<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.340> thumb<00:02:47.550> controls<00:02:48.000> and

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
just a thumb just the thumb controls and

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.500 
just a thumb just the thumb controls and
automatic<00:02:48.989> gear<00:02:49.170> shifting<00:02:49.620> but<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.940> still

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
automatic gear shifting but I still

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.420 
automatic gear shifting but I still
enjoyed<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:52.050> race<00:02:52.290> I'm<00:02:52.830> just<00:02:53.070> glad<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.280> was

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
enjoyed this race I'm just glad I was

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.729 
enjoyed this race I'm just glad I was
out<00:02:53.550> in<00:02:53.580> front<00:02:53.730> quite<00:02:54.180> early<00:02:54.330> on<00:02:54.600> because<00:02:54.840> that

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
out in front quite early on because that

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.160 
out in front quite early on because that
allowed<00:02:56.070> me<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.250> relax<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.790> little<00:02:56.910> bit<00:02:57.170> my

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
allowed me to relax a little bit my

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.840 
allowed me to relax a little bit my
biggest<00:02:58.410> fear<00:02:58.680> was<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.920> have<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> whole<00:02:59.580> bunch

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
biggest fear was to have a whole bunch

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.190 
biggest fear was to have a whole bunch
of<00:02:59.970> collisions<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.630> only<00:03:00.840> really<00:03:01.050> got

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
of collisions and the only really got

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.640 
of collisions and the only really got
one<00:03:01.410> go<00:03:01.590> at<00:03:01.709> this<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:02.330> but<00:03:03.330> that's<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.230> easy<00:03:04.380> to

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
one go at this so but that's so easy to

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.680 
one go at this so but that's so easy to
clip<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.010> Bend<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.459> rate<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:06.269> come<00:03:06.480> in<00:03:06.570> on

clip that Bend I rate you you come in on

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.240 
clip that Bend I rate you you come in on

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
that bender and there's just a concrete

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.090

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
one here I've noticed a I struggle with

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.440 
one here I've noticed a I struggle with
that<00:03:12.959> chicane<00:03:13.440> quite<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.769> bit<00:03:13.950> as<00:03:14.070> well<00:03:14.209> it<00:03:15.209> can

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
that chicane quite a bit as well it can

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.180 
that chicane quite a bit as well it can
be<00:03:15.600> cut<00:03:15.810> quite<00:03:16.019> effectively<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.800> second

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
be cut quite effectively on that second

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.610 
be cut quite effectively on that second
bit<00:03:17.450> but<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.570> AI<00:03:18.660> tends<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.170> spread<00:03:19.470> out<00:03:19.590> over

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
bit but the AI tends to spread out over

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.259 
bit but the AI tends to spread out over
that<00:03:19.980> chicane<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.670> can<00:03:20.790> be<00:03:20.880> sometimes

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
that chicane and it can be sometimes

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.020 
that chicane and it can be sometimes
tricky<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.930> can<00:03:22.110> often<00:03:22.260> get<00:03:22.530> yourself<00:03:23.030> you

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
tricky you can often get yourself you

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.490 
tricky you can often get yourself you
can<00:03:24.150> overtake<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.630> car<00:03:24.780> in<00:03:24.900> front<00:03:25.050> through

can overtake the car in front through

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.930 
can overtake the car in front through
that<00:03:25.680> chicane<00:03:26.010> because<00:03:26.400> they'll<00:03:26.580> go<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.730> little

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
that chicane because they'll go a little

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.550 
that chicane because they'll go a little
bit<00:03:27.150> wide<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.690> can<00:03:27.840> just<00:03:27.959> cut<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.320> up<00:03:28.440> a

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
bit wide and you can just cut it up a

bit wide and you can just cut it up a
little<00:03:28.680> bit
