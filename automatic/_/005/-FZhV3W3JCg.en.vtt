00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
as a Lego set because those both those

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.240 
as a Lego set because those both those
videos<00:02:24.989> have<00:02:25.019> more<00:02:25.440> than<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.739> quarter<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.159> a

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
videos have more than a quarter of a

videos have more than a quarter of a
million<00:02:26.549> views<00:02:27.209> so<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.840> don't<00:02:28.019> know<00:02:28.110> why<00:02:28.349> Lego

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
million views so I don't know why Lego

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.970 
million views so I don't know why Lego
would<00:02:29.730> be<00:02:29.909> like<00:02:30.120> no<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:31.470> reason<00:02:31.500> why<00:02:31.950> I

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
would be like no and the reason why I

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.860 
would be like no and the reason why I
let<00:02:32.250> go<00:02:32.400> no<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:33.060> because<00:02:33.420> they<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:33.629> to<00:02:33.690> get

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
let go no is because they have to get

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.619 
let go no is because they have to get
the<00:02:34.140> cop<00:02:34.500> they<00:02:34.829> have<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.069> get<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:36.180> rights

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
the cop they have to get the like rights

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.360 
the cop they have to get the like rights
to<00:02:37.019> use<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.709> that's<00:02:37.829> probably<00:02:38.190> what's

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
to use it so that's probably what's

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.580 
to use it so that's probably what's
taking<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.700> long<00:02:38.879> for<00:02:39.120> finding<00:02:40.049> as<00:02:40.110> Freddy's<00:02:40.440> I

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
taking so long for finding as Freddy's I

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.130 
taking so long for finding as Freddy's I
don't<00:02:40.709> know<00:02:40.799> why<00:02:40.920> Scott<00:02:41.340> would<00:02:41.610> be<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:42.140> d-bag

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
don't know why Scott would be a d-bag

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.319 
don't know why Scott would be a d-bag
about<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.860> or<00:02:44.040> something<00:02:44.519> well<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.760> don't<00:02:44.970> know

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
about it or something well I don't know

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.180 
about it or something well I don't know
Lego<00:02:45.780> probably<00:02:46.109> contacted<00:02:46.769> him<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.069> then

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
Lego probably contacted him and then

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.280 
Lego probably contacted him and then
maybe<00:02:47.430> Scott's<00:02:47.819> was<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.390> busy<00:02:48.780> with<00:02:48.959> finance

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
maybe Scott's was just busy with finance
