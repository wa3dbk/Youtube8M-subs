00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.580
 and a sweet potato comes back here I bring you 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.469
 a new video and today we are going to 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.879
 see a tutorial that had many many 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.330
 I am going to show you how to bring 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.590
 build on roller coasters in minecraft 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.510
 probably you say is not a mountain 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.550
 Russian you just put crazy rails 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.080
 and you already have your roller coaster not from 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.700
 think about making a roller coaster that looks 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.200
 pretty that you see father who is like 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.300
 an amusement park so they can 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.980
 do it in your worlds and look as if 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.230
 outside to give us the Disneyland or six flags 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.390
 or any of those nonsense then 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.429
 let's start with the video the video will 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.379
 divided into certain steps so the 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:40.359
 first to start will be to choose the 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.309
 material normally I would tell them that 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:44.199
 will use this type of wood that is the one 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.420
 more will be used for roller coasters 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.800
 this dark wave electrons want me 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.929
 I'm going to use this and the first thing we have 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.149
 what to do is to give our 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.760
 roller coaster the first thing I'm going to 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.260
 do I in this case will be open 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.940
 like a small space this is going to be 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.190
 a simple roller coaster and already after 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.870
 this is how I'm going to make this video 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.219
 as a basic and now you can 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.750
 take out the idea to make one with 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.760
 different curves or if you do not have it 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.200
 be exactly the same then good 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.730
 let's start building around here 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.090
 example 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.950
 and over here I'm going to start shaping a 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.409
 Once I give a good shape to my 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.869
 roller coaster see you 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.270
 and as you can see people I already have my 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.859
 roller coaster structure the most not 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.409
 they are going to exceed as I do because if 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.210
 they fix it I made it very very very very long 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.710
 then I used too many blocks and 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.270
 for the next step we have to 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.310
 do good rather well in two steps 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.869
 I'm going to take a lot then I'll 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.609
 I recommend that you first watch the video and 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.619
 then give an idea of ​​how you want 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:40.359
 be the roller coaster because there is a 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.670
 little late to work I say will be 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.679
 very cool but it will be a little 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.299
 slow for me but you are going to 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.950
 enjoy you can not then like 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.750
 can see nothing else is the structure does not 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.299
 I've put rails or anything like that 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.429
 next step is to put rails like this 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.619
 normal and in the rises from time to 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.179
 when to put propelled eye not 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.039
 I always put, do not always put him 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.079
 propelled because if they always put him 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.209
 propelled will be very boring and 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.280
 too fast the anp the race well 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.349
 I recommend you do it then 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.149
 normal and is and from time to time 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.250
 put propelled if you see the cart 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.140
 does not arrive then if they already put 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.390
 propelled and they're going to put you 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.560
 measuring ok so we'll see each other when 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.980
 have 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.140
 the real of good-looking 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.879
 and good people as you can see I already put 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.640
 rails to everything and I got propelled as 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.900
 can see I did not put almost straight 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.790
 propelled forgiveness as you can see that 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.900
 a few here up here I did not put 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.830
 nothing to give like the typical 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.660
 feeling this is going to say slow 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.150
 slow slow and ponla qaeda here I put 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.860
 other little pieces of equipment other little ones and 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.739
 it was all I put on activators 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.650
 now comes a part that is therefore a 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.489
 little boring but not so not so this 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.560
 art before that is to put stairs 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.769
 around the roller coaster 'stairs 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.569
 and blocks in this way then people 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.310
 once you have this step ready what 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.890
 what you have to do is grab stairs and 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.900
 blocks and we are going to scale all of 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.370
 our roller coaster that good where 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.260
 there is that staircase apart for example here 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.760
 there is no longer for stairs then 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.280
 you just have to put everything here 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.989
 towards around and only the blocks 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.400
 that are going up as you can see here already 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:20.910
 no yes no here although it was here here 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.799
 here and here here here and everything else what 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.780
 we fill with normal block of this 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.520
 way once this is over 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.650
 see you again 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.360
 so people like you can see three 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.070
 chia methods it started to rain but 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.650
 see how beautiful it looks like this 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.510
 all all all stairs and blocks below 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.680
 What I recommend is that they do 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.540
 this first have their normal rail not of 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.490
 where will the cart go next 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.230
 down they make 11 below height and towards 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.790
 one side and the other towards the other and already with 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.170
 that they are putting everything to the side that 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.360
 I am putting these blocks 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.580
 here and they are ordering everything bordered 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.350
 everything and they put the stairs 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.420
 over and it's going to be easier for you 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.650
 because that way they will not flip 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.230
 then once you have it finished 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.460
 is going to look something like this now the 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.530
 next step is a step that 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.320
 I usually like it or rather it's not 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.140
 it bothers me I do not dislike like this and 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.140
 it is easy in quotes that is 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.000
 make the base where we are going to start this 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.580
 the race or whatever we're going to 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.770
 do then the only thing that we have to 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.430
 choosing is a flat area for example I 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.190
 this and make a house like here 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.380
 where can people enter and 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.000
 where there is a dispenser with mine card 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.890
 so you can get this one 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.040
 the times that you hit you like that 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.140
 who built it and right now we come back 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.120
 and ready as you can see people and stay 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.250
 here as a little house by the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.140
 typical little houses that there are before 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.180
 start the roller coaster the whole 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.390
 turn and stop again in that block 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.050
 now the most horrible part of 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.130
 everything but at the end is the final and what is it 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.860
 What do we have to do? 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.230
 grab fences and just in the block 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.870
 where we put the rails that is done in 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.060
 the middle one we have to fill everything 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.390
 everything all everything all everything all with 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.100
 fences everything absolutely everything then 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.390
 how can you see if you look very father 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.270
 person as to kill to fill 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:19.350
 all that and good people as you can see 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.330
 this roller coaster is finished as 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.450
 can you see them I said it looked very very 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.980
 father with all the berries so and so what 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.390
 The last thing that is missing is to throw a 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.090
 I looked up to be seen 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.340
 little bit better you here the little 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.380
 and the whole mother here all this well 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.570
 pretty nice see everything all everything 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.330
 here the effect like that of it being broken 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.610
 here a very father very father part now 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.249
 obviously we are going to try it 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.709
 so before you try it here 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:49.549
 I hope you enjoyed a greeting and 

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:49.549
 see you later 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.080
 or if I can finally go to the roller coaster 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.580
 most epic of all minecraft I hope that 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.300
 There is someone who can control it 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.160
 because the other time there was no one or 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.140
 minimum height or perfect I think I am 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.160
 higher I can well my view happens more 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.160
 then I imagine that I am more 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.560
 not good maybe if I wear a helmet je
