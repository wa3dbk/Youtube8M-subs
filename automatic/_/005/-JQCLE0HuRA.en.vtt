00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.890

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.559
 anouk h 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.789
 I worked 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.329
 business driving working out 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.050
 I am of course a quarter of a million euros 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.759
 and 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.759
 but we will never do that again 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.829
 easy I am really looking forward to it 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.319
 nice lot 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:30.390
 much nicer 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.320
 I hope to see episodes if they don't continue 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.159
 I was the first 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.820
 at his arm and for the first time under the mat but also to explain even on 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.240
 there we go were the moss 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.560
 some ships 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.880
 at the deduction are not placed the last passionately let us so 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.810
 to hold 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.800
 I have a pair 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.540
 egg mountains 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.680
 become the first trainer for in 2010 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.710
 so yes 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.830
 yes they were real and the people's level case 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.719
 okay according to 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.719
 but now I also feel a roll of expectations 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.880
 except 7 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.850
 Paul Weitz found euros in the wrong way 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.130
 continues to be one of the highlights that is not true you can't say 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.790
 and you can't beat the size of the shrink, so it's a mess 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.300
 You can't tell what the strengths and weaknesses are so small 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.790
 we will still 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.030
 against the Czech Republic 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.820
 No 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.030
 the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.450
 is that so earth the 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.220
 only know that this also can also be a trace investigation the latter 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.170
 time up 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.250
 the culture pfff 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.030
 you also have that thing 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.840
 I think you like that 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.450
 both that understand for discussion bild according to fully planned park for his life 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.080
 I think then you 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.410
 Ariie foeke eaten 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.380
 that states 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.610
 time fatter brave 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.610
 I don't know that was a bit of Ajax 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.999
 ride for hope order troops on my food nature 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.269
 only government has this through I again there is a reason not to know small 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.479
 kilos 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:19.349
 next year the party thinks a good talk means talking 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.529
 That the plan of the PVDA is that this stops on 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:28.529
 clean up a mess I have a reward a myth yes what a country Middelburg 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:32.099
 space does not stop what were we have spoken before next to him 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.909
 that it was a joke can happen but you can tell by the old days 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:42.480
 the homers i am he strong with all you too garmin so that the king does not like that 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.089
 them on the proposal 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:45.290
 from the golden palm 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.390
 at times lumps is not on a few weeks more times we can use the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.080
 walk open again a crack and that she put I just go see my 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.359
 complete 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.709
 yes it is the intention that we would rather take a serious approach 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:59.719
 the 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.559
 and just as it is called 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:05.319
 the permanence episodes for the people we've seen on the dt v 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:10.009
 so then it's there we just went through there flushing 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:13.339
 and those arrested to try 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:14.180
 here 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.180
 of course come it is participant 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.149
 sanctions 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:25.029
 9 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:27.080
 as soon as the war would stay but 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.829
 if it is an idea for the we try to go too far 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.240
 to continue that piece of nature 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.279
 the loss we think 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:40.029
 We do not lead that, we are therefore much wiser at the effective 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:41.349
 at work 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.659
 to the 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.379
 if you have one in the city park that look the tactics and that the other side 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.060
 under other rules I had oil myself 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.390
 how so 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.869
 I thought 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:58.919
 a small example of 3 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.629
 but fortunately 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.189
 get a cigar 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.569
 I'm wearing you 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.250
 Wall Street stock exchanges 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.739
 polished puppet 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.039
 also private every working day why 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.539
 if that's the parties 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:16.699
 tickets to the public it is mandatory 7 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.250
 murder work of what we always do for children 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.569
 they are on stilts 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:24.849
 what killed as a team 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:28.210
 Well then the one is going to get hold of that one 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.650
 and the newspaper is for a little checking and sorting and the other ones 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.569
 had a bit of an eye or maybe not handy 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.740
 person 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.979
 is present and 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.460
 fertility 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.610
 I think that even if that does not happen soon because the moment there first 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.969
 encounter six 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:53.199
 the possibility that the deployment of an ea may be there but from me you can be your child 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.939
 can make each other what a bookmark that maybe made a mistake yet 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:58.430
 some 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.150
 8 the project 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.059
 you have yourself 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:03.529
 erik lammers point 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:05.689
 and I'm going to see how the oldest 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:11.289
 corner the siepel festival will be shown fc cologne a second day for you and 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.449
 I don't think about it 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.009
 no I can still hear it 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.029
 how is that possible 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:18.300
 I drank for the recordings 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.300
 I looked full as the final pair for men 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:23.210
 why 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.460
 then that can also be a book
