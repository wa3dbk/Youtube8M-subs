00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
we sports quiz or waste plus result

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.670 
we sports quiz or waste plus result
which<00:06:30.010> which<00:06:30.250> was<00:06:30.400> family<00:06:30.820> families<00:06:31.180> and

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
which which was family families and

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.200 
which which was family families and
social<00:06:32.680> game<00:06:33.070> which<00:06:33.310> I<00:06:33.430> think<00:06:33.730> again<00:06:34.030> is<00:06:34.180> a

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
social game which I think again is a

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.460 
social game which I think again is a
really<00:06:34.540> good<00:06:34.660> result<00:06:34.810> I<00:06:35.020> mean<00:06:35.169> we<00:06:35.260> said

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
really good result I mean we said

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.200 
really good result I mean we said
earlier<00:06:35.500> a<00:06:35.890> little<00:06:36.100> bit<00:06:36.220> about<00:06:36.400> it<00:06:36.640> I<00:06:36.880> think

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
earlier a little bit about it I think

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
earlier a little bit about it I think
it's<00:06:37.360> the<00:06:37.450> microsoft<00:06:37.900> the<00:06:37.960> more<00:06:38.140> i<00:06:38.169> think

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230 
it's the microsoft the more i think

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.140 
it's the microsoft the more i think
about<00:06:38.470> it<00:06:38.650> because<00:06:39.280> it<00:06:39.400> is<00:06:39.580> a<00:06:39.610> game<00:06:39.850> that<00:06:39.880> does

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
about it because it is a game that does

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.460 
about it because it is a game that does
have<00:06:40.270> longevity<00:06:40.450> thought<00:06:40.990> we<00:06:41.110> apply<00:06:41.410> this

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
have longevity thought we apply this

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.590 
have longevity thought we apply this
yeah<00:06:41.830> now<00:06:42.520> I<00:06:42.550> don't<00:06:42.970> completely<00:06:43.300> agree<00:06:43.450> with

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600
