00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.459
 how worried is the possibility 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.590
 of the neymar to stay out of this classic 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:15.119
 because he was an attacker and the victim did not 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.070
 hit the goal 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.070
 it's not a joke it 's yours 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.050
 but to what extent the cast is 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.259
 worried if they think he has 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.850
 playing there so obvious neymar is 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.310
 the main player of the cast 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.530
 I hope so, I hope you have totals. 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.660
 able to play and help us think 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.730
 not only I but all the comrades 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.000
 saints supporters 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.050
 even because who has the neymar next door 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.760
 then it's a job in a club and the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.310
 people hope he can be in 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.190
 conditions is worrying it is not 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.180
 because he finished the game is to put his hand 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.100
 in the thigh 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.810
 I think it was to do the cheer 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.070
 is nothing that can be totally 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.199
 in conditions 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.600
 It was what we know you 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.729
 professionals say that it is hardly 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.479
 are actually obliged to live with 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.740
 pain right 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.570
 it's hard to not go into the field 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.759
 sometimes not having some kind of pain 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.109
 that neymar is not 100% knowing 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.229
 neymar the way you know it from 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:21.479
 2010 is going to the game that's what 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.130
 waits for him by the decision that the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.140
 saints face the saints do not have the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.850
 liberators this year only the paulista 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.259
 so that game is worth maybe the first 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.069
 the saints and we have also the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.499
 from brazil but it's hard to tell if it goes 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:40.319
 with pain I do not think every player 

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:42.659
 whether or not you want one dose and another 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.700
 I think the game is gone. 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.429
 something that does not disturb not 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.270
 hinders the group and does not put at risk 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.799
 It's also his way of playing. 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.539
 I think he's going to play this game. 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.579
 this our fans 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.759
 Now what historically palms 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.130
 he was always the great adversary of the saints 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.899
 Henry when in time in the 50's 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.630
 60 has always been like this 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.819
 now you think that because the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.030
 saints have the village belmiro as 12th 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.120
 player to live a better phase you think 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.950
 that this can be reversed reverted to 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.709
 this is our goal 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.140
 is this factor playing at home since 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.239
 the beginning of the year of São Paulo we put 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.030
 in the head that it was necessary to classify 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.519
 well to have this factor but this 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.280
 also does not mean that what is already 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.900
 wins on the contrary is a classic one 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.940
 Difficult game against the palm trees as 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.510
 you told me the last palm trees 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.489
 games has given us a lot of work and 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.680
 The group that they have is called attention 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.140
 by arrangement in the latter classic we 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.239
 against them was was was so was too much 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.970
 truncated the game where a lot of 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.830
 and I believe that in this game there is no 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.560
 It will be different, they will come with a lot of 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.340
 but we players know 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.920
 responsibility what is it is a game 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.440
 decisive where the saints usually grow 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.000
 in recent years it has been like this and we are going to do 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.290
 to overcome it there because the 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.640
 People really want this championship game. 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.280
 now reach two questions first 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.980
 be a game in which not only the whole 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.930
 more individual talents can 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.480
 decide not to decide the future of both 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.190
 santos and of the palm trees and a second 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.139
 question regarding selection 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.109
 yesterday after the draw with the 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.239
 cyprus scolari said what 's missing 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.859
 time to prepare time to train 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.540
 You were in the team until another day. 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.430
 who has a lot of chance to go to the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.040
 confederations agree with him missing 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.950
 time for coaching selection 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.930
 I believe in the latter case in the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.280
 game playing x presented do not me 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.260
 The second error is wrong. 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.810
 is how many players have played in 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.299
 Sunday had a training in the text 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.950
 but Tuesday was already game eve 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.370
 I believe he can not make a 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.950
 very strong work and already on Wednesday in 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.440
 a super difficult game about chile 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.660
 I believe that with teacher work 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.380
 felipe will going to put brazil on 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.079
 way it deserves no doubt classic 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.090
 in my view, it's a game 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.099
 where it can not be rare it can not close 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.780
 an error can be fatal 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.019
 even more, here's just a game. 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.410
 so the team is very aware that it has 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.810
 who is playing the 90 minutes and I believe 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.849
 that in an individual bid both neymar 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.590
 montijo to other players of the 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.009
 opponent can decide the game then by 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.770
 This is what we have to do. 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.629
 good character exchange is your focus now there 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.639
 little and if I play with sudden pains 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:38.020
 discounted play had an example in the 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.479
 Tuesday I do not know if I had the 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.379
 opportunity to follow the messi 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.809
 messi did not play 100% of him 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:48.219
 and obviously also could not render 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:50.529
 good football and failed to produce 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:52.809
 practically absolutely nothing of what 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:54.969
 it is able to produce in a comparison 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:57.369
 with neymar to what extent the player 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:59.439
 really must make the sacrifice and 

00:04:57.369 --> 00:05:01.389
 he should go to the field and to what extent 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:02.800
 also he has to know what he can 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.439
 harming the team 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.120
 not so much in full conditions the game 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:09.939
 I could not watch because I was 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.770
 training s comes a little bit a lot 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:15.580
 little but told me that the messi was 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.559
 far below what is expected of him and 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.020
 I believe it may be because of the 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:23.050
 He's injured but not every player yet. 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.759
 another game like that it was his he 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.830
 knew everyone knew he would want 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:30.069
 play and I believe that here in the saints 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.229
 neymar is he is too mature to take 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:34.839
 their decisions and believes that this 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.639
 trainer that will not disrupt him much 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:38.469
 or the team and I believe it to go 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.939
 the game and we hope he does not feel 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:42.669
 no pain 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:43.990
 this examination does not contain anything serious and 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.749
 that he can stay in treatment there 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.399
 because he is a player who can not think 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:51.219
 in no way 

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:54.699
 the exercise a fast exercise of 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:58.269
 Let's suppose for a moment. 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:00.729
 You 're a trainer of the saints and you discover yourself. 

00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:02.289
 tomorrow morning the neymar that is 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.990
 available for the game 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.089
 You come here to talk, thank God, no. 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.129
 it was nothing you leave flea behind 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:11.889
 Ear Proposing Palm Trees Coach 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:16.360
 if I were a coach, I'd like to see a job 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:21.099
 now I can stay on top of the wall there 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:23.399
 I will answer where could it be is one is one 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:26.169
 new factor 

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:27.849
 no excuse is not 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:31.689
 being we usually have 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:33.779
 none is my way of seeing yes but no 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:37.240
 I know in the head pro for example 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:39.999
 arouca is the selection was booed out where 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.830
 You were in the game when the selection was 

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:44.830
 hilarious in morumbi too 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.300
 is by the defended the selection entered into the 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.820
 neymar's place was born to win the cup 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.740
 of South Africa against Africa is 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.590
 that the Brazilian team is losing 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:56.710
 the house factor in the world cup in 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.870
 relationships with everyone knows that the 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.150
 Brazilian fan charges a lot 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:04.060
 all players going to the selection 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.070
 so aware of that Brazil was doing a lot 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:10.570
 time that I did not play at home 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:13.600
 now started to play more is the supporter is 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:16.000
 Normal charge is when Nuno team 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.210
 is producing what is expected because 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.250
 It will fill the stadium and cough but I believe 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.680
 who with time as a felipão teacher 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.750
 He told me to work it will make 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.390
 Let the team win again, I'll 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.190
 show a beautiful football and fans 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.210
 embrace this cause and Brazil will 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.840
 enter into this cup of 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.840
 confederations
