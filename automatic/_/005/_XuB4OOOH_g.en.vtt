00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.410
 very good to all and welcome one day 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.900
 more to my channel that I'm jimmy and good 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.000
 Today I want to show you a small 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.180
 trick to get many 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.060
 scales heart and good for the one who does not 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.880
 know what these scales are for 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.040
 I'll explain it in this video 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.740
 first of all we have to have a 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.570
 pokémon with the cache skill or we can 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.650
 capture 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.760
 usually have this stability after you 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:54.950
 we will put the new attack the thief and 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.950
 then we will go to this city 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:05.650
 and we equip ourselves an old cane 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:11.210
 we will look for the relief city route 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:14.390
 and until we get a playful savage 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.260
 we will use the long attack against the light and 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.770
 wild and so we can steal the flake 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.119
 heart without having to capture it 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.310
 remember that your pokemon does not 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.680
 carry any object equipped because if 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.680
 I did not steal the object from you 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.890
 and well then now I will explain to you why 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.190
 they serve the heart scales with these 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.540
 scales we can remember attacks from 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.710
 Pokemon 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.600
 that they have forgotten and many times 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.000
 example there is pokemon like char raise auto 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.030
 x who can learn attacks at level 1 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.740
 but when they have evolved to analyze 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.750
 other x 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.990
 and now I explain to you where is this 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.300
 person so that we will give you the 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.420
 beds heart and will make us remember a 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.420
 attack and we'll go to cool town 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.140
 in the house highlights now appears here 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.340
 we will find the person who makes us 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.340
 remember him 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.950
 and well, here we have the person 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.900
 that will make us remember 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.870
 and attacks on our pokémon with a 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.709
 heart flake 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.709
 we will deliver 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.720
 the heart beds and it will make us remember the 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.810
 attack of our pokemon I for example 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.550
 the user can learn speed 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.470
 extreme then the dragon oral sphere 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.810
 and for example if you have a fee 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.780
 rates by level can not learn yew 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.900
 aerial but if we remind him 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.269
 well to learn it 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.040
 and all x can learn also slash 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.040
 aerial and that's cool a lot 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.170
 and well, in this place we have 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.220
 also here so movements that this 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.290
 person will make us 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.090
 remove the attacks as cascade and its 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.730
 cutting force all these types of 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.350
 attacks and well that's all guys 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.760
