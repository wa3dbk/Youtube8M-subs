the sort of pressure we're going to be

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.070

seeing<00:03:17.400> in<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.610> room<00:03:17.910> we<00:03:18.480> don't<00:03:18.660> want<00:03:18.930> to

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
cause any damage in the room so we have

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.510 
cause any damage in the room so we have
to<00:03:21.180> limit<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.570> pressure<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.530> do<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.890> we

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
to limit the pressure and to do that we

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.910 
to limit the pressure and to do that we
use<00:03:23.820> an<00:03:24.030> overpressure<00:03:24.840> vent<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:28.530> system

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
use an overpressure vent the system

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.950 
use an overpressure vent the system
takes<00:03:29.460> just<00:03:29.700> over<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:30.000> minute<00:03:30.210> to<00:03:30.360> discharge

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
takes just over a minute to discharge

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.380 
takes just over a minute to discharge
and<00:03:31.260> because<00:03:31.710> it's<00:03:31.860> so<00:03:32.010> close<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.340> us<00:03:32.520> it<00:03:32.820> will

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
and because it's so close to us it will

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.930 
and because it's so close to us it will
create<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.900> lot<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.350> noise<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:34.860> ear<00:03:35.580> defenders

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
create a lot of noise so ear defenders

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:58.190 
create a lot of noise so ear defenders
on<00:03:56.209> straightaway<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:57.360> can<00:03:57.540> see<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:58.080> that

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
on straightaway you can see that that

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.780 
on straightaway you can see that that

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
the gas continues to descend and they'll

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.430 
the gas continues to descend and they'll
receive<00:04:23.790> lower<00:04:24.210> hurricane<00:04:24.720> lamp<00:04:24.930> is<00:04:25.110> also

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
receive lower hurricane lamp is also

continuing<00:04:28.350> it's<00:04:28.830> fighting<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.550> gas<00:04:29.730> it's

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
continuing it's fighting the gas it's

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.750 
continuing it's fighting the gas it's
quite<00:04:30.630> a<00:04:30.660> fierce<00:04:30.930> blaze<00:04:31.250> but<00:04:32.250> you<00:04:32.370> can<00:04:32.550> see

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
quite a fierce blaze but you can see

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.070 
quite a fierce blaze but you can see
it's<00:04:32.910> now<00:04:33.060> becoming<00:04:33.450> more<00:04:33.720> sporadic<00:04:34.010> and<00:04:36.080> as

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
it's now becoming more sporadic and as

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.320 
it's now becoming more sporadic and as
the<00:04:37.200> concentration<00:04:37.950> increases<00:04:38.100> we<00:04:38.940> get<00:04:39.150> to

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
the concentration increases we get to

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.690 
the concentration increases we get to
the<00:04:39.420> point<00:04:39.660> where<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.770> flame<00:04:41.040> has<00:04:41.220> now<00:04:41.430> been

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
the point where the flame has now been

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.580 
the point where the flame has now been
extinguished

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.860 

so<00:04:46.590> we've<00:04:47.250> extinguished<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.820> fire<00:04:48.000> so<00:04:48.690> let's

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
so we've extinguished the fire so let's

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.750 
so we've extinguished the fire so let's
go<00:04:49.050> inside<00:04:49.410> and<00:04:49.770> we'll<00:04:49.890> show<00:04:50.100> you<00:04:50.130> that<00:04:50.460> it's

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
go inside and we'll show you that it's

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.490 
go inside and we'll show you that it's
