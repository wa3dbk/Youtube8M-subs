our banana peppers and our jalapenos

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.060 
our banana peppers and our jalapenos
that<00:00:10.019> we've<00:00:10.710> been<00:00:11.030> growing<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.769> that<00:00:13.769> little

that we've been growing in that little
house<00:00:15.059> solved<00:00:15.480> for<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.690> picture<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.109> here

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
house solved for the picture in here

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.390 
house solved for the picture in here
that<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.680> see

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.179 

as<00:00:21.400> you<00:00:21.580> can<00:00:21.669> see<00:00:21.820> some<00:00:22.090> grew<00:00:22.990> a<00:00:23.259> little<00:00:23.949> bit

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
as you can see some grew a little bit

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.130 
as you can see some grew a little bit
bigger<00:00:24.400> than<00:00:24.609> the<00:00:24.669> others<00:00:25.000> we're<00:00:25.869> going<00:00:26.019> to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
bigger than the others we're going to

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.560 
bigger than the others we're going to
only<00:00:26.590> take<00:00:26.829> the<00:00:27.009> strongest<00:00:27.429> ones<00:00:27.699> that<00:00:28.419> came

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
only take the strongest ones that came

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.620 
only take the strongest ones that came
out<00:00:28.809> and<00:00:29.079> we're<00:00:29.890> going<00:00:30.099> to<00:00:30.189> put<00:00:30.369> six<00:00:31.119> in<00:00:31.359> we

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
out and we're going to put six in we

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.420 
out and we're going to put six in we
have<00:00:31.750> a<00:00:31.779> six<00:00:32.079> foot<00:00:32.320> bed<00:00:32.559> they're<00:00:33.070> supposed<00:00:33.370> to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
have a six foot bed they're supposed to

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.509 
have a six foot bed they're supposed to
be<00:00:33.550> about<00:00:33.790> 12<00:00:34.239> inches<00:00:34.390> apart<00:00:35.159> we're<00:00:36.159> not<00:00:36.280> being

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
be about 12 inches apart we're not being

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.100 
be about 12 inches apart we're not being
real<00:00:36.670> precise<00:00:37.059> about<00:00:37.239> it<00:00:37.510> you<00:00:37.659> can<00:00:37.780> see<00:00:37.960> the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
real precise about it you can see the

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.430 
real precise about it you can see the
tape<00:00:38.320> measure<00:00:38.589> here<00:00:39.100> but<00:00:39.820> like<00:00:40.329> I<00:00:40.480> said<00:00:40.540> 12

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
tape measure here but like I said 12

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.189 
tape measure here but like I said 12
inches<00:00:41.739> doesn't<00:00:42.100> actually<00:00:42.220> mean<00:00:42.550> literally

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
inches doesn't actually mean literally

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.950 
inches doesn't actually mean literally
12<00:00:44.199> inches<00:00:44.559> from<00:00:44.710> here<00:00:45.220> to<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.120> next<00:00:46.449> one<00:00:46.629> it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
12 inches from here to the next one it

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.160 
12 inches from here to the next one it
means<00:00:47.290> in<00:00:47.620> diameter<00:00:48.250> so<00:00:48.909> we<00:00:49.390> have<00:00:49.540> about<00:00:49.750> six

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
means in diameter so we have about six

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.920 
means in diameter so we have about six
inches<00:00:50.379> from<00:00:50.680> here<00:00:51.070> to<00:00:51.579> here<00:00:51.820> and<00:00:52.089> about<00:00:52.600> six

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
inches from here to here and about six

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.270 
inches from here to here and about six
inches<00:00:53.140> from<00:00:53.439> here<00:00:53.680> to<00:00:53.769> here<00:00:53.890> so<00:00:54.100> there'll<00:00:54.250> be

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
inches from here to here so there'll be

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.549 
inches from here to here so there'll be
plenty<00:00:54.549> of<00:00:54.790> space<00:00:55.089> for<00:00:55.119> the<00:00:55.420> root<00:00:55.600> ball<00:00:55.780> and

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
plenty of space for the root ball and

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.770 
plenty of space for the root ball and
these<00:00:57.100> peppers<00:00:57.400> don't<00:00:57.759> actually<00:00:58.119> get<00:00:58.299> real

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
these peppers don't actually get real

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.200 
these peppers don't actually get real
big<00:00:59.019> they'll<00:00:59.259> get<00:00:59.439> about<00:00:59.769> Oh<00:01:00.040> two<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:00.939> three

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
big they'll get about Oh two to three

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.320 
big they'll get about Oh two to three
feet<00:01:01.239> tall<00:01:01.689> at<00:01:01.809> most<00:01:02.049> they<00:01:02.949> get<00:01:03.129> about<00:01:03.400> about

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
feet tall at most they get about about

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.749 
feet tall at most they get about about
like<00:01:04.479> that<00:01:04.689> not<00:01:05.049> not<00:01:05.409> real<00:01:05.650> big<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:06.640> can

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
like that not not real big and you can

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.760 
like that not not real big and you can
always<00:01:06.880> prune<00:01:07.180> them<00:01:07.299> back<00:01:07.479> little<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:08.170> hot

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
always prune them back little the hot

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.120 
always prune them back little the hot
peppers<00:01:09.130> don't<00:01:09.369> really<00:01:10.320> take<00:01:11.320> pruning<00:01:11.950> too

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
peppers don't really take pruning too

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.690 
peppers don't really take pruning too
badly<00:01:12.400> so<00:01:13.240> you<00:01:13.329> can<00:01:13.689> you<00:01:14.650> can<00:01:14.860> take<00:01:15.430> them<00:01:15.549> back

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
badly so you can you can take them back

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.880 
badly so you can you can take them back
as<00:01:15.970> needed<00:01:16.360> so<00:01:17.170> what<00:01:17.290> we're<00:01:17.409> going<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.590> do<00:01:17.710> now

six inches from there again we're not

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.169 
six inches from there again we're not
being<00:01:23.380> real<00:01:23.679> precise<00:01:24.130> even<00:01:24.819> though<00:01:24.909> there's<00:01:25.119> a
