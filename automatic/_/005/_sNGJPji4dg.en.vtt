right Teflon pots and pans the Teflon is
a<00:00:06.569> chemical<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:07.020> was<00:00:07.109> created<00:00:07.560> from<00:00:07.680> DuPont

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
a chemical that was created from DuPont

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.730 
a chemical that was created from DuPont
and<00:00:08.910> I'm<00:00:09.000> gonna<00:00:09.120> tell<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:09.420> what<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.750> it's<00:00:10.469> a

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
problem with Teflon there's a price you

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.970 
problem with Teflon there's a price you
gotta<00:00:24.359> pay<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.900> convenience<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
distress if you have birds in the house

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.330 
distress if you have birds in the house
especially<00:00:42.660> birds<00:00:43.559> are<00:00:43.770> affected<00:00:44.190> by<00:00:44.280> this

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
especially birds are affected by this

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.940 
especially birds are affected by this
extremely<00:00:45.090> they<00:00:45.690> could<00:00:45.870> suffer<00:00:46.110> from<00:00:46.320> Teflon

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
extremely they could suffer from Teflon

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.950 
extremely they could suffer from Teflon
toxicosis<00:00:47.640> which<00:00:48.059> causes<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
toxicosis which causes have the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.779 
toxicosis which causes have the
hemorrhage<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.829> stop<00:00:50.070> breathing<00:00:50.640> and

hemorrhage and to stop breathing and
they<00:00:50.879> suffocate<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.230> people<00:00:52.489> this<00:00:53.489> is

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
they suffocate now if people this is

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.069 
they suffocate now if people this is
even<00:00:53.910> been<00:00:54.059> because<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.420> breathe<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> same

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
gonna get a problem called polymer fume

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.070 
gonna get a problem called polymer fume
fever<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.239> influenza<00:01:03.629> you

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
yeah you got this distress going on in

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.300 
yeah you got this distress going on in
your<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.750> your<00:01:09.930> respiratory<00:01:10.110> system<00:01:10.830> well

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
your in your respiratory system well

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.190 
your in your respiratory system well
create<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.790> from<00:01:11.939> chemicals<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:13.020> are

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
create it from chemicals that are

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.280 
create it from chemicals that are
emitting<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> air<00:01:14.220> from<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.689> Teflon

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
emitting the air from this Teflon

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.550 
emitting the air from this Teflon
material<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.820> my<00:01:18.240> suggestion<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.380> want

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
material so my suggestion is if you want

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.460 
material so my suggestion is if you want
to<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.740> safe<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.640> avoid<00:01:20.939> Teflon<00:01:21.659> especially

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
to be safe is to avoid Teflon especially

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.410 
to be safe is to avoid Teflon especially
if<00:01:22.530> you're<00:01:22.619> cooking<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.220> got<00:01:23.430> materials

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
if you're cooking it's got materials

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.300 
if you're cooking it's got materials
that<00:01:24.600> contain<00:01:24.900> carcinogen<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.100> that

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that contain carcinogen in it so that

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.760 
that contain carcinogen in it so that
means<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.000> could<00:01:27.390> cause<00:01:27.570> cancer<00:01:27.960> now

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
means that that could cause cancer now

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.410 
means that that could cause cancer now
let<00:01:29.070> me<00:01:29.130> use<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.759> were<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> straighten

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
let me use have you were to straighten

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.490 
let me use have you were to straighten
something<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> little<00:01:31.140> bit<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.380> that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
something up with a little bit of that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.590 
something up with a little bit of that
kind<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.770> your<00:01:31.950> food<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.520> wouldn't<00:01:33.299> want<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> be

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
kind of your food I wouldn't want to be

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.569 
kind of your food I wouldn't want to be
consuming<00:01:34.110> chemicals<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.860> DuPont<00:01:35.280> made

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
consuming chemicals that DuPont made

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.120 
consuming chemicals that DuPont made
that's<00:01:36.090> known<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.630> cause<00:01:36.840> cancer<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.619> other

that's known to cause cancer and other
respiratory<00:01:38.759> problems<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.350> stay<00:01:41.009> away<00:01:41.189> from

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
respiratory problems so stay away from
