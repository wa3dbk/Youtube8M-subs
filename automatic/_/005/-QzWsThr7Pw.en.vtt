00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.369
 Hello my name is Irina and today I 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.830
 I will tell you about the products of the magician who I 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.560
 recently came want to tell a little 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.039
 I ordered the background from the official 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.750
 their website usa that is not with and our 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.500
 Russian site magician on our 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.920
 Russian site poppy prices 2 times higher 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.980
 exactly twice sometimes even more then 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.899
 There is for example if here is this jar 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.030
 Well, let's say I do not remember how much 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.780
 it was worth this powder well let's say she 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.039
 cost 30 dollars now and here 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.260
 how many grams 30 then 8 grams on our 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.199
 Russian site will cost the same 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.510
 or even ordered 35 dollars through 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.280
 the mediator and the mediators say I will not 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.770
 so that it does not look like advertising girls 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.140
 who are interested write to me in 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.630
 comments there it all depends on weight 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.380
 in advance you can calculate by 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.900
 calculator 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.090
 how much will the delivery cost you i am not 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.400
 I will say that it is a lot I mean 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.040
 ordered 6 products that weighed 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.860
 something 700 grams somewhere 800 fun 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.780
 packaging and I paid for shipping 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.049
 thousands of rubles per week literally 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.659
 probably got to the base of the package itself from 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.840
 mac and somewhere in two three weeks came 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.610
 sending to me is this pretty 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.430
 long probably due to the fact that now 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.680
 new year and very very many parcels 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.890
 as you know is not just e-mail 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.470
 that’s how I’ve done 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.100
 I paid for the delivery of one thousand 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.590
 rubles 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.509
 considering i bought 6 products and 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.939
 they were all two times cheaper 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.799
 than on our russian site i 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.590
 pretty much saved and that is 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.710
 I spent 7000 on whether I have my 6 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.829
 It took 6000 I took you all this 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.509
 parcel entirely if i were 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.180
 would order from our site it would 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.729
 cost me probably 12 or even 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.319
 no longer get on now 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.440
 directly to the product itself 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.060
 and ordered and two shadows 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.400
 like in matte in shade mode and curry 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.340
 beautiful shades of this shade 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.340
 it is very very easy to control by applying it 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.880
 on its not for example the hanging eyelid 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.550
 there is a darken it and here's this one 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.560
 huawei he so know purple 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.720
 a little hit that is such 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.840
 beautiful same shade for daytime 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.330
 make-up here these two colors are quite 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.730
 enough it is applied to all 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.010
 directly century this little bit in 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.100
 the corners of the eyes and it turns out very beautiful 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.970
 decent daytime makeup so next 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.190
 lipstick shaded lip cream called 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.640
 planets by long 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.010
 sorry are called like this way and 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.610
 It looks like this absolutely simple 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.810
 pomade 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.450
 but this is probably my merit let's say 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.920
 many inappropriate color for me now 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.250
 on my lips and honestly 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.840
 there is another such lipstick in my 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.660
 Now I show you the one that I have 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.140
 was the one that came to me I did not find 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.870
 can 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.590
 because the one that came to me was 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.750
 by far 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.010
 pink that is there was so saturated 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.110
 pink shade 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.360
 which obviously didn't suit me already 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.700
 Now it is painted and in my opinion it is in 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.410
 principle not to say that they don't suit me 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.320
 but I can't find my second 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.570
 in general, sweets are well kept 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.840
 perfectly moisturize lips but it is an attachment 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.209
 comes off quickly and remains on the lips like 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.130
 as if just a pigment lips become 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.390
 a little sticky i mean they stick together 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.280
 among themselves but with a touch guess already 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.310
 I probably shouldn't order anymore 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.420
 lipstick from mac because i'm not the first time 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.070
 already the third time and I get into a mess 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.640
 the next is powder which i am very 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.470
 very long wanted transparent powder 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.720
 Matting in my opinion from mac 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.850
 if they are mistaken she's so white 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.290
 the colors are perfectly fixed 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.570
 Well, at least my makeup so she 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.789
 gives you know right if on hand 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.110
 Watch something light whiteness gives but when 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.750
 brush on face 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.560
 this is almost no visible skin 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.979
 such becomes more even such 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.830
 smooth know with such shine how to be 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.750
 healthy inside me this powder is very 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.159
 I liked it very much and now 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.979
 will enjoy use and 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:45.080
 use only her next product 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.879
 this is a fixer from mac to start 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.409
 I did not at first could not even understand how 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:51.500
 open it thought he came to me 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:53.599
 broken ie could not bring him 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.090
 in order that I want to tell you about 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:58.580
 latch specifically right how much time 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.770
 thoughtful your makeup will last i say 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.750
 I can not but he is not the best 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.199
 sprayer meaning it is not sprayed as 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.840
 would be right so finely fine and and much yes 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.210
 as usual spray does he somehow in 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.240
 one point there are several points y so 1 1 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.009
 1 immediately and all that is necessary pshikat 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.680
 several times drops pretty 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:21.169
 big face becomes very shiny 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.969
 and wet somewhere in a minute it's all 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.990
 light but light shine absorbed 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:29.029
 of course it remains and in principle the thing 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.589
 not bad as already said that not yet 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:32.839
 I can say exactly how much is with him 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:33.860
 holding make up sure to say in 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:36.139
 next videos 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.219
 Well, the last product that I am very 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.330
 happy it's blush in the shade of the brain it's 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:44.449
 matte blush 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.159
 I have long wanted a special rouge myself 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.900
 probably the first dry blush which 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.460
 buy lately that is 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.360
 the last time I was keen only 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.460
 creams this is a very very cool blush 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.800
 they have a beautiful shade of cold 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.919
 just for my face color pattern 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.810
 Now I have it on my cheeks immediately say 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.719
 that the camera generally conveys absolutely by 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.169
 my other color but it seems to me they 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:11.839
 very cool very long they keep 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.759
 and they have the noblest shade 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:17.150
 who rarely meet 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:18.979
 and so there is only one minus blush not 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.189
 It is worth typing on a brush like this 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:24.080
 way and apply like this a very rouge 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:26.479
 heavily pigmented not necessary there 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.289
 poke at them is enough to hold one 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.990
 once and 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:32.599
 the product will be on your brush the problem in 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.060
 than when you poke like that 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.660
 and apply it in this way 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.270
 you have cheeks here 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.120
 it will not work such a light veil and yes 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.900
 and there will be such spots 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.880
 pigmented that is due to that 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.160
 that you got me on very pigmented 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.330
 but for me it is absolutely not a problem I 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.690
 put edge 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.660
 oh with the brush plane I type like this 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.490
 Here is the way I go on the brush 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.970
 enough product for me and 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:03.810
 I put on my face once more I say 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:06.570
 absolutely natural shade not 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:09.990
 some kind of red not pink but he 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:14.400
 this is more likely to go into such 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:16.500
 some kind of boas light up to such something 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.690
 this is perhaps a bit like on 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.450
 would harmonize at least shorter 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:24.300
 blush awesome if you are not confused by them 

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:26.280
 good pigmentation and brush application 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.200
 in the right way, be sure to have them 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.830
 get yourself because well really 

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:36.090
 In fact, the shade is just the smartest is better 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:38.220
 Blush with such a better shade I do not 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:41.730
 I guess I never even had 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:44.190
 that is, it is absolutely cool blush here 

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.510
 it was all my order from mac girls i 

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.760
 I hope you liked to write 

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:50.130
 products that you love from this company 

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.710
 or from any other and be sure to them 

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.900
 look after girls remember beauty 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:59.000
 shines from the inside go off nicely and inside and 

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.000
 out and see you yet
