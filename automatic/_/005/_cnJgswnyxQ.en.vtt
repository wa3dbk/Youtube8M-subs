 ahmed sassi negative for mid-evening services three balls by

 his ticket not for saving bullets but simply for the 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.930
 reduction of animal suffering because 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.890
 read more feel cleanly 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.400
 and moreover we are efficient 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.660
 in this new world 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.660
 other atmosphere 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.260
 I made my weapons 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.460
 I suffer too 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.460
 woerth 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.900
 bolt took one of the last finalists in the region his passion and 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.500
 the idea of ​​dead animals to fill them with straw 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.100
 none of that ten teams quite the contrary a form of expression of his 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.680
 love for nature naturalization would extend 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.659
 the existence of small animals 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.650
 to date the marmot 180 seeded are 70 being shot 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.729
 funny idea thanks to hunters 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.770
 but not only 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.289
 once a month 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.289
 I make little tripoli poodles 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.440
 she does this because she is pregnant or not like the others 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.169
 but so far to sommières 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.889
 we can all the time at this point 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.319
 but it's going to get up and to date something 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.929
 for the sum of 7 seconds 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:18.169
 it is to the person a thing that pastors moment of the good heads of 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:20.669
 heating is not done 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:22.219
 sometimes a little bit 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.859
 because my wife still 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.859
 the site is not it according to her the head of hunting for bargains 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.769
 at the request of the sort no doubt more what could be the speech of 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:33.810
 launch of the rally 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.560
 to obernai crisis if we did not really broadcast for 15 years his 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.840
 most beautiful piece is worth 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.180
 35000 euros the first prices start at 1000 euros with such a nice rifle with 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.459
 their big stunt dogs breed 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.499
 and their beautiful pair of boots the hunters smiles only zurich 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.410
 I think yes% the purchase is a 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.579
 gold maybe of luxury now it's true that 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.540
 we are all trying to make an effort for young people who want to get involved 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.119
 after we try fictitiously to find the choice of good opportunities we try 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:05.919
 to advise them 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.149
 the high level of hunters also where you have companies today 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:11.919
 hunting that offers young people to hunt with that without funding 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.799
 with help to do some work 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.209
 when we can see you the price of 1 1 billion years iphone or the price 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.209
 from a laptop or the private of other things 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.499
 these are also important budgets 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:27.719
 alsace today has less than fourteen thousand hunters for their 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:29.319
 number drops every year 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.989
 buying on the internet one of the future victims of the crisis 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.129
 but I hear for thirty years that tomorrow we will chase him more 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.379
 so I think in thirty years will also sing again
