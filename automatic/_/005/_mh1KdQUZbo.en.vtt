 when you get this machine going 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.470
 to be able to see the parts so that

 has all the things that the machine uses 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:15.800
 then you are going to be able to

 have their own parts and you can 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.420
 Let's say we know that this accessory is for 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.720
 that you can mainly because 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:31.010
 let's say some part even come 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.870
 its flavors also the needles so that 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.220
 you can replace your needle this 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.290
 I'll show you later 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.730
 we go in the bottom part so that 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.430
 you see 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.420
 let's see here come here it gets here 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.330
 opposite let's see the engine and can 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.470
 see you here here is where the 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.460
 machine 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.640
 it turns off and turns on what we learned 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:01.380
 the stress and the machine is on 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:05.160
 we turn off here the machine turns off now 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.819
 when you connect your machine 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.810
 has its own cable 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.909
 own cancels the connection and well 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.650
 you make your connection of you in 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.170
 your own house 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.530
 then say no longer connect 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.900
 machine that we say in a way that 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.830
 be sure for us to say 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:32.620
 good but then we are seeing 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.660
 that this is the machine advice 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.570
 something also that you would like 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.570
 you see here at the bottom is the 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:44.260
 engine that has this machine here can 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:48.100
 see your engine and there let's say you 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.540
 can see the capacity of the force 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.840
 now let's go down a little bit here 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.120
 down we also have the pedal where 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.120
 you say later I'm going to 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.370
 teach how they are going to teach you to 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.670
 control the machine here has another of 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:08.420
 the parties and this is usually used 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:11.390
 to lift the foot then when it 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.370
 do this you can see in a bind 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.670
 this part and this is when you use 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.760
 your knees on the bottom and 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:22.060
 you see how he lifts his foot in 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.880
 top part 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.240
 very well another part that I want 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.120
 teach them 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:34.560
 here is for when you go to 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.319
 deliver your life then it 's all this 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.810
 you do not use it for when they go to 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:42.599
 entangle you can put your taxi 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:46.110
 reel whatever you want to call him and they put it 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:47.759
 there and now let's say it's going to be that 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.930
 this way we 're going to do it I'm going to 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:54.569
 teach when I teach them how to sew 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.840
 then this is the first video that 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:02.280
 We have shown remember the machine 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:05.370
