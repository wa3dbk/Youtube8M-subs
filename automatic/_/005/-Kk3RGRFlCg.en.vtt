00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
released factions I want to start work

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.940 
released factions I want to start work
on<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.760> arcade<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.630> know<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.050> arcade<00:02:49.410> sign<00:02:49.770> has

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
on the arcade I know the arcade sign has

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.430 
on the arcade I know the arcade sign has
been<00:02:50.100> in<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.700> hub<00:02:50.910> for<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.180> long<00:02:51.600> time<00:02:52.020> now<00:02:52.230> I

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
been in the hub for a long time now I

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.250 
been in the hub for a long time now I
started<00:02:52.740> work<00:02:52.890> on<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.970> kind<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.750> got<00:02:54.870> up<00:02:55.050> and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
started work on it it kind of got up and

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.380 
started work on it it kind of got up and
then<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.070> went<00:02:56.190> down<00:02:56.490> there<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:56.940> never<00:02:57.090> sort

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
then it went down there that never sort

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.690 
then it went down there that never sort
of<00:02:57.480> came<00:02:57.600> back<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.860> reason<00:02:59.220> being<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.670> because

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
of came back the reason being is because

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.210 
of came back the reason being is because
things<00:03:00.560> when<00:03:01.560> they're<00:03:01.680> not<00:03:01.890> made

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
things when they're not made

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.280 
things when they're not made
specifically<00:03:02.880> don't<00:03:03.330> integrate<00:03:03.600> nicely<00:03:04.110> I

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
specifically don't integrate nicely I

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.040 
specifically don't integrate nicely I
wanted<00:03:05.010> set<00:03:05.220> up<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:05.550> when<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.790> win<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.030> game<00:03:06.240> it

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
wanted set up so when you win a game it

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.290 
wanted set up so when you win a game it
gives<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.890> reward<00:03:08.010> which<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.120> can<00:03:09.270> then

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
gives you a reward which you can then

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.970 
gives you a reward which you can then
use<00:03:09.690> in<00:03:09.930> other<00:03:10.080> games<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.650> things<00:03:10.770> like<00:03:10.920> that

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
use in other games and things like that

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.350 
use in other games and things like that
I<00:03:11.130> just<00:03:11.340> want<00:03:11.460> them<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.610> all<00:03:11.850> merge<00:03:12.060> seamlessly

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
I just want them to all merge seamlessly

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.810 
I just want them to all merge seamlessly
so<00:03:12.780> for<00:03:12.990> that<00:03:13.080> reason<00:03:13.460> when<00:03:14.460> we<00:03:14.580> get<00:03:14.730> the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
so for that reason when we get the

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.520 
so for that reason when we get the
arcade<00:03:15.150> done<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.600> all<00:03:15.810> going<00:03:15.960> to<00:03:16.020> be<00:03:16.140> custom

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
arcade done it is all going to be custom

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.260 
arcade done it is all going to be custom
made<00:03:16.560> everything<00:03:17.220> is<00:03:17.340> going<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.550> be<00:03:17.640> coded<00:03:18.000> for

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
made everything is going to be coded for

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.480 
made everything is going to be coded for
Kiwi<00:03:18.660> servers<00:03:19.080> I'm<00:03:19.590> going<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.010> put<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.190> lot<00:03:20.460> of

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
Kiwi servers I'm going to put a lot of

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.070 
Kiwi servers I'm going to put a lot of
money<00:03:20.730> into<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.240> it<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.690> going<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.050> be

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
money into it and it is going to be

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.440 
money into it and it is going to be
amazing<00:03:22.320> so<00:03:22.740> that's<00:03:23.610> not<00:03:23.790> just<00:03:24.150> around<00:03:24.360> the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450
