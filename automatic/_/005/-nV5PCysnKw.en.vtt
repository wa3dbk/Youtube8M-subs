00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.240
 hi friends how are you welcome 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.220
 again to my channel I am neither of flowers and 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.830
 this day will be teaching you how 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.719
 prepare some rolls of creamy lasagna 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.709
 so let's see what are the 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:17.340
 ingredients 8 layers of lasagna 6 ounces 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:21.009
 of cream cheese at room temperature 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.099
 half a teaspoon of garlic powder one 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:27.939
 cup of mozzarella cheese half cup of 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:31.300
 Parmesan cheese half a cup of milk 2 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:34.510
 shredded chicken cups a spoonful 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.780
 and a half of fresh parsley sauce 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.910
 Italian tomato before you start all 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.370
 let's boil the lasagna as we 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.880
 says the package as we have it ready 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.910
 let's move on to the next step 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.540
 Now let's beat the cream cheese 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.430
 with garlic powder 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.560
 and remember that cream cheese has to 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.750
 be at room temperature so that 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.750
 can make creamy and not be too hard 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.800
 Now we add the mozzarella cheese 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.409
 here 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.409
 you have to overcome my healthy 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.690
 and like a spatula or like a spoon 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.690
 let's mix everything very well 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.470
 since everything is very well combined 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.470
 let's add the milk 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.410
 do not 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.960
 we follow them music 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.270
 if they see that they have been very very 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.869
 liquid can be added a little more 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.869
 of mozzarella cheese 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.420
 now finally we are going to add the 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.420
 chicken 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.290
 and the parsley 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.659
 we're going to mix everything well 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.630
 now in the container we are not going to 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.640
 put in the oven can be glass can 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.319
 also be aluminum must be 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.240
 big enough so that 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.240
 fit the lasagna rolls 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.530
 let's talk a little about our sauce 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.150
 I've already bought it, but if 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.770
 you want to do it at home 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.300
 they can also do it 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.300
 let's put a little 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.230
 in the bottom of the container for 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.879
 that we are not going to stick our eyes 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.370
 it is not necessary that we put 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.739
 butter or that we put ac 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.810
 oil to the people so that it does not go away 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.250
 to take off because the salsita is going to be the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.540
 that will help us so that we are not 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.540
 the others can operate 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.269
 now let's grab one of the pieces 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.670
 of lasagna that we already have prepared 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.069
 It has to be very careful because 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.489
 already cooked is very easy to leave us 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.489
 to buy 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.540
 and we're going to add a little bit of the chicken with 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.540
 cheese that we have prepared 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.560
 until covering the entire layer of lasagna 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.460
 and as always his hands for this step 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.720
 It has to be very very clean because 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.720
 we are touching the food 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.540
 we're going to start rolling 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.640
 many looked 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.650
 squeezing a little at the same time 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.650
 let's roll up so it's sinking 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.330
 until we stay like a snail 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.330
 milestone or something 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.930
 let's put it on the container that 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.930
 we have prepared 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.090
 i 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.390
 Y 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.640
 the recipe is for 8 but my container 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.090
 nothing else they met me 6 but the recipe 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.370
 you will reach for 8 rolls 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.260
 Now that we are ready and we will 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.260
 add a little of the sauce on top 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.740
 so that we can not stay so 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.740
 parched 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.930
 and we are going to add cheese to it 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.400
 mozzarella or if you like it too 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.400
 it may be that super table does not 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.340
 we will cover it with the domain 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.669
 and we're going to put it in our oven 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:52.440
 preheated to 350 degrees French by 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.440
 approximately 25 minutes 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.380
 after the 25 minutes have passed 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.360
 we take it out we uncover it and return it to 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.330
 put in about 10 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.580
