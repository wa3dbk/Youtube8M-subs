00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the edge because I don't like having

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.639 
the edge because I don't like having
this<00:00:32.550> part<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.059> my<00:00:33.210> sketch<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.079> naked<00:00:34.500> edge

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
forward to get that triangle shape you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.830 
forward to get that triangle shape you
can<00:00:58.230> make<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.590> angle<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.550> like<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> side

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
can make the angle here like on the side

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.209 
can make the angle here like on the side
like<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.230> did<00:01:01.440> or<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.770> make<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
like I did or you can make it in the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.759 
like I did or you can make it in the
center<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.000> that's<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.359> first<00:01:03.769> crisscross

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
center so that's the first crisscross

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.580 
center so that's the first crisscross
the<00:01:05.339> next<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.600> make<00:01:06.869> sure<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.350> sort

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the next one and make sure that you sort

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.859 
the next one and make sure that you sort
of<00:01:07.729> find<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.090> with<00:01:09.270> your<00:01:09.450> hand<00:01:09.659> gray

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
because it can come undone so now you

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.390 
because it can come undone so now you
need<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.060> make<00:01:12.240> another<00:01:12.600> one<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:14.159> left

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
now when I wrap it around I sort of

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.310 
now when I wrap it around I sort of
create<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.890> third<00:02:33.250> crisscross<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:35.019> try<00:02:35.260> and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320

I<00:03:03.319> have<00:03:04.189> a<00:03:04.310> habit<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:04.640> doing<00:03:04.849> it<00:03:05.060> but<00:03:05.239> don't<00:03:05.659> do

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
I have a habit of doing it but don't do

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.690 
I have a habit of doing it but don't do
it<00:03:05.989> not<00:03:06.200> with<00:03:07.780> this<00:03:08.780> is<00:03:08.989> I'm<00:03:09.890> point<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.400> bit<00:03:10.579> I

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
it not with this is I'm point a bit I

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.380 
it not with this is I'm point a bit I
don't<00:03:10.939> like<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.780> should<00:03:12.349> just<00:03:12.470> fall<00:03:12.739> down

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
don't like that it should just fall down

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.789 
don't like that it should just fall down
smoothly<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.780> reason<00:03:15.109> why<00:03:15.260> it's<00:03:15.439> not<00:03:15.530> is

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
smoothly and the reason why it's not is

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.319 
smoothly and the reason why it's not is
because<00:03:15.920> when<00:03:16.189> I<00:03:16.250> first<00:03:16.609> did<00:03:16.760> my<00:03:16.819> scarf<00:03:17.239> II

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
because when I first did my scarf II

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.929 
because when I first did my scarf II
know<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.659> didn't<00:03:17.989> like<00:03:18.109> the<00:03:18.290> naked<00:03:18.470> edge<00:03:18.939> here

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
know I didn't like the naked edge here

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.020 
know I didn't like the naked edge here
so<00:03:20.209> I<00:03:21.170> folded<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:21.829> now<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.549> need<00:03:22.609> to<00:03:22.879> maintain

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
so I folded it now I need to maintain

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.509 
so I folded it now I need to maintain
that<00:03:23.450> fold<00:03:23.689> all<00:03:23.989> throughout<00:03:24.379> the<00:03:24.590> scarf<00:03:24.920> so

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
that fold all throughout the scarf so

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.030 
that fold all throughout the scarf so
basically<00:03:26.060> at<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.420> end<00:03:26.629> when<00:03:27.620> I<00:03:27.650> bring<00:03:27.889> it

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
basically at the end when I bring it

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.069 
basically at the end when I bring it
across<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.430> naturally<00:03:28.790> comes<00:03:29.000> over<00:03:29.329> weak<00:03:29.870> that

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
across it naturally comes over weak that

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:38.180 
across it naturally comes over weak that
fold<00:03:30.409> I<00:03:30.620> need<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.920> maintain<00:03:31.129> that<00:03:31.700> fold<00:03:32.030> right

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:47.450 

so<00:03:38.760> now<00:03:40.280> when<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.400> pin<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.730> down<00:03:45.800> it<00:03:46.800> should<00:03:47.160> stay

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
so now when I pin it down it should stay

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.940 
so now when I pin it down it should stay
down<00:03:48.020> okay<00:03:49.020> great<00:03:50.780> so<00:03:51.780> I'm<00:03:52.200> pretty<00:03:52.440> happy<00:03:52.710> with

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
down okay great so I'm pretty happy with

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.190 
down okay great so I'm pretty happy with
that<00:03:53.060> sometimes<00:03:54.060> if<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:54.480> like<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:54.840> can<00:03:54.990> show

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
that sometimes if you like you can show

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.800 
that sometimes if you like you can show
less<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.620> your<00:03:55.800> cat<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.760> I'm<00:03:57.300> actually<00:03:57.480> showing

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
less of your cat so I'm actually showing

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.570 
less of your cat so I'm actually showing
quite<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.170> bit<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.620> scarf<00:03:58.920> Falls<00:03:59.250> quite

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
quite a bit of the scarf Falls quite

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.170 
quite a bit of the scarf Falls quite
nicely<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:01.140> again<00:04:01.770> it's<00:04:02.040> very<00:04:02.160> long<00:04:02.640> on<00:04:03.120> one

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
nicely and again it's very long on one

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.060 
nicely and again it's very long on one
side<00:04:03.840> because<00:04:05.030> you<00:04:06.030> can<00:04:06.270> do<00:04:06.570> it<00:04:06.600> um<00:04:07.110> towards

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
side because you can do it um towards

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.950 
side because you can do it um towards
the<00:04:08.340> back<00:04:08.490> as<00:04:08.700> well<00:04:08.820> so<00:04:09.120> as<00:04:09.540> long<00:04:09.690> as<00:04:09.840> you've

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
the back as well so as long as you've

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.990 
the back as well so as long as you've
got<00:04:09.990> a<00:04:10.200> base<00:04:10.440> so<00:04:11.250> you're<00:04:11.430> bringing<00:04:11.610> it<00:04:11.910> around

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
got a base so you're bringing it around

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.320 
got a base so you're bringing it around
and<00:04:13.040> then<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.220> literally<00:04:14.610> just<00:04:17.060> make<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.090> nun

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
and then you literally just make a nun

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.850 
and then you literally just make a nun
layer<00:04:19.070> it's<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.280> same<00:04:20.520> thing<00:04:20.820> is<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.209> same

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
layer it's the same thing is the same

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.950 
layer it's the same thing is the same
core<00:04:22.860> principle<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:23.760> put<00:04:24.480> your<00:04:24.630> left<00:04:24.840> hand

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
core principle of put your left hand

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.850 
core principle of put your left hand
