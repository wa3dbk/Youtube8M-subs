consistently makes it very far in

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.960 
consistently makes it very far in
tournaments<00:05:07.220> but<00:05:08.220> this<00:05:08.400> was<00:05:08.580> this<00:05:08.910> was

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
tournaments but this was this was

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.939 
tournaments but this was this was
interesting<00:05:09.330> because<00:05:09.630> worth<00:05:10.229> noting<00:05:10.740> is<00:05:10.889> that

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
interesting because worth noting is that

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.189 
interesting because worth noting is that
this<00:05:11.280> tournament<00:05:12.240> was<00:05:12.680> hosted<00:05:14.479> just<00:05:15.479> a<00:05:15.750> few

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
this tournament was hosted just a few

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.110 
this tournament was hosted just a few
hours<00:05:16.229> after<00:05:17.039> the<00:05:17.159> release<00:05:17.310> of<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:17.760> tiller

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
hours after the release of the tiller

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.939 
hours after the release of the tiller
basically<00:05:18.599> so<00:05:18.840> this<00:05:19.139> is<00:05:19.289> a<00:05:19.320> day<00:05:19.620> one

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
basically so this is a day one

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.420 
basically so this is a day one
tournament<00:05:20.400> where<00:05:20.789> players<00:05:21.349> have<00:05:22.349> gotten<00:05:23.190> an

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
tournament where players have gotten an

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.879 
tournament where players have gotten an
idea<00:05:23.820> of<00:05:23.880> which<00:05:24.630> builds<00:05:25.080> work<00:05:25.289> in<00:05:25.470> which<00:05:25.620> don't

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
idea of which builds work in which don't

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.070 
idea of which builds work in which don't
but<00:05:26.610> too<00:05:27.510> little<00:05:27.900> time<00:05:28.260> to<00:05:28.560> know<00:05:28.740> exactly<00:05:29.010> but

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
but too little time to know exactly but

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.719 
but too little time to know exactly but
many<00:05:31.080> of<00:05:31.229> the<00:05:31.320> players<00:05:31.500> were<00:05:31.919> aware<00:05:32.250> of<00:05:32.310> course

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
many of the players were aware of course

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.350 
many of the players were aware of course
of<00:05:32.909> the<00:05:33.030> strength<00:05:33.330> of<00:05:33.570> cavalry<00:05:34.080> and<00:05:34.289> the

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
of the strength of cavalry and the

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.790 
of the strength of cavalry and the
strength<00:05:36.360> of<00:05:36.539> the<00:05:36.659> two<00:05:36.870> boats<00:05:37.139> are<00:05:37.349> cavalry

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
strength of the two boats are cavalry

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.240 
strength of the two boats are cavalry
and<00:05:38.010> the<00:05:38.880> two<00:05:39.030> motor<00:05:39.500> are<00:05:40.500> so<00:05:40.680> powerful<00:05:40.889> that

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
and the two motor are so powerful that

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.879 
and the two motor are so powerful that
they<00:05:41.669> have<00:05:41.940> actually<00:05:42.150> been<00:05:42.510> banned<00:05:42.990> in<00:05:43.409> some

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
they have actually been banned in some

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.500 
they have actually been banned in some
recent<00:05:44.220> tournaments<00:05:44.639> and<00:05:44.849> I<00:05:45.000> think<00:05:45.240> they

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
recent tournaments and I think they

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.279 
recent tournaments and I think they
might<00:05:45.840> be<00:05:45.870> bound<00:05:46.560> or<00:05:46.919> severely<00:05:47.370> limited<00:05:47.909> in

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
might be bound or severely limited in

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.250 
might be bound or severely limited in
other<00:05:49.289> tournaments<00:05:49.889> as<00:05:49.949> well<00:05:50.810> so<00:05:51.810> I<00:05:51.840> hope<00:05:52.080> you

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
other tournaments as well so I hope you

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.770 
other tournaments as well so I hope you
enjoyed<00:05:52.560> these<00:05:53.010> battles<00:05:53.490> I<00:05:53.729> think<00:05:54.510> there<00:05:54.690> were

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
enjoyed these battles I think there were

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.899 
enjoyed these battles I think there were
a<00:05:54.810> lot<00:05:55.020> of<00:05:55.050> good<00:05:55.380> there<00:05:56.280> were<00:05:56.370> a<00:05:56.400> lot<00:05:56.460> of<00:05:56.610> good

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:56.909 
a lot of good there were a lot of good

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.770 
a lot of good there were a lot of good

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
ones the pace of cavalry versus infantry

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.620 
ones the pace of cavalry versus infantry

charge<00:06:07.979> by<00:06:08.159> cavalry<00:06:08.490> basically<00:06:08.940> unless<00:06:09.599> they

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
charge by cavalry basically unless they

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.230 
charge by cavalry basically unless they
were<00:06:09.870> using<00:06:10.080> Pikes<00:06:10.440> and<00:06:10.759> being<00:06:11.759> braced<00:06:12.060> and

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
were using Pikes and being braced and

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.899 
were using Pikes and being braced and
stationary<00:06:12.720> but<00:06:13.409> I<00:06:14.099> quite<00:06:14.550> like<00:06:14.760> the

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
stationary but I quite like the

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.530 
stationary but I quite like the
aggressive<00:06:15.060> playstyle<00:06:15.570> this<00:06:16.139> allows

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
aggressive playstyle this allows

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.960 
aggressive playstyle this allows
and<00:06:17.620> this<00:06:18.620> straight<00:06:18.950> up<00:06:19.100> infantry<00:06:19.550> spamming

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
and this straight up infantry spamming

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.910 
and this straight up infantry spamming
doesn't<00:06:20.270> work<00:06:20.450> anymore<00:06:20.690> but<00:06:21.020> I<00:06:21.200> do<00:06:21.320> have<00:06:21.680> some

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:21.920 
doesn't work anymore but I do have some

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.280 
doesn't work anymore but I do have some
concerns<00:06:21.950> about<00:06:22.730> straight<00:06:23.300> up<00:06:23.480> cavalry

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
concerns about straight up cavalry

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.470 
concerns about straight up cavalry
spamming<00:06:24.680> because<00:06:25.490> that<00:06:25.700> definitely<00:06:25.970> works

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
spamming because that definitely works

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.790 
spamming because that definitely works
unless<00:06:27.850> well<00:06:28.850> if<00:06:29.090> an<00:06:29.510> opponent<00:06:29.690> doesn't<00:06:30.470> just

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
unless well if an opponent doesn't just

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.890 
unless well if an opponent doesn't just
pike<00:06:31.130> box<00:06:31.430> then<00:06:31.700> you<00:06:31.820> go<00:06:31.970> to<00:06:32.030> run<00:06:32.330> into<00:06:32.600> trouble

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
pike box then you go to run into trouble

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.740 
pike box then you go to run into trouble
but<00:06:33.160> that's<00:06:34.160> the<00:06:34.370> way<00:06:34.550> I<00:06:34.580> feel<00:06:34.970> the<00:06:35.180> balance<00:06:35.360> of

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
but that's the way I feel the balance of

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.030 
but that's the way I feel the balance of
the<00:06:35.900> game<00:06:36.110> is<00:06:36.380> moving<00:06:36.970> if<00:06:37.970> you<00:06:38.900> basically<00:06:39.470> can

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.040 
the game is moving if you basically can

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.490 
the game is moving if you basically can
win<00:06:40.280> without<00:06:40.490> bringing<00:06:41.090> any<00:06:41.600> or<00:06:41.990> very<00:06:42.020> little

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
win without bringing any or very little

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.290 
win without bringing any or very little
infantry<00:06:43.630> you're<00:06:44.630> coming<00:06:44.930> up<00:06:44.990> against<00:06:45.290> strong

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
infantry you're coming up against strong

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.600 
infantry you're coming up against strong
cavalry<00:06:47.300> factions<00:06:47.720> Pikes<00:06:48.620> are<00:06:48.920> going<00:06:49.280> to<00:06:49.430> be<00:06:49.580> a

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
cavalry factions Pikes are going to be a

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.360 
cavalry factions Pikes are going to be a
very<00:06:49.850> viable<00:06:50.480> counter<00:06:51.200> to<00:06:51.350> that<00:06:51.500> so<00:06:51.830> we<00:06:52.130> might

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
very viable counter to that so we might

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.840 
very viable counter to that so we might
start<00:06:52.730> seeing<00:06:52.970> box<00:06:53.540> versus<00:06:54.550> cavalry<00:06:55.550> spam

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
start seeing box versus cavalry spam

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.780 
start seeing box versus cavalry spam
battles<00:06:56.330> and<00:06:56.570> that's<00:06:56.780> just<00:06:57.080> not<00:06:57.200> fun<00:06:57.650> for

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
battles and that's just not fun for

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.870 
battles and that's just not fun for
anyone<00:06:58.900> so<00:06:59.900> yeah<00:07:00.410> I<00:07:00.440> do<00:07:00.620> like<00:07:01.040> how<00:07:01.310> the<00:07:01.370> cavalry

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:01.880 
anyone so yeah I do like how the cavalry

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.770 
anyone so yeah I do like how the cavalry
works<00:07:02.120> some<00:07:02.660> of<00:07:02.810> the<00:07:02.900> cavalry<00:07:03.260> is<00:07:03.410> too<00:07:03.740> strong

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
works some of the cavalry is too strong

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.990 
works some of the cavalry is too strong
but<00:07:05.780> overall<00:07:06.080> I<00:07:06.440> think<00:07:06.620> Attila<00:07:07.340> in<00:07:07.610> terms<00:07:07.880> of

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
but overall I think Attila in terms of

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.920 
but overall I think Attila in terms of
multiplayer<00:07:08.480> is<00:07:08.810> a<00:07:09.260> more<00:07:10.130> fun<00:07:10.520> game<00:07:10.820> than<00:07:11.240> Rome

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
multiplayer is a more fun game than Rome

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.860 
multiplayer is a more fun game than Rome
to<00:07:12.320> ever<00:07:12.740> was<00:07:13.160> basically<00:07:13.820> and<00:07:14.030> certainly<00:07:14.480> the

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
to ever was basically and certainly the

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.220 
to ever was basically and certainly the
rome<00:07:15.140> 2<00:07:15.410> is<00:07:15.620> at<00:07:15.980> the<00:07:16.340> moment<00:07:17.230> strengthened

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.230 
rome 2 is at the moment strengthened

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.290 
rome 2 is at the moment strengthened
over
