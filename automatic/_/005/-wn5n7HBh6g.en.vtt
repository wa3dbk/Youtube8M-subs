 first thing we'll do 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.280
 to start the installation of our game 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.530
 is to double-click here this is what 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.450
 vine drive that you downloaded the 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.700
 by mega give me a double

 click here and it will ask for a folder in the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.840
 place to extract the files you choose 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.540
 your desktop and click next and 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.470
 will start extracting the paste from our 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.760
 game ben helli drive extraction completed 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.170
 here from the files 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.790
 now we see that there is this part here 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.590
 from the game in our work area to 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.950
 people will remember this folder that ended 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.980
 to extract from a cut let's go there 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.350
 my computer you have my computer 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.850
 choose your local dry disk is the hd 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.100
 your computer comes with program files 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.720
 and 86 here we go. 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.540
 put the peace that we made to 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.640
 extraction behind continue and we will wait 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.820
 here paste will pass in our files 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.140
 x86 programs finish here take off 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.670
 from our game files from 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.650
 programs of 16 we will have this 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.600
 page and that we now enter it into the 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.400
 Binha folder and drive because when 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.590
 people enter here in here the folder of the 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.390
 our game, but we do not have a 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.440
 shortcut our work to start the 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.870
 Our warrior then you will click 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.450
 here in this file on billy drive that is 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.579
 an application with the right button and will 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.109
 choose the one to send to the 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.580
 Work, we'll have a link later. 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.330
 in our work that I came with 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.750
 our 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.360
 we laugh in the middle of it for me and drive 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.580
 and perfect staff our game is already 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.500
 ready to be played everything worked

 very important to me and stay now 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.099
 with the deadpool game showing you 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.229
 well and drive running perfectly 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.849
 here we are person combines daily 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.039
 working perfectly we are here 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.780
 in the sim menu of our simulator is 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.129
 reminding you two things that do not 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.659
 translation is still available for this 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.699
 simulator but as soon as you get out you 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:01.099
 car for you and also that this the 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.349
 initial version of the game is that version 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.699
 that people have early access 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.409
 so there may still be some bugs 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.150
 some things yes I do if it were news 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.460

 here in law is to start here the 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.370
 our simulator already has here the 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:18.319
 first part who loves initial choice 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.779
 I'll start to get to know my 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.919
 simulator is to choose a level is the level 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.389
 that I will want to use to make the 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.919
 test my cars and here it will have 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.199
 several scenarios here just click on the 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.330
 I can see here several 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.490
 scenarios he has to show has 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.460
 The website that is a kart ds da 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.990
 factory industry here we have the 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.729
 of racing and hiroshi he will give me 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.259
 information that each place will 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.659
 do with the vehicle I can choose 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.580
 here what I'm most interested in 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:46.099
 You can choose here to show us 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.900
 It is always from your website that it speaks here that it is 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:50.270
 one rally a track circuit Alijó 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.279
 flowd that has an upload piece to 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.229
 to test vehicles published in 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:57.919
 goal and will start charging and my 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:00.139
 setting and here we are on my track in 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.389
 start track here from my test that I 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.759
 I'll do here and here you several 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.500
 information for you at the beginning of your 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.900
 game as lucky vehicle information 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.789
 at the moment and if you click here 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.069
 you will have several other information 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.289
 such as the vehicles available there for 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.240
 you make your 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.520
 and if you reinforce the idea of ​​what 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.610
 Do you wish we have a buggy here?

 vehicles here you can is to choose the 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.469
 that the information of the problems that 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:28.749
 be there in front of your car and 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:31.449
 we have information on the ground and we have 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:33.430
 here the rendering options right because 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:35.979
 You can observe everything that happens. 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.169
 in its simulation we have the embargo in 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.180
 your local environment you can choose 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.830
 everything including gravity has several 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.080
 things and can do crazy things to choose 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.569
 how would you have Mars Jupiter a sun 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.330
 saturn here you can choose from 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:51.099
 everything and even revealed the speed of 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.509
 simulation for example I 'm doing the 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:53.559
 real-time simulation 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:55.629
 but I can also change the speed 

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:56.169
 twice four times ten times and all 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:58.719
 more 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:00.249
 we have here are also the effects that are 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:02.529
 information including the effects have 

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:04.569
 that the field of lists division and effects 

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:05.949
 can still improve the 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:08.830
 performance of your video card during 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:11.740
 these very crazy simulations that have 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.539
 here and so you have to move and 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.339
 discovered that there are several things that 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:16.659
 have you can see who else he too 

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:19.149
 will give you information here from 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:21.639
 instruments you can use is when 

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:22.899
 you're doing your tests and so 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:25.240
 you will choose what you want to put 

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:27.879
 the screen is moving and doing all its 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.279
 possible tests of vehicles in 

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:31.779
 components of vehicles and so this is 

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:33.219
 for more advanced users 

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:34.839
 interest in this type of software 

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:36.370
 cits tool that is considered a 

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:38.860
 but also a simulator at the same time. 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.229
 time depends on the level of fun that 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.149
 you in singles you find when 

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:45.129
 you are faced with a type of game like 

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:47.019
 this and that another staff there
