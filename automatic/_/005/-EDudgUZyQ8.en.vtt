and you can see although the picture is
a<00:00:57.690> little<00:00:57.930> grainy<00:00:58.200> you<00:00:58.710> can<00:00:59.220> see<00:00:59.550> me<00:00:59.730> quite

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
a little grainy you can see me quite

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.060 
a little grainy you can see me quite
clearly<00:01:00.330> so<00:01:00.720> it<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.290> camera<00:01:01.590> does<00:01:01.800> work

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
clearly so it this camera does work

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.299 
clearly so it this camera does work
pretty<00:01:02.370> well<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.670> low<00:01:03.150> light<00:01:03.949> I'm<00:01:04.949> gonna<00:01:05.190> turn

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
pretty well in low light I'm gonna turn

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.670 
pretty well in low light I'm gonna turn
the<00:01:05.430> lights<00:01:05.580> back<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.479> we'll<00:01:07.410> give<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.590> a

the lights back on and we'll give it a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.530 
the lights back on and we'll give it a
second<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.160> switch<00:01:08.310> back<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.700> daytime<00:01:09.270> color

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

was<00:01:39.480> a<00:01:39.510> little<00:01:39.930> bit<00:01:40.050> grainy<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.560> low-light<00:01:40.950> I

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
was a little bit grainy in low-light I

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.710

was able to make out objects in the room
quite<00:01:43.020> well<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:44.040> was<00:01:44.160> not<00:01:44.280> expecting<00:01:44.490> that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
quite well and I was not expecting that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.540 
quite well and I was not expecting that

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
I would recommend this camera mostly for

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.940 
I would recommend this camera mostly for
surveillance<00:01:47.880> installations<00:01:48.180> where<00:01:49.140> most<00:01:49.680> or
