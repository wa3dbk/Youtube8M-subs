well<00:00:02.190> it's<00:00:02.340> always<00:00:02.550> fun<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:02.970> make<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.840> video

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
well it's always fun to make a video

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.900 
well it's always fun to make a video
about<00:00:04.319> one<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.740> these<00:00:04.890> this<00:00:05.370> is<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.549> recent

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
about one of these this is a recent

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.280 
about one of these this is a recent
video<00:00:06.330> from<00:00:06.810> NASA<00:00:07.610> they<00:00:08.610> are<00:00:09.019> noting<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.170> way

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
video from NASA they are noting the way

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.440 
video from NASA they are noting the way
that<00:00:10.469> stars<00:00:10.860> form<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.759> they're<00:00:12.210> noticing

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
that stars form and they're noticing

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.789 
that stars form and they're noticing
something<00:00:12.780> kind<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.110> interesting<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.679> they

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
something kind of interesting that they

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.320 
something kind of interesting that they
can't<00:00:14.040> quite<00:00:14.280> explain<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:15.000> let<00:00:15.120> me<00:00:15.210> go<00:00:15.299> ahead

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
can't quite explain so let me go ahead

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.689 
can't quite explain so let me go ahead
and<00:00:15.599> play<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.379> guys<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.980> then<00:00:17.609> I'm

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
and play this for you guys and then I'm

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.700 
and play this for you guys and then I'm
going<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.910> explain<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.359> for<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:21.710> strawberries

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
going to explain it for you strawberries

going to explain it for you strawberries
have<00:00:22.859> long<00:00:23.070> thought<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.699> star<00:00:24.210> clusters

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
have long thought that star clusters

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.630 
have long thought that star clusters
form<00:00:25.170> when<00:00:25.470> clouds<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:26.010> gas<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.580> dust

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
form when clouds of gas and dust

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.179 
form when clouds of gas and dust
condense<00:00:27.510> constructing<00:00:28.380> themselves<00:00:29.039> from

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
findings are counterintuitive means we

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.670 
findings are counterintuitive means we
must<00:00:57.090> think<00:00:57.390> harder<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.020> come<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.469> more

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
must think harder and come up with more

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.090 
must think harder and come up with more
ideas<00:00:58.789> of<00:00:59.789> how<00:01:00.000> stars<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.870> our<00:01:01.020> Sun<00:01:03.589> so<00:01:04.589> NASA

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
ideas of how stars like our Sun so NASA

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.460 
ideas of how stars like our Sun so NASA
is<00:01:05.430> surprised<00:01:05.850> at<00:01:06.240> why<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> stars<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
is surprised at why the stars on the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.469 
is surprised at why the stars on the
outer<00:01:07.650> side<00:01:08.070> outer<00:01:08.280> part<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.820> formation

outer side outer part of the formation

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.050 
outer side outer part of the formation
are<00:01:09.979> older<00:01:10.979> than<00:01:11.130> they<00:01:11.280> would<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
are older than they would be on the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.990

we're<00:01:15.270> looking<00:01:16.110> at<00:01:16.229> biblical<00:01:16.770> texts<00:01:17.310> and

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
we're looking at biblical texts and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.080 
we're looking at biblical texts and
ancient<00:01:19.140> texts<00:01:19.590> are<00:01:19.860> important<00:01:20.759> because<00:01:20.909> they

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
ancient texts are important because they

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.870 
ancient texts are important because they
give<00:01:21.360> us<00:01:21.479> information<00:01:21.810> about<00:01:22.200> cosmology<00:01:22.890> not

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
give us information about cosmology not

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120 
give us information about cosmology not
just<00:01:24.180> information<00:01:24.390> about<00:01:25.110> theology<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:26.009> they

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
just information about theology but they

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.010 
just information about theology but they
also<00:01:26.280> give<00:01:26.640> us<00:01:26.729> information<00:01:27.000> about<00:01:27.330> cosmology

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
also give us information about cosmology

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.690 
also give us information about cosmology
and<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.100> way<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> universe<00:01:29.610> works<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:32.040> what

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
and the way the universe works so what

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.840 
and the way the universe works so what
we<00:01:32.850> see<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.780> jobe<00:01:34.049> 99<00:01:34.590> he<00:01:35.130> made<00:01:35.490> all

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
we see here is in jobe 99 he made all

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.179 
we see here is in jobe 99 he made all

better term and they discovered it one
year<00:02:02.700> after<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.390> discovered<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.320> because<00:02:04.649> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
year after I discovered it because I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.499 
year after I discovered it because I
noticed<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.250> these<00:02:05.369> cathedrals<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:06.299> they

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
noticed in these cathedrals that they

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.499 
noticed in these cathedrals that they
were<00:02:06.890> always<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.310> these<00:02:08.459> angels<00:02:09.000> circling

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
were always have these angels circling

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.390 
were always have these angels circling
around<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.869> bright<00:02:10.229> tetragrammaton<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
around this bright tetragrammaton in the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.760 
around this bright tetragrammaton in the
middle<00:02:11.670> which<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.060> same<00:02:12.270> as<00:02:12.390> what<00:02:12.510> we

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
middle which is the same as what we

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.640 
middle which is the same as what we
here<00:02:13.360> what<00:02:14.360> they<00:02:14.450> don't<00:02:14.570> realize<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:15.470> that

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
here what they don't realize is that

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.260 
here what they don't realize is that
these<00:02:15.860> black<00:02:16.220> holes<00:02:16.520> or<00:02:16.850> whatever<00:02:17.120> these

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
these black holes or whatever these

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.410 
these black holes or whatever these
anomalies<00:02:17.840> are<00:02:18.490> they're<00:02:19.490> actually<00:02:19.940> producing

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
anomalies are they're actually producing

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.940 
anomalies are they're actually producing
the<00:02:20.510> stars<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.740> if<00:02:22.010> they<00:02:22.190> produce<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.760> stars

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
the stars so if they produce the stars

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.160 
the stars so if they produce the stars
then<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.310> makes<00:02:25.550> sense<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.300> stars<00:02:26.690> out

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
then it makes sense that the stars out

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.490 
then it makes sense that the stars out
here<00:02:27.850> would<00:02:28.850> be<00:02:28.910> older<00:02:29.630> than<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:30.020> stars<00:02:30.320> in

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
here would be older than the stars in

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.960 
here would be older than the stars in
the<00:02:30.620> in<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.010> center<00:02:31.460> because<00:02:31.670> they're

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
the in the center because they're

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.020 
the in the center because they're
actually<00:02:32.330> emanating<00:02:32.660> from<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:33.290> area<00:02:34.030> this

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
actually emanating from this area this

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.820 
actually emanating from this area this
is<00:02:35.180> what<00:02:35.330> we<00:02:35.420> call<00:02:35.630> emanation<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:36.590> the

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
is what we call emanation in the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.640 
is what we call emanation in the
mysteries<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:38.330> if<00:02:39.200> we<00:02:39.320> take<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.530> look<00:02:39.800> at<00:02:41.650> these

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
mysteries and if we take a look at these

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.030 
mysteries and if we take a look at these
other<00:02:43.070> images<00:02:44.050> here's<00:02:45.050> another<00:02:45.320> image<00:02:45.770> of<00:02:45.950> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
other images here's another image of the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.040 
other images here's another image of the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
same area right here which is the touch

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.740 
same area right here which is the touch
of<00:02:48.230> graviton<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:49.670> stars<00:02:50.000> are<00:02:50.240> actually<00:02:50.270> being

produced out of this what we call the

center of the trapezium which know I

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.250 
center of the trapezium which know I
have<00:03:19.820> an<00:03:19.910> angel<00:03:20.209> has<00:03:20.330> ever<00:03:20.480> seen<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.020> thought

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
have an angel has ever seen the thought

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.230 
have an angel has ever seen the thought
of<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.470> heart<00:03:21.680> has<00:03:21.770> ever<00:03:21.980> comprehended<00:03:22.670> and

of the heart has ever comprehended and

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.660 
of the heart has ever comprehended and
it<00:03:23.360> was<00:03:23.450> never<00:03:23.720> called<00:03:24.020> by<00:03:24.260> any<00:03:24.410> name<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.920> a

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
it was never called by any name and a

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.390 
it was never called by any name and a
great<00:03:25.910> luminous<00:03:26.540> cloud<00:03:26.959> appeared<00:03:27.709> there<00:03:27.980> he

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
great luminous cloud appeared there he

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.190 
great luminous cloud appeared there he
said<00:03:28.610> let<00:03:28.820> an<00:03:28.910> angel<00:03:29.240> come<00:03:29.420> into<00:03:29.630> being<00:03:29.840> as<00:03:30.050> my

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
said let an angel come into being as my

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.170 
said let an angel come into being as my
tenant<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.830> great<00:03:31.100> angel<00:03:31.490> the<00:03:31.610> enlightened

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
tenant a great angel the enlightened

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.020 
tenant a great angel the enlightened
divine<00:03:32.480> self<00:03:32.990> generated<00:03:33.650> emerged<00:03:34.580> from<00:03:34.880> the

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
divine self generated emerged from the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.380 
divine self generated emerged from the
cloud<00:03:35.300> and<00:03:36.459> so<00:03:37.459> this<00:03:37.580> is<00:03:37.760> speaking<00:03:38.209> of

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
cloud and so this is speaking of

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:45.340 
cloud and so this is speaking of
emanation<00:03:42.130> emanation<00:03:43.209> being<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.750> very<00:03:44.930> first

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
emanation emanation being the very first

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.620 
emanation emanation being the very first
point<00:03:45.800> which<00:03:46.459> is<00:03:46.550> right<00:03:46.910> here<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.330> center<00:03:47.600> of

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
point which is right here the center of

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.340 
point which is right here the center of
the<00:03:47.780> trapezium<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.560> then<00:03:49.250> emanating<00:03:49.880> out

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
the trapezium and then emanating out

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.740 
the trapezium and then emanating out
this<00:03:51.350> is<00:03:51.500> what<00:03:51.650> we<00:03:51.770> see<00:03:52.120> so<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.450> reason<00:03:53.720> that

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
this is what we see so the reason that

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.470 
this is what we see so the reason that
NASA<00:03:54.110> is<00:03:54.620> scratching<00:03:55.520> their<00:03:55.790> heads<00:03:56.060> is

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
NASA is scratching their heads is

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.120 
NASA is scratching their heads is
because<00:03:57.170> they<00:03:57.260> don't<00:03:57.350> realize<00:03:57.800> that<00:03:58.040> the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
because they don't realize that the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.949 
because they don't realize that the
emanation<00:03:58.610> occurs<00:03:58.970> from<00:03:59.270> the<00:03:59.390> center<00:03:59.750> area

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
emanation occurs from the center area

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.890 
emanation occurs from the center area
out<00:04:00.290> from<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.370> trapezium<00:04:02.000> out<00:04:02.270> from<00:04:02.690> that

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
out from the trapezium out from that

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.140 
out from the trapezium out from that
black<00:04:03.260> hole<00:04:03.620> or<00:04:03.950> whatever<00:04:04.310> that<00:04:04.370> anomaly<00:04:04.790> is

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
black hole or whatever that anomaly is

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.900 
black hole or whatever that anomaly is
that<00:04:05.390> we<00:04:05.510> want<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.810> call<00:04:06.050> it<00:04:06.430> black<00:04:07.430> hole<00:04:07.730> is

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
that we want to call it black hole is

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.790 
that we want to call it black hole is
just<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:08.270> placeholder<00:04:08.630> for<00:04:09.080> whatever<00:04:09.650> the

just a placeholder for whatever the

just a placeholder for whatever the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.420 
anomaly actually is I don't necessarily
agree<00:04:12.770> with<00:04:13.390> Thunderbolts<00:04:14.390> info<00:04:15.080> I<00:04:15.860> don't

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
agree with Thunderbolts info I don't

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.760 
agree with Thunderbolts info I don't
necessarily<00:04:16.730> agree<00:04:17.330> with<00:04:17.540> NASA's<00:04:18.200> definition

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
necessarily agree with NASA's definition

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.230 
necessarily agree with NASA's definition
of<00:04:18.919> it<00:04:19.010> I<00:04:19.070> think<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:19.459> something<00:04:19.730> different

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
of it I think it's something different

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.119 
of it I think it's something different
but<00:04:23.240> I<00:04:23.270> think<00:04:23.599> it<00:04:23.720> is<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.169> anomaly<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:24.830> we

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:25.129 
but I think it is the anomaly that we

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.999 
but I think it is the anomaly that we
were<00:04:25.220> all<00:04:25.400> familiar<00:04:25.639> with<00:04:25.970> familiar<00:04:26.840> with<00:04:27.319> the

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
were all familiar with familiar with the

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.650 
were all familiar with familiar with the
same<00:04:28.220> type<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.490> anomaly<00:04:28.819> that<00:04:29.120> sits<00:04:29.479> the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
same type of anomaly that sits the

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.559 
same type of anomaly that sits the
center<00:04:30.050> of<00:04:30.080> galaxies<00:04:30.949> but<00:04:31.759> these<00:04:32.000> areas

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569 
center of galaxies but these areas

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.550 
center of galaxies but these areas
produce<00:04:33.139> stars<00:04:33.500> from<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.009> center<00:04:34.370> out<00:04:34.490> I

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
produce stars from the center out I

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.659 
produce stars from the center out I
think<00:04:36.560> that's<00:04:36.710> what<00:04:36.889> we're<00:04:37.009> seeing<00:04:37.190> here<00:04:37.310> and

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
think that's what we're seeing here and

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:38.860 
think that's what we're seeing here and
I<00:04:37.729> think<00:04:37.940> that's<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.150> reason<00:04:38.449> why<00:04:38.479> NASA

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
I think that's the reason why NASA

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.290 
I think that's the reason why NASA
doesn't<00:04:39.169> understand<00:04:39.740> it<00:04:39.919> so<00:04:40.849> there<00:04:41.120> you<00:04:41.270> go

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
doesn't understand it so there you go

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.869 
doesn't understand it so there you go
guys<00:04:41.449> there<00:04:42.169> is<00:04:42.379> more<00:04:42.710> cosmology<00:04:43.520> from<00:04:43.759> the

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:43.879 
guys there is more cosmology from the

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.540 
guys there is more cosmology from the
ancients<00:04:44.620> showing<00:04:45.620> us<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:45.979> pointing<00:04:46.310> us<00:04:46.430> to

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
ancients showing us and pointing us to

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.480 
ancients showing us and pointing us to
this<00:04:46.669> area<00:04:46.970> pointing<00:04:47.569> us<00:04:47.720> to<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.490> emanation

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
this area pointing us to the emanation

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.309 
this area pointing us to the emanation
that<00:04:49.610> occurs<00:04:49.879> from<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.240> center<00:04:50.659> out<00:04:50.780> which<00:04:51.289> is

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
that occurs from the center out which is

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.020 
that occurs from the center out which is
the<00:04:51.560> reason<00:04:51.680> why<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:51.979> stars<00:04:52.310> on<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.520> outside

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
the reason why the stars on the outside

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.899 
the reason why the stars on the outside
are<00:04:53.330> actually<00:04:54.229> older<00:04:54.590> guys<00:04:55.099> take<00:04:55.310> care<00:04:55.340> talk

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909 
are actually older guys take care talk

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.180 
are actually older guys take care talk
to<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.120> soon
