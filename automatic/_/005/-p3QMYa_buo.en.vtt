00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:07.509 
next we're going to work the spine in a

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.509 
next we're going to work the spine in a
slightly<00:00:07.779> different<00:00:08.170> fashion<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.950> this<00:00:12.160> time

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 
slightly different fashion so this time

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.410 
slightly different fashion so this time
the<00:00:13.299> palms<00:00:13.690> slightly<00:00:14.320> palm<00:00:15.070> upward<00:00:15.910> the<00:00:16.270> other

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
the palms slightly palm upward the other

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.880 
the palms slightly palm upward the other
time<00:00:16.660> they're<00:00:16.840> slightly<00:00:17.050> from<00:00:17.439> downward<00:00:17.769> this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
time they're slightly from downward this

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.700 
time they're slightly from downward this
is<00:00:18.039> slightly<00:00:18.460> palm<00:00:18.910> upward<00:00:19.390> feeling<00:00:20.080> the<00:00:20.260> ball

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
is slightly palm upward feeling the ball

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.829 
is slightly palm upward feeling the ball
of<00:00:20.829> energy<00:00:21.189> from<00:00:21.310> the<00:00:21.429> bottom<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:21.970> this<00:00:22.480> time

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:22.839 
of energy from the bottom and this time

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.089 
of energy from the bottom and this time
as<00:00:23.320> we<00:00:23.890> inhale<00:00:24.490> we're<00:00:24.939> going<00:00:24.970> to<00:00:25.300> open<00:00:26.099> down

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
as we inhale we're going to open down

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:35.330 
as we inhale we're going to open down
and<00:00:27.519> back

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
feel the stretch of the energy back lift

00:00:56.010 --> 00:02:31.320 
feel the stretch of the energy back lift
up<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.850> coming<00:01:01.390> forward

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:54.020 

one<00:02:32.330> more<00:02:32.570> time

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
effective because the camera people are

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.790 
effective because the camera people are
trying<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.800> do<00:03:19.950> these<00:03:20.100> exercises<00:03:20.670> too<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:23.570> okay

it's once again so feeling them kind of
a<00:03:29.400> little<00:03:29.430> bit<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.790> weight<00:03:30.120> in<00:03:30.360> your<00:03:30.390> palms

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
kind of connecting to this ball of

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.240 
kind of connecting to this ball of
energy<00:03:33.300> from<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.960> bottom<00:03:36.050> and<00:03:37.100> in<00:03:38.100> here<00:03:40.250> draw

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
energy from the bottom and in here draw

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:48.500 
energy from the bottom and in here draw
back<00:03:43.070> gently<00:03:44.070> stretching<00:03:44.490> forward<00:03:47.510> and
