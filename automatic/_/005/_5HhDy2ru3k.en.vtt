00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.520 
axe royal dragon that was released
fairly<00:00:09.210> recently<00:00:09.690> into<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.080> black<00:00:10.260> market

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
fairly recently into the black market

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.620 
fairly recently into the black market
I'm<00:00:10.830> giving<00:00:11.429> all<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.639> damage<00:00:12.000> stats<00:00:12.300> as<00:00:12.480> well

I'm giving all the damage stats as well

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.450 
I'm giving all the damage stats as well
as<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.809> comparison<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.679> then<00:00:13.769> my<00:00:13.950> own<00:00:14.070> opinion

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
as a comparison and then my own opinion

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.179 
as a comparison and then my own opinion
of<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.639> weapon<00:00:15.230> seeing<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.829> melee

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
of the weapon seeing that it's a melee

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.189 
of the weapon seeing that it's a melee
weapon<00:00:17.220> there's<00:00:17.730> only<00:00:17.849> one<00:00:18.179> real<00:00:18.480> range<00:00:18.869> that

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
weapon there's only one real range that

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.509 
weapon there's only one real range that
you<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.319> test<00:00:19.679> it<00:00:19.859> out<00:00:19.919> and<00:00:19.980> that's<00:00:20.279> obviously

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:20.519 
you can test it out and that's obviously

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.019 
you can test it out and that's obviously
a<00:00:20.849> point-blank<00:00:21.509> such<00:00:21.929> close<00:00:22.230> range<00:00:22.499> so<00:00:23.029> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
a point-blank such close range so the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.259 
a point-blank such close range so the
damages<00:00:24.569> are<00:00:24.839> the<00:00:25.109> 0<00:00:25.289> for<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.009> first<00:00:26.339> /<00:00:26.759> you'll

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
damages are the 0 for the first / you'll

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.099 
damages are the 0 for the first / you'll
do<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.479> hundred<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.140> head<00:00:28.439> 70<00:00:29.339> to<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.639> chest

the body now for the second / there's

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.479 
the body now for the second / there's
only<00:00:42.570> one<00:00:42.899> difference<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.649> that's<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.949> arms

and they do 65 damage and with armor

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.209 
and they do 65 damage and with armor
it's<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> body<00:00:48.749> and<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.230> does<00:00:49.469> 80<00:00:49.739> damage

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
it's to the body and that does 80 damage

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.049 
it's to the body and that does 80 damage
and<00:00:51.440> then<00:00:52.440> with<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.769> right<00:00:52.980> click<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.519> does<00:00:53.820> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
and then with the right click it does a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.450 
and then with the right click it does a
hundred<00:00:54.659> anywhere<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.409> body<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.249> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
hundred anywhere on the body and it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.130 
hundred anywhere on the body and it
doesn't<00:00:56.760> matter<00:00:56.789> whether<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.690> armor<00:00:58.019> or

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
doesn't matter whether you have armor or

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.470 
doesn't matter whether you have armor or
not<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.280> hit<00:00:59.819> kill<00:01:00.030> across<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
not so it's just one hit kill across the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.500 
not so it's just one hit kill across the
board<00:01:00.920> now<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.159> the<00:01:02.249> comparisons<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.120> I'm

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
board now for the comparisons and I'm

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.119 
board now for the comparisons and I'm
only<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.050> compare<00:01:04.320> against<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> normal

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
only going to compare against the normal

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.480 
only going to compare against the normal
acts<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:06.140> you'll<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.439> why<00:01:07.619> as<00:01:07.649> there<00:01:08.280> is

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
acts because you'll see why as there is

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.940 
acts because you'll see why as there is
no<00:01:09.060> difference<00:01:09.570> between<00:01:09.659> any<00:01:10.259> of<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.649> stats

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
no difference between any of the stats

now<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:23.969> my<00:01:24.060> own<00:01:24.180> opinion<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.689> weapon<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
now for my own opinion at the weapon and

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.080 
now for my own opinion at the weapon and
to<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.560> honest<00:01:25.829> I<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.159> literally<00:01:26.460> see<00:01:26.790> only

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
to be honest I can literally see only

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.289 
to be honest I can literally see only
two<00:01:27.540> reasons<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.350> why<00:01:28.469> you'd<00:01:28.770> get<00:01:29.009> this

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
two reasons as to why you'd get this

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.719 
two reasons as to why you'd get this
you're<00:01:30.299> either<00:01:30.420> after<00:01:30.840> opponent<00:01:31.110> X<00:01:31.560> or<00:01:32.100> you're

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
you're either after opponent X or you're

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.850 
you're either after opponent X or you're
finishing<00:01:33.030> off<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> royal<00:01:33.719> dragon<00:01:34.110> bag<00:01:34.439> there

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
finishing off a royal dragon bag there

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.270 
finishing off a royal dragon bag there
is<00:01:35.039> nothing<00:01:35.460> else<00:01:36.469> going<00:01:37.469> for<00:01:37.649> this<00:01:38.039> it's

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
is nothing else going for this it's

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
is nothing else going for this it's
literally<00:01:38.700> exactly<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.509> same<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.079> normal

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
literally exactly the same as the normal

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.719 
literally exactly the same as the normal
axe<00:01:42.380> why<00:01:43.380> you'd<00:01:43.740> bother<00:01:43.770> if<00:01:44.310> you've<00:01:44.490> got<00:01:44.700> a

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729

don't<00:02:00.420> know<00:02:00.479> why<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.840> not<00:02:00.929> because<00:02:01.439> all<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
don't know why it's not because all the

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.319 
don't know why it's not because all the
others<00:02:01.920> do<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.399> kind<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.670> expect<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.179> but

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
others do and you kind of expect it but

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.910 
others do and you kind of expect it but
it<00:02:03.450> doesn't<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.200> yeah<00:02:06.320> maybe<00:02:07.320> difficult<00:02:07.590> to

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
it doesn't so yeah maybe difficult to

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.100 
it doesn't so yeah maybe difficult to
add<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.340> which<00:02:09.030> wouldn't<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.420> surprise<00:02:09.920> as

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
add it which wouldn't be a surprise as

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.000 
add it which wouldn't be a surprise as
