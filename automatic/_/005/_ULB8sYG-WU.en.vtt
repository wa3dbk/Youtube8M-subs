00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:26.869
 yesterday cut the shelf through everything is fine 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.869
 nothing hinders work 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:38.219
 threw pedals adjustable by hand 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:44.570
 bait just from can sign here do 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:48.059
 so convenient by the way so here's a kick on the neckline 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.530
 now of course there will be two pens 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:56.039
 small and but court strip weld shiva 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.660
 closed the whole thing here here too from 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.120
 yanchik will remove but this hole 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.720
 she immediately roe was going to remove this girl and 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.700
 cane apologize and where then lived here 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.010
 tilt 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:20.540
 it was comfortable 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.750
 tubes tank means this here 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.020
 Duma 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.820
 brake tank but they are there three things 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.320
 he has two brakes 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.770
 and one on the clutch 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.689
 and here it is 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.229
 Zhigulevsk, that is, I think it 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.560
 uses i don't know what's up there 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.560
 section 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.969
 I think the same will be almost the volume 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:55.759
 we can see even water somehow 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:02:00.869
 nevian experience the whole thing that is 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:07.369
 volume you look well and mind the glasses have it 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.780
 as if already a little happy means now 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.819
 correcting 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.640
 all the flaws that is here there was a piece 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.209
 I have cutouts under the State Duma 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.760
 here you can see the trace just now 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:25.980
 sixes trim start and correct 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.829
 welded yes a little bit shlifanul here 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.190
 if you cleaned were just not slit 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:34.590
 which are needed technologically here here 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.049
 also looked now too small 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.450
 such a revision to do now such 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:43.019
 triangle with sandalwood that is she 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.359
 instead of for displacement there is and as it were a move 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.959
 for leverage too now it is all 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.959
 bent 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.030
 but on such tack small affairs 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.450
 that is, all the metal you're not warming 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.930
 just three points of shock looked 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:17.240
 okay the whole field where you say you can 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:20.450
 know the boil lever is here 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:27.740
 why not because the bullet when 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:30.140
 will you pull so second here 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.600
 why it is impossible to brew because when 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.880
 you will pull out the field 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:43.370
 he would seem to interfere with this whole business 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:04:00.590
 here at least it was possible for wine so better 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:04:03.430
 do so here's a sector to do if 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.430
 think so 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:16.950
 Now let's see then made such a 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.250
 cut down 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:24.670
 the mount itself is fixed which holds 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:30.180
 need gas while temporarily you need on was 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:31.300
 12 put that is the gift itself here it is 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.210
 thought 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:40.650
 put up grab and there will already be 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:44.350
 fixed on 100 lieutenant so mean 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.560
 everything works the engine that is talking about 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.830
 that comes to the end here too 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.830
 the end 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.140
 in this moment I think finish our 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.180
 video is all done 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.360
 remain on speech hold tubes for 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.270
 cistern 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:29.430
 liquid then dilute with you tube 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.220
 here I think a lot of mind do not come on 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.840
 in principle there was not much mind 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:44.580
 just slowly scored on think 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:47.250
 this moment everything suits here and so 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.820
 everything turns out there is a gap there everything 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:54.800
 is here as i said i did 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:58.320
 at an angle and everything works fine 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:02.870
 moves here and her to polik 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:08.970
 brought clear that the lever went out 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:13.490
 let everything that is there is a gap here too 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:17.270
 differently the sole will not rest 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.170
 glass and stuff 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:27.950
 here, too, everything here 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:30.950
 gone and yes it's super 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.950
 pushing through 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.540
 all work this video is our finished by 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.540
 retrofit brakes
