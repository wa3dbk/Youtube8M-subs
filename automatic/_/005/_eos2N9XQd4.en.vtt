00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 hello today I will tell you how 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.019
 make a macro on a weapon in a.p. 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.309
 let's say we need for both guns 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.410
 Mark distribute choose number 7 number seven 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:22.970
 on the middle mouse button next to 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:25.680
 select the wheel go to the macro manager 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:33.480
 but I 'll show you now clearly 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:35.510
 open click on the macro new well not 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.280
 it turns out to open click open 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.649
 here we need to choose some of my bedtime 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.700
 let's study 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:47.570
 but let's say yes, I already have everything 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.940
 I'm ready to 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.309
 see 3234 32 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.219
 what is this pause for this floor 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.680
 a stand is made to not quite 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:05.659
 the macro was obvious rented small 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.780
 delay how to explain it that is 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.990
 unnoticed 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.299
 By and large, this is a macro 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.240
 since it shoots unevenly 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.180
 with different delays, that's the principle 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.189
 comfortable enough and not you actually 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.110
 you lose nothing you lose nothing 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.930
 just the opposite all the time leg 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.590
 here's how to make a new one 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:36.950
 macro open absolutely any yes I 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:44.460
 discovered what we see we see the script 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:46.470
 remove too much immediately leave to 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.990
 principle, everything can be removed completely 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:55.040
 quietly open the game which can be 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.040
 this case fb 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.020
 so well, sobsno say we went to 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.970
 the area that we now have to do everything 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:36.440
 quite ingenious just turn off 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:36.440
 game click record 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:03:03.920
 these shots shoot with a gun well 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:03:03.920
 or what do you have there we turn off the game 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:11.360
 we press that records and we see here 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:20.760
 a lot of weird colors for us we 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:24.780
 delete the extra move we start 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.349
 our 5 left mouse button or hold 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.140
 with pause coals we remove the excess press 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:40.950
 release pauses move remove pauses 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:46.769
 excess we delete further they crawled and 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.170
 so we delete the movie what we do 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:57.690
 edit 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:04:03.959
 we set 04 probably put 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:17.130
 gun room say so here we are 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:21.770
 we delete this market 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.320
 play there is a tab 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:28.710
 reproduce the macro repeatedly 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.349
 click click start release stop it 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.229
 necessarily so that you just 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:37.349
 it was more convenient to press it once 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:41.599
 middle button shoot 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:44.700
 let go and all the meaning 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.320
 name but I donâ€™t know anyone but I 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.880
 Now let's say we just came 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:55.830
 test notes the same 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:05:12.020
 write put 6 at random description 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:15.450
 functions let's say click click ok 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:19.500
 click ok once it is desirable to rename 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.430
 so that we will not be confused with you but I 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.140
 I'll just write 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.570
 you can write whatever you want 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.720
 what do you like to do preferably 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:32.540
 of course I know discotheque 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.540
 click ok click save 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.150
 close because we have cars 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.290
 now we need a macro 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:46.920
 download the mouse for this 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:54.470
 arrow goes in our hands increases 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:54.470
