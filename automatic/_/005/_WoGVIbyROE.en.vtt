straight<00:00:29.160> lines<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.990> GIMP<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.529> let's<00:00:31.949> go<00:00:32.070> ahead

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
straight lines in GIMP so let's go ahead

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.819 
straight lines in GIMP so let's go ahead
and<00:00:32.279> get<00:00:32.460> started<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.260> when<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.350> open<00:00:34.649> GIMP

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
and get started so when we open GIMP

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.560 
and get started so when we open GIMP
we're<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.160> going<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> blank<00:00:35.910> canvas<00:00:36.450> to

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
we're just going to do a blank canvas to

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.990 
we're just going to do a blank canvas to
give<00:00:36.690> us<00:00:36.809> some<00:00:36.960> place<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.380> work<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.879> we're

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
give us some place to work on so we're

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.209 
give us some place to work on so we're
going<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> file<00:00:39.390> new<00:00:39.469> just<00:00:40.469> open<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:41.040> so

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219

here now if you guys remember from my

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.729 
here now if you guys remember from my
past<00:00:45.360> tutorials<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.079> told<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.469> there's<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
past tutorials I told you there's a

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.860 
past tutorials I told you there's a
large<00:00:47.039> difference<00:00:47.190> between<00:00:47.730> GIMP<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
large difference between GIMP and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.170 
large difference between GIMP and
something<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.410> paint<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.579> program<00:00:51.000> like

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
something like paint in a program like

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.450 
something like paint in a program like
paint<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.750> things<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.129> draw

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
paint or things like that you can draw

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.459 
paint or things like that you can draw
shapes<00:00:53.489> all<00:00:54.120> around<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:55.140> draw<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.379> you

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
shapes all around you can draw it you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.959 
shapes all around you can draw it you
can<00:00:55.590> add<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.829> line<00:00:56.070> or<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> triangle<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
can add in a line or a triangle and

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.369 
can add in a line or a triangle and
stuff<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.510> if<00:00:57.809> you've<00:00:57.930> watched<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
stuff like that if you've watched the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.170 
stuff like that if you've watched the
past<00:00:58.559> tutorials<00:00:59.219> you've<00:00:59.370> learned<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.789> gimps

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
past tutorials you've learned that gimps

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.849 
past tutorials you've learned that gimps
a<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:00.449> bit<00:01:00.570> different<00:01:01.020> gives<00:01:01.469> more<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
a little bit different gives more of a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.619 
a little bit different gives more of a
photo<00:01:02.190> editor<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.149> not<00:01:03.300> going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> have

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
photo editor so it's not going to have

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.380 
photo editor so it's not going to have
the<00:01:03.750> ability<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.920> do<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.850> painted

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the ability to just do that like painted

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.300 
the ability to just do that like painted
but<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:06.990> still<00:01:07.260> accomplish<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.040> if<00:01:08.220> you

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
but you can still accomplish that if you

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.580 
but you can still accomplish that if you
know<00:01:08.549> how<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.750> today<00:01:10.110> I'm<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.439> show<00:01:10.560> you

straight<00:01:31.500> line<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.950> all<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> shift<00:01:32.850> key<00:01:33.090> so

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
straight line is all in the shift key so

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.149 
straight line is all in the shift key so
we<00:01:33.869> are<00:01:33.960> going<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.140> click<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.500> our<00:01:34.590> first<00:01:34.890> spot

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
we are going to click on our first spot

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.700 
we are going to click on our first spot
right<00:01:35.340> here<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.229> then<00:01:37.229> we're<00:01:37.380> going<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.530> go

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
right here and then we're going to go

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.230 
right here and then we're going to go
down<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.040> ever<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.280> want<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> final<00:01:38.700> spot<00:01:39.090> to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
down to ever we want the final spot to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.660 
down to ever we want the final spot to
be<00:01:39.360> hold<00:01:40.170> down<00:01:40.439> shift<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.280> can<00:01:41.400> see<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
be hold down shift and you can see the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.580 
be hold down shift and you can see the
line<00:01:41.850> appears<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.750> when<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:42.960> hold<00:01:43.140> down<00:01:43.259> shift

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
line appears so when we hold down shift

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.560 
line appears so when we hold down shift
here<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.890> see<00:01:43.979> exactly<00:01:44.460> where<00:01:44.850> your<00:01:44.880> line<00:01:45.240> is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
here and see exactly where your line is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.039 
here and see exactly where your line is
I<00:01:45.890> want<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.920> click<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.280> now<00:01:47.600> of<00:01:48.600> course<00:01:48.840> you

blue pattern so drawing those lines has
a<00:03:14.520> lot<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.000> applications<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.960> also<00:03:16.710> it<00:03:16.980> allows
