these are those little cones that we're
talking<00:02:27.480> about<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:28.230> early<00:02:28.500> innovations<00:02:29.400> that

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
talking about the early innovations that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.699 
talking about the early innovations that
Nike<00:02:29.970> had<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.239> lot<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.750> do<00:02:30.900> with<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.140> outsoles

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
Nike had a lot to do with the outsoles

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.590 
Nike had a lot to do with the outsoles
remember<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.280> waffle<00:02:32.730> innovation<00:02:33.330> was<00:02:33.480> all

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
remember the waffle innovation was all

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.630 
remember the waffle innovation was all
about<00:02:33.810> gripping<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.380> ground<00:02:34.650> here<00:02:35.340> we<00:02:35.489> have

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
about gripping the ground here we have

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.210 
about gripping the ground here we have
these<00:02:35.790> tiny<00:02:36.150> cones<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.900> americas<00:02:37.830> track

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
these tiny cones on the americas track

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.330 
these tiny cones on the americas track
spike<00:02:38.750> beautiful<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:39.989> remember<00:02:40.800> earlier<00:02:40.950> we

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
spike beautiful and remember earlier we

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.190 
spike beautiful and remember earlier we
were<00:02:41.459> looking<00:02:41.730> at<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.940> lowercase<00:02:42.270> Nike<00:02:42.930> font

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
were looking at the lowercase Nike font

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.440 
were looking at the lowercase Nike font
on<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.440> Prix<00:02:43.709> Montreal<00:02:44.250> here's<00:02:44.550> an<00:02:44.730> uppercase

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
on the Prix Montreal here's an uppercase

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.590 
on the Prix Montreal here's an uppercase
Nike<00:02:46.080> font<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.620> there<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.920> have<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.280> little

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
Nike font and there you have that little

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.150 
Nike font and there you have that little
registered<00:02:48.600> trademark<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.320> there<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:50.010> this

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
registered trademark on there so this

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.560 
registered trademark on there so this
one<00:02:50.370> would<00:02:50.519> have<00:02:50.550> come<00:02:50.790> out<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> little<00:02:51.420> bit

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
one would have come out a little bit

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.949 
one would have come out a little bit
later

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
later

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.460 
later
Nike<00:02:52.680> registered<00:02:53.280> their<00:02:53.459> trademark<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.090> early

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
Nike registered their trademark in early

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.020 
Nike registered their trademark in early
1974<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.800> shoes<00:02:56.040> from<00:02:56.250> then<00:02:56.459> on<00:02:56.640> would<00:02:56.820> have

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
1974 so shoes from then on would have

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.970 
1974 so shoes from then on would have
the<00:02:57.180> little<00:02:57.390> registered<00:02:57.900> trademark<00:02:58.380> whereas

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
the little registered trademark whereas

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.759 
the little registered trademark whereas
the<00:02:59.100> early<00:02:59.459> early<00:02:59.790> ones<00:03:00.000> do<00:03:00.360> not<00:03:00.560> let's<00:03:01.560> have<00:03:01.739> a

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
the early early ones do not let's have a

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.430 
the early early ones do not let's have a
look<00:03:01.980> at<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.310> third<00:03:02.580> shoe<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.269> ad<00:03:03.440> the

look at the third shoe in the ad the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.199 
look at the third shoe in the ad the
interval<00:03:05.660> pop<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.840> on<00:03:06.959> there<00:03:07.550> so<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.760> interval

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
interval pop it on there so the interval

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.170 
interval pop it on there so the interval
a<00:03:09.450> popular<00:03:10.019> training<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.709> racing<00:03:10.950> spike<00:03:11.580> it
