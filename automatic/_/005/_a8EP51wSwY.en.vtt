00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
like this but I really hope it isn't for

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.410 
like this but I really hope it isn't for
much<00:05:57.130> longer<00:05:57.340> because<00:05:57.520> it's<00:05:57.820> actually<00:05:58.120> kind

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
much longer because it's actually kind

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.720 
much longer because it's actually kind
of<00:05:58.540> starting<00:05:58.900> to<00:05:58.930> get<00:05:59.080> on<00:05:59.140> my<00:05:59.260> nerves

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
of starting to get on my nerves

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.160 
of starting to get on my nerves
otherwise<00:06:00.730> like<00:06:01.300> I<00:06:01.420> said<00:06:01.630> this<00:06:01.810> is<00:06:01.870> still<00:06:02.140> a

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
otherwise like I said this is still a

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.930 
otherwise like I said this is still a
pretty<00:06:02.410> decent<00:06:02.830> episode<00:06:02.980> watch<00:06:03.520> it<00:06:03.700> for<00:06:03.880> the

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
pretty decent episode watch it for the

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.000 
pretty decent episode watch it for the
action<00:06:04.360> and<00:06:04.570> try<00:06:05.140> to<00:06:05.200> pay<00:06:05.410> attention<00:06:05.440> to<00:06:05.890> the

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.590 
action and try to pay attention to the
story<00:06:06.280> this<00:06:06.550> is<00:06:06.610> one<00:06:06.850> of<00:06:06.880> those<00:06:07.030> anime<00:06:07.420> though

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600
