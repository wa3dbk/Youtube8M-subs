00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:24.240
 15 minutes passed the dough rested and now 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.240
 i will prepare a form which she will 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.809
 look the world was shaped 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:01:13.110
 the main bottom just besides already 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:20.580
 Slippery rises just sounds 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.580
 napkin 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:29.660
 a little bit more just a little depressed 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.560
 remaining 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:54.049
 while the dough was resting, I turned on the oven 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.920
 at 40 degrees warm it up 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:01.360
 and now the dough after I decompose 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.860
 the forms I put on the proof from the oven 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.830
 for two or three hours 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.569
 there is no such exact time either 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.450
 because it all depends on the temperature to 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.650
 which you heat how much 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:23.360
 dough will be possible if in the kitchen 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.600
 heat can be left right on the river to 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.790
 She came well, you can than anything 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:34.360
 cover the top was the juice period I divide 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.920
 into 2 parts and 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.920
 800 grams of dough turned out 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:58.480
 every ball lump 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.550
 bun bun and already 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:34.110
 dough forms and it turned out two parts 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:40.829
 Semi Clean Circle Needles Beautiful 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:43.319
 oven warmed to 40 degrees more 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:48.629
 it does not need to be heated 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:53.299
 warm they are hot i put on two 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.299
 two and a half hours pastry for proofing
