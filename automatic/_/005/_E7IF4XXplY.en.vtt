looking through the other aperture this

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.489 
looking through the other aperture this
is<00:00:27.759> something<00:00:27.999> we<00:00:28.119> would<00:00:28.269> do<00:00:29.079> we<00:00:29.409> have

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:29.499

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
the truck alright so from there we stood

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.380 
the truck alright so from there we stood
up<00:00:37.149> we<00:00:37.660> did<00:00:37.809> a<00:00:37.840> box<00:00:38.230> drill<00:00:38.590> okay<00:00:39.370> then<00:00:40.090> we<00:00:40.179> moved

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
to an intermediate barrier and here this

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.479 
to an intermediate barrier and here this
is<00:00:43.600> where<00:00:43.719> we<00:00:44.079> practice<00:00:44.289> kneeling<00:00:45.219> which<00:00:45.339> is<00:00:45.460> a

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
is where we practice kneeling which is a

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.490 
is where we practice kneeling which is a
very<00:00:45.699> common<00:00:45.879> shooting<00:00:46.210> position<00:00:46.570> you<00:00:47.410> know

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
very common shooting position you know

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.029 
very common shooting position you know
we<00:00:47.620> engage<00:00:47.800> our<00:00:47.829> targets<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:49.510> moved<00:00:50.039> through

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
we engage our targets we moved through

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.029 
we engage our targets we moved through
no<00:00:51.489> practicing<00:00:52.199> safety<00:00:53.199> rules<00:00:53.379> obviously<00:00:53.800> if

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
no practicing safety rules obviously if

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.500 
no practicing safety rules obviously if
we<00:00:54.280> had<00:00:54.609> been<00:00:54.789> moving<00:00:55.030> with<00:00:55.120> her<00:00:55.179> fingers<00:00:55.420> on

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
we had been moving with her fingers on

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.639 
we had been moving with her fingers on
the<00:00:55.600> trigger<00:00:55.809> it<00:00:56.230> could<00:00:56.350> have<00:00:56.440> had<00:00:56.530> an

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
the trigger it could have had an

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.130 
the trigger it could have had an
accident<00:00:56.999> all<00:00:57.999> that<00:00:58.210> stuff<00:00:58.510> so<00:00:58.539> the<00:00:58.809> safety

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
accident all that stuff so the safety

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.319 
accident all that stuff so the safety
plays<00:00:59.379> in<00:00:59.559> every<00:00:59.769> step<00:00:59.980> of<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.159> way<00:01:00.190> from<00:01:01.120> here

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
plays in every step of the way from here

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.239 
plays in every step of the way from here
we<00:01:01.539> did<00:01:01.719> a<00:01:01.749> standing<00:01:02.350> position<00:01:02.559> where<00:01:02.980> we<00:01:03.100> also

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:03.249 
we did a standing position where we also

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.060 
we did a standing position where we also
did<00:01:03.519> either<00:01:03.909> a<00:01:04.089> box<00:01:04.300> drill<00:01:04.600> or<00:01:04.960> failure<00:01:05.830> drear

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
did either a box drill or failure drear

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.200 
did either a box drill or failure drear
oh<00:01:06.300> okay<00:01:07.800> and<00:01:08.800> those<00:01:09.010> are<00:01:09.040> those<00:01:09.880> are<00:01:09.940> drills

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
oh okay and those are those are drills

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.930 
oh okay and those are those are drills
that<00:01:10.300> we<00:01:10.420> teach<00:01:10.630> in<00:01:10.870> carving<00:01:11.680> one<00:01:11.830> all<00:01:12.700> right

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
that we teach in carving one all right

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.460 
that we teach in carving one all right
but<00:01:13.150> we<00:01:13.300> just<00:01:13.450> build<00:01:13.600> on<00:01:13.750> them<00:01:13.870> as<00:01:14.020> we<00:01:14.230> go<00:01:14.320> as

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
but we just build on them as we go as

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.350 
but we just build on them as we go as
you<00:01:14.590> can<00:01:14.710> see<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:15.070> then<00:01:15.370> from<00:01:15.520> here<00:01:15.580> this<00:01:16.240> is

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
you can see and then from here this is

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.700 
you can see and then from here this is
where<00:01:16.480> we<00:01:16.600> really<00:01:17.050> get<00:01:17.290> into<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.940> dynamics<00:01:19.150> of

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
where we really get into the dynamics of

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.010 
where we really get into the dynamics of
foot<00:01:20.710> placement<00:01:21.160> while<00:01:21.430> you're<00:01:21.580> shooting

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
foot placement while you're shooting

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.780 
foot placement while you're shooting
with<00:01:23.020> you<00:01:23.200> if<00:01:23.380> you<00:01:23.470> play<00:01:23.590> video<00:01:23.890> games<00:01:24.130> or<00:01:24.640> you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
getting their targets all the time and

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.200 
getting their targets all the time and
in<00:01:32.260> real<00:01:32.410> life<00:01:32.560> it's<00:01:32.830> that<00:01:33.040> takes<00:01:33.460> a<00:01:33.700> lot<00:01:34.180> of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
in real life it's that takes a lot of

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.600 
in real life it's that takes a lot of
practice<00:01:34.660> to<00:01:34.810> move<00:01:34.960> your<00:01:35.080> feet<00:01:35.260> if<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.460> have<00:01:36.550> a

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
those are all things that are covered we

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.160 
those are all things that are covered we
cover<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.430> basics<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.240> carbon<00:02:27.990> one

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
cover the basics of it in carbon one

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.590 
cover the basics of it in carbon one
with<00:02:28.350> carving<00:02:28.620> too<00:02:28.800> we<00:02:29.310> build<00:02:29.550> on<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.880> carving

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
with carving too we build on it carving

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.410 
with carving too we build on it carving
three<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:31.260> would<00:02:31.440> have<00:02:31.710> more<00:02:32.520> team<00:02:33.000> movements

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
three we would have more team movements

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.800 
three we would have more team movements
more<00:02:33.920> higher<00:02:34.920> speed<00:02:35.310> type<00:02:35.850> stuff<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.660> is

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
more higher speed type stuff so this is

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.020 
more higher speed type stuff so this is
all<00:02:36.960> that's<00:02:37.830> what<00:02:37.980> we<00:02:38.100> do<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.550> know<00:02:38.640> build<00:02:38.910> on

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
all that's what we do you know build on

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.450 
all that's what we do you know build on
the<00:02:39.090> basics
