hi<00:00:06.180> I'm<00:00:06.540> Peter<00:00:06.810> address<00:00:07.110> and<00:00:07.260> blue<00:00:07.380> shooters

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
hi I'm Peter address and blue shooters

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.420 
hi I'm Peter address and blue shooters
we<00:00:09.090> teach<00:00:09.389> children<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:10.019> all<00:00:10.140> ages<00:00:10.170> right<00:00:11.130> from

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.430 
we teach children of all ages right from

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.070 
we teach children of all ages right from
primary<00:00:11.760> school<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.030> degree<00:00:12.300> level<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.960> we

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
primary school to degree level and we

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.560 
primary school to degree level and we
find<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.470> highest<00:00:13.710> quality<00:00:14.160> tutors<00:00:14.639> and

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
find the highest quality tutors and

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.540 
find the highest quality tutors and
today<00:00:15.990> I'm<00:00:16.289> going<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.679> teach<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:16.890> some<00:00:17.220> maths

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.010 

we're<00:00:21.550> now<00:00:21.700> going<00:00:21.880> to<00:00:21.940> look<00:00:22.060> at<00:00:22.180> how<00:00:22.330> to<00:00:22.390> change

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
we're now going to look at how to change

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.320 
we're now going to look at how to change
a<00:00:23.440> decimal<00:00:23.740> into<00:00:24.520> a<00:00:24.550> fraction

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
a decimal into a fraction

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.570 
a decimal into a fraction
um<00:00:26.110> so<00:00:26.260> we're<00:00:26.380> going<00:00:26.470> to<00:00:26.560> start<00:00:26.770> off<00:00:26.950> with<00:00:27.189> a

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
um so we're going to start off with a

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.910 
um so we're going to start off with a
fairly<00:00:27.970> simple<00:00:28.300> example<00:00:28.960> and<00:00:29.320> hopefully

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
fairly simple example and hopefully

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.499 
fairly simple example and hopefully
expand<00:00:30.340> that<00:00:30.520> into<00:00:30.730> something<00:00:31.029> a<00:00:31.180> bit<00:00:31.360> more

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
expand that into something a bit more

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.020 
expand that into something a bit more
complicated<00:00:31.869> so<00:00:32.470> if<00:00:33.400> we<00:00:33.520> look<00:00:33.640> at<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:33.820> first

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
complicated so if we look at the first

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.330 
complicated so if we look at the first
example<00:00:34.120> we<00:00:34.450> have<00:00:34.480> up<00:00:34.750> here<00:00:36.239> 0.12<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:39.100> what<00:00:39.250> you

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
example we have up here 0.12 so what you

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.290 
example we have up here 0.12 so what you
have<00:00:39.489> to<00:00:39.610> think<00:00:39.640> about<00:00:39.879> when<00:00:40.150> you're

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
have to think about when you're

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.189 
have to think about when you're
converting<00:00:40.600> this<00:00:40.809> to<00:00:40.870> a<00:00:41.019> fraction<00:00:41.290> is<00:00:43.199> what

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
converting this to a fraction is what

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.140 
converting this to a fraction is what
how<00:00:44.530> many<00:00:44.710> decimal<00:00:45.070> places<00:00:45.190> do<00:00:45.550> we<00:00:45.670> have<00:00:45.910> in

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
how many decimal places do we have in

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.840 
how many decimal places do we have in
this<00:00:46.750> case<00:00:46.960> we<00:00:47.140> have<00:00:47.320> two<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:48.370> first<00:00:48.610> decimal

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
this case we have two the first decimal

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.869 
this case we have two the first decimal
place<00:00:49.090> represents<00:00:50.050> ten<00:00:50.260> tenths<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.370> the

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
place represents ten tenths and the

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.470 
place represents ten tenths and the
second<00:00:52.300> represents<00:00:52.899> hundredths<00:00:53.649> so<00:00:54.550> this<00:00:54.850> is

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
second represents hundredths so this is

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.229 
second represents hundredths so this is
in<00:00:55.690> fact<00:00:55.960> equal<00:00:56.230> to<00:00:56.910> 12<00:00:57.910> over<00:00:58.860> 100<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:01.000> we<00:01:01.090> can

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
in fact equal to 12 over 100 and we can

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.510 
in fact equal to 12 over 100 and we can
simplify<00:01:01.480> that<00:01:01.809> by<00:01:02.020> dividing<00:01:02.800> top<00:01:02.980> and<00:01:03.039> bottom

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
simplify that by dividing top and bottom

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.830 
simplify that by dividing top and bottom
by<00:01:03.700> 4<00:01:04.000> so<00:01:04.899> you<00:01:04.960> get<00:01:05.140> 3<00:01:05.440> over<00:01:05.649> 25<00:01:06.580> so<00:01:07.360> this

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
by 4 so you get 3 over 25 so this

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.350 
by 4 so you get 3 over 25 so this
decimal<00:01:08.259> here<00:01:08.550> 0.12<00:01:09.550> is<00:01:09.910> equal<00:01:10.660> to<00:01:10.810> 3<00:01:11.080> over<00:01:11.440> 25

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
decimal here 0.12 is equal to 3 over 25

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.760 
decimal here 0.12 is equal to 3 over 25
so<00:01:13.360> let's<00:01:13.509> do<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.660> similar<00:01:13.960> thing<00:01:14.110> with<00:01:14.619> this

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
so let's do a similar thing with this

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.639 
so let's do a similar thing with this
this<00:01:15.190> decimal<00:01:15.580> now<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:17.020> fact<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.320> can<00:01:17.470> see

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
this decimal now in fact you can see

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.910 
this decimal now in fact you can see
that<00:01:17.830> we<00:01:17.950> have<00:01:18.190> 4<00:01:18.670> decimal<00:01:19.090> places<00:01:19.649> so<00:01:20.649> we<00:01:20.770> have

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
that we have 4 decimal places so we have

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.210 
that we have 4 decimal places so we have
tenths<00:01:21.460> hundredths<00:01:22.390> thousandths<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.470> 10

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
tenths hundredths thousandths and 10

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.510 
tenths hundredths thousandths and 10
thousandths<00:01:24.789> so<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:26.170> is<00:01:26.500> going<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:26.950> be<00:01:27.039> equal

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
thousandths so this is going to be equal

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:36.300 
thousandths so this is going to be equal
to<00:01:27.940> 7<00:01:28.690> 5<00:01:29.110> 2<00:01:29.619> 4<00:01:30.330> over<00:01:33.060> 10,000<00:01:34.319> and<00:01:35.319> so<00:01:35.950> again<00:01:36.160> we

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
to 7 5 2 4 over 10,000 and so again we

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.150 
to 7 5 2 4 over 10,000 and so again we
can<00:01:36.459> simplify<00:01:36.729> that<00:01:37.410> this<00:01:38.410> might<00:01:38.740> take<00:01:38.979> me<00:01:39.130> a

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
can simplify that this might take me a

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.540 
can simplify that this might take me a
while

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
while

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.389 
while
so<00:01:40.479> we've<00:01:41.140> got<00:01:41.319> to<00:01:41.440> divide<00:01:41.740> we'll<00:01:42.069> divide<00:01:42.280> top

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
so we've got to divide we'll divide top

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:50.120 
so we've got to divide we'll divide top
and<00:01:42.459> bottom<00:01:42.580> by<00:01:42.759> 2<00:01:42.849> first<00:01:44.069> to<00:01:45.069> give<00:01:45.429> us<00:01:45.899> 3<00:01:47.490> 7<00:01:48.490> 6<00:01:49.149> 2

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and bottom by 2 first to give us 3 7 6 2

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.630 
and bottom by 2 first to give us 3 7 6 2
over<00:01:51.599> 5,000<00:01:52.709> which<00:01:53.709> is<00:01:54.130> equal<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:56.550> 1

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
over 5,000 which is equal to 1

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.130 
over 5,000 which is equal to 1
eight<00:01:59.650> eight<00:02:00.650> one

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
eight eight one

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.310 
eight eight one
over<00:02:03.270> 2,500

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.490 

and<00:02:06.409> so<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:08.060> that<00:02:08.330> that<00:02:08.990> fashion

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
and so that is that that fashion

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.890 
and so that is that that fashion
simplified<00:02:10.360> now<00:02:11.360> we're<00:02:11.480> going<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.660> look<00:02:11.780> at

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
simplified now we're going to look at

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.949 
simplified now we're going to look at
more<00:02:11.990> complicated<00:02:12.580> situation<00:02:13.600> where<00:02:14.600> we<00:02:14.720> have

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
more complicated situation where we have

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.320 
more complicated situation where we have
a<00:02:15.230> decimal<00:02:15.620> but<00:02:16.070> these<00:02:16.430> two<00:02:16.640> dots<00:02:16.850> here<00:02:17.120> mean

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
a decimal but these two dots here mean

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.500 
a decimal but these two dots here mean
that<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:19.430> line<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.760> digits<00:02:20.330> is

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
that that that that line of digits is

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.960 
that that that that line of digits is
repeated<00:02:21.050> over<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.650> over<00:02:21.800> again<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:22.940> a

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
repeated over and over again this is a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.210 
repeated over and over again this is a
recurring<00:02:23.390> decimal<00:02:23.660> which<00:02:24.020> never<00:02:24.290> ends<00:02:24.560> and

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
recurring decimal which never ends and

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.830 
recurring decimal which never ends and
we're<00:02:25.430> going<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.670> try<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:25.970> work<00:02:26.060> out<00:02:26.300> what

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
we're going to try and work out what

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.050 
we're going to try and work out what
fraction<00:02:27.110> this<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.270> now<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.630> way<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.810> do<00:02:30.170> that

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
fraction this is now the way to do that

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.570 
fraction this is now the way to do that
is<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.300> take<00:02:32.510> this<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.200> in<00:02:33.410> fact<00:02:33.520> multiply<00:02:34.520> it

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
is to take this and in fact multiply it

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.449 
is to take this and in fact multiply it
so<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:35.360> decimal<00:02:35.780> point<00:02:36.140> comes<00:02:36.800> after

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
so that this decimal point comes after

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.290 
so that this decimal point comes after
this<00:02:37.910> seven<00:02:38.330> here<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:40.190> we<00:02:40.730> need<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:40.940> point<00:02:41.180> to

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
this seven here so we need the point to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.380 
this seven here so we need the point to
jump<00:02:41.540> one<00:02:41.780> two<00:02:42.020> three<00:02:42.680> four<00:02:43.160> five<00:02:43.580> six<00:02:44.060> times

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
jump one two three four five six times

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.370 
jump one two three four five six times
so<00:02:45.200> we<00:02:45.260> have<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.470> multiply<00:02:45.590> this<00:02:45.950> by<00:02:46.100> 1<00:02:46.520> million

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
so we have to multiply this by 1 million

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.260 
so we have to multiply this by 1 million
so<00:02:48.380> we're<00:02:48.530> gonna<00:02:48.620> call<00:02:48.890> this<00:02:49.280> number<00:02:49.700> here<00:02:49.880> X

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
so we're gonna call this number here X

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.320 
so we're gonna call this number here X
and<00:02:50.980> we're<00:02:51.980> going<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.250> say<00:02:52.520> a<00:02:54.430> million<00:02:55.430> times<00:02:55.790> X

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
and we're going to say a million times X

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.220 
and we're going to say a million times X
is<00:02:57.080> equal<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.739> one<00:02:57.950> four<00:02:58.420> two<00:02:59.420> eight<00:02:59.450> five

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
is equal to one four two eight five

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.780 
is equal to one four two eight five
seven<00:03:00.530> point<00:03:01.269> one<00:03:02.269> four<00:03:02.600> two<00:03:03.170> eight<00:03:03.790> five

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
seven point one four two eight five

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.320 
seven point one four two eight five
seven<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.450> again<00:03:06.170> this<00:03:06.830> this<00:03:07.280> recursive<00:03:08.000> over

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
seven and again this this recursive over

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.060 
seven and again this this recursive over
and<00:03:08.480> over<00:03:08.750> again<00:03:09.760> now<00:03:10.760> we<00:03:10.820> have<00:03:11.090> this<00:03:11.950> what<00:03:12.950> we

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
and over again now we have this what we

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:20.509 
and over again now we have this what we
can<00:03:13.250> do<00:03:13.459> is<00:03:13.850> take<00:03:14.390> our<00:03:14.690> other<00:03:14.900> X

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.039 

and<00:03:21.519> what<00:03:21.939> we're<00:03:22.090> going<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.329> do<00:03:22.450> now<00:03:22.629> is<00:03:22.780> take

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
and what we're going to do now is take

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.099 
and what we're going to do now is take
this<00:03:24.010> bottom<00:03:24.459> line<00:03:24.609> away<00:03:25.150> from<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:25.599> top<00:03:25.870> line

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
this bottom line away from this top line

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:33.420 
this bottom line away from this top line
that<00:03:27.099> leaves<00:03:27.400> us<00:03:27.609> with<00:03:30.629> 999,999<00:03:31.629> X<00:03:32.010> equal<00:03:33.010> to

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
that leaves us with 999,999 X equal to

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.270 
that leaves us with 999,999 X equal to
one<00:03:34.329> four<00:03:34.750> two<00:03:35.079> eight<00:03:35.519> five<00:03:36.519> seven<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.890> so<00:03:38.890> X

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
one four two eight five seven and so X

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.110 
one four two eight five seven and so X
is<00:03:39.730> equal<00:03:40.239> to<00:03:40.269> one<00:03:40.959> four<00:03:41.409> two<00:03:41.829> eight<00:03:42.120> five

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
is equal to one four two eight five

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.440 
is equal to one four two eight five
seven<00:03:43.859> over<00:03:44.939> nine<00:03:45.939> hundred<00:03:46.209> ninety<00:03:46.359> nine

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
seven over nine hundred ninety nine

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.229 
seven over nine hundred ninety nine
thousand<00:03:46.959> nine<00:03:47.109> hundred<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.590> ninety<00:03:47.980> nine

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
thousand nine hundred and ninety nine

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.369 
thousand nine hundred and ninety nine
and<00:03:49.239> if<00:03:49.659> you<00:03:49.750> put<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:49.989> into<00:03:50.200> your<00:03:50.290> calculator

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
and if you put that into your calculator

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.979 
and if you put that into your calculator
and<00:03:51.220> work<00:03:51.519> it<00:03:51.639> out<00:03:51.760> you<00:03:52.180> will<00:03:52.269> see<00:03:52.329> that<00:03:52.750> that

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
and work it out you will see that that

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.460 
and work it out you will see that that
is<00:03:53.170> equal<00:03:53.319> to<00:03:53.709> 1/7<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.670> so<00:03:55.599> that's<00:03:56.139> how<00:03:56.439> to

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
is equal to 1/7 and so that's how to

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.589 
is equal to 1/7 and so that's how to
work<00:03:56.799> out<00:03:57.099> a<00:03:57.370> fraction<00:03:57.639> when<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.209> have<00:03:58.419> a

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
work out a fraction when you have a

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.649 
work out a fraction when you have a
recurring<00:03:59.230> decimal<00:03:59.349> and<00:03:59.799> as<00:04:00.669> long<00:04:00.879> as<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.419> is<00:04:01.629> a

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
recurring decimal and as long as it is a

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.509 
recurring decimal and as long as it is a
recurring<00:04:02.200> decimal<00:04:02.319> and<00:04:02.709> not<00:04:02.950> an<00:04:03.220> irrational

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
recurring decimal and not an irrational

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.789 
recurring decimal and not an irrational
number<00:04:04.120> then<00:04:04.299> you<00:04:04.989> will<00:04:05.139> always<00:04:05.349> be<00:04:05.500> able<00:04:05.620> to

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
number then you will always be able to

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.460 
number then you will always be able to
do<00:04:06.040> those<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.849> that<00:04:07.659> is<00:04:07.689> how<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.019> convert

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
do those and that is how to convert

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.609 
do those and that is how to convert
decimals<00:04:09.069> into<00:04:09.400> fractions
