I<00:00:02.060> run<00:00:03.060> into<00:00:03.270> guitar<00:00:03.540> players<00:00:03.750> all<00:00:03.959> over<00:00:04.230> the

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
I run into guitar players all over the

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:05.030 
I run into guitar players all over the
place

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
place

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.280 
place
and<00:00:05.339> I<00:00:05.879> find<00:00:06.150> people<00:00:06.420> who<00:00:06.600> are<00:00:06.779> doing<00:00:07.049> all

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
and I find people who are doing all

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.259 
and I find people who are doing all
kinds<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.649> things<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:07.950> amazed<00:00:08.490> me<00:00:08.519> when<00:00:09.120> I've

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
kinds of things that amazed me when I've

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.520 
kinds of things that amazed me when I've
been<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> student<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.870> guitar<00:00:10.110> for<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.320> long

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
been a student of the guitar for a long

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.070 
been a student of the guitar for a long
time<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:11.099> check<00:00:11.490> out<00:00:11.639> everything<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.300> just

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
time of check out everything I just

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.660 
time of check out everything I just
think<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.740> period<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.219> history<00:00:14.400> in

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
think it's that period in history in

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.400 
think it's that period in history in
which<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.000> guitar<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.509> still<00:00:15.719> pretty<00:00:15.990> new<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
which the guitar is still pretty new the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.840 
which the guitar is still pretty new the
electric<00:00:16.740> guitar<00:00:17.010> particularly<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.640> pretty

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
electric guitar particularly is pretty

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.150 
electric guitar particularly is pretty
new<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.230> amplification<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.740> acoustic

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
new and amplification on the acoustic

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.529 
new and amplification on the acoustic
guitar<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.640> let<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> lot<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> percussive

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
guitar to let a lot of the percussive

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.019 
guitar to let a lot of the percussive
things<00:00:21.900> come<00:00:22.260> through<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.769> really<00:00:23.460> pretty<00:00:23.760> new

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
things come through is really pretty new

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.630 
things come through is really pretty new
and<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.930> think<00:00:25.080> there<00:00:25.410> there's<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.220> lot<00:00:26.490> of

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
and so I think there there's a lot of

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.429 
and so I think there there's a lot of
new<00:00:26.789> techniques<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.359> are<00:00:27.449> going<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.779> on<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
new techniques that are going on on the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.929 
new techniques that are going on on the
guitar<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.800> people<00:00:29.099> have<00:00:29.250> not<00:00:29.400> just<00:00:29.640> sat<00:00:29.910> down

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
guitar and people have not just sat down

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.970 
guitar and people have not just sat down
if<00:00:30.750> they're<00:00:30.960> still<00:00:31.109> getting<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.439> discover<00:00:31.769> new

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
if they're still getting to discover new

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.299 
if they're still getting to discover new
ways<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.189> hit<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> thing<00:00:32.960> basically<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:35.250> I

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
ways to hit the thing basically and so I

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.069 
ways to hit the thing basically and so I
think<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.579> an<00:00:35.670> exciting<00:00:36.120> time<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.960> a

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
think it's an exciting time it's a

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.660 
think it's an exciting time it's a
different<00:00:37.500> time<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> history<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
different time in the history of the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.010 
different time in the history of the
guitar<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:38.940> would<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:39.329> safe<00:00:39.540> for<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.719> piano

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
guitar that would be safe for the piano

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.020 
guitar that would be safe for the piano
which<00:00:40.590> has<00:00:40.710> been<00:00:40.860> around<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.489> long<00:00:41.520> that

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
which has been around for so long that

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.150 
which has been around for so long that
everybody's<00:00:42.930> managed<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.440> agree<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.800> which

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
everybody's managed to agree on which

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.440 
everybody's managed to agree on which
technique<00:00:44.579> works<00:00:44.820> best<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.329> which

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
technique works best or which

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.810 
technique works best or which
combination<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.469> techniques<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.520> guitar

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
combination of techniques on the guitar

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.450 
combination of techniques on the guitar
it's<00:00:48.090> still<00:00:48.420> almost<00:00:48.960> anybody's<00:00:49.770> guess<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.340> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it's still almost anybody's guess as to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.639 
it's still almost anybody's guess as to
what<00:00:50.640> works<00:00:50.820> best<00:00:51.170> well<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.469> things

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
what works best well one of the things

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.930 
what works best well one of the things
that<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.100> try<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.340> layer<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.670> lot<00:00:53.850> of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
that I do is try to layer a lot of

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
that I do is try to layer a lot of
different<00:00:54.210> parts<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.660> that's<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.289> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
different parts and that's really I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.310 
different parts and that's really I
think<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.120> kind<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.390> problem-solving<00:00:57.899> on

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
think of this kind of problem-solving on

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.020 
think of this kind of problem-solving on
the<00:00:58.410> guitar<00:00:58.710> I'll<00:00:59.250> give<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.430> an<00:00:59.520> example<00:00:59.579> this

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the guitar I'll give you an example this

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.049 
the guitar I'll give you an example this
is<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.140> song<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.590> called<00:01:01.829> uuugh<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
is this is a song we do called uuugh and

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.119 
is this is a song we do called uuugh and
it<00:01:03.420> came<00:01:03.600> directly<00:01:04.199> off<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.559> record<00:01:04.979> where

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
it came directly off the record where

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.230 
it came directly off the record where
there<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.309> four<00:01:05.489> parts<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.939> thought<00:01:06.150> were

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
there are four parts that I thought were

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.899 
there are four parts that I thought were
really<00:01:06.390> important<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.930> bass<00:01:07.110> part<00:01:07.909> percussion

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
really important a bass part percussion

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.300 
really important a bass part percussion
part<00:01:09.150> which<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.450> always<00:01:09.600> important<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.740> little

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
part which is always important a little

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.370 
part which is always important a little
guitar<00:01:11.430> part<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.150> piano<00:01:12.420> part<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
guitar part and a piano part and so the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.570 
guitar part and a piano part and so the
trick<00:01:13.530> was<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.710> try<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:13.979> figure<00:01:14.250> out<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> way<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
trick was to try to figure out a way to

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.460 
trick was to try to figure out a way to
put<00:01:14.790> those<00:01:14.939> parts<00:01:15.240> together<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.290> I'll

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
put those parts together and so I'll

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.499 
put those parts together and so I'll
just<00:01:16.500> layer<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:18.030> way<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.299> normally

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
just layer it up as the way it normally

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.880 
just layer it up as the way it normally
layers<00:01:18.930> up<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> way<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.439> happened<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
layers up the way it happened on the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.160 
layers up the way it happened on the
record<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.580> here's<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> bass<00:01:21.000> part

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
record so here's the bass part

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:32.290 
record so here's the bass part

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
that's pretty much the problem-solving

that's pretty much the problem-solving
on<00:02:19.269> the<00:02:19.359> guitar<00:02:19.629> I'm<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.409> fan<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.739> Michael

Hedges<00:02:21.579> Stanley<00:02:22.569> Jordan<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.200> bet<00:02:24.159> you<00:02:24.430> know<00:02:24.579> I

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
Hedges Stanley Jordan I bet you know I

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.420 
Hedges Stanley Jordan I bet you know I
think<00:02:25.030> music<00:02:25.780> sort<00:02:26.319> of<00:02:26.409> evolves<00:02:27.129> and<00:02:27.280> it's

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
think music sort of evolves and it's

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.460 
think music sort of evolves and it's
it's<00:02:27.670> very<00:02:27.819> much<00:02:28.359> incremental<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.349> so<00:02:30.129> you'll

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
it's very much incremental and so you'll

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.899 
it's very much incremental and so you'll
for<00:02:32.470> example<00:02:32.829> I'm<00:02:33.069> doing<00:02:33.159> something<00:02:33.670> that

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
for example I'm doing something that

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.699 
for example I'm doing something that
that<00:02:34.390> appears<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.930> be<00:02:35.079> new<00:02:35.290> because<00:02:35.620> it's

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
that appears to be new because it's

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:36.929 
that appears to be new because it's
really<00:02:35.859> it's<00:02:36.010> just<00:02:36.069> a<00:02:36.220> combination<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.790> lot

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
really it's just a combination of a lot

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.160 
really it's just a combination of a lot
of<00:02:37.060> things<00:02:37.209> that<00:02:37.329> everybody<00:02:37.390> else<00:02:37.659> has<00:02:37.930> done

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
of things that everybody else has done

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.339 
of things that everybody else has done
but<00:02:38.739> it's<00:02:38.889> in<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.069> different<00:02:39.220> situation<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.510> I

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
but it's in a different situation and I

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.140 
but it's in a different situation and I
think<00:02:41.560> what<00:02:41.680> you're<00:02:41.769> going<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:41.980> find<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.489> wait

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
think what you're going to find is wait

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.059 
think what you're going to find is wait
a<00:02:43.180> few<00:02:43.420> years<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.930> you're<00:02:44.560> going<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.769> see<00:02:44.920> all

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
a few years and you're going to see all

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.770 
a few years and you're going to see all
kinds<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.400> people<00:02:45.670> that<00:02:45.700> are<00:02:45.939> taking<00:02:46.060> what<00:02:46.629> I'm

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
kinds of people that are taking what I'm

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.839 
kinds of people that are taking what I'm
doing<00:02:47.019> right<00:02:47.230> now<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.739> they're<00:02:48.639> going<00:02:48.760> to

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
doing right now and they're going to

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.210 
doing right now and they're going to
appear<00:02:49.209> really<00:02:49.480> innovative<00:02:50.079> because<00:02:50.590> they'll

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
appear really innovative because they'll

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.619 
appear really innovative because they'll
go<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.370> lot<00:02:51.579> farther<00:02:51.760> than<00:02:51.939> I<00:02:52.120> thought<00:02:52.359> of<00:02:52.480> going

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
go a lot farther than I thought of going

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.300 
go a lot farther than I thought of going
with<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.900> same<00:02:53.169> thing<00:02:53.439> that's<00:02:53.919> just<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.189> way

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
with the same thing that's just the way

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.059 
with the same thing that's just the way
it<00:02:54.400> develops<00:02:54.819> so<00:02:55.599> I<00:02:55.659> sort<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.590> hate<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:56.799> single

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
it develops so I sort of hate to single

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.800 
it develops so I sort of hate to single
people<00:02:57.400> out<00:02:57.609> just<00:02:57.879> because<00:02:58.209> you're<00:02:58.659> going<00:02:58.720> to

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
people out just because you're going to

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.089 
people out just because you're going to
find<00:02:58.989> some<00:02:59.200> guy<00:02:59.319> on<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.530> street<00:02:59.739> corner<00:02:59.919> I've

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
find some guy on a street corner I've

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.640 
find some guy on a street corner I've
got<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.280> nephew<00:03:01.269> that<00:03:01.569> sits<00:03:01.810> there<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.079> whacks

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
got a nephew that sits there and whacks

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.490 
got a nephew that sits there and whacks
away<00:03:02.889> on<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.099> guitar<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:04.079> he<00:03:05.079> doesn't<00:03:05.349> do<00:03:05.409> it

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
away on the guitar and he doesn't do it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.839 
away on the guitar and he doesn't do it
the<00:03:05.560> way<00:03:05.650> everybody<00:03:05.859> else<00:03:06.159> says<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.549> but<00:03:06.669> it's

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
the way everybody else says it but it's

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.450 
the way everybody else says it but it's
it's<00:03:07.180> great
