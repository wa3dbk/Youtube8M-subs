00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.350 
just speaking about the 2014 regulations
and<00:00:35.989> how<00:00:36.140> they<00:00:37.070> impacted<00:00:37.550> on<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:37.730> importance

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
and how they impacted on the importance

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.540 
and how they impacted on the importance
of<00:00:38.690> race<00:00:39.260> feel<00:00:39.530> you<00:00:39.920> know<00:00:40.010> you've<00:00:40.160> wondered

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
of race feel you know you've wondered

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.180 
of race feel you know you've wondered
what<00:00:41.050> was<00:00:42.050> been<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.350> real<00:00:42.500> game<00:00:42.710> changer<00:00:43.160> for

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
what was been the real game changer for

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.020 
what was been the real game changer for
you<00:00:43.400> this<00:00:43.550> season

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
you this season

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.970 
you this season
yeah<00:00:44.330> I<00:00:44.390> think<00:00:44.510> I<00:00:44.960> think<00:00:45.020> obviously<00:00:45.559> taught<00:00:45.800> to

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
yeah I think I think obviously taught to

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.560 
yeah I think I think obviously taught to
chant<00:00:46.190> about<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.550> fuel<00:00:46.760> then<00:00:47.360> Phi<00:00:47.510> the

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
chant about the fuel then Phi the

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.060 
chant about the fuel then Phi the
changes<00:00:48.050> in<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.199> Reg<00:00:48.379> says<00:00:48.410> you<00:00:48.739> know<00:00:48.830> they're

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
changes in the Reg says you know they're

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.010 
changes in the Reg says you know they're
really<00:00:49.160> significant<00:00:49.730> for<00:00:49.790> Perkins<00:00:50.270> to<00:00:50.510> throw

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
really significant for Perkins to throw

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.990 
really significant for Perkins to throw
the<00:00:51.170> main<00:00:51.379> thing<00:00:51.650> is<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.040> downsizing<00:00:52.699> of

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
the main thing is the the downsizing of

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.720 
the main thing is the the downsizing of
the<00:00:53.120> per-unit<00:00:53.390> so<00:00:54.230> we<00:00:54.350> go<00:00:54.500> from<00:00:54.650> a<00:00:54.800> 2.4<00:00:55.699> liter

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
the per-unit so we go from a 2.4 liter

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.530 
the per-unit so we go from a 2.4 liter
v8<00:00:56.300> to<00:00:57.019> 1.6<00:00:57.680> or<00:00:57.890> services<00:00:58.430> really<00:00:59.210> with<00:00:59.450> the

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
v8 to 1.6 or services really with the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.120 
v8 to 1.6 or services really with the
same<00:00:59.750> light<00:00:59.989> that<00:01:00.170> are<00:01:00.320> even<00:01:00.710> better<00:01:00.739> right

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
same light that are even better right

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.010 
same light that are even better right
there<00:01:01.340> nine<00:01:01.670> creases<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.540> pie<00:01:02.720> repair

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
there nine creases the pie repair

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.590 
there nine creases the pie repair
reservation<00:01:03.649> okay<00:01:04.190> so<00:01:04.729> does<00:01:04.850> that<00:01:04.880> resulting

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
reservation okay so does that resulting

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.450 
reservation okay so does that resulting
in<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.290> engines<00:01:06.560> running<00:01:06.770> much<00:01:07.009> hotter<00:01:07.250> this

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
in the engines running much hotter this

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.400 
in the engines running much hotter this
season<00:01:07.910> yeah<00:01:08.149> the<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.630> running<00:01:08.869> much<00:01:09.020> shorter

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
season yeah the the running much shorter

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.930 
season yeah the the running much shorter
that<00:01:09.590> that's<00:01:09.800> a<00:01:09.950> challenge<00:01:10.280> for<00:01:10.340> us<00:01:10.490> we've<00:01:10.759> had

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
that that's a challenge for us we've had

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.660 
that that's a challenge for us we've had
to<00:01:11.090> be<00:01:11.270> engineered<00:01:12.009> patronage<00:01:13.009> sent<00:01:13.280> in<00:01:13.430> for

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
to be engineered patronage sent in for

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.660 
to be engineered patronage sent in for
the<00:01:14.030> race<00:01:14.149> car<00:01:14.450> for<00:01:15.440> this<00:01:15.530> year<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:15.860> this<00:01:16.610> year

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
the race car for this year so this year

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.219 
the race car for this year so this year
if<00:01:16.910> we've<00:01:17.210> got<00:01:17.360> a<00:01:17.390> carefully<00:01:17.869> balanced

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
if we've got a carefully balanced

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.130 
if we've got a carefully balanced
mission<00:01:19.300> synthetic<00:01:20.300> they<00:01:20.450> saw<00:01:20.660> and<00:01:20.869> I<00:01:20.930> say

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
mission synthetic they saw and I say

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.660 
mission synthetic they saw and I say
I'll<00:01:21.200> kill<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.649> engine<00:01:21.979> it's<00:01:22.280> running<00:01:22.520> much

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
I'll kill the engine it's running much

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.520 
I'll kill the engine it's running much
shorter<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.570> then<00:01:23.720> power<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.289> swastikas

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
shorter and then power the swastikas

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.770 
shorter and then power the swastikas
there's<00:01:25.190> they<00:01:25.700> can<00:01:26.060> make<00:01:26.240> even<00:01:26.539> higher

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
there's they can make even higher

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.100 
there's they can make even higher
temperatures<00:01:27.200> help<00:01:27.560> stop<00:01:27.860> door<00:01:28.130> opening

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
temperatures help stop door opening

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.800 
temperatures help stop door opening
okay<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:29.980> that<00:01:30.550> is<00:01:30.580> that<00:01:30.850> is<00:01:31.120> the<00:01:31.390> thing<00:01:31.570> is

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
okay so that is that is the thing is

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.870 
okay so that is that is the thing is
that<00:01:31.960> related<00:01:32.230> to<00:01:32.410> does<00:01:33.190> that<00:01:33.310> impact<00:01:33.640> on

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
that related to does that impact on

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.490 
that related to does that impact on
friction<00:01:34.120> or<00:01:34.360> is<00:01:34.450> that<00:01:34.540> related<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:34.990> friction

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
friction or is that related to friction

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.620 
friction or is that related to friction
yeah<00:01:36.010> no<00:01:36.310> friction<00:01:36.820> is<00:01:36.940> a<00:01:36.970> real<00:01:37.180> killer<00:01:37.420> on<00:01:37.600> a

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
yeah no friction is a real killer on a

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.810 
yeah no friction is a real killer on a
Formula<00:01:38.050> One<00:01:38.110> car<00:01:38.230> and<00:01:38.740> particularly<00:01:39.640> on<00:01:39.730> the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
Formula One car and particularly on the

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.140 
Formula One car and particularly on the
engine<00:01:40.150> so<00:01:40.930> friction<00:01:41.320> reduces<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.490> power<00:01:42.700> it

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
engine so friction reduces the power it

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150 
engine so friction reduces the power it
also<00:01:43.540> creates<00:01:44.080> heat<00:01:44.290> which<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:44.800> thing<00:01:45.010> for

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
also creates heat which you thing for

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.270 
also creates heat which you thing for
the<00:01:45.220> call<00:01:45.480> but<00:01:46.480> worst<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:46.810> all<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:47.170> damages<00:01:48.130> the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
the call but worst of all it damages the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.450 
the call but worst of all it damages the
engine<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:49.690> year<00:01:50.020> you<00:01:50.710> have<00:01:50.890> only<00:01:51.070> five

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
engine and this year you have only five

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.070 
engine and this year you have only five
units<00:01:52.210> to<00:01:52.390> get<00:01:52.540> them<00:01:52.660> through<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.930> whole

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
units to get them through the whole

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.890 
units to get them through the whole
season<00:01:53.730> which<00:01:54.730> is<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.910> lot<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.120> lot<00:01:55.570> of<00:01:55.600> mileage

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
season which is a lot of lot of mileage

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.210 
season which is a lot of lot of mileage
per<00:01:56.500> engine<00:01:56.890> so<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:58.710> lubricant<00:01:59.710> and<00:01:59.950> how<00:02:00.100> it

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
per engine so the lubricant and how it

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.650 
per engine so the lubricant and how it
protects<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.730> engine<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:01.150> absolutely

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
protects the engine is absolutely

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.770 
protects the engine is absolutely
crucial<00:02:01.870> to<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.260> championship<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:03.760> you<00:02:04.660> know

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
crucial to the championship so you know

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.260 
crucial to the championship so you know
we<00:02:04.960> work<00:02:05.170> very<00:02:05.200> closely<00:02:05.650> with<00:02:06.100> Petronas<00:02:07.030> they

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
we work very closely with Petronas they

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.750 
we work very closely with Petronas they
work<00:02:07.450> very<00:02:07.690> closely<00:02:08.100> in<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.250> design<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.580> the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
work very closely in the design of the

from<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.700> beginning<00:02:13.060> so<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:13.990> sounds<00:02:14.260> like

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290
