it's a fascinating structure actually
that<00:00:03.150> has<00:00:03.270> led<00:00:03.480> some<00:00:03.690> people<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:04.080> call<00:00:04.500> it<00:00:04.680> a

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
call the for movement structure Eileen

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.340 
call the for movement structure Eileen
to<00:00:11.220> the<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.760> the<00:00:11.790> middle<00:00:12.360> one<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:13.050> it's<00:00:13.230> a

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.350 
to the to the middle one that it's a

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.770 
to the to the middle one that it's a
three<00:00:13.590> movement<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.430> starts<00:00:14.880> off<00:00:15.030> with<00:00:15.270> a<00:00:15.330> very

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
three movement it starts off with a very

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.920 
three movement it starts off with a very
elaborate<00:00:16.560> accompanied<00:00:17.280> cadenza<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.060> it's

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
elaborate accompanied cadenza and it's

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.450 
elaborate accompanied cadenza and it's
of<00:00:19.170> such<00:00:19.470> big<00:00:20.480> and<00:00:21.480> vast<00:00:21.720> proportion<00:00:22.530> that<00:00:22.710> it

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
of such big and vast proportion that it

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.190 
of such big and vast proportion that it
seems<00:00:23.789> like<00:00:24.030> a<00:00:24.060> movement<00:00:24.480> itself<00:00:24.780> and<00:00:25.050> that's

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
seems like a movement itself and that's

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.660 
seems like a movement itself and that's
what<00:00:25.380> has<00:00:25.530> led<00:00:25.710> some<00:00:25.890> people<00:00:25.950> to<00:00:26.250> call<00:00:26.520> this

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
what has led some people to call this

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.490 
what has led some people to call this
the<00:00:26.850> first<00:00:27.060> movement<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.570> don't<00:00:28.110> think<00:00:28.350> so<00:00:28.470> i

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
the first movement I don't think so i

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500 
the first movement I don't think so i
think<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.100> a<00:00:29.369> large<00:00:29.670> introduction

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
think it's a it's a large introduction

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
certainly want to call it vigorous and

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.479 
certainly want to call it vigorous and
very<00:00:52.859> inert<00:00:53.339> energetic<00:00:54.350> main<00:00:55.350> movement<00:00:55.620> now

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
very inert energetic main movement now

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.090 
very inert energetic main movement now
in<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.030> an<00:00:57.179> actual<00:00:57.769> cadenza<00:00:58.769> as<00:00:58.889> well

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
in that is an actual cadenza as well

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
piece which has led some people to say

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.920 
piece which has led some people to say
it's<00:01:14.399> a<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.640> movement<00:01:15.030> structure<00:01:15.390> because<00:01:15.719> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it's a to movement structure because the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.160 
it's a to movement structure because the
second<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.649> third<00:01:16.859> movement<00:01:17.759> are<00:01:18.479> again<00:01:18.930> go

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
second and third movement are again go

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.139 
second and third movement are again go
right<00:01:19.409> into<00:01:19.590> each<00:01:19.829> other<00:01:20.039> and<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.850> have<00:01:21.000> an

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
exquisite slow movement that is I don't

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.389 
exquisite slow movement that is I don't
know<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.579> again<00:01:27.539> it<00:01:27.780> would<00:01:28.109> be<00:01:28.140> 22<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.159> would<00:01:29.280> be

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
know it again it would be 22 it would be

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.399

back Narian elements totally and it has

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.380 
back Narian elements totally and it has
moments<00:01:34.649> of<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.189> moments<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:36.090> it's

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
moments of this and moments because it's

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.130 
moments of this and moments because it's

his own its own piece but it's extremely

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.380 
his own its own piece but it's extremely
aleejack<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.380> ends<00:01:41.100> harmonically<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.240> would

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
aleejack and ends harmonically you would

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.109 
aleejack and ends harmonically you would
think<00:01:42.630> except<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.499> final<00:01:43.920> final<00:01:44.549> note<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.999> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
think except the final final note in the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.660 
think except the final final note in the
violin<00:01:45.539> leave<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.469> question<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.159> that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
violin leave it as a question and that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.770 
violin leave it as a question and that
leaves<00:01:47.850> us<00:01:47.969> right<00:01:48.270> into<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.719> final

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
leaves us right into the final

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.510 
leaves us right into the final
concluding<00:01:51.780> movement<00:01:52.740> which<00:01:53.369> has<00:01:53.579> again<00:01:55.520> some

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
concluding movement which has again some

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.459 
concluding movement which has again some
sense<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.060> ambiguity<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.929> its<00:01:58.079> character

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
sense of ambiguity in its character

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.289 
sense of ambiguity in its character
because<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.920> could<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.789> a<00:02:00.060> very<00:02:01.039> aristocratic

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
because it could be a very aristocratic

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.780 
because it could be a very aristocratic
sort<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.450> not<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> minuet<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:05.159> kind<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.909> light

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
sort of not a minuet but kind of a light

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.470 
sort of not a minuet but kind of a light
