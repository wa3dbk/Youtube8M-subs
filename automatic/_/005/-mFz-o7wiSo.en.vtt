as ice mentioned in the packet delivery
video<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:14.929> the<00:00:15.929> less<00:00:16.199> poseable

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
video this is the the less poseable

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.760 
video this is the the less poseable
version<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.699> one<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.210> easier<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.260> find<00:00:19.560> I

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
version the one that is easier to find I

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.759 
version the one that is easier to find I
think<00:00:19.800> they<00:00:20.039> made<00:00:20.160> more<00:00:21.470> copies<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.680> when

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
think they made more copies of it when

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.759 
think they made more copies of it when
they<00:00:22.859> went<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.180> produce<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.420> model<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.529> there's

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
they went to produce a model and there's

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.230 
they went to produce a model and there's
another<00:00:25.859> version<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.760> get<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:26.939> is

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
another version that you can get that is

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.490 
another version that you can get that is
far<00:00:27.480> more<00:00:27.599> poseable<00:00:28.050> comes<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.380> some

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
far more poseable comes with some

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.950 
far more poseable comes with some
different<00:00:28.680> characters<00:00:29.420> but<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:30.750> really

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
different characters but it's really

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.810 
different characters but it's really
hard<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.289> find<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.740> relatively<00:00:32.550> expensive

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
hard to find and relatively expensive

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.479 
hard to find and relatively expensive
compared<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.480> one<00:00:33.590> so<00:00:34.590> until<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.340> day<00:00:35.460> i

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
compared to this one so until the day i

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.500 
compared to this one so until the day i
can<00:00:35.760> find<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.360> or<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:38.510> good

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
can find that that or that one in a good

I think connect from the backpack to the

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.500 
I think connect from the backpack to the
wings<00:03:21.100> themselves<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.639> then<00:03:21.970> this<00:03:22.090> big<00:03:22.299> piece

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
wings themselves and then this big piece

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.930

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.550 

is<00:03:44.290> like<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.250> really<00:03:45.760> dark<00:03:46.420> gray<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:46.930> I<00:03:47.170> guess

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
is like a really dark gray and I guess

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.860 
is like a really dark gray and I guess
this<00:03:47.680> is<00:03:47.860> technically<00:03:48.190> black<00:03:48.430> isn't<00:03:48.870> just

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
this is technically black isn't just

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.530 
this is technically black isn't just
think<00:03:50.020> it<00:03:50.080> looked<00:03:50.560> really<00:03:50.709> go<00:03:50.860> straight<00:03:51.130> but

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
think it looked really go straight but

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.630 
think it looked really go straight but

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
if these are all molten black here you

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.410 
if these are all molten black here you

even going since don't take me all that
long<00:05:44.660> I<00:05:44.690> mean<00:05:44.900> it<00:05:45.020> take<00:05:45.110> me<00:05:45.230> longer<00:05:45.410> than<00:05:45.560> a<00:05:45.770> up

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
long I mean it take me longer than a up

the high-grade got them kit but nothing

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.220 
the high-grade got them kit but nothing
close<00:05:49.910> to<00:05:50.030> like<00:05:50.300> the<00:05:50.510> level<00:05:50.870> of<00:05:50.900> time<00:05:51.050> it<00:05:51.170> takes

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
close to like the level of time it takes

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.600 
close to like the level of time it takes
me<00:05:51.350> to<00:05:51.440> build<00:05:51.680> the<00:05:51.740> master<00:05:52.100> raid<00:05:52.250> and

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
me to build the master raid and

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:53.890 
me to build the master raid and
concerning<00:05:53.180> this<00:05:53.300> one<00:05:53.450> isn't<00:05:53.690> quite<00:05:53.720> as

concerning this one isn't quite as

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.030 
concerning this one isn't quite as
possible<00:05:54.080> i'm<00:05:54.380> guessing<00:05:54.800> we'll<00:05:54.890> probably

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
possible i'm guessing we'll probably

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.400 
possible i'm guessing we'll probably
take<00:05:55.190> even<00:05:55.460> less<00:05:55.550> time<00:05:55.760> the<00:05:55.910> most<00:05:56.169> even<00:05:57.169> going

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
take even less time the most even going

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.070 
take even less time the most even going
kids<00:05:57.590> take<00:05:57.770> me<00:05:57.919> so<00:05:58.210> if<00:05:59.210> you<00:05:59.240> guys<00:05:59.510> can<00:05:59.780> look<00:05:59.870> for
