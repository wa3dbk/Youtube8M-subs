is a brushed aluminum it produces a
green<00:00:22.090> static<00:00:22.660> stark<00:00:22.930> field<00:00:23.170> and<00:00:23.410> this<00:00:23.830> works

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
green static stark field and this works

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.810 
green static stark field and this works
for<00:00:24.220> most<00:00:24.670> outdoor<00:00:25.120> environments<00:00:26.580> next<00:00:27.580> step

up<00:00:28.030> from<00:00:28.240> that<00:00:28.360> picture<00:00:28.780> would<00:00:29.170> be<00:00:29.440> this<00:00:30.280> one

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
up from that picture would be this one

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.479 
up from that picture would be this one
which<00:00:31.300> is<00:00:31.330> our<00:00:31.630> brass<00:00:31.930> housing<00:00:32.230> this<00:00:33.070> is<00:00:33.250> more

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
which is our brass housing this is more

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.939 
which is our brass housing this is more
suited<00:00:33.910> this<00:00:34.270> will<00:00:34.809> take<00:00:35.379> care<00:00:35.530> of<00:00:35.590> all<00:00:35.770> your

atmospheres<00:00:36.460> plus<00:00:37.109> soft<00:00:38.109> air<00:00:38.469> so<00:00:38.920> if<00:00:39.069> you're

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
atmospheres plus soft air so if you're

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.000 
atmospheres plus soft air so if you're
down<00:00:40.300> by<00:00:40.480> the<00:00:40.539> water<00:00:40.839> having<00:00:41.559> these<00:00:41.649> fixtures

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
down by the water having these fixtures

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.739 
down by the water having these fixtures
outside<00:00:42.399> the<00:00:42.550> salt<00:00:42.760> air<00:00:42.909> is<00:00:43.239> not<00:00:43.510> going<00:00:43.690> to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
outside the salt air is not going to

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:46.849 
outside the salt air is not going to
corrode<00:00:44.050> when<00:00:44.589> you've<00:00:44.710> got<00:00:44.890> a<00:00:44.920> brass<00:00:45.460> housing

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
corrode when you've got a brass housing

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.829 
corrode when you've got a brass housing
also<00:00:47.859> produces<00:00:48.309> a<00:00:48.339> static<00:00:49.239> pattern<00:00:49.539> star

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
also produces a static pattern star

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.869 
also produces a static pattern star
field<00:00:50.079> that<00:00:50.559> will<00:00:50.889> actually<00:00:51.460> have<00:00:51.639> some

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
field that will actually have some

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.479 
field that will actually have some
motion<00:00:52.120> in<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.719> trees<00:00:53.019> as<00:00:53.350> long<00:00:53.710> as<00:00:53.889> wind<00:00:54.159> is

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
motion in the trees as long as wind is

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.239 
motion in the trees as long as wind is
moving<00:00:55.030> those<00:00:55.389> trees<00:00:55.719> but<00:00:56.289> if<00:00:56.589> you<00:00:56.799> don't<00:00:57.100> have

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
moving those trees but if you don't have

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:58.770 
moving those trees but if you don't have
a<00:00:57.280> lot<00:00:57.429> of<00:00:57.460> wind<00:00:57.699> where<00:00:57.819> you<00:00:57.909> live<00:00:58.120> then<00:00:58.659> you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
a lot of wind where you live then you

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.779 
a lot of wind where you live then you
might<00:00:58.960> want<00:00:59.199> to<00:00:59.289> move<00:01:00.190> up<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:00.489> something<00:01:00.760> like

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
might want to move up to something like

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.100 
might want to move up to something like
this<00:01:01.059> this<00:01:01.629> is<00:01:01.839> our<00:01:02.019> LS<00:01:02.739> unit<00:01:03.249> it<00:01:03.879> does<00:01:04.239> provide

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
this this is our LS unit it does provide

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.130 
this this is our LS unit it does provide
a<00:01:05.440> moving<00:01:06.100> green<00:01:06.670> star<00:01:07.030> field<00:01:07.299> and<00:01:07.510> this<00:01:07.900> is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
a moving green star field and this is

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.770 
a moving green star field and this is
all<00:01:08.409> weather<00:01:08.680> as<00:01:08.979> well<00:01:09.189> to<00:01:09.460> each<00:01:10.450> of<00:01:10.689> the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
all weather as well to each of the

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.859 
all weather as well to each of the
unit's<00:01:11.079> operates<00:01:11.680> on<00:01:11.979> anywhere<00:01:12.640> between<00:01:12.869> 2

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
unit's operates on anywhere between 2

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.139 
unit's operates on anywhere between 2
and<00:01:14.289> as<00:01:14.469> much<00:01:14.649> as<00:01:14.710> 10<00:01:15.100> watts<00:01:15.340> of<00:01:15.549> power<00:01:15.729> so

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
and as much as 10 watts of power so

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.700 
and as much as 10 watts of power so
they're<00:01:16.329> very<00:01:16.360> easy<00:01:16.810> on<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.079> electric<00:01:17.560> bill

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
they're very easy on the electric bill

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.590 
they're very easy on the electric bill
and<00:01:18.329> they're<00:01:19.329> also<00:01:19.479> great<00:01:19.840> when<00:01:20.109> it<00:01:20.229> comes<00:01:20.439> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
and they're also great when it comes to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.670 
and they're also great when it comes to
different<00:01:22.600> themes<00:01:22.930> if<00:01:23.380> you're<00:01:23.560> doing

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
now for our LS and LS a units on the

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.270 
now for our LS and LS a units on the
permanent<00:01:47.200> install<00:01:47.770> we've<00:01:47.979> got<00:01:48.130> these

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
permanent install we've got these

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.950 
permanent install we've got these
transformers<00:01:48.820> right<00:01:48.999> over<00:01:49.210> here<00:01:49.479> these<00:01:49.899> are

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
transformers right over here these are

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.859 
transformers right over here these are
AC<00:01:50.590> units<00:01:51.159> 12-volt<00:01:51.789> and<00:01:51.999> if<00:01:52.359> you<00:01:52.450> open<00:01:52.689> up<00:01:52.749> the

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
AC units 12-volt and if you open up the

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.230 
AC units 12-volt and if you open up the
top<00:01:53.049> I<00:01:53.380> even<00:01:53.679> have<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:54.159> little<00:01:54.579> timer<00:01:54.820> on<00:01:55.060> there

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
top I even have a little timer on there

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.319 
top I even have a little timer on there
so<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:56.049> can<00:01:56.200> set<00:01:56.350> your<00:01:56.469> fixtures<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.329> whatever
