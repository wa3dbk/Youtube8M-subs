00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:02.350
 an ambulance 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.350
 maintain 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:18.369
 this one is not yet 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.390
 so here's the video with as first 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.530
 who explains how to achieve fortin% in germany 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.899
 so first have the trap debate the sum 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.749
 So what is the soukra here 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:34.700
 the place against the perfect school block 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.700
 the coupons but in addition it allows to dig a ride 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.100
 e then for us my biggest system so it's a performance 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.720
 or how busy 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.560
 So here are two tete-a-teteos on cetacean studies in a document 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.800
 well like that 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.840
 online app store 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.210
 and therefore a circuit platform 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.800
 to the state and to ruin 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.360
 investigation 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.460
 whatever happens in full swing 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.520
 finally the buttons of the accusers 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.840
 it does not matter 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.159
 so in June I saw here 5th 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.230
 and hailed by accepting 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.760
 so that his memoirs 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.020
 9 a myth 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.900
 for those who are not very high with that go see the money rate 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.040
 day by day 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.610
 I present well 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.550
 so here we go to see how he was going to 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.790
 so already 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.060
 for that I called and stairs yes but that was to talk about it 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.050
 so to be like that 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.620
 so to feed them 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.570
 it is enough that it will not sound on the wire on which it opposed so like that 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.380
 a saint-quentinois 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.320
 often I'm not going to hide the circulars from what I just got from you 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.690
 explain 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.140
 so I knew that everything seems 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.500
 we will make a beautiful meeting 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 paris 6 oct 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.879
 the wrongs 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.699
 we assume 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.699
 it's okay 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.879
 so we went through there you go but we have to think 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.959
 in the camp it's like that 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.959
 at that time only the works were to do this 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.849
 so we'll fix that 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.929
 for a final it does not change absolutely anything 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:46.929
 e 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.809
 fucking shit 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.279
 but the breath 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.609
 so then 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.779
 then the little button to squeeze a little bit of pressure could be 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.569
 beffy prosecutor we're on the safe side 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.089
 so that's the reason 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:07.949
 so it has to be the signifier here 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.169
 he has like this and on pressure methods 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.169
 it's the most useful in the whole canton 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:15.939
 e 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.639
 finally that 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.999
 so damascus production volume 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.249
 here we are 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:26.349
 quevilly cfa and those who know more what to do 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.349
 but by cons I'm not crazy 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.969
 e 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.379
 3 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.379
 ignoble canada who will initiate meaning 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.569
 on a beach by appointment 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.609
 it's like that 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.680
 for this inde problem we must think about the club of pines 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.239
 I do not know how to do 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.649
 in the same position I'm lazy 

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:03.649
 long thoughtful 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.769
 we are here watching the river 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:13.969
 no no what we do is when we do not care by placing payers 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.079
 only 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.070
 mockus here it's our soul thompson little pressure more collective pieces 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.079
 we will not allow ourselves 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.229
 and his family 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.879
 so that's his wings 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.520
 these rates had paired a little simpler 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.770
 after a clash between the circuits for me I'm just doing it too 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.529
 caused a huge audience 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.150
 before we go on me 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.879
 but she does all the wiring 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.559
 and for 100 points 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:48.490
 for me it's a bit more complicated because as I like 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.509
 the busy mother eads and stairs afp 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.509
 while the mark was just to show 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.289
 for you to express so that's how it is 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:07.599
 except that where we want the nationality 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.599
 not like this 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.509
 ferrara moment of writing 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.509
 it's sienna and pato would not be simpler 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:33.959
 to see the movie was complicated life to make big jumps on the 

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.930
 sides of jk shin circuit 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.930
 in fact, you just have to do it like what you're talking about before 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.580
 ben moubamba 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.830
 to see the paper version the pvp blue helmets have to take its course 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.999
 click here even if you hide it 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.999
 ways to go on the side like that to walk on bangkok 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:57.860
 so for a problematic 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.050
 if we want to do that but it's really half an hour 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.050
 so if we want to conceal 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.400
 can you do hers 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.339
 that's good 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:11.979
 it's just for aesthetics a game that looks strong below it's 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.229
 really ashamed 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.229
 it's a balanced text can you white Saturday 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.080
 so I know it's to accelerate over 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.800
 so that is 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.279
 in fact it goes behind like that 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.819
 it's going straight and for that it must be said that it is sent that 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.150
 smell good it's a great champion 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.439
 and with boeing 

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:49.619
 we can do stuff that a lot more pretty costumes 

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:52.809
 she wants to be safe, it's gone like that 

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:55.559
 he was two laps to his side 

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:58.559
 so more hostile 

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:08.059
 still all women 

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:12.979
 so that's the end of this video 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:16.389
 we will stay away but he was sacked 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:19.789
 but during that time kind I take the opportunity to tell you 

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:23.690
 you go the signed comments we are all very proud 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:28.800
 masters in eubea start dust also if you like all 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.550
 the csa has improved their ranking on Monday 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.550
 video in the study made of saint-andrÃ©-de-bohon 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.030
 and so if you have any suggestions from Bahrain 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.030
 you can send me a message I will answer no 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.999
 when the wind blows again 

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:46.110
 so that's the fault of taste 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.280
 thanks to watch you 

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.940
 but only goal
