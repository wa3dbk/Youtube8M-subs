00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
waiting for I'm just going explaining

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.060 
waiting for I'm just going explaining
the<00:03:04.450> way<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.690> we're<00:03:04.780> weighing<00:03:04.930> in<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:05.920> we're

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
the way that we're weighing in so we're

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.130 
the way that we're weighing in so we're
gonna<00:03:06.190> do<00:03:06.280> at<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.430> same<00:03:06.670> time<00:03:06.970> each<00:03:07.360> week<00:03:07.660> so

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
gonna do at the same time each week so

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.180 
gonna do at the same time each week so
this<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.410> little<00:03:08.500> after<00:03:08.920> nine<00:03:09.040> o'clock

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
this is a little after nine o'clock

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.000 
this is a little after nine o'clock
friday<00:03:09.760> morning<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.330> so<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.560> same<00:03:11.740> amount<00:03:11.950> of

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
friday morning and so the same amount of

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.980 
friday morning and so the same amount of
eating<00:03:12.280> will<00:03:12.400> have<00:03:12.520> happened<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.810> same

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
eating will have happened and the same

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.229 
eating will have happened and the same
amount<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.490> emptying<00:03:15.490> your<00:03:15.550> bowels<00:03:16.000> will<00:03:16.150> have

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
amount of emptying your bowels will have

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.910 
amount of emptying your bowels will have
happened<00:03:16.600> theoretically<00:03:17.080> by<00:03:17.260> this<00:03:17.410> point<00:03:17.620> and

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
happened theoretically by this point and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.440 
happened theoretically by this point and
so<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.880> won't<00:03:19.090> be<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.180> hundred<00:03:19.330> percent

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
so it won't be a hundred percent

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.030 
so it won't be a hundred percent
accurate<00:03:20.019> but<00:03:20.110> it's<00:03:20.200> going<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.350> be<00:03:20.440> relative

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
accurate but it's going to be relative

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.470 
accurate but it's going to be relative
to<00:03:21.070> this<00:03:21.280> weight<00:03:21.519> like<00:03:21.700> I<00:03:21.970> know<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.239> is<00:03:22.390> going

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
to this weight like I know this is going

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.640 
to this weight like I know this is going
to<00:03:22.570> weigh<00:03:22.660> me<00:03:22.810> heavier<00:03:23.080> than<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.290> weigh<00:03:23.410> at<00:03:23.500> home

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
to weigh me heavier than I weigh at home

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.650 
to weigh me heavier than I weigh at home
but<00:03:24.519> that's<00:03:24.640> okay<00:03:24.850> as<00:03:24.940> long<00:03:25.000> as<00:03:25.209> relatively

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
but that's okay as long as relatively

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.870 
but that's okay as long as relatively
lose<00:03:25.930> 20<00:03:26.140> pounds<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:27.430> scale<00:03:27.610> that<00:03:27.670> we

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
lose 20 pounds and the scale that we

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.880 
lose 20 pounds and the scale that we
have<00:03:28.090> kind<00:03:28.870> of<00:03:28.930> gives<00:03:29.080> varying<00:03:29.380> results<00:03:29.530> so

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
have kind of gives varying results so

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.410 
have kind of gives varying results so
we're<00:03:29.980> going<00:03:30.070> to<00:03:30.160> weigh<00:03:30.459> ourselves<00:03:30.640> two<00:03:31.300> or

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
we're going to weigh ourselves two or

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.960 
we're going to weigh ourselves two or
three<00:03:31.540> times<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:31.930> dick<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.080> average<00:03:32.489> ok<00:03:33.489> so

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
three times and dick the average ok so

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.940 
three times and dick the average ok so
go<00:03:34.120> ahead<00:03:34.209> fable<00:03:35.050> go<00:03:35.140> first<00:03:35.380> cuz<00:03:35.590> he's<00:03:35.709> lighter

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
go ahead fable go first cuz he's lighter

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.900 
go ahead fable go first cuz he's lighter
than<00:03:36.100> me<00:03:36.250> now<00:03:36.540> unlike<00:03:37.540> last<00:03:37.840> time<00:03:38.700> where<00:03:39.700> he

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
than me now unlike last time where he

an iron 76.8 hold on hold on oh ok glad

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.640 
an iron 76.8 hold on hold on oh ok glad
i<00:03:52.209> didn't<00:03:52.480> realize<00:03:52.720> i<00:03:53.019> didn't<00:03:53.290> realize<00:03:53.530> it

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
i didn't realize i didn't realize it

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.630 
i didn't realize i didn't realize it
would<00:03:53.709> go<00:03:53.830> right<00:03:53.950> away<00:03:55.470> 170<00:03:56.470> 6.8<00:03:57.010> ok<00:03:57.430> that's

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
would go right away 170 6.8 ok that's

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.550 
would go right away 170 6.8 ok that's
good<00:03:57.790> if<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.540> get<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.690> twice<00:03:58.930> in<00:03:59.080> a<00:03:59.140> row<00:03:59.230> i<00:03:59.260> think

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
good if you get a twice in a row i think

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.580 
good if you get a twice in a row i think
it<00:03:59.680> sticks<00:03:59.950> that's<00:04:00.700> probably<00:04:00.940> right<00:04:01.630> for<00:04:02.410> this

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
it sticks that's probably right for this

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.030 
it sticks that's probably right for this
