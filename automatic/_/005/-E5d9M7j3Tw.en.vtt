00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.009
 Oh 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.830
 no 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.460
 yeah 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.750
 the basics of photography 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.800
 depth of field hello and 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.020
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.650
 today devoted to the basics of 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.930
 photography 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.750
 more specifically at the depth of 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.850
 field and to the notion of openness that 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.300
 are two closely related concepts 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.399
 since one can handle the other 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.590
 so what is the depth of 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.090
 field first of all it's the area of 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.340
 sharpness of your image that's what will 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.489
 do you want to have a first 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.640
 plan a median plan 1000 or in 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.420
 background that are going to be sharp or fuzzy 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.400
 and that you will be able to regulate 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.900
 the opening we will come back to after 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.760
 you will be able to choose if your 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.350
 foreground must be sharp and your 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.520
 Blurred background if your background 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.320
 must be net is your foreground 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.640
 blur this is by putting in the bottom but 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.530
 you will also be able to say I want and 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.860
 that my foreground and that my back 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.720
 plan be net and not just a 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.750
 of the two is so that's how 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.830
 will be able to manage the depth of field 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.230
 so I told you we were going to have 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.970
 play for it on opening then 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.980
 the opening what is it is in 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.229
 does the diameter at which you go 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.150
 ask your camera to open 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.700
 the diaphragm that's in your 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.260
 objective and this is the opening of this 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.400
 deacon at ghm who will determine the 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.400
 depth of field of your image 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.320
 as seen in this illustration 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.440
 it can be very open that's what 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.420
 you see left or very closed it's 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.340
 what you see on the right 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.710
 what must be remembered is that more 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.540
 you will have an open diaphragm 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.850
 the more your depth of field is going to be 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.250
 reduced to make it simpler 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.800
 we'll just talk about values 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.620
 opening which is determined with a f 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.900
 on something 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.910
 its opening values plus the figure 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.960
 is going to be big plus your depth of 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.340
 field is going to be important 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.890
 that's how you can their 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.810
 hold a big equal number of a big 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.650
 depth of field a small figure 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.510
 equal a small depth of field 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.760
 that's what we can see on this 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.870
 image the depth of field is 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.819
 important so the opening a f2 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.090
 important values ​​like 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.829
 on illustration for example f-16 and 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.230
 we realize that the first 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.780
 plan with the water is clear the median plane 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.900
 with boats and net 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.999
 the background with the mountain and net 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.129
 conversely on this other photo or 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:49.799
 the opening and 2.8 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.310
 so a small f a small depth of 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.170
 field we realize that the 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.950
 character in the foreground and 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.870
 perfectly clear 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.459
 but that the background is extremely 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.890
 fuzzy which detaches the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.600
 character in the background 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.980
 so how do you get that type of 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.540
 result as I told you it's 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.930
 playing on the opening of the diaphragm 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.720
 for that you have two possibilities 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.450
 on your scenes mode selector 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.430
 your device you put yourself either in 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.840
 p mode finally you have 3 years of 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.620
 possibilities either in p mode are in 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.770
 to be in mode 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.900
 m to experiment only the game 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.690
 on the depth of field I you 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.400
 invite you to put in mode a like 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.030
 you currently see it on this 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.100
 picture 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.700
 once in this mode you will be able 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.860
 use the wheel which is just 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.100
 or your trigger to select 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.390
 your diaphragm aperture on the fly 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.390
 according to the image you 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.890
 want to do in order to get the 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.740
 depth of field that you wish 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.270
 to realize your image 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.460
 so that you understand perfectly 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.760
 this notion I realized for you 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.400
 four photos that will allow you 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.540
 to understand a little more this notion 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.610
 with a little more finette 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.010
 since the depth of field 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.050
 actually appreciates using 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.920
 opening the diaphragm to be able to 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.260
 to control the intensity if I can say 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.090
 but this depth of field will only be 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.050
 not the same an identical setting and to 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.390
 identical frame 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.220
 if you do your focus on 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.660
 an object that is very close or on a 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.940
 object he is distant 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.980
 effect the depth of field makes 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.320
 air in front and two-thirds behind your 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.590
 object 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.700
 to be larger than the object 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.070
 on which you make your bet 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.470
 point will be distant so we will start 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.170
 with this first image where you have 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.280
 a focus that is done on the 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:49.050
 foreground with a little f so 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.250
 a very small depth of field that 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.050
 we are well aware therefore the first 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.780
 plan and net is very quickly behind 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.210
 we get in the background which is crazy 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.310
 if we compare this first image to 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.830
 this second image we make ourselves well 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.240
 account only with a depth of field 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.780
 more important since we have settled 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.020
 at f 16 we have a foreground that 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.020
 is net 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.069
 cans and even in the foreground first 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.720
 that we did not see on the first 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.659
 image which is also net which is the 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.599
 toasting the same way now 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:27.780
 we will redo the same test on a 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:30.629
 third image that you see here or in 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.009
 do we have the same openness as the whole 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.629
 first image that I showed you on 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.800
 is still at 1.7 so a very small 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:38.139
 or depths of field 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.280
 and there we made the focus on 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.650
 the tree in the middle of the field 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.990
 so we realize that before and 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.120
 after the tree is blurry and we surrender 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.830
 already well pleased that with serene 7 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.270
 we have an area of ​​sharpness that is a bit 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.500
 more important since we have the 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.539
 the entire middle tree of the 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.500
 land that is net and not just a 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:58.220
 tiny shrub 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.200
 finally on this fourth image we see 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.540
 the same as for the second image 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.250
 to know that we are with a very small 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.009
 opening so a big f is so a 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.960
 great depth of field 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.150
 and we end up with something 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.379
 which is much more important in term 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.749
 of depth of field because our 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:16.180
 focus remained on the tree of 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:18.339
 midfield as the tree is over 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.740
 remote the depth of field to 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:22.059
 identical opening to increase one's 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.529
 so with a sharp area 

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:25.899
 since that's the depth of field 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:28.760
 which is much more important 

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:30.860
 from the first to the last plane 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.390
 to convince you I propose you 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.450
 to look to the left 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.940
 the first image with an opening of 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.890
 f 16 so a great depth of field 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.720
 but an update made on 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.120
 the shrub in the foreground 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.280
 while in the picture on the right you 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.140
 have the same opening always f-16 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.000
 so theoretically the same depth of 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.980
 field and as you made your bet 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.750
 in focus on a more distant object one 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.250
 is well aware that the area of 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.780
 sharpness the depth of field is 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.569
 much more important on the image of 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.569
 right than on the left 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:04.460
 so this is for the notion of openness and 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:06.649
 depth of field I wanted 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.240
 present to you today I hope that 

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:09.709
 this video will have been sufficiently clear 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.809
 so that you can understand it 

00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:13.479
 do not hesitate to tell me about your 

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:15.559
 remarks and your comments 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:17.089
 directly so in areas of 

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:18.860
 comments from various social networks 

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:20.569
 through which you view this video 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.119
 since it is they who will allow me 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:24.619
 to be a little more specific if there is 

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:26.209
 too many inaccuracies to be a little bit 

00:07:24.619 --> 00:07:28.159
 more simplistic or a little more 

00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:29.839
 detailed in my explanations if you 

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:30.979
 think it's not enough to 

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:32.749
 that you can still better 

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:35.719
 understand the next notion that 

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:37.430
 will be addressed within the notions of 

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:41.169
 basis of the basics of photography 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.169
 see you soon for a next video 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.849
 if you liked my video you have 

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:48.009
 many ways to support my work 

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:49.139
 the first is to visit my channel 

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:51.339
 youtube and subscribe 

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:53.760
 the second is to come and put a
