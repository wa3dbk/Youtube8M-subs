00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.210
 and determine 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:09.280
 its distance with which the knife will be 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:14.070
 guaranteed to poke now we are a knife 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.070
 take a reverse grip 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.470
 blades on wire aimed at 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.869
 hand grip forward thumb 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.910
 is on top 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.180
 lower fingers lightly hold 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.180
 covering up what task 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.259
 again take away 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.579
 after landing we stretch the arm and stretch 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.790
 tasks included what and 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.380
 knife 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.380
 sharpen the telly reach out 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:58.140
 turnover and entered 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.180
 andy cooler step 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.630
 if a 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.560
 knife goes under such 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.260
 it means the distance is small and we start 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.440
 quietly four steps away from that 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.230
 we will move away if the knife starts 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.170
 going out at that angle means 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.910
 the distance is big and we start back 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.190
 return to the first stages need not 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:30.100
 try and put a lot of effort 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.100
 to get a knife and just watch 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.760
 the yacht saw 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.190
 and the knife came with me 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.770
 like that 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:46.880
 it means the distance is small I start 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.880
 I still walk away and throw back 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:56.310
 the knife is not trying again I am walking away again and 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.030
 average, this is a distance of five 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:05.010
 six steps 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:07.650
 each differently after working out 1 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.850
 year of distances this distance is two or three steps 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:16.350
 when we throw a knife with a straight grip and a knife 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:19.380
 makes no turnovers and flocks to 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.690
 target is the first distance 2 distance 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.490
 this is a five six step distance when we 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.490
 and balanced knife 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.140
 those 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.990
 you kept straight scares 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.630
 like a half turn and stick it in 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.650
 a distance of five six steps next 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.850
 test distance 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.140
 treat due to change 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.240
 the number of revolutions this distance will be 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.890
 five steps we 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.890
 knife back take a direct grip 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.340
 they are straight then she 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:04.280
 we threw at a distance 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.390
 two three steps five to six steps we have a knife 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.000
 started 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.990
 makes a turn then makes hydrogen and 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.170
 entrance 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.170
 target 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.720
 3 bets 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.010
 but 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.850
 mistakes made when throwing knives 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.270
 sharpening 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.450
 where is the most 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.860
 and shooting when throwing a knife 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.350
 whiteness starts 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.640
 to the left side in order for this not 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:59.090
 it was a lesson we hold right at chest level 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.100
 and we target her 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.740
 my paper rules 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.710
 this is the position 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.070
 if it is powered then we will make the goods 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.680
 specified and 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.910
 line up again on the leg in order to 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.920
 do not break a hand and do not dislocate a shoulder 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.920
 our task is to extinguish inertia 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:27.710
 extinguishes inertia we will at the expense of the last 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.520
 and at this moment after we 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.700
 hooked 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:37.400
 we slightly release the lower fingers and the knife 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.880
 send ahead and stretch it a little 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.490
 and then at this moment 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.230
 the knife is guaranteed to stick in if we 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.310
 went to a controlled distance such still 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.170
 I use 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.810
 cops when throwing knives sharpening it 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:59.990
 additional acceleration that we are with 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:05.650
 using the left leg, we lift the leg 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.650
 and when our foot went back
