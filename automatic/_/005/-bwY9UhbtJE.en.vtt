we're<00:00:55.619> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.769> use<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.010> single<00:00:56.610> switch<00:00:57.379> for

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
to touch two switches at once

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.770 
to touch two switches at once
one<00:01:02.250> switch<00:01:02.610> will<00:01:03.479> go<00:01:03.629> over<00:01:03.930> how<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.350> that

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
one switch will go over how to do that

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.539 
one switch will go over how to do that
connected<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.140> Tecla<00:01:07.770> shield<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.159> also<00:01:08.520> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
connected to this Tecla shield is also a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.700 
connected to this Tecla shield is also a
joystick<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.110> mounted<00:01:10.259> to<00:01:10.560> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
joystick that can be mounted to a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.370 
joystick that can be mounted to a
wheelchair<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.549> use<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.780> cycle<00:01:13.350> through

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
wheelchair and use to cycle through

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.120 
wheelchair and use to cycle through
different<00:01:13.790> applications<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:14.970> well<00:01:15.590> so<00:01:16.590> that's

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
different applications as well so that's

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.440 
different applications as well so that's
how<00:01:17.250> we're<00:01:17.370> going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.550> get<00:01:17.670> started<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:19.310> have

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
how we're going to get started I have

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.300 
how we're going to get started I have
the<00:01:21.450> device<00:01:21.630> itself<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.560> Tecla<00:01:22.770> shield<00:01:22.920> does

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the device itself the Tecla shield does

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.280 
the device itself the Tecla shield does
need<00:01:23.550> to<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.760> powered<00:01:24.120> through<00:01:24.330> USB<00:01:24.870> cable

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
need to be powered through USB cable

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.840 
need to be powered through USB cable
that's<00:01:25.890> why<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.250> hooked<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.550> to<00:01:26.700> my<00:01:26.820> computer

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that's why it's hooked up to my computer

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.790 
that's why it's hooked up to my computer
and<00:01:27.630> our<00:01:28.230> switch<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.980> hooked<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:30.710> one<00:01:31.710> of

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
and our switch is hooked in to one of

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.030 
and our switch is hooked in to one of
our<00:01:31.920> ports<00:01:32.280> there<00:01:32.550> now<00:01:33.210> there<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:34.380> secondary

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
our ports there now there is a secondary

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.610 
our ports there now there is a secondary
port<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.670> two<00:01:35.820> switches<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.480> I<00:01:36.600> said<00:01:36.930> but

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
port for two switches like I said but

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.399 
port for two switches like I said but
right<00:01:37.860> now<00:01:38.040> we're<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.400> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.700> use<00:01:38.880> one

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
right now we're just going to use one

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.770 
right now we're just going to use one
alrighty<00:01:40.880> um<00:01:42.140> so<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.159> cap<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.850> single<00:01:45.540> tap

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
alrighty um so if I cap a single tap

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.120 
alrighty um so if I cap a single tap
here<00:01:46.490> iTunes<00:01:47.659> is<00:01:48.659> actually<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.770> spin

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
here iTunes is actually going to spin

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.840 
here iTunes is actually going to spin
another<00:01:50.750> music<00:01:51.860> it's<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.159> scanned<00:01:53.490> through

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
another music it's just scanned through

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.520 
another music it's just scanned through
everything<00:01:55.010> as<00:01:56.010> I<00:01:56.250> touch<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.840> if<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.260> hold

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
everything as I touch it and if you hold

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.140 
everything as I touch it and if you hold
it<00:02:01.650> for<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.950> certain<00:02:02.100> amount<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.490> seconds

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
it for a certain amount of seconds

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.340 
it for a certain amount of seconds
that's<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.690> be<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.049> different

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
that's going to be of a different

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.830 
that's going to be of a different
command<00:02:04.650> so<00:02:05.460> holding<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.030> one<00:02:06.210> second<00:02:06.720> is

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
command so holding it for one second is

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.869 
command so holding it for one second is
going<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.650> allow<00:02:07.860> me<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.129> select<00:02:08.340> something

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
going to allow me to select something

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.630 
going to allow me to select something
and<00:02:09.209> two<00:02:09.929> seconds<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.679> allowed<00:02:11.400> me<00:02:11.580> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and two seconds is it allowed me to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.149 
and two seconds is it allowed me to
toggle<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.269> keyboard<00:02:12.480> on<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.709> can<00:02:13.890> scan

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
toggle the keyboard on and you can scan

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.680 
toggle the keyboard on and you can scan
through<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.489> keyboard<00:02:14.700> just<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:15.360> we<00:02:15.540> did

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
through the keyboard just like we did

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.750 
through the keyboard just like we did
with<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.900> applications<00:02:16.590> by<00:02:16.769> tapping<00:02:17.129> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
with the applications by tapping the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.890 
with the applications by tapping the
