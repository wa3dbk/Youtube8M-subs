00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.790
 around 40 students come 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.380
 practically of almost all Spain on 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.540
 everything also from the marina baixa and 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.279
 also from the nuria because they will have the 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:33.160
 opportunity to receive new pedagogies 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:37.200
 to recycle and naturally to expand 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.260
 your knowledge as well as acquire 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.380
 a base and a large formation 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.070
 important dancers as is the work 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:50.610
 mulberry or ricardo cervera to be three 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.840
 levels the upper middle elementary and 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.780
 students will be between 9 and 20 years old if 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.380
 We've been doing it for 6 years 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.960
 these short courses and I think all 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.360
 we are already Ricardo and I went to 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.180
 england to learn 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.460
 the technique a bit and what we want 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.620
 do is give a little bit of what 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.270
 we learned there now I am principal 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.630
 of the royal ballet and riccardo the first 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.100
 soloist and I think we're trying 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.720
 create artists besides simply 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.930
 concentrate on the technique I think what 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.210
 what we have done is try to make people 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.150
 Maybe I can do courses in 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.640
 london and many of the girls some 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.350
 the ones you're watching here dancing have 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.020
 got to go to london and in fact it 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.660
 they go after this course to do 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.440
 another workshop there so it's opening a 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.080
 little doors for young people and for 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.430
 that they also learn internationally 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.649
 in our intention always from the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.690
 principle was to bring a little london 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.790
 here in Spain because we left 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.170
 very young and we have done our 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.570
 career and in london and we have learned 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.869
 a lot and we have concentrated 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.910
 much in addition to the technique because in the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.860
 style in acting in the dynamics 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.390
 then we want to teach young people 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.430
 Dancers 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.459
 so that they learn not only about technique 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.100
 but also a little bit of style and about 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.840
 all of the style and dynamics that we have 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.840
 learned ourselves there are in london
