00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.800
 love 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.800
 [AFFETTO] A strong deep feeling of affection for, especially towards a member of your family or towards a friend: [ROMANTIC] A strong feeling of affection for, he is sexually attracted to: 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.450
 Less 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.420
 used with countable nouns a means 'a smaller amount of': People often use less with countable nouns: This is not considered correct by some people, and less, instead, must be used: 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.000
 LOVELESS xxx (Less love xxx) 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:36.450
 If you said "goodbye" faster than me, then it could be ... 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:46.100
 even if it is a lacerating pain that of lies, I could pretend not to hear anything 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.350
 is the amount of my strong feelings the only thing that hurts? 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.050
 the tears that fall from your cheeks tear my heart 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.700
 how easy it is to stand next to me and then say cold words 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.090
 and maybe you start hating me, but even if you do, everything will be fine 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.350
 My little dreams and desires, I will keep them hidden in my heart 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.620
 I have no more to tell you 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.500
 I will protect you until the end of the world 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.030
 surely you will be happy 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.600
 all you've got is all I've lost 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.400
 they sink deep and vanish with a flicker 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.070
 The echoes resound softly in my chest 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.590
 if I had killed them, would the echo have calmed down? 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.150
 But even if my love is something they don't allow 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.580
 then the meaning of my existence here would be meaningless, I said at night 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.010
 so I will not see again, and I will be able to give you my eyes 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.600
 incomplete thoughts are when it comes to vanish 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.770
 It seemed that my heart was torn to pieces when I could hug you 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.030
 forever, forever is a good thing if time stands still 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.110
 the hour he made that day, the punishment for me for not having been able to protect you 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.890
 I tried to suppress my voice which then faded 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.060
 the sky crumbles 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.340
 My little dreams and desires, I will keep them secret in my heart 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.020
 I have nothing else to say to you 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.000
 I want to protect you, until the end of the world 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.260
 surely you will be happy, even a moment 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.700
 On the road I walked with you 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.480
 in a world without betrayals 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.200
 one day I will surely be allowed to be born again
