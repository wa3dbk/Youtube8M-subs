00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
time and a very nice win to start off

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.510 
time and a very nice win to start off
the<00:02:03.420> tournament<00:02:04.259> rather<00:02:04.439> high<00:02:04.680> scoring<00:02:05.070> 18

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520

goals<00:02:06.000> there<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.680> as<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:07.950> see<00:02:07.979> I

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
goals there and as you can see I

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.010 
goals there and as you can see I
probably<00:02:08.399> did<00:02:08.700> deserve<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.149> win<00:02:09.270> few<00:02:09.869> more

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
probably did deserve the win few more

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.809 
probably did deserve the win few more
shots<00:02:10.259> few<00:02:10.619> more<00:02:10.770> on<00:02:10.890> target<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.580> just

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
shots few more on target and just

generally tiny

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.440 
generally tiny
bit<00:02:13.650> better<00:02:13.860> but<00:02:14.220> we<00:02:14.700> went<00:02:14.819> into<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.209> next

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
bit better but we went into the next

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.920 
bit better but we went into the next
game<00:02:15.630> now<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.530> now<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.860> round<00:02:17.489> of<00:02:17.760> 16<00:02:18.750> I

the<00:03:07.799> bull<00:03:07.980> definitely<00:03:08.670> went<00:03:08.910> out<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.239> play<00:03:09.450> so

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
the bull definitely went out of play so

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.690 
the bull definitely went out of play so
I'm<00:03:10.110> not<00:03:10.290> exactly<00:03:10.560> sure<00:03:10.709> what<00:03:11.099> happens<00:03:11.489> it

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.770 
I'm not exactly sure what happens it
definitely<00:03:12.120> should<00:03:12.180> have<00:03:12.269> gone<00:03:12.420> out<00:03:12.540> for<00:03:12.690> a

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
definitely should have gone out for a

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.390 
definitely should have gone out for a
goal-kick<00:03:12.989> or<00:03:13.349> corner<00:03:13.739> or<00:03:13.830> whatever<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:14.250> was

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
made a free nail at halftime and I

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.270 
made a free nail at halftime and I
definitely<00:03:19.230> was<00:03:19.590> not<00:03:19.620> going<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.950> be<00:03:20.070> done

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280

Benzema managed to earn myself a penalty
which<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.630> believe<00:03:24.989> i<00:03:25.260> chose<00:03:25.590> Remy<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.310> take<00:03:26.549> Oh

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
which I believe i chose Remy to take Oh

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.970 
which I believe i chose Remy to take Oh
No<00:03:26.850> Benzema<00:03:27.480> took<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.019> he<00:03:28.350> chipped<00:03:28.890> it

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
No Benzema took it and he chipped it

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.949 
No Benzema took it and he chipped it
down<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.250> middle<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.519> scored<00:03:30.209> easily<00:03:30.450> that

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
down the middle and scored easily that

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.860

was<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.200> make<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.620> for<00:03:32.609> nila<00:03:33.030> but<00:03:33.209> yet<00:03:33.390> for<00:03:33.690> nill

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
was to make it for nila but yet for nill

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.229 
was to make it for nila but yet for nill
in<00:03:34.049> 50<00:03:34.709> minutes<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.340> was<00:03:35.609> dominating<00:03:36.150> at

chipped<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.989> across<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.380> Ben's<00:03:40.530> my<00:03:40.739> think<00:03:40.950> that

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
chipped it across to Ben's my think that

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.770 
chipped it across to Ben's my think that
was<00:03:41.130> actually<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.400> chip<00:03:41.670> shot<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:42.150> missed<00:03:42.510> and

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
was actually a chip shot that missed and

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.500 
was actually a chip shot that missed and
Bentham<00:03:43.440> up<00:03:43.560> managed<00:03:43.859> to<00:03:44.040> make<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.250> five<00:03:44.910> nil

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
Bentham up managed to make it five nil

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.379 
Bentham up managed to make it five nil
and<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:46.019> very<00:03:46.230> easy<00:03:46.620> win<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.850> he<00:03:48.030> did<00:03:48.209> get<00:03:48.329> a

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
and a very easy win that he did get a

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.580 
and a very easy win that he did get a
pleasant<00:03:48.840> off<00:03:48.930> when<00:03:49.109> giving<00:03:49.319> away<00:03:49.500> the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
pleasant off when giving away the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.259 
pleasant off when giving away the
penalty<00:03:49.889> but<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.069> didn't<00:03:50.310> capitalize<00:03:50.670> too<00:03:51.060> much

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
penalty but I didn't capitalize too much

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.080 
penalty but I didn't capitalize too much
after<00:03:51.900> that<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:52.950> went<00:03:53.310> straight<00:03:53.489> into<00:03:53.970> the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
after that so I went straight into the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.789 
after that so I went straight into the
next<00:03:54.389> game<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:54.750> we<00:03:54.870> came<00:03:55.049> up<00:03:55.079> against<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.560> guy

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
next game and we came up against a guy

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.819 
next game and we came up against a guy
called<00:03:57.060> every<00:03:57.600> so<00:03:57.780> I'm<00:03:57.870> guessing<00:03:58.200> he<00:03:58.620> is

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
called every so I'm guessing he is

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.819 
called every so I'm guessing he is
a<00:03:59.239> Liverpool<00:04:00.239> fan<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.900> Liverpool<00:04:01.650> badger

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
a Liverpool fan the Liverpool badger

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.410 
a Liverpool fan the Liverpool badger
also<00:04:02.220> makes<00:04:02.400> me<00:04:02.549> think<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.120> this<00:04:03.209> guy

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
also makes me think this and this guy

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.240 
also makes me think this and this guy
had<00:04:03.630> quite<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:03.989> low<00:04:04.290> amount<00:04:04.500> of<00:04:04.680> chemistry<00:04:05.160> as

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
had quite a low amount of chemistry as

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.729 
had quite a low amount of chemistry as
well<00:04:05.579> he<00:04:05.850> had<00:04:05.970> quite<00:04:06.389> a<00:04:06.930> bit<00:04:07.109> of<00:04:07.139> Brazilian

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
well he had quite a bit of Brazilian

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.680 
well he had quite a bit of Brazilian
links<00:04:08.040> along<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.459> right<00:04:08.670> but<00:04:08.940> almost<00:04:09.359> every

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
links along the right but almost every

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.120 
links along the right but almost every
player<00:04:09.900> was<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.079> half<00:04:10.230> position<00:04:10.500> or<00:04:10.980> our

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
player was a half position or our

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.610 
player was a half position or our
formation<00:04:11.850> so<00:04:12.480> it<00:04:12.660> did<00:04:12.870> give<00:04:13.170> us<00:04:13.290> another

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
formation so it did give us another

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.199 
formation so it did give us another
great<00:04:13.889> chance<00:04:14.160> another<00:04:14.430> guy<00:04:14.670> on<00:04:14.700> low

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
great chance another guy on low

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.060 
great chance another guy on low
chemistry<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.350> was<00:04:16.470> expecting<00:04:16.829> to

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
chemistry and I was expecting to

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.310 
chemistry and I was expecting to
absolutely<00:04:17.789> annihilate<00:04:18.120> once<00:04:18.750> more<00:04:19.049> I<00:04:19.079> got

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320
