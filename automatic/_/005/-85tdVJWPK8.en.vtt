00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.820
 So, welcome to another one. 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.350
 video in which a video and good in video 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.109
 Today I wanted to talk about the cuts that 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.810
 Comes to come, our life is not mine. 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.720
 not focusing on advanced faith but rather on 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.489
 Code of 2015 and 2016 and 2017 that you 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.110
 know that fifa runs are the only games 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.880
 Then I think they will last for 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.790
 eternity is to see until when there is 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.680
 videogame are launching these games but 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.910
 Anyway, I got a comment one time 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.480
 behind a letter from me saying that the 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.570
 acura né 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.890
 let's say so the code would be to have 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.500
 participation in the healing of the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.960
 would be to participate in the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.300
 community that plays the game for him 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.190
 improve and I found it simply brilliant 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.329
 nor bid it was a thread of 4 was 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.260
 developed and was a success. 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.549
 total 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.100
 so in this video here I wanted 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.439
 discuss it with you about it 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.380
 Just imagine if the next cuts here 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.509
 in the future they could count on 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.250
 galley playing the competitive galley 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.830
 What are you playing at school? 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.950
 sample of each genre let's say so 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.450
 who plays the game to approve or not 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.369
 Things know the game would be much more 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.650
 balanced much more pleasant for 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.420
 we all play, I think 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.610
 missing this is not missing a little more 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.799
 this interaction of the companies that 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.689
 develops with their own 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.390
 players in the people who play 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.600
 I do not know if they already have 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.549
 in practice the optical honey e.g. 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.770
 quixote and has a very close proximity 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.960
 with the developers of the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.270
 code should be a problem and such 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.030
 turn and move he's there with you 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.920
 with the guys for sure I think he 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.380
 It has contact rather competitive prices and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.310
 involves more money for them and for 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.680
 the companies 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.360
 I think they may even have a peep. 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.520
 another opinion but I believe 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.479
 they do not get to say so do not 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.759
 it's bad here 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.590
 Let's try to do it another way. 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.410
 I do not say yes there is 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.840
 it's us who watch videos that we play 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.879
 the game working for the cases know 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.739
 but so they catch a show the day 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:25.080
 the day of the most famous people in the 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:27.000
 youtube and go there for the studio and help 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.769
 to develop the game know how to put the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.440
 things more balanced things have 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.299
 more pleasing to the public that plays 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.560
 with the general wardrobe I think it would be 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.209
 very good 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.099
 they did it is not like I said in the 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.810
 beginning of the video already gives and did not 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.730
 were children of 4 and for me it was a 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.890
 total success fell no I did not get to 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.900
 play a lot of noise from three but I think 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.060
 I thought it was an exceptional game, so you know. 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.430
 for the first impressions I had of the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.170
 Game to tell you the truth, I really liked it. 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.420
 a lot and I even bought her and I do not know 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.549
 and such I had prize numbers 3 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.299
 I really liked to play, I had 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:03.420
 very light one number 3 and number 4 wire 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.459
 I do not see it that way, you know, it 's okay. 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.920
 be that you have changed some 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.720
 server and also number 23 also 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.519
 It was server but can also be that 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.530
 have at least three at the end and for 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.850
 that I did not play such a condition 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.889
 good like this 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.420
 but then what do you think that they 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.420
 They think it would be cool but only that 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.359
 lack vision going there for the infinity ward 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.370
 You can prove it or you can not get here. 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.040
 for subscribers can sometimes speak 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.230
 mano in the game're so have to roast 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.599
 improve this and if this guy would be too 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.819
 Fuck, I believe, it's not a joke. 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.430
 of the folder I the obvious that not but the 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.919
 Fucking guys like for example the 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.560
 cars do and opash these guys who 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:47.069
 are most famous of sniper to honey of 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.980
 xote and the evil geniuses that is the clan and 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.919
 current champion of the hot chip né 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.230
 then, in our optics, then 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.150
 lots of people so it would be fucked up 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.540
 participate has a le also makes videos 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.220
 commented every day was him and I think 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.530
 who is one of the guys who are most 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.480
 world fashion rocks 4 million and 400,000 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.069
 enrolled already then california o 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.989
 companion for a long time you do not know these 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.310
 guys so you have more experience with 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.200
 codes that would be really cool they 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.970
 the right to participate developments 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.950
 of the other games to come 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.539
 Do not comment on what you think of it. 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.430
 do you think would be a cool idea if 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.950
 Do you think it would suck not? 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.210
 that almost has to end that can have 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.190
 to die at once because 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.990
 we are in this dilemma and it's been a while 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.150
 marked the cuts that are coming 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.539
 have been very good has not been much 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.889
 to our liking but that's it then 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.229
