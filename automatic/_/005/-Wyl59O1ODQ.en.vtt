00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
them I believe that's exactly what it's

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.929 
them I believe that's exactly what it's
gonna<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.110> 9500<00:01:37.979> ix<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.670> -

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
gonna do just like you 9500 ix on -

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.590 
gonna do just like you 9500 ix on -
radar<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.659> very<00:01:40.790> simply<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> each

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
radar this is very simply so it each

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.450 
radar this is very simply so it each
time<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.930> go<00:01:43.049> down<00:01:43.079> down<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.009> road<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
time you go down down the road and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.770 
time you go down down the road and
you're<00:01:44.520> passing<00:01:44.909> by<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.180> grocery<00:01:45.509> store

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
you're passing by that grocery store

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.270 
you're passing by that grocery store
where<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:46.110> old<00:01:46.320> radar<00:01:46.710> detector<00:01:46.979> would<00:01:47.070> go

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
where your old radar detector would go

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.460 
where your old radar detector would go
off<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:48.090> one<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> second<00:01:48.780> or<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.930> third<00:01:48.960> time<00:01:49.140> it

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
off this one a second or a third time it

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.499 
off this one a second or a third time it
automatically<00:01:49.950> learns<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.030> puts<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.390> in

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
automatically learns it and puts it in

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.480 
automatically learns it and puts it in
its<00:01:51.600> database<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> false<00:01:52.590> alarm<00:01:52.860> that's

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
its database as a false alarm that's

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.980 
its database as a false alarm that's
pretty<00:01:53.729> key<00:01:53.939> cuz<00:01:54.210> next<00:01:54.479> time<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.840> cop

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
pretty key cuz next time if a cop

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.330 
pretty key cuz next time if a cop
sitting<00:01:55.350> there<00:01:55.500> you'll<00:01:55.649> really<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.310> that

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
sitting there you'll really know that

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.130 
sitting there you'll really know that
it's<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.700> cop<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.090> not<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> false<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.630> that's<00:01:58.020> it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
it's a cop and not a false or that's it

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.389 
it's a cop and not a false or that's it
that's<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.409> wonderful<00:01:58.799> feature<00:01:59.100> that's

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
that's a wonderful feature that's

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.690 
that's a wonderful feature that's
exactly<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.509> what<00:02:01.409> kind<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.860> sensors<00:02:02.340> are<00:02:02.520> in

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
exactly so what kind of sensors are in

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.609 
exactly so what kind of sensors are in
the<00:02:02.880> car<00:02:03.090> like<00:02:03.240> what<00:02:03.450> goes<00:02:03.630> into<00:02:03.899> my<00:02:04.140> car

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the car like what goes into my car

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.109 
the car like what goes into my car
check<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.950> out<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.189> got<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.460> front<00:02:05.850> laser

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
check it out you got to front laser

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.459 
check it out you got to front laser
jammers<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:06.780> there's<00:02:06.960> two<00:02:07.110> separate

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
jammers so there's two separate

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.770 
jammers so there's two separate
diffusers<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.160> front<00:02:08.429> separate<00:02:09.390> diffuser

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
diffusers in the front separate diffuser

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.570 
diffusers in the front separate diffuser
in<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> rear<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.890> mounts<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.400> rear

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
in the rear the mounts on the rear

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.480 
in the rear the mounts on the rear
license<00:02:11.940> plate<00:02:12.000> usually

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
license plate usually

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.010 
license plate usually
and<00:02:13.670> that'll<00:02:14.060> be<00:02:14.180> your<00:02:14.210> front<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:14.930> rear

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
and that'll be your front and rear

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.420 
and that'll be your front and rear
jamming<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:15.800> even<00:02:16.040> if<00:02:16.100> you're<00:02:16.220> getting<00:02:16.310> shot

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
jamming so even if you're getting shot

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.220 
jamming so even if you're getting shot
from<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.880> rear<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:17.270> still<00:02:17.510> gonna<00:02:17.690> jam<00:02:18.020> that

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
from the rear it's still gonna jam that

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.160 
from the rear it's still gonna jam that
up<00:02:18.410> great<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.610> there's<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.150> radar<00:02:20.540> sensor<00:02:20.930> also

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
up great and there's a radar sensor also

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.300 
up great and there's a radar sensor also
there's<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:22.000> 360<00:02:23.140> 360-degree<00:02:24.140> radar<00:02:24.560> receiver

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
there's a 360 360-degree radar receiver

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.650 
there's a 360 360-degree radar receiver
that<00:02:25.490> goes<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.880> there<00:02:26.030> as<00:02:26.150> well<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.510> that

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
that goes in there as well and that

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.900 
that goes in there as well and that
usually<00:02:26.840> well<00:02:27.530> we<00:02:27.650> usually<00:02:27.950> manage<00:02:28.280> under<00:02:28.700> the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
usually well we usually manage under the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.490 
usually well we usually manage under the
bumper<00:02:29.090> somewhere<00:02:29.570> or<00:02:29.720> inside<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.200> grill

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
bumper somewhere or inside the grill

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.630 
bumper somewhere or inside the grill
somewhere<00:02:30.920> right

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
somewhere right

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.790 
somewhere right
and<00:02:31.850> that<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.300> picks<00:02:32.540> up<00:02:32.630> 306<00:02:33.320> degrees<00:02:33.620> if

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
and that that picks up 306 degrees if

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.170 
and that that picks up 306 degrees if
you're<00:02:33.950> getting<00:02:34.190> shot<00:02:34.220> from<00:02:34.550> radar<00:02:34.940> from<00:02:35.060> the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
you're getting shot from radar from the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.970 
you're getting shot from radar from the
side<00:02:35.420> from<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.840> back<00:02:36.110> from<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.410> front<00:02:36.500> it'll

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
side from the back from the front it'll

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.530 
side from the back from the front it'll
pick<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.340> up<00:02:37.400> great<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.120> as<00:02:38.300> far<00:02:38.480> as

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
pick that up great and as far as

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.090 
pick that up great and as far as
displays<00:02:38.960> inside<00:02:39.380> they're<00:02:39.620> pretty<00:02:39.800> small<00:02:40.070> I

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
displays inside they're pretty small I

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.400 
displays inside they're pretty small I
believe<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:41.090> display<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:41.630> very<00:02:41.840> discreet<00:02:42.290> and

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
believe the display is very discreet and

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.140 
believe the display is very discreet and
there's<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.040> separate<00:02:43.370> controller<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:44.000> goes

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
there's a separate controller that goes

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.610 
there's a separate controller that goes
along<00:02:44.300> with<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.780> that's<00:02:44.870> also<00:02:45.110> really<00:02:45.470> sweet
