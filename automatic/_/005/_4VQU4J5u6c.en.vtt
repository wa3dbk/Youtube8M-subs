doesn't<00:01:51.619> suffer<00:01:52.100> I<00:01:52.280> think<00:01:52.760> the<00:01:52.880> UMP<00:01:53.300> succeeds

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.170 
doesn't suffer I think the UMP succeeds
here<00:01:54.020> just<00:01:54.830> like<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.070> grease<00:01:55.280> gun<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.700> UMP

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
here just like the grease gun the UMP

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.630 
here just like the grease gun the UMP
was<00:01:56.360> meant<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.630> be<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.840> more<00:01:57.050> cost<00:01:57.410> effective

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
was meant to be a more cost effective

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.520

and<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.630> UMP<00:02:03.110> was<00:02:03.140> designed<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.190> replace<00:02:04.490> the

mp5<00:02:06.430> now<00:02:07.430> one<00:02:07.610> of<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.759> things<00:02:07.940> I<00:02:08.030> want<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.270> talk

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
mp5 now one of the things I want to talk

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.630 
mp5 now one of the things I want to talk
about<00:02:08.660> today<00:02:08.929> is<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.770> similarities<00:02:10.610> between

about today is the similarities between
the<00:02:11.240> UMP<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.250> since<00:02:13.250> you've<00:02:13.430> got<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:13.760> here<00:02:13.880> the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
the UMP and since you've got it here the

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.430 
the UMP and since you've got it here the
grease<00:02:14.300> gun<00:02:14.330> oh<00:02:14.810> yeah

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
grease gun oh yeah

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.770 
grease gun oh yeah
even<00:02:15.739> though<00:02:15.830> they<00:02:15.980> really<00:02:16.010> came<00:02:16.550> from<00:02:17.510> two

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
even though they really came from two

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.630 
even though they really came from two
needs<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.290> necessities<00:02:18.380> that<00:02:18.890> both<00:02:19.220> really

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
needs and necessities that both really

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.580 
needs and necessities that both really
this<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:20.300> without<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.630> doubt<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.320> agree

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
this is without a doubt you and I agree

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.160 
this is without a doubt you and I agree
the<00:02:22.430> modern-day<00:02:22.970> version<00:02:23.150> of<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.810> grease<00:02:24.140> gun

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
the modern-day version of the grease gun

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.830 
the modern-day version of the grease gun
itself<00:02:24.680> absolutely<00:02:25.150> but<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.330> parallel<00:02:26.660> of

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
itself absolutely but the parallel of

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.860 
itself absolutely but the parallel of
application<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:28.550> similar<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.180> it's

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
application is so similar it's it's

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.990 
application is so similar it's it's
pretty<00:02:30.110> impressive<00:02:30.320> with<00:02:30.760> obviously<00:02:31.760> a

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
pretty impressive with obviously a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.240 
pretty impressive with obviously a
probably<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.450> far<00:02:32.750> superior<00:02:32.989> gun<00:02:33.470> right<00:02:33.769> but<00:02:34.160> my

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
probably a far superior gun right but my

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.449 
probably a far superior gun right but my
rolls<00:02:34.610> they<00:02:34.940> feel<00:02:35.300> or<00:02:35.860> pretty<00:02:36.860> much<00:02:37.070> very

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
rolls they feel or pretty much very

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.550 
rolls they feel or pretty much very
similar<00:02:37.519> very<00:02:38.030> similar<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.510> then<00:02:38.870> very

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
similar very similar and then very

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.530 
similar very similar and then very
simple<00:02:39.950> gun<00:02:40.100> easy<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.489> manufacture<00:02:40.730> much<00:02:41.300> like

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
simple gun easy to manufacture much like

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.870 
simple gun easy to manufacture much like
that<00:02:41.780> one<00:02:41.989> exactly<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.310> course<00:02:43.519> also

both<00:03:21.350> done<00:03:21.500> you<00:03:21.650> can<00:03:21.830> do<00:03:22.069> that<00:03:22.340> with<00:03:22.760> the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
both done you can do that with the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.670 
both done you can do that with the
grease<00:03:23.390> gun<00:03:23.420> but<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.020> have<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.410> get<00:03:24.530> off<00:03:24.650> that

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
grease gun but you have to get off that

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.530 
grease gun but you have to get off that
dray<00:03:25.069> exactly<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:25.760> got<00:03:25.910> it's<00:03:26.090> all<00:03:26.240> trigger

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
dray exactly you got it's all trigger

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.240 
dray exactly you got it's all trigger
controls<00:03:26.990> all<00:03:27.140> trigger<00:03:27.380> control<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.010> we

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
controls all trigger control and we

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.920 
controls all trigger control and we
could<00:03:28.430> certainly<00:03:28.700> argue<00:03:28.910> you<00:03:29.660> know<00:03:29.750> one<00:03:29.900> of

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
could certainly argue you know one of

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.210 
could certainly argue you know one of
the<00:03:30.050> troubles<00:03:30.410> with<00:03:30.500> a<00:03:30.560> grease<00:03:30.770> gun<00:03:30.800> is

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
the troubles with a grease gun is

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.400 
the troubles with a grease gun is
basically<00:03:31.880> to<00:03:32.120> load<00:03:32.300> it<00:03:32.510> specially

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
basically to load it specially

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.840 
basically to load it specially
originally<00:03:33.800> in<00:03:33.890> three<00:03:34.160> you<00:03:34.310> get<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.430> cocking

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
originally in three you get a cocking

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.720 
originally in three you get a cocking
lever<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.390> cock<00:03:35.660> but<00:03:36.470> at<00:03:36.800> this<00:03:37.040> point<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.580> make

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
lever you cock but at this point to make

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.220 
lever you cock but at this point to make
it<00:03:37.880> safe<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.300> only<00:03:38.330> way<00:03:38.600> you<00:03:38.660> could<00:03:38.870> really<00:03:38.930> do

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
it safe the only way you could really do

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.620 
it safe the only way you could really do
it<00:03:39.380> was<00:03:39.800> retract<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.370> bolt<00:03:40.490> slightly<00:03:41.090> close

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
it was retract the bolt slightly close

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.540 
it was retract the bolt slightly close
the<00:03:41.870> dust<00:03:42.110> cover<00:03:42.380> which<00:03:42.709> lock<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.160> bolt<00:03:43.280> and

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
the dust cover which lock the bolt and

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.520 
the dust cover which lock the bolt and
that<00:03:43.640> was<00:03:43.790> your<00:03:43.940> safety<00:03:44.150> right<00:03:44.570> that<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.290> you
