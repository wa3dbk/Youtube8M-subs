00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 you want to zac so today for the 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.279
 13th episode of the scoring series 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.810
 to say so this is not seen the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.639
 previous episode we had left 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.380
 so on buying two new 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.049
 players a central defender who evolves 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.210
 to hull city neighborhood is aiming as well as in 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.130
 our player at hull is the defender 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.680
 right there is mauzÃ© niort for this first 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.330
 match in top face a weird team a 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.760
 series is therefore a defense 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.289
 I would not have chosen me personally 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.910
 and one still a beautiful little 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.340
 attack with two iguanas inform the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.830
 mario balotelli my opponent will see 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.450
 the first chance of the match and he's going 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.469
 even marked on this first occasion to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.719
 the 9th minute of play 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.660
 it must be said I am well helped by 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.090
 this bad raise is starting very 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.940
 very badly the match but we still go 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.090
 try to come back to the 2nd minute of play 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.110
 it's doing who will have the first 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.670
 opportunity on our part but 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.780
 unfortunately the coiled shot that goes 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.190
 completely beside 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.710
 my opponent will even have the second 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.539
 goal in the 22nd minute of play so in a 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.219
 first time his June will shoot the 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.060
 post and then 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.850
 so he'll manage to see her right after 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.060
 so at the 22nd but just before mid 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.920
 time 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.659
 we will see a confused action with this 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.270
 strikes first then 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.960
 have a second shot the ball goes 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.600
 get back to me 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.630
 and there I do not know why the referee 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.119
 whistle penalty anyway so much better 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.549
 for us luckily she goes to the bottom 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.380
 so we go back to 2 1 at the half time a 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.119
 not very lucky to say this penalty 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.189
 but hey, we're not going to shoot next 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.650
 be useless anyway plays 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.060
 not against pals we play against the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.850
 purpose of scoring goals then we are 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.619
 already in the second half my opponent 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.409
 is going to have a huge huge opportunity there 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.630
 a post and then a second chance that my 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.350
 goalkeeper will get to stop but just 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.840
 after the 58th minute of play it hurts 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.420
 the third goal of mona must tightens 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.850
 to arrive then at this moment of the match 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.770
 I was a little disgusted but when 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.640
 even we will try to react for 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.520
 retain invincibility and at the 67th 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.960
 minute of play through a fake b one goes 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.260
 return 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.020
 almost to the score at 3-2 I say to myself there 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.060
 is pretty good we can try 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.330
 to get the point of the tie 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.920
 so is keeping the invincibility that 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.200
 date anyway from several matches and 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.840
 that's what will happen of course you in 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.740
 doubt I think of the 81st minute of play 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.420
 we come back to three goals everywhere 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.210
 so the first goal of denying rez at 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.280
 passage for his first match 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.990
 draw 3 3 which is clearly deserved 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.820
 from both teams 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.890
 when we look at the detail of the match I 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.960
 think the draw 3 3 is when 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.830
 even rather good matches we do not hurt 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.330
 of goals is still not bad 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.280
 important then for this second match 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.010
 will fall in front of a nice little team 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.310
 of liga bbva with particular case 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.400
 benzema attack we go pretty well 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.260
 started this game in the 24th minute of play 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.080
 so these tuna boats on his left side 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.030
 who will have the first opportunity but 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.010
 the goalkeeper is going to do it and decisive he's me 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.530
 seems like it was even casillas do 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.810
 a double decisive stop quite disgusted 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.550
 still on this first occasion 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.700
 because my opponent alain 30th minute of 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.610
 game will score a superb goal a 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.580
 beautiful goal outside of the foot to 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.560
 almost 30 meters from karim 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.180
 benzema 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.950
 so here we will leave lenses when 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.070
 even because it is rare that the guys 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.110
 opposite but back so nice goal and there 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.120
 it's pretty so I thought we're going to 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.280
 so let's usually it's me 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.570
 which leaves but slows down anyway 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.400
 will try to come back to the score 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.720
 then in the second half but lacks 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.480
 of luck the galbert strikes and 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.170
 obertan will arrive on the bar 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.300
 transversal 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.820
 then then new opportunity of the 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.410
 part of Iran do it so on this very 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.090
 good seems dafoe but unfortunately the 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.959
 goaltender is going to make a new 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.269
 nice stop but justin would do so on 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.430
 this opportunity therefore of fo b so the 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.580
 goaltender do lob on corner go 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.400
 equalize so thanks to lloris yesterday who at 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.019
 passage as of the foot and the head there 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.640
 is tremendous that day I you 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.739
 advise everyone for those who want 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.560
 to make babies her not very very 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.430
 expensive 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.410
 so we come back then obertan will do 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.190
 a little straight all right and 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.500
 the little center head for info b le 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.940
 classic I want to say this is the 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.930
 easier to score goals so 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.200
 we will not complain 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.400
 I think the camera would have done 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.810
 no you're not going to tell me yet of a 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.660
 comment that I do center head 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.680
 won this match 2 to 1 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.660
 so the match anyway she is a 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.280
 little bit deserved of us if we 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.490
 look at the detail of the match 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.510
 almost 500 credits which is still 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:52.889
 that and so we're still not really 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:55.590
 badly in this this division so we 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.030
 so is at 17 points we miss two 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.520
 points to have the title 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.100
 so we're going to follow up on this 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.169
 third and last match so who goes 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.060
 we just need a victory 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.310
 to have the title we will fall face 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.440
 a team of liga bbva and it's me a 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.660
 opponent who is going to have the first 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.060
 opportunity of the match so in the 28th minute 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.390
 on this beautiful little diego strike 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.650
 costa he will open the score so at 1 0 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.740
 for our opponents so this match it goes 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.500
 there are only goals and not 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:29.460
 actions that there are only buses 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.280
 simply already 2 to 0 in the 32nd minute of 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.280
 game so it's modric that will double the 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.050
 put for my opponent 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.690
 then small reaction 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:43.050
 so we're just before half-time so 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.419
 ben &amp; jerry mina who will launch so in 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.160
 litas depth that will address a good 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.620
 small center for tuna heads 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.050
 so we come back just before half-time 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.510
 at 2 1 which is still not so 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.770
 wrong to always come back before mid 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.710
 time I pressure it happens so much 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.590
 often that but in the second half my 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.570
 opponent will hit with griezmann the 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.090
 ball will get him back on pedro 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.400
 really lucky because in fact 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.320
 my guardian instead stop him at 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.350
 right who will stop him to the left 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.360
 and that's precisely why pedro 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.560
 will succeed in scoring so then taken 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.120
 new opportunities in all 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.510
 last few minutes but hey it does not 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.630
 will change nothing to matches including 4 to 1 on 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.990
 this last goal of benzema 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:30.020
 so defeat defeat so the match 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.670
 outright it can be said deserved by my 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.710
 opponent after I could have put two 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.010
 or three goals but hey that's not too much 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.690
 serious 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.150
 we finish the episode anyway 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.500
 not bad with six goals scored so 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.520
 first defeat it was enough 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.620
 a long time anyway I think it must 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:46.240
 do almost ten matches that I had 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.290
 not lost if we can say that like that 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.370
 so what is still not so 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:54.080
 bad so that's why we'll go get some 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.690
 two little players so I decide to 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.450
 replace litas so been really really 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.810
 very very bad but not even one 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.780
 goal 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.510
 there it will be started to have heavy 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.770
 still with and local sonia yet 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.500
 a hull city player there is a 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.360
 Nigerian buy 3500 credit he looks 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.190
 still rather not bad at 71.2 general 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.560
 so a little + 3 for the moment and 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.230
 then a small + 3 so 3 and 3.6 if 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.780
 you know how to count it's not bad 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:25.490
 nathan delfouneso so the English player 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:27.800
 of aston villa which at 68 which quite 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.720
 quickly after pulling it's not too much 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.380
 that but it will always be better than 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.940
 our attac father before I think in 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.380
 Anyway I hope to put a lot of goals 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.700
 with them during the next episodes 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.740
 so here I hope this third episode 

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.080
 to score for pulling will have pleased you 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.400
 good even if he did not reach this 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.560
 division 5 

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.420
 so I think we'll have the title of the 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.740
 division located in the next episode 

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.990
 normally it should do it 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.600
 I hope these small choices in attack 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:56.030
 so aluko edel you will not have you anymore 

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.520
 if so, let go of lay people 

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.380
 I hope that we will reach its 120 

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.150
 aic by episode to score for in 

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.740
 so say right now it's not that much 

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.870
 so I hope we'll be there 

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.440
