domination game is way harder for me
because<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.810> takes<00:01:37.079> way<00:01:37.380> meaning<00:01:37.650> i<00:01:37.890> get<00:01:38.189> four

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
because it takes way meaning i get four

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.260 
because it takes way meaning i get four
or<00:01:38.400> five<00:01:38.579> bullets<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.880> kill<00:01:38.909> someone

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
or five bullets to kill someone

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.770 
or five bullets to kill someone
sometimes<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.680> kind<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.070> ridiculous

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
sometimes and it is kind of ridiculous

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.960 
sometimes and it is kind of ridiculous

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
was a USB I think extended mags or maybe

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.290 
was a USB I think extended mags or maybe
if<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.370> can't<00:02:33.610> remember<00:02:33.880> maybe<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.180> was

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
if I can't remember maybe it was

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.730 
if I can't remember maybe it was
external<00:02:34.600> max<00:02:34.720> maybe<00:02:34.930> what<00:02:35.080> was<00:02:35.170> without

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
external max maybe what was without

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.199 
external max maybe what was without
attachments<00:02:36.610> but<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.900> was<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.080> USB<00:02:38.530> mode<00:02:38.740> and

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
attachments but it was a USB mode and

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.830 
attachments but it was a USB mode and
that<00:02:40.209> mode<00:02:40.420> got<00:02:40.840> me<00:02:41.020> to<00:02:42.270> come<00:02:43.270> into<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.600> stress

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840
