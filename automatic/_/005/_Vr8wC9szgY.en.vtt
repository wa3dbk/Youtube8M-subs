everyone I had the pleasure to work with
the<00:00:29.780> students<00:00:30.780> at<00:00:30.869> Virginia<00:00:31.350> Tech<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.950> is<00:00:32.129> a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the students at Virginia Tech this is a

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.939 
the students at Virginia Tech this is a
senior<00:00:32.640> design<00:00:33.120> project<00:00:33.809> where<00:00:34.110> they<00:00:34.320> built

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
senior design project where they built

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.020 
senior design project where they built
an<00:00:35.160> all<00:00:35.309> electric<00:00:35.780> motorcycle<00:00:36.780> they<00:00:37.620> entered

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
an all electric motorcycle they entered

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.540 
an all electric motorcycle they entered
what<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.510> TTX<00:00:40.020> GP<00:00:40.610> 75<00:00:41.610> class<00:00:41.970> which<00:00:42.390> limits

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
what is the TTX GP 75 class which limits

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.569 
what is the TTX GP 75 class which limits
the<00:00:44.550> energy<00:00:45.000> storage<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.630> 7.5<00:00:46.560> kilowatt<00:00:47.160> hours

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the energy storage to 7.5 kilowatt hours

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.030 
the energy storage to 7.5 kilowatt hours
there's<00:00:48.030> basically<00:00:48.570> two<00:00:48.899> classes<00:00:49.290> that<00:00:49.890> were

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
there's basically two classes that were

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.690 
there's basically two classes that were
running<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.520> these<00:00:50.700> ama<00:00:51.239> races<00:00:52.010> 75<00:00:53.010> class<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
running in these ama races 75 class and

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.830 
running in these ama races 75 class and
then<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.300> open<00:00:54.750> class<00:00:55.880> 2013<00:00:56.880> we're<00:00:57.450> going<00:00:57.719> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
then the open class 2013 we're going to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.549 
then the open class 2013 we're going to
the<00:00:57.960> open<00:00:58.380> class<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.610> this<00:01:00.000> year<00:01:00.360> we<00:01:01.350> did

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
the open class but in this year we did

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.609 
the open class but in this year we did
this<00:01:01.680> 75<00:01:02.489> class<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.570> whole<00:01:03.809> trick<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.440> this

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
this 75 class the whole trick to this

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.139 
this 75 class the whole trick to this
was<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:06.290> take<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.530> amount<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:08.070> energy<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
was to take that amount of energy do the

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.480 
was to take that amount of energy do the
required<00:01:09.750> amount<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.289> warm-up<00:01:10.740> citing<00:01:11.250> laps

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
required amount of warm-up citing laps

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.359 
required amount of warm-up citing laps
warm-up<00:01:12.000> laps<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:13.050> race<00:01:13.259> itself<00:01:13.800> and<00:01:14.190> then

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
warm-up laps the race itself and then

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.609 
warm-up laps the race itself and then
the<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.830> cooldown<00:01:16.830> lap<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:19.020> want<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> spend

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the the cooldown lap you want to spend

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.640 
the the cooldown lap you want to spend
all<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> energy<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:21.750> know<00:01:21.840> no<00:01:22.080> more<00:01:22.380> no

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
all the energy and you know no more no

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.270 
all the energy and you know no more no
less<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.729> want<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.000> get<00:01:24.090> around<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:25.229> track<00:01:25.500> so

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
less you want to get around the track so

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.359 
less you want to get around the track so
got<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> video<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.320> show<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:31.369> bc

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
got a video on this like to show you bc

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.460 
got a video on this like to show you bc

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
what's different from this bike as far

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.310 
what's different from this bike as far
as<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.650> other<00:01:37.979> electric<00:01:38.520> bikes<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:39.320> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
as all the other electric bikes is the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.310 
as all the other electric bikes is the
drivetrain<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.369> really<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.880> there<00:01:42.119> are

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
drivetrain we really have in there are

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.960 
drivetrain we really have in there are
drivetrain<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.500> from<00:01:43.710> Col<00:01:43.890> Morgan<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.640> a

drivetrain is from Col Morgan and it's a
lot<00:01:45.780> more<00:01:46.159> sophisticated<00:01:47.159> than<00:01:47.340> some<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
lot more sophisticated than some of the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.480 
lot more sophisticated than some of the
others<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.810> will<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.170> out<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
bolt project is really kind of my desire

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.330 
bolt project is really kind of my desire
for<00:01:53.009> electric<00:01:53.729> vehicles<00:01:54.020> making<00:01:55.020> something

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
for electric vehicles making something

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.270 
for electric vehicles making something
innovative<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.469> guess<00:01:58.469> inventing<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.130> future

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
innovative I guess inventing the future

00:01:59.280 --> 00:03:17.530 
innovative I guess inventing the future
if<00:01:59.609> you<00:01:59.729> will

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.720 

we<00:03:18.540> entered<00:03:18.990> three<00:03:19.290> races<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:20.040> we<00:03:20.490> won<00:03:20.700> our

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
we entered three races and we won our

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.780 
we entered three races and we won our
class<00:03:21.240> in<00:03:21.630> all<00:03:21.870> three<00:03:22.140> races<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:23.160> was<00:03:23.460> a<00:03:23.490> very

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
class in all three races it was a very

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.770 
class in all three races it was a very
exciting<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:24.890> one<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.160> so<00:03:26.970> it's<00:03:27.390> not<00:03:27.600> only

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
exciting and one of the so it's not only

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.080 
exciting and one of the so it's not only
a<00:03:27.930> place<00:03:28.530> for<00:03:28.860> us<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.190> work<00:03:29.400> on<00:03:29.640> technology<00:03:30.360> we

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
a place for us to work on technology we

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.450 
a place for us to work on technology we
produced<00:03:33.090> our<00:03:33.450> load<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.470> first<00:03:34.710> low<00:03:34.980> voltage

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
produced our load the first low voltage

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.960 
produced our load the first low voltage

and<00:03:42.980> we<00:03:43.980> modified<00:03:44.670> an<00:03:44.910> AKM<00:03:45.500> servo<00:03:46.500> motor<00:03:46.800> to

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
and we modified an AKM servo motor to

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.840 
and we modified an AKM servo motor to
match<00:03:48.150> up<00:03:48.420> with<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.690> exact<00:03:49.620> conditions<00:03:50.520> for

match up with the exact conditions for
