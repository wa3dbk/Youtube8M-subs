on<00:00:00.210> the<00:00:00.960> anaerobic<00:00:01.410> side<00:00:01.860> and<00:00:02.159> that<00:00:02.700> is

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
on the anaerobic side and that is

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.260 
on the anaerobic side and that is
delivering<00:00:03.480> calories<00:00:04.049> of<00:00:04.740> energy<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.819> use<00:00:06.000> for

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
muscle contraction without oxygen

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.890 
muscle contraction without oxygen
requires<00:00:10.800> only<00:00:11.309> about<00:00:11.670> nine<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.150> eleven<00:00:12.630> weeks

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
requires only about nine to eleven weeks

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.349 
requires only about nine to eleven weeks
of<00:00:13.460> training<00:00:15.049> why<00:00:16.049> because<00:00:16.980> these<00:00:17.220> are

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
of training why because these are

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.820 
of training why because these are
biochemical<00:00:18.359> or<00:00:18.510> chemical<00:00:19.109> changes<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
body very little structural changes so

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.310 
body very little structural changes so
structural<00:00:23.460> changes<00:00:23.910> take<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> long<00:00:24.539> time<00:00:24.900> an

structural changes take a long time an
aerobic<00:00:26.220> training<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.880> know<00:00:26.970> nine<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.330> eleven

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
aerobic training you know nine to eleven

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.060 
aerobic training you know nine to eleven
weeks<00:00:27.720> still<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.990> long<00:00:28.140> time<00:00:28.170> that's<00:00:28.650> basically

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
weeks still a long time that's basically

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.780 
weeks still a long time that's basically
your<00:00:29.279> season<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.660> nearly<00:00:31.050> as<00:00:31.170> much<00:00:31.439> time

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
your season but not nearly as much time

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.139 
your season but not nearly as much time
as<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.540> aerobic<00:00:33.930> side<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.610> slide

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
as the aerobic side so this slide

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.479 
as the aerobic side so this slide
indicates<00:00:36.390> two<00:00:36.840> things<00:00:37.110> number<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.129> need

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
indicates two things number one you need

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.010 
indicates two things number one you need

training the anaerobic training done
mostly<00:00:43.710> during<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> season<00:00:44.640> but<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.149> can't

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
mostly during the season but you can't

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.680 
mostly during the season but you can't
wait<00:00:45.870> long<00:00:46.289> during<00:00:46.920> your<00:00:47.070> season<00:00:47.460> either<00:00:47.690> too

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
wait long during your season either too

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.290 
wait long during your season either too
many<00:00:48.930> coaches<00:00:49.289> wait<00:00:50.070> too<00:00:50.520> long<00:00:50.730> into<00:00:51.059> their

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
many coaches wait too long into their

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.330 
many coaches wait too long into their
season<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.960> start<00:00:52.020> any<00:00:52.530> sort<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.890> anaerobic

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
work nine to eleven weeks is what you

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.830 
work nine to eleven weeks is what you
need

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.299 

this<00:01:00.590> is<00:01:00.830> an<00:01:00.980> example<00:01:01.430> of<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:03.010> each<00:01:04.010> of<00:01:04.070> the

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
this is an example of the each of the

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.580 
this is an example of the each of the
nine<00:01:04.489> days<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:05.120> this<00:01:05.330> on<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:05.960> right<00:01:06.200> side

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
nine days and this on the right side

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.500 
nine days and this on the right side
would<00:01:06.830> be<00:01:06.980> what<00:01:07.130> I'm<00:01:07.250> trying<00:01:07.550> to<00:01:07.640> accomplish

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.690 

Dave<00:01:11.510> wine<00:01:11.720> vo2max<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:12.530> can<00:01:12.710> see<00:01:12.950> how<00:01:13.460> it's

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
Dave wine vo2max you can see how it's

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.200 
Dave wine vo2max you can see how it's
done

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
done

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.700 
done
date<00:01:14.360> paste<00:01:14.630> intervals<00:01:15.170> okay<00:01:17.229> heels<00:01:18.229> or<00:01:18.440> speed

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
date paste intervals okay heels or speed

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.670

member<00:01:19.040> we're<00:01:19.190> alternating<00:01:20.050> between<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.500> two

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
member we're alternating between the two

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.070 
member we're alternating between the two
so<00:01:21.950> one<00:01:22.430> nine<00:01:22.640> day<00:01:22.820> cycle<00:01:23.360> we<00:01:23.479> do<00:01:23.630> hills<00:01:23.869> the

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
so one nine day cycle we do hills the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.260 
so one nine day cycle we do hills the
next<00:01:24.290> one<00:01:24.410> we<00:01:24.530> do<00:01:24.680> speed<00:01:25.010> okay<00:01:25.670> that's<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:26.030> max

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
next one we do speed okay that's a max

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.240 
next one we do speed okay that's a max
effort<00:01:26.450> getting<00:01:26.840> up<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.200> hill<00:01:27.229> at<00:01:27.619> max<00:01:27.860> effort

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
effort getting up the hill at max effort

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.250 
effort getting up the hill at max effort
or<00:01:28.430> running<00:01:28.790> thirty<00:01:29.060> meter<00:01:29.330> repeats<00:01:29.570> at<00:01:30.020> max

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
or running thirty meter repeats at max

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.800 
or running thirty meter repeats at max
effort<00:01:30.650> I'll<00:01:30.920> set<00:01:31.520> these<00:01:31.670> specific<00:01:32.390> workouts

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
effort I'll set these specific workouts

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.450 
effort I'll set these specific workouts
out<00:01:33.050> just<00:01:35.050> you<00:01:36.050> know<00:01:36.080> in<00:01:36.470> detail<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.009> little<00:01:37.310> bit

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
out just you know in detail a little bit

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.340 
out just you know in detail a little bit
later<00:01:37.729> here<00:01:37.970> this<00:01:38.180> is<00:01:38.360> just<00:01:39.020> kind<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.229> an

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
later here this is just kind of an

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.310 
later here this is just kind of an
overview<00:01:40.149> and<00:01:41.149> we've<00:01:41.300> got<00:01:41.450> add<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.780> recovery

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
overview and we've got add the recovery

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.560 
overview and we've got add the recovery
run<00:01:42.530> which<00:01:42.770> we<00:01:42.920> talked<00:01:43.160> about<00:01:43.570> special

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
run which we talked about special

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.430 
run which we talked about special
endurance<00:01:45.290> one<00:01:45.560> which<00:01:46.070> would<00:01:46.250> be<00:01:47.110> 150<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.200> 300

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
endurance one which would be 150 to 300

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.760 
endurance one which would be 150 to 300
meter<00:01:48.800> repeats<00:01:49.009> done<00:01:49.940> at<00:01:50.119> goal<00:01:50.479> pace<00:01:50.869> so<00:01:51.619> these

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
meter repeats done at goal pace so these

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.029 
meter repeats done at goal pace so these
are<00:01:51.890> done<00:01:52.039> very<00:01:52.250> fast<00:01:53.380> some<00:01:54.380> goal<00:01:54.710> out<00:01:54.740> there

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
are done very fast some goal out there

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.600 
are done very fast some goal out there
that<00:01:55.460> might<00:01:55.670> be<00:01:55.940> wrapped<00:01:56.539> around<00:01:56.750> their<00:01:57.170> 800

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
that might be wrapped around their 800

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.240 
that might be wrapped around their 800
goal<00:01:58.610> their<00:01:59.030> mile<00:01:59.330> goal<00:02:00.009> there<00:02:01.009> will<00:02:01.100> be<00:02:01.130> a

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
goal their mile goal there will be a

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.740 
goal their mile goal there will be a
crossover<00:02:01.759> between<00:02:01.940> track<00:02:02.570> and

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
crossover between track and

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.790 
crossover between track and
cross-country<00:02:02.990> here<00:02:03.860> as<00:02:04.009> you<00:02:04.700> determine<00:02:05.800> you

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
cross-country here as you determine you

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.240 
cross-country here as you determine you
know<00:02:06.830> what<00:02:07.069> their<00:02:07.220> goal<00:02:07.429> pace<00:02:07.670> may<00:02:07.910> be<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:09.470> you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
know what their goal pace may be and you

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.620 
know what their goal pace may be and you
can<00:02:10.369> see<00:02:10.520> how<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.729> rest<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.150> these<00:02:11.240> are<00:02:11.450> laid

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
can see how the rest of these are laid

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.740 
can see how the rest of these are laid
out<00:02:11.680> so<00:02:12.680> they're<00:02:12.950> either<00:02:13.069> goal<00:02:13.340> pace

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
out so they're either goal pace

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.140 
out so they're either goal pace
