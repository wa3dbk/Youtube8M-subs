00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
alright so this is the cage system that

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.430 
alright so this is the cage system that
i<00:00:10.889> was<00:00:11.040> talking<00:00:11.309> about<00:00:11.960> it's<00:00:12.960> just<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.260> way<00:00:13.410> of

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
i was talking about it's just a way of

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.760 
i was talking about it's just a way of
laying<00:00:14.070> out<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.719> major<00:00:15.719> chord<00:00:16.110> five<00:00:16.379> different

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
laying out a major chord five different

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.060 
laying out a major chord five different
ways<00:00:16.920> across<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.940> fretboard<00:00:18.660> here<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.800> what

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
ways across the fretboard here so what

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.660 
ways across the fretboard here so what
you<00:00:20.190> already<00:00:20.369> know<00:00:20.490> as<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.240> C<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.110> paying<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.190> G

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
you already know as a C and paying a G

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.110 
you already know as a C and paying a G
and<00:00:24.210> E<00:00:24.690> and<00:00:24.960> addy<00:00:25.470> we're<00:00:26.100> going<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.280> refer<00:00:26.970> to

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
and E and addy we're going to refer to

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.320 
and E and addy we're going to refer to
those<00:00:27.240> as<00:00:27.300> shapes<00:00:28.250> so<00:00:29.250> if<00:00:29.430> I<00:00:29.550> was<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.789> play<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
those as shapes so if I was to play a

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.569 
those as shapes so if I was to play a
c-major<00:00:30.990> chord<00:00:31.200> five<00:00:31.710> different<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.430> those

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
c-major chord five different with those

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.160 
c-major chord five different with those
five<00:00:32.789> shapes<00:00:33.530> I<00:00:34.530> would<00:00:35.520> start<00:00:35.760> with<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
five shapes I would start with the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.960 
five shapes I would start with the
c-shape<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.410> play<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.739> C<00:00:37.980> chord<00:00:38.220> down<00:00:38.700> here

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
c-shape to play the C chord down here

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.170 
c-shape to play the C chord down here
and<00:00:39.150> uh<00:00:40.280> I'm<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.520> illustrate<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.030> like

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
and uh I'm going to illustrate it like

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.540 
and uh I'm going to illustrate it like
this<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:42.930> my<00:00:43.200> first<00:00:43.440> finger<00:00:43.620> playing<00:00:44.280> across

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
this with my first finger playing across

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.610 
this with my first finger playing across
the<00:00:44.790> nut<00:00:44.970> because<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.540> make<00:00:46.380> sure<00:00:46.500> they

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the nut because the make sure they

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.670 
the nut because the make sure they
remember<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.760> third<00:00:48.660> string<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
remember that the third string and the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.080 
remember that the third string and the
first<00:00:50.070> string<00:00:50.309> are<00:00:51.079> open<00:00:52.079> here<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:53.790> this<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
first string are open here so so this is

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.049 
first string are open here so so this is
really<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.600> shape<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.870> gets<00:00:55.320> moved<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:56.059> it's

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
really the shape that gets moved up it's

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.990 
really the shape that gets moved up it's
not<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.559> which<00:00:58.559> common<00:00:59.370> misconception<00:00:59.969> that

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
not this which common misconception that

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.969 
not this which common misconception that
but<00:01:00.570> um<00:01:02.809> all<00:01:03.809> right<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.469> if<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
but um all right so if I was going to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.730 
but um all right so if I was going to
put<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> C<00:01:05.549> chord<00:01:05.759> with<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> c-shape<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.780> then

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
put a C chord with the c-shape and then

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.990 
put a C chord with the c-shape and then
I'm<00:01:07.799> going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.950> play<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> C<00:01:08.460> chord<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.969> a

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
I'm going to play a C chord with the a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.130 
I'm going to play a C chord with the a
shape

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.270 

alright<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:13.190> then<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:14.120> C<00:01:14.420> chord<00:01:14.720> with<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.920> G

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
alright and then a C chord with the G

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.040 
alright and then a C chord with the G
shape<00:01:18.970> all<00:01:19.970> I<00:01:20.120> have<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.300> do<00:01:20.479> is<00:01:20.659> pay<00:01:21.020> attention

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
to where my root note is and then build

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.040 
to where my root note is and then build
the<00:01:23.000> G<00:01:23.150> shape<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:24.820> then<00:01:25.820> C<00:01:26.540> chord<00:01:26.780> with<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.020> e

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
the G shape and then C chord with the e

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.540 
the G shape and then C chord with the e
shape<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:28.280> then<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.460> C<00:01:28.729> chord<00:01:28.970> with<00:01:29.210> d<00:01:29.509> shape

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
shape and then a C chord with d shape

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.210 
shape and then a C chord with d shape
and<00:01:31.550> the<00:01:31.670> root<00:01:31.850> notice<00:01:32.210> right<00:01:32.390> here<00:01:32.450> on<00:01:33.220> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
and the root notice right here on the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.560 
and the root notice right here on the
10th<00:01:34.700> fret<00:01:35.030> string<00:01:35.600> 4<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:38.150> then<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.420> repeats

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
itself starts over with the c-shape

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.969 
itself starts over with the c-shape
again<00:01:40.820> right<00:01:41.360> up<00:01:41.450> here<00:01:41.630> of<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.320> fifteenth<00:01:42.740> and

twelfth<00:01:43.220> fret<00:01:46.060> here's<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.119> quick<00:01:47.330> little<00:01:47.509> trick

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
twelfth fret here's a quick little trick

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.279 
twelfth fret here's a quick little trick
this<00:01:48.920> is<00:01:49.070> what<00:01:49.190> I<00:01:49.250> used<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.789> kind<00:01:50.600> of<00:01:50.750> shrink

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
this is what I used to kind of shrink

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:52.660 
this is what I used to kind of shrink
the<00:01:51.619> fretboard<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:52.250> remember<00:01:52.460> when<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.640> first

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
the fretboard I remember when I first

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.279 
the fretboard I remember when I first
started<00:01:53.119> this<00:01:53.240> prep<00:01:53.509> board<00:01:53.720> felt<00:01:53.930> like<00:01:54.080> it<00:01:54.200> was

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
started this prep board felt like it was

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.550 
started this prep board felt like it was
like<00:01:54.440> six<00:01:54.770> miles<00:01:54.979> long<00:01:55.220> and<00:01:55.460> then<00:01:56.530> when<00:01:57.530> i

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
like six miles long and then when i

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.139 
like six miles long and then when i
started<00:01:57.830> using<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.130> cage<00:01:58.340> system<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:58.880> started

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
started using the cage system it started

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.960 
started using the cage system it started
to<00:01:59.240> shrink<00:01:59.390> down<00:01:59.570> and<00:02:00.310> not<00:02:01.310> until<00:02:01.520> like<00:02:01.729> maybe

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
to shrink down and not until like maybe

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.450 
to shrink down and not until like maybe
I'll<00:02:02.210> four<00:02:02.600> years<00:02:02.929> ago<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.410> started<00:02:03.890> looking<00:02:04.160> at

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
I'll four years ago I started looking at

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.719 
I'll four years ago I started looking at
it<00:02:04.490> as<00:02:04.990> though<00:02:05.990> it's<00:02:06.229> really<00:02:06.560> only<00:02:06.740> two<00:02:07.220> shapes

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
it as though it's really only two shapes

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.449 
it as though it's really only two shapes
to<00:02:08.209> big<00:02:08.450> shapes<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.739> kind<00:02:10.070> of<00:02:10.130> my

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
to big shapes so this is kind of my

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.420 
to big shapes so this is kind of my
little<00:02:11.030> trick<00:02:11.239> I<00:02:11.470> look<00:02:12.470> at<00:02:12.590> as<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:12.980> sea<00:02:13.280> and

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
little trick I look at as the sea and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.650 
little trick I look at as the sea and
the<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.550> shape<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:15.140> GE<00:02:15.470> shape<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.390> see

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
the a shape and the GE shape so the see

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.020 
the a shape and the GE shape so the see

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
right here is to see and then on this on

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.280 
right here is to see and then on this on
string<00:02:33.380> six<00:02:33.769> right<00:02:34.730> here<00:02:34.760> on<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.030> 8th<00:02:35.180> fret<00:02:35.510> so

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
string six right here on the 8th fret so

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.170 
string six right here on the 8th fret so
if<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.650> can<00:02:36.980> visually<00:02:37.400> keep<00:02:37.610> track<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:37.910> where

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
if I can visually keep track of where

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.750 
if I can visually keep track of where
those<00:02:38.420> two<00:02:38.780> notes<00:02:38.989> are<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.590> can<00:02:40.070> then<00:02:40.220> build<00:02:40.489> out

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
those two notes are I can then build out

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.720 
those two notes are I can then build out
the<00:02:41.660> entire<00:02:41.989> fretboard<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.769> c-shape<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.700> a

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
the entire fretboard the c-shape to a

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.210 
the entire fretboard the c-shape to a
shape<00:02:44.470> because<00:02:45.470> they're<00:02:45.590> both<00:02:45.739> built<00:02:45.980> off<00:02:46.190> of

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
shape because they're both built off of

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.000 
shape because they're both built off of
the<00:02:46.459> same<00:02:46.700> route<00:02:47.480> right<00:02:47.660> there<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.049> then<00:02:48.799> the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
the same route right there and then the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.509 
the same route right there and then the
g<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.640> shape<00:02:51.010> now<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.100> reason<00:02:52.250> i<00:02:52.459> don't

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
g and the shape now the reason i don't

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.509 
g and the shape now the reason i don't
focus<00:02:53.150> on<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.540> d<00:02:53.720> shape<00:02:53.959> is<00:02:54.230> because<00:02:54.680> the

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
focus on the d shape is because the

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.390 
focus on the d shape is because the
d-shaped<00:02:55.760> kind<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.299> overlaps<00:02:56.900> it's<00:02:57.650> part<00:02:58.040> c

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
d-shaped kind of overlaps it's part c

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.110 
d-shaped kind of overlaps it's part c
and<00:02:58.670> then<00:02:59.420> part<00:02:59.750> ii<00:02:59.989> shape<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:01.280> i<00:03:01.579> refer<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.000> as

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
and then part ii shape so i refer to as

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.350 
and then part ii shape so i refer to as
kind<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:02.540> like<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.780> connecting<00:03:03.350> shape<00:03:03.620> but<00:03:04.579> it

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
kind of like the connecting shape but it

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.349 
kind of like the connecting shape but it
doesn't<00:03:05.780> have<00:03:05.930> any<00:03:06.110> of<00:03:06.260> its<00:03:06.410> own<00:03:07.180> notes<00:03:10.359> like

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
doesn't have any of its own notes like

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.390 
doesn't have any of its own notes like
notes<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:11.840> need<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.950> shape<00:03:13.190> there

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
notes you need to the the shape there

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.090 
notes you need to the the shape there
even<00:03:13.730> if<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:13.970> lay<00:03:14.359> down<00:03:14.510> right<00:03:14.750> there<00:03:14.989> I'm<00:03:15.829> still

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
even if I lay down right there I'm still

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.350 
even if I lay down right there I'm still
playing<00:03:16.250> those<00:03:16.489> two<00:03:16.760> from<00:03:17.060> the

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
playing those two from the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.520 
playing those two from the
shape

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.740 

I<00:03:21.680> think<00:03:22.400> in<00:03:22.490> my<00:03:22.580> posting<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.090> said<00:03:23.330> that<00:03:23.569> we

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
I think in my posting I said that we

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.530 
I think in my posting I said that we
play<00:03:23.959> you<00:03:24.410> end<00:03:24.560> up<00:03:24.680> playing<00:03:24.860> every<00:03:25.580> note<00:03:26.270> of

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
play you end up playing every note of

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.040 
play you end up playing every note of
the<00:03:26.720> major<00:03:26.750> chord<00:03:27.430> except<00:03:28.430> for<00:03:28.610> two<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:29.270> that

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
the major chord except for two and that

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.199 
the major chord except for two and that
would<00:03:30.200> be<00:03:30.230> found<00:03:30.560> right<00:03:30.770> here<00:03:30.830> so<00:03:31.819> if<00:03:31.910> i<00:03:32.000> play<00:03:32.180> a

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
would be found right here so if i play a

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.140 
would be found right here so if i play a

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
chord and then I'm missing when I play

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.100 
chord and then I'm missing when I play
ji<00:03:40.880> Yi<00:03:41.440> here<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.980> then<00:03:43.250> I<00:03:43.340> start<00:03:43.580> with<00:03:43.700> C<00:03:43.910> again

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
ji Yi here and then I start with C again

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.620 
ji Yi here and then I start with C again
I'm<00:03:45.110> missing<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:46.610> e<00:03:46.640> note<00:03:46.850> which<00:03:47.360> is<00:03:47.510> the

I'm missing the e note which is the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:55.420 
I'm missing the e note which is the
three<00:03:47.959> on<00:03:48.230> a<00:03:48.880> front<00:03:49.880> 12<00:03:50.120> here<00:03:50.800> so<00:03:53.680> if<00:03:54.680> we<00:03:54.980> had

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
three on a front 12 here so if we had

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.930 
three on a front 12 here so if we had
five<00:03:55.940> fingers<00:03:56.180> in<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.570> front<00:03:56.950> for<00:03:57.950> outermost

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
five fingers in the front for outermost

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.750 
five fingers in the front for outermost
performance<00:03:59.600> here<00:03:59.780> we<00:04:00.440> would<00:04:00.650> we<00:04:01.310> would<00:04:01.340> be

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
performance here we would we would be

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.840 
performance here we would we would be
able<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:02.320> hit<00:04:03.320> this<00:04:03.620> three<00:04:04.100> in<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.370> base<00:04:04.550> here

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
able to hit this three in the base here

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.729 
able to hit this three in the base here
then<00:04:05.540> I'd<00:04:05.660> be<00:04:05.780> able<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:05.989> cover<00:04:06.200> that<00:04:06.410> but

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
then I'd be able to cover that but

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.710 
then I'd be able to cover that but
otherwise<00:04:07.670> it's<00:04:07.910> not<00:04:07.970> going<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.239> work<00:04:08.330> out<00:04:08.510> so

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
otherwise it's not going to work out so

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.949 
otherwise it's not going to work out so
well<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:09.700> since<00:04:10.700> we<00:04:10.850> relieve<00:04:11.360> this<00:04:11.569> I

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
well so since we relieve this I

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.650 
well so since we relieve this I
personally<00:04:12.830> like<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.160> form<00:04:13.519> my<00:04:13.670> cords<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.360> I

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
personally like to form my cords and I

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.810 
personally like to form my cords and I
when<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:14.810> think<00:04:15.140> about<00:04:15.200> this<00:04:15.500> as<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:16.549> root

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
when I think about this as the root

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.819 
when I think about this as the root
being<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.299> lowest<00:04:17.720> sounding<00:04:18.049> note<00:04:18.260> so<00:04:18.709> that's

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
being the lowest sounding note so that's

here's<00:04:29.350> a<00:04:29.490> physical<00:04:30.490> trick<00:04:30.730> for<00:04:31.030> drilling<00:04:31.960> the

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
here's a physical trick for drilling the

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.150 
here's a physical trick for drilling the
CA<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.880> GE<00:04:34.120> shape<00:04:34.600> just<00:04:35.320> into<00:04:35.830> your<00:04:35.950> brain

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
CA and the GE shape just into your brain

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.530 
CA and the GE shape just into your brain
all<00:04:36.639> right<00:04:37.440> first<00:04:38.440> take<00:04:38.919> it<00:04:39.210> take<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.330> see<00:04:40.510> a

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
all right first take it take the see a

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.300 
all right first take it take the see a
shape<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.320> what<00:04:41.710> we're<00:04:41.800> going<00:04:41.889> to<00:04:41.980> do<00:04:42.040> is<00:04:42.160> take

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
shape and what we're going to do is take

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.950 
shape and what we're going to do is take
one<00:04:42.550> finger<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.270> you're<00:04:43.360> going<00:04:43.450> to<00:04:43.510> outline

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
one finger and you're going to outline

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.220 
one finger and you're going to outline
that<00:04:44.230> shape<00:04:44.669> going<00:04:45.669> up<00:04:45.910> all<00:04:46.840> right<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.169> then

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
that shape going up all right and then

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.750 
that shape going up all right and then
you<00:04:47.440> want<00:04:47.620> to<00:04:47.680> come<00:04:47.800> back<00:04:48.100> down<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:51.280> egg<00:04:51.460> shape

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
you want to come back down the egg shape

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.990 
you want to come back down the egg shape
and<00:04:52.330> then<00:04:52.600> go<00:04:52.690> up<00:04:52.870> to<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.820> back<00:04:55.090> down<00:04:57.000> and

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
and then go up to a and back down and

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000 
and then go up to a and back down and
then<00:04:58.060> go<00:04:58.720> up<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:58.990> G<00:04:59.230> shape<00:04:59.470> and<00:04:59.770> do<00:04:59.889> the

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
then go up to the G shape and do the

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.390 
then go up to the G shape and do the
same<00:05:00.190> thing<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:04.660> then<00:05:05.530> of<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:05.860> E<00:05:05.890> and<00:05:06.010> then

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
same thing and then of the E and then

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.020 
same thing and then of the E and then
down<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.730> G<00:05:06.880> all<00:05:07.300> right<00:05:07.830> then<00:05:08.830> once<00:05:09.760> you<00:05:09.880> kind

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
down the G all right then once you kind

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.000 
down the G all right then once you kind
of<00:05:10.150> get<00:05:10.270> that<00:05:10.480> and<00:05:10.750> also<00:05:10.990> try<00:05:11.620> to<00:05:11.680> close<00:05:11.890> your

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
of get that and also try to close your

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.620 
of get that and also try to close your
eyes<00:05:12.100> and<00:05:12.190> picture<00:05:12.520> what<00:05:12.850> you<00:05:12.940> just<00:05:13.120> did<00:05:13.360> and

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
eyes and picture what you just did and

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.110 
eyes and picture what you just did and
try<00:05:14.530> to<00:05:14.590> keep<00:05:14.860> track<00:05:15.130> of<00:05:15.190> how<00:05:15.490> far<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.880> frets

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
try to keep track of how far the frets

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.290 
try to keep track of how far the frets
are<00:05:16.270> apart<00:05:16.600> from<00:05:16.780> each<00:05:16.870> other<00:05:17.550> now<00:05:18.550> to

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
are apart from each other now to

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.450 
are apart from each other now to
increase<00:05:19.900> the<00:05:20.050> difficulty<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:20.740> this<00:05:21.160> is<00:05:21.280> all

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
increase the difficulty and this is all

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.070 
increase the difficulty and this is all
about<00:05:21.580> visualization<00:05:22.180> because<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:22.900> more<00:05:23.050> you

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
about visualization because the more you

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.540 
about visualization because the more you
can<00:05:23.290> just<00:05:23.470> visualize<00:05:23.620> where<00:05:24.100> you<00:05:24.220> are<00:05:24.370> the

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
can just visualize where you are the

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.129 
can just visualize where you are the
front<00:05:24.790> board<00:05:27.510> you<00:05:28.510> can<00:05:28.630> just<00:05:28.780> kind<00:05:28.930> of<00:05:28.960> move

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
front board you can just kind of move

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:38.030 
front board you can just kind of move
around<00:05:29.260> real<00:05:29.620> quick<00:05:35.340> all<00:05:36.340> right<00:05:36.460> so<00:05:37.000> but<00:05:37.360> um

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
around real quick all right so but um

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:49.350 
around real quick all right so but um
the<00:05:41.520> so<00:05:44.190> try<00:05:45.190> it<00:05:45.250> like<00:05:45.400> this<00:05:46.680> good<00:05:47.680> route<00:05:48.360> then

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
the so try it like this good route then

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.680 
the so try it like this good route then
the<00:05:49.570> three<00:05:50.380> inside<00:05:50.830> the<00:05:50.979> c-shape<00:05:51.510> then<00:05:52.510> the

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
the three inside the c-shape then the

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.710 
the three inside the c-shape then the
five<00:05:52.960> inside<00:05:53.350> the<00:05:53.500> a<00:05:53.970> right<00:05:54.970> and<00:05:55.180> then<00:05:55.450> go<00:05:55.660> to

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
five inside the a right and then go to

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.930 
five inside the a right and then go to
the<00:05:55.930> five<00:05:56.410> and<00:05:56.620> the<00:05:56.680> sea<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:59.080> one<00:05:59.320> in<00:05:59.470> a<00:05:59.940> you

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
the five and the sea the one in a you

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.050 
the five and the sea the one in a you
wanted<00:06:01.240> to<00:06:01.330> see<00:06:01.570> the<00:06:01.960> three<00:06:02.260> in<00:06:02.320> the<00:06:02.440> a<00:06:03.060> and

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
wanted to see the three in the a and

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.460 
wanted to see the three in the a and
then<00:06:04.479> you'll<00:06:04.630> end<00:06:04.840> with<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.050> five<00:06:05.260> right

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
then you'll end with the five right

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:14.730 
then you'll end with the five right
there<00:06:05.500> so<00:06:06.430> you<00:06:06.490> get<00:06:06.700> this<00:06:12.840> all<00:06:13.840> right<00:06:13.960> then<00:06:14.530> try

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
there so you get this all right then try

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.960 
there so you get this all right then try
to<00:06:14.800> do<00:06:15.010> it<00:06:15.100> with<00:06:15.130> just<00:06:15.220> one<00:06:15.550> Turner<00:06:15.850> because

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
to do it with just one Turner because

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.240 
to do it with just one Turner because
then<00:06:16.960> you<00:06:17.050> have<00:06:17.140> to<00:06:17.229> keep<00:06:17.410> track<00:06:17.710> of<00:06:17.770> where

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
then you have to keep track of where

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.880 
then you have to keep track of where
everything<00:06:18.460> is<00:06:19.169> with<00:06:20.169> your<00:06:20.380> I<00:06:20.650> only<00:06:21.070> I<00:06:22.890> usually

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.890 
everything is with your I only I usually

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.860 
everything is with your I only I usually
kind<00:06:24.010> of<00:06:24.160> almost<00:06:24.610> kind<00:06:25.150> of<00:06:25.240> stare<00:06:25.630> in<00:06:25.780> the

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
kind of almost kind of stare in the

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.570 
kind of almost kind of stare in the
middle<00:06:26.200> and<00:06:26.380> use<00:06:26.590> my<00:06:26.770> peripheral<00:06:27.250> to<00:06:27.400> move

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
middle and use my peripheral to move

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.790 
middle and use my peripheral to move
around<00:06:27.700> real<00:06:28.030> quick<00:06:28.090> and<00:06:28.419> then<00:06:28.510> do<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.620> same

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
around real quick and then do the same

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.529 
around real quick and then do the same
thing<00:06:30.010> with<00:06:30.160> the<00:06:30.190> G<00:06:30.460> and<00:06:30.760> E<00:06:31.000> while<00:06:31.479> you're

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 
thing with the G and E while you're

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.350 
thing with the G and E while you're
right<00:06:35.370> and<00:06:36.370> that<00:06:36.610> will<00:06:36.729> kind<00:06:36.880> of<00:06:36.940> help<00:06:37.000> drill

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
right and that will kind of help drill

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.890 
right and that will kind of help drill
in<00:06:37.479> the<00:06:37.510> CA<00:06:37.870> and<00:06:38.320> then<00:06:38.560> the<00:06:38.650> GE
