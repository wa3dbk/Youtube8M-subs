00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
insertion ones like CTF because as I get

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.100 
insertion ones like CTF because as I get
closer<00:04:46.310> to<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.670> flag<00:04:46.940> of<00:04:47.330> constantly<00:04:47.870> drop

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110

good thing to note about all this stuff
is<00:05:22.780> we<00:05:23.780> have<00:05:24.020> two<00:05:24.560> basic<00:05:24.830> philosophies<00:05:25.490> that

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
is we have two basic philosophies that

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.460 
is we have two basic philosophies that
we<00:05:25.930> incorporate<00:05:26.930> that<00:05:27.050> everything<00:05:27.380> we're

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
we incorporate that everything we're

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.140 
we incorporate that everything we're
adding<00:05:27.680> to<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.860> game<00:05:28.070> we<00:05:28.820> have<00:05:28.940> to<00:05:29.000> make<00:05:29.120> sure

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
adding to the game we have to make sure

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.870 
adding to the game we have to make sure
it's<00:05:29.360> fun<00:05:29.540> which<00:05:29.870> is<00:05:29.900> obvious<00:05:30.610> and<00:05:31.610> we<00:05:31.730> also

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
it's fun which is obvious and we also

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.640 
it's fun which is obvious and we also
make<00:05:32.150> sure<00:05:32.180> that<00:05:32.480> it

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
make sure that it

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.830 
make sure that it
balance<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:33.520> there<00:05:33.820> are<00:05:33.940> counters<00:05:34.330> to<00:05:34.540> it<00:05:34.690> in

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
balance and there are counters to it in

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.780 
balance and there are counters to it in
there<00:05:34.990> are<00:05:35.080> ways<00:05:35.259> that<00:05:35.440> this<00:05:36.280> isn't<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:36.639> thing

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
there are ways that this isn't the thing

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.700 
there are ways that this isn't the thing
that's<00:05:37.000> going<00:05:37.180> to<00:05:37.210> break<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:37.840> game<00:05:37.990> so<00:05:38.560> if<00:05:38.620> you

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
that's going to break the game so if you

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.870 
that's going to break the game so if you
see<00:05:38.860> that<00:05:39.009> guy<00:05:39.130> that's<00:05:39.340> using<00:05:39.580> attack<00:05:39.790> to

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
see that guy that's using attack to

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.210 
see that guy that's using attack to
insertion<00:05:40.150> you're<00:05:40.990> actually<00:05:41.199> able<00:05:41.560> to<00:05:41.830> go<00:05:42.130> up

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
insertion you're actually able to go up

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.040 
insertion you're actually able to go up
and<00:05:42.340> break<00:05:42.550> it<00:05:42.729> shoot<00:05:43.360> it<00:05:43.509> you<00:05:43.660> can<00:05:43.780> make<00:05:43.960> it

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
and break it shoot it you can make it

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.469 
and break it shoot it you can make it
blow<00:05:44.169> up<00:05:44.229> or<00:05:44.979> you<00:05:45.130> can<00:05:45.280> wait<00:05:45.520> behind<00:05:45.729> it<00:05:46.090> which
