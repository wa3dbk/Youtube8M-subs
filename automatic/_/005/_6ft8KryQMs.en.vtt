00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.010
 let's learn to easily find the 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.020
 plant the elevation and the profile of a 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.410
 piece seen in perspective 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.630
 in this case isometric 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.119
 let's start with a cube with the three 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.160
 numbered visible faces if we look at the 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.789
 cube from above we will see a square 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.919
 with number one 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.919
 we extract this orthogonal projection 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.840
 if we look at the cube on the right side 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.090
 we will see a square with the number 2 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.370
 we extract this view too 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.830
 finally if we look from the left 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.700
 we'll see a square with the number 3 that 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.770
 we will extract also 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.290
 well we have already extracted the three views 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.660
 main of the piece below 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:01.860
 we are going to project them in the background behind 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.860
 the piece the movement would be 1 plant 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.710
 2 raised in correspondence with the 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.200
 plant and finally 3 the profile in 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.420
 correspondence with the elevation we already know 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.820
 what are the plant the elevation and the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.430
 profile now let's see how and where it 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.320
 place each one for this we draw the 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.350
 tri edro on which we have projected 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.899
 the views of the solid below 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.450
 let's extract the piece we're going to 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.420
 imagine that we cut the right axis of the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.369
 tri edro and that the faces inferior and 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.340
 right they fold until they are placed 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.369
 parallel to the upper left 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.549
 if we face this plane 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:46.899
 we can see correctly located the 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.899
 cube views 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.290
 the one below is always the plant 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.229
 the one on the plant will always be 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.810
 launched and the one on one side of the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.650
 raised in this case to the right will be the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.030
 profile plant elevation and profile but it is not 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.070
 the only way you can 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.259
 place the views if we go back to 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.170
 hatchery and in this case we cut the axis 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.900
 left the lower and left sides 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.420
 they will fold until they line up with the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.120
 right if we stand in front of this 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.040
 we will see a new arrangement so 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.500
 correct as the previous the plant 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.180
 located below and rotated with respect to 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.120
 previous 90 degrees in sense 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.420
 counter-clockwise the elevation that in this case 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.680
 is the number 3 and the profile that in this 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.680
 case is located on the left 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.770
 next we are going to repeat all the 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.540
 operation but in this case with the 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.180
 solid that really object of the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.620
 exercise we look from above and 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.620
 we extract the view 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.600
 the right 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.650
 at the right sight 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.010
 and finally we look from the left 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.010
 of the solid 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.910
 we project the views to the bottom 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.070
 we see the movement of raised plant 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.810
 in correspondence with the plant 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.340
 and profile in correspondence with the anza 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.140
 we will draw now the tri hetero of the 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.140
 seen and we already removed the solid 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.349
 we cut the tri ebro below by 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.349
 the right axis 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.519
 we unfold the faces 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.590
 and when we stand in front of the plane we see the 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.830
 downstairs 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.120
 launched on the plant and the profile in 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.120
 this case to the dra 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.520
 If the previous tri- rio we cut it by 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.520
 the left axis 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.760
 we will unfold the faces 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.790
 by placing ourselves in front of them we would see 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.289
 the plant in this case is rotated to 90 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.600
 degrees 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:38.900
 it would be in the bottom part on the right 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.790
 the elevation is the previous profile and 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.270
 vice versa the profile is the previous 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.270
 raised
