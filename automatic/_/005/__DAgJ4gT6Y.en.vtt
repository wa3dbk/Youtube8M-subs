got<00:00:26.790> one<00:00:26.940> when<00:00:27.450> we<00:00:27.540> went<00:00:27.720> down<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.080> movie

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380

got one when we went down to the movie
at<00:00:28.530> this<00:00:28.650> time<00:00:28.950> it<00:00:29.670> was<00:00:30.240> early<00:00:30.540> wasn't<00:00:30.810> for<00:00:30.900> a

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
at this time it was early wasn't for a

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.779 
at this time it was early wasn't for a
record<00:00:31.290> attempt<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:31.860> had<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.129> find<00:00:32.369> our<00:00:32.550> feet

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:32.789 
record attempt we had to find our feet

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:34.250 
record attempt we had to find our feet
it<00:00:32.940> was<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.089> brand-new<00:00:33.510> boat<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.050> very

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
it was a brand-new boat in a very

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.000 
it was a brand-new boat in a very
innovative<00:00:34.500> vote<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:36.230> we<00:00:37.230> really<00:00:37.859> had<00:00:37.980> to

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
innovative vote and we really had to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.729 
innovative vote and we really had to
learn<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.280> walk<00:00:38.429> again<00:00:38.609> and<00:00:39.230> from<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.320> design

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
learn to walk again and from a design

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.520 
learn to walk again and from a design
perspective<00:00:41.179> you<00:00:42.179> can<00:00:42.390> design<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.780> theorize

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
perspective you can design a theorize

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.259 
perspective you can design a theorize
and<00:00:43.859> do<00:00:43.949> all<00:00:44.129> your<00:00:44.160> computer<00:00:44.730> modelling<00:00:45.120> you

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
and do all your computer modelling you

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.180 
and do all your computer modelling you
like<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:46.050> until<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.409> actually<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.739> things

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
like but until you actually see things

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.919 
like but until you actually see things
happen<00:00:47.519> for<00:00:47.730> real<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> flesh<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.749> don't

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
happen for real in the flesh you don't

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.689 
happen for real in the flesh you don't
feel<00:00:49.199> you<00:00:49.469> really<00:00:49.800> understand<00:00:50.249> the<00:00:50.370> nature<00:00:50.489> of

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
feel you really understand the nature of

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.779 
feel you really understand the nature of
the<00:00:50.879> problem<00:00:51.679> because<00:00:52.679> every<00:00:52.980> 10<00:00:53.190> knots<00:00:53.429> is<00:00:53.579> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the problem because every 10 knots is a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.229 
the problem because every 10 knots is a
significant<00:00:54.600> stepping<00:00:54.989> stone<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:56.239> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
significant stepping stone and you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.329 
significant stepping stone and you
always<00:00:57.480> find<00:00:57.960> something<00:00:58.289> new<00:00:58.440> first<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.129> see

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
always find something new first you see

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:00.979 
always find something new first you see
if<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.819> over<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> low<00:01:00.300> speed<00:01:00.690> hump

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
if you can get over the low speed hump

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.799 
if you can get over the low speed hump
and<00:01:01.199> get<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> boat<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.159> and<00:01:02.399> planning<00:01:02.879> next

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
and get the boat up and planning next

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.040 
and get the boat up and planning next
you<00:01:04.680> go<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:06.120> know<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.270> start<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> see<00:01:06.900> how

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
you go and you know you start to see how

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.810 
you go and you know you start to see how
the<00:01:07.110> boat<00:01:07.380> starts<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.950> behave<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.670> goes

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the boat starts to behave as it goes

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.970 
the boat starts to behave as it goes
faster<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.600> see<00:01:09.750> if<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.350> start<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.860> learn

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
faster and see if it and start to learn

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.670 
faster and see if it and start to learn
about<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> transition<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.480> makes<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
about the transition that makes as it

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.090 
about the transition that makes as it
goes<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.280> 20<00:01:14.670> 30<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.210> 40<00:01:15.570> nights<00:01:15.780> I'm<00:01:16.770> pretty

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
goes to 20 30 and 40 nights I'm pretty

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.130 
goes to 20 30 and 40 nights I'm pretty
sure<00:01:17.370> that<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.700> boat<00:01:17.940> we've<00:01:18.120> got<00:01:18.300> here<00:01:18.570> once

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
sure that this boat we've got here once

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.310 
sure that this boat we've got here once
it's<00:01:19.350> doing<00:01:19.710> 50<00:01:20.460> knots<00:01:20.640> will<00:01:20.910> go<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.540> 60

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
it's doing 50 knots will go on and do 60

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.470 
it's doing 50 knots will go on and do 60
knots<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.740> perhaps<00:01:22.860> above<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.940> boat<00:01:24.120> is<00:01:24.240> very

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
knots and perhaps above the boat is very

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.360 
knots and perhaps above the boat is very
awkward<00:01:24.660> at<00:01:24.960> low<00:01:25.110> speed<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.680> found<00:01:25.980> that<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.190> lot

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
awkward at low speed we found that a lot

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.600 
awkward at low speed we found that a lot
of<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.580> systems<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.650> that<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.800> built<00:01:29.160> into<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
of the systems we that we built into the

of the systems we that we built into the
boat<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.090> help<00:01:30.300> us<00:01:30.420> get<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.870> from<00:01:31.260> from

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
boat to help us get going from from

boat to help us get going from from
stationary<00:01:32.070> weren't<00:01:32.520> actually<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.150> be

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
stationary weren't actually going to be

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.730 
stationary weren't actually going to be
necessary<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.110> could<00:01:34.230> dump<00:01:34.410> a<00:01:34.530> lot<00:01:34.650> of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
necessary so we could dump a lot of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.530 
necessary so we could dump a lot of
weight<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:34.950> complication<00:01:35.760> on<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.450> other

weight and complication on the other
hand<00:01:36.660> we<00:01:37.080> used<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.500> couple<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.860> those<00:01:38.010> are

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
hand we used a couple of those are

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.760 
hand we used a couple of those are
designs<00:01:39.510> that<00:01:39.660> we<00:01:39.810> built<00:01:40.050> in<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.470> actually

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
designs that we built in to actually

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.530 
designs that we built in to actually
help<00:01:41.220> us<00:01:41.400> get<00:01:41.610> started<00:01:41.760> and<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.240> made<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> big

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
help us get started and they made a big

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.160 
help us get started and they made a big
difference<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.800> boat<00:01:44.010> went<00:01:44.340> from<00:01:45.120> a<00:01:45.690> peak

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
difference the boat went from a peak

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.130

the real secret though is how we're
going<00:01:56.970> to<00:01:57.030> use<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.480> how<00:01:58.020> we're<00:01:58.170> going<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.320> get

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
going to use this how we're going to get

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.130 
going to use this how we're going to get
this<00:01:58.710> wedge<00:01:59.010> foil<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.940> work<00:02:00.120> this<00:02:00.570> foil<00:02:00.870> that's

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
this wedge foil to work this foil that's

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.640 
this wedge foil to work this foil that's
designed<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.650> work<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.610> ventilated<00:02:02.910> mouth

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
designed to work in a ventilated mouth

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.800 
designed to work in a ventilated mouth
first<00:02:04.650> time<00:02:04.980> I<00:02:05.280> use<00:02:05.550> that<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.090> was<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.660> same

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
first time I use that that was the same

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.619 
first time I use that that was the same
day<00:02:06.870> we<00:02:07.050> did<00:02:07.290> 40<00:02:07.650> knots<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.119> we<00:02:09.119> straight<00:02:09.450> away

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
day we did 40 knots and we straight away

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.309 
day we did 40 knots and we straight away
took<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.899> other<00:02:10.439> for<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.769> lot

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
took the other for a lot

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.720 
took the other for a lot
be<00:02:11.379> confident<00:02:11.739> we<00:02:11.890> could<00:02:12.010> get<00:02:12.129> that<00:02:12.310> boat<00:02:12.549> up

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
be confident we could get that boat up

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.089 
be confident we could get that boat up
over<00:02:13.030> 50<00:02:13.329> knots<00:02:13.540> quite<00:02:13.810> quickly<00:02:14.079> but<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:14.920> real

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
over 50 knots quite quickly but the real

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.190 
over 50 knots quite quickly but the real
issue<00:02:15.129> making<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.150> are<00:02:16.389> ventilated<00:02:16.930> is

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
issue making this are ventilated is

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.770 
issue making this are ventilated is
wedge-shaped<00:02:17.489> for<00:02:18.489> work<00:02:18.849> was<00:02:19.420> what<00:02:19.599> we<00:02:19.719> were

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
wedge-shaped for work was what we were

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.720 
wedge-shaped for work was what we were
really<00:02:19.840> down<00:02:20.319> there<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.739> see<00:02:20.920> what<00:02:21.249> the<00:02:21.579> new

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
really down there to see what the new

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.050 
really down there to see what the new
boats<00:02:21.969> all<00:02:22.209> about<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:24.069> first<00:02:24.249> time<00:02:24.549> I<00:02:24.849> took

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
boats all about so the first time I took

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.410 
boats all about so the first time I took
it<00:02:25.329> out<00:02:25.420> onto<00:02:25.599> the<00:02:25.810> course<00:02:26.700> surprisingly<00:02:27.700> she

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
it out onto the course surprisingly she

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.360 
it out onto the course surprisingly she
got<00:02:28.599> up<00:02:28.750> over<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.379> over<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.650> first<00:02:29.950> hump<00:02:30.219> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
got up over the over the first hump the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.309 
got up over the over the first hump the
boat<00:02:30.549> got<00:02:30.730> up<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.030> planing<00:02:31.480> there's<00:02:32.049> a<00:02:32.139> God<00:02:32.290> in

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
boat got up and planing there's a God in

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.080 
boat got up and planing there's a God in
college<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.829> beach<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.250> turned<00:02:33.489> away<00:02:33.670> and

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
college to the beach I turned away and

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.869 
college to the beach I turned away and
pointed<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:34.870> down<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.260> course<00:02:35.790> even<00:02:36.790> this

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
pointed it down the course even this

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.789 
pointed it down the course even this
boat<00:02:37.120> behind<00:02:37.329> me<00:02:37.750> at<00:02:37.989> this<00:02:38.109> stage<00:02:38.409> would<00:02:38.650> be

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
boat behind me at this stage would be

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.709 
boat behind me at this stage would be
doing<00:02:39.010> 50<00:02:39.430> knots<00:02:39.639> in<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:39.939> wind<00:02:40.150> we<00:02:40.269> were<00:02:40.419> doing

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:40.719 
doing 50 knots in the wind we were doing

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.440 
doing 50 knots in the wind we were doing
and<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:42.040> with<00:02:42.189> that<00:02:42.340> foil<00:02:42.669> it<00:02:42.969> felt<00:02:43.209> like<00:02:43.329> I

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
and but with that foil it felt like I

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.449 
and but with that foil it felt like I
just<00:02:43.659> drove<00:02:43.870> into<00:02:44.109> sand<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.889> whole<00:02:45.040> boat<00:02:45.250> just

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
just drove into sand the whole boat just

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.220 
just drove into sand the whole boat just
dragged<00:02:45.790> along<00:02:46.000> dragged<00:02:46.810> along<00:02:46.930> and

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
dragged along dragged along and

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.580 
dragged along dragged along and
eventually<00:02:48.120> slow<00:02:49.120> slowed<00:02:49.599> right<00:02:49.870> down<00:02:49.930> as<00:02:50.349> far

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
eventually slow slowed right down as far

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.009 
eventually slow slowed right down as far
as<00:02:50.680> dragging<00:02:51.099> a<00:02:51.159> drogue<00:02:51.459> at<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.299> back<00:02:52.480> and

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
as dragging a drogue at the back and

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.179 
as dragging a drogue at the back and
came<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.530> stop<00:02:53.859> so<00:02:55.650> basically<00:02:56.650> we<00:02:56.889> had<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.069> go

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
came to a stop so basically we had to go

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.330 
came to a stop so basically we had to go
back<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.430> scratch<00:02:57.849> our<00:02:58.120> heads<00:02:58.299> again<00:02:58.599> and<00:02:59.340> we

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
back and scratch our heads again and we

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.009 
back and scratch our heads again and we
didn't<00:03:00.549> get<00:03:00.669> many<00:03:00.819> other<00:03:01.060> chances<00:03:01.359> due<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.930> the

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
didn't get many other chances due to the

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.709 
didn't get many other chances due to the
weather<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.680> take<00:03:03.129> that<00:03:03.340> foil<00:03:04.150> out<00:03:04.299> and<00:03:04.569> give

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:04.719 
weather to take that foil out and give

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.599 
weather to take that foil out and give
it<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.900> really<00:03:05.079> good<00:03:05.349> shot<00:03:05.620> we<00:03:06.069> saw<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.549> the

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
it a really good shot we saw that the

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.659 
it a really good shot we saw that the
boat<00:03:06.909> is<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.209> fantastic<00:03:07.959> platform<00:03:08.579> it's<00:03:09.579> a
