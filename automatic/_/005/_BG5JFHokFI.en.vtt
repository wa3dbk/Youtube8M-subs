00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.500
 rich welcome a better day 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.650
 in today's video I 'll show you how 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.150
 I used the dry shampoo worth 6 many 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.359
 the ones that you asked me and that 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.699
 although I write it to you because I think that 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.650
 it is very clear in the explanation like this 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.029
 that I have decided that as well as I now 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.669
 same I have to apply it because I 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.890
 I'm going to work because that's how I teach you in 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.989
 I live and live so nothing 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.579
 let's start to start talking a 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.230
 little bit of the dry shampoo right now 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.239
 the one I'm using is this one 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.220
 batista you can get in makeup 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.440
 already and I have been told that in fine 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.240
 they sell it but I have never seen it 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.700
 this is cherry and I like it 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.980
 very much the dry shampoo let's see the 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.380
 dry shampoo because logically you have to 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.320
 think not wash your hair or it is not 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.180
 to replace the usual shampoo that 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.850
 we use wet under the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.640
 shower let's say this saves our hair 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.260
 one day better, I usually clean myself 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.500
 clean that I can take it loose I 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.110
 Hard perfect two days is my third day 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.720
 of hair and how I do not like to wash it in 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.920
 Excess me third day I make myself a bun 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.710
 or a pigtail 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.880
 so what do we do with the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.100
 dry shampoo 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.220
 make hair hold a little bit 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.799
 cleanest say that in my case I 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.810
 He reached out one day so I'm going to teach 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.729
 how do I apply it, it does not mean 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.009
 that this is the way of application 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.430
 correct is simply the way in the 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.530
 I use it and it works well for me 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.289
 tell you that also that I am good I am 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.840
 and I also do so blond streaks 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.140
 I do not notice so much about the subject 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.020
 of the white powder is worth what you are 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.119
 brunettes I know there are shampoos 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.819
 you battiste for example that are focused 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.770
 for brown hair and for brown hair not 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.080
 I've tried it because I do not need it 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.509
 I intuit that simply the powder 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.060
 Taquito will be a little less white 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.549
 Now you will see what I tell you about the powder 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.369
 it's worth it I do not know what it takes but 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.259
 I can intuit that what is inside is 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.450
 a powdered talc species that 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.310
 apply it on the root absorbs the 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.040
 Greasy is worth because in the past I know 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.319
 that my mother and her sisters do that 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.010
 they did it in put talcum to hold 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.379
 more clean hair then shape of 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.030
 apply them I recommend that you are 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.999
 all the time waving it's worth it because 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.139
 when it does not shake it jce leaves a jet 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.139
 huge white then 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.980
 apply it from far away and also not 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.790
 we make it worth just go a little bit to 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.380
 little bit 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.480
 me in my case what I'm going to do next 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.430
 is to make a bow so I do not 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.830
 I need to apply myself all over my head 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.530
 it is simply the areas that are most 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.380
 come and as you see all the time I'm going 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.770
 I'm shaking and I'm also massaging it 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.470
 little bit in this way you will do that 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.209
 is too white because if not 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.950
 you do all the time shaking it stays 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.950
 very white and also 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.560
 us in each case but it leaves us 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.780
 a frank a huge fringe is worth it 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.040
 that basically I applied it for 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.209
 areas that are more visible 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.209
 a little bit of work 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:34.140
 but here I am also remembering 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.850
 a lot of my partner redhead maria 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.450
 I told him I was going to make this video 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.730
 he said yes to me so from here I'm going 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.300
 to send a kiss not to my barbie 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.300
 redhead 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.329
 well I think that it would be worth what 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.790
 it is the greasers already been absorbed and 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.200
 now a trick that I do that I do not know if 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.900
 is trick or not but good is what I 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.060
 I do is that with the dryer I remove a 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.769
 little the valÃ¨ncia product we have 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.799
 massaged a little bit to absorb 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.569
 well the fat we have with the 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.299
 dryer can be me what am I going to put on 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.829
 cold because thus no deterioration both 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.319
 hair and also right now I do not need it 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.719
 in case you wanted to be molded because 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.269
 sometimes that I maybe 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:18.349
 I simply mold my bangs 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.789
 so then it would heat 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.789
 to give it shape 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.000
 and basically what I do is 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.860
 remove the excess white powder as well 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.070
 that nothing in my case simply because 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.590
 would be to make my bow 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.470
 And that's it, I would make my little bun you have in 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.630
 my channel on the playlist of 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.190
 hair you have how I do it 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.260
 every way I would try to remember 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.690
 leave it in the information box and 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.220
