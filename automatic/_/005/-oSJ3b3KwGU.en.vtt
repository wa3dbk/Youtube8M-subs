00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.389 

hey<00:00:00.630> everyone<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.290> wanted<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:01.979> talk<00:00:02.129> about<00:00:02.159> a

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hey everyone I wanted to talk about a

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.670 
hey everyone I wanted to talk about a
technique<00:00:02.639> called<00:00:02.879> vacuum<00:00:03.419> frying<00:00:03.990> today

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
technique called vacuum frying today

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.280 
technique called vacuum frying today
so<00:00:05.310> traditionally<00:00:05.910> frying<00:00:06.270> deep<00:00:06.690> fat<00:00:06.960> frying

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
so traditionally frying deep fat frying

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.080 
so traditionally frying deep fat frying
is<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.560> technique<00:00:08.010> where<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:08.580> put<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.880> food

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
is a technique where we put the food

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.749 
is a technique where we put the food
into<00:00:09.420> hot<00:00:09.630> oil<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.290> remove<00:00:11.280> some<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.580> the

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
into hot oil and remove some of the

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.430 
into hot oil and remove some of the
water<00:00:11.910> from<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.420> food<00:00:12.599> at<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.960> same<00:00:13.170> time

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
water from the food at the same time

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.200 
water from the food at the same time
replacing<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:14.099> portion<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.030> hot

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
replacing a portion of it with the hot

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.330 
replacing a portion of it with the hot
oil<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.809> while<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.619> all<00:00:16.770> going<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
oil and while this is all going on the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.939 
oil and while this is all going on the
heat<00:00:17.550> from<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.910> oil<00:00:18.029> also<00:00:18.330> cooks<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.990> food<00:00:19.170> so

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
heat from the oil also cooks the food so

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.800 
heat from the oil also cooks the food so
we<00:00:20.039> have<00:00:20.220> both<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.609> cooking<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.180> sort<00:00:21.779> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
we have both a cooking and sort of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.509 
we have both a cooking and sort of
another<00:00:22.020> alteration<00:00:22.590> going<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.250> with<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
another alteration going on with the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.029 
another alteration going on with the
food<00:00:23.869> however<00:00:24.869> if<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.199> ever<00:00:25.380> wanted<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> fry

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
food however if you ever wanted to fry

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.769 
food however if you ever wanted to fry
something<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> fruit<00:00:27.090> or<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.359> vegetable

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
something like a fruit or a vegetable

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.929 
something like a fruit or a vegetable
the<00:00:28.680> problem<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.369> there's<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> lot<00:00:29.820> of

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
the problem is that there's a lot of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.930 
the problem is that there's a lot of
water<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.539> item<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.320> at<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.669> temperature

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
water in that item and at a temperature

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.600 
water in that item and at a temperature
high<00:00:33.450> enough<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.930> cause<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.530> water<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.010> boil

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
high enough to cause the water to boil

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.119 
high enough to cause the water to boil
away<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.690> outside<00:00:37.110> would<00:00:37.260> become<00:00:37.590> scorched

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
away the outside would become scorched

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.540 
away the outside would become scorched
and<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.640> inside<00:00:38.940> would<00:00:39.149> still<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.570> too<00:00:40.140> moist

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
and the inside would still be too moist

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.459 
and the inside would still be too moist
so<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> vacuum<00:00:41.910> frying<00:00:42.420> technique<00:00:42.719> allows<00:00:43.260> us

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
so the vacuum frying technique allows us

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.799 
so the vacuum frying technique allows us
to<00:00:43.649> change<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.219> boiling<00:00:44.579> point<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.059> water<00:00:45.120> by

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
to change the boiling point of water by

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.810 
to change the boiling point of water by
lowering<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.379> pressure<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> pot<00:00:47.250> just

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
lowering the pressure in the pot just

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.400 
lowering the pressure in the pot just
like<00:00:47.940> high-altitude<00:00:48.420> cooking<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.230> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
like high-altitude cooking you have to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.369 
like high-altitude cooking you have to
adjust<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.149> cooking<00:00:51.149> time<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.809> compensate

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
adjust the cooking time to compensate

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.040 
adjust the cooking time to compensate
for<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> atmosphere<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.510> here's<00:00:54.719> three

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
for the atmosphere so here's three

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.990 
for the atmosphere so here's three
batches<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.710> fried<00:00:56.010> bananas<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.760> just

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
batches of fried bananas that I just

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.180 
batches of fried bananas that I just
made<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> vacuum<00:00:58.649> fried

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
made and this is the vacuum fried

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.819 
made and this is the vacuum fried
bananas<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.079> bananas<00:01:01.079> fried<00:01:01.320> at<00:01:01.500> normal

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
bananas the bananas fried at normal

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.770 
bananas the bananas fried at normal
atmospheric<00:01:01.920> pressure<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.600> also

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
atmospheric pressure and then also

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.710 
atmospheric pressure and then also
bananas<00:01:04.379> fried<00:01:04.710> under<00:01:05.189> higher<00:01:05.610> pressure<00:01:06.060> so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
bananas fried under higher pressure so

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.480 
bananas fried under higher pressure so
with<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> same<00:01:07.200> setup<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:08.070> built<00:01:08.310> I

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
with the same setup that I just built I

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.630 
with the same setup that I just built I
can<00:01:08.640> also<00:01:08.760> fry<00:01:09.180> things<00:01:09.479> under<00:01:09.900> pressure<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
can also fry things under pressure and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.100 
can also fry things under pressure and
that<00:01:11.640> technique<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.240> actually<00:01:12.600> used<00:01:12.810> in

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
that technique is actually used in

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.780 
that technique is actually used in
fast-food<00:01:13.860> restaurants<00:01:14.369> for<00:01:14.490> fried<00:01:14.760> chicken

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
fast-food restaurants for fried chicken

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.060 
fast-food restaurants for fried chicken
and<00:01:15.390> I'll<00:01:15.840> talk<00:01:16.020> about<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.350> reasons<00:01:16.650> why<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.979> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and I'll talk about the reasons why in a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.539 
and I'll talk about the reasons why in a
minute<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> vacuum<00:01:18.960> fried<00:01:19.439> bananas<00:01:20.310> are

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
minute so the vacuum fried bananas are

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.170 
minute so the vacuum fried bananas are
fairly<00:01:21.030> stiff<00:01:22.310> they<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> nice<00:01:23.670> crispy

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
fairly stiff they have a nice crispy

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.899 
fairly stiff they have a nice crispy
outside<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.990> if<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:25.799> cut<00:01:26.040> one<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.310> half<00:01:26.340> it's

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
outside and if we cut one in half it's

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.480 
outside and if we cut one in half it's
actually<00:01:27.360> fairly<00:01:27.920> firm<00:01:28.920> all<00:01:29.159> throughout

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
actually fairly firm all throughout

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.179 
actually fairly firm all throughout
although<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> inside<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.540> moist<00:01:31.009> however<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
although the inside is moist however the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.069 
although the inside is moist however the
normal<00:01:32.400> fried<00:01:32.790> bananas<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> very<00:01:33.810> very

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
normal fried bananas have a very very

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.749 
normal fried bananas have a very very
thin<00:01:34.409> skin<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.130> outside<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.700> are

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
thin skin on the outside and are

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.260 
thin skin on the outside and are
actually<00:01:36.090> fairly<00:01:36.420> soft<00:01:36.869> throughout<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.270> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
actually fairly soft throughout and the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.030 
actually fairly soft throughout and the
pressure<00:01:39.540> fried<00:01:39.960> bananas<00:01:40.409> are<00:01:40.530> extremely

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
pressure fried bananas are extremely

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.530 
pressure fried bananas are extremely
crisp<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.549> outside<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.270> are<00:01:42.390> also

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
crisp on the outside but are also

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
crisp on the outside but are also
surprisingly<00:01:42.960> soft<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.340> inside<00:01:45.439> so<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
surprisingly soft on the inside so the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.319 
surprisingly soft on the inside so the
vacuum<00:01:46.770> fried<00:01:47.220> bananas<00:01:47.700> were<00:01:47.880> cooked<00:01:48.180> at<00:01:48.299> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
vacuum fried bananas were cooked at a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.270 
vacuum fried bananas were cooked at a
lower<00:01:48.630> temperature<00:01:48.899> than<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.470> atmospheric

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
lower temperature than the atmospheric

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280 
lower temperature than the atmospheric
fried<00:01:50.820> bananas<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.570> was<00:01:51.689> also<00:01:51.869> still<00:01:52.259> a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
fried bananas and that was also still a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.600 
fried bananas and that was also still a
lower<00:01:52.530> temperature<00:01:52.950> than<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.340> pressure

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
lower temperature than the pressure

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.700 
lower temperature than the pressure
fried<00:01:54.030> bananas<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.259> might<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.530> saying

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
fried bananas so you might be saying

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.109 
fried bananas so you might be saying
well<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.009> not<00:01:56.100> surprising<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:56.939> is

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
well it's not surprising that this is

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.120 
well it's not surprising that this is
more<00:01:57.360> cooked<00:01:57.780> almost<00:01:58.140> burned<00:01:58.439> up<00:01:58.740> here

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
more cooked almost burned up here

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.590 
more cooked almost burned up here
because<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> temperature<00:02:00.180> was<00:02:00.329> higher

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
because the temperature was higher

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.660 
because the temperature was higher
however<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.979> point<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.460> whole

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
however that is the point of this whole

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.510 
however that is the point of this whole
process<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.259> vacuum<00:02:04.259> frying<00:02:04.619> allows<00:02:05.009> us<00:02:05.310> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
process the vacuum frying allows us to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.999 
process the vacuum frying allows us to
do<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.820> oil<00:02:06.149> water<00:02:06.509> exchange<00:02:06.899> at<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.500> lower

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
do this oil water exchange at a lower

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.010 
do this oil water exchange at a lower
temperature<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.270> don't<00:02:09.450> actually<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:09.810> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
temperature so we don't actually have to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.380 
temperature so we don't actually have to
cook<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.410> fruit<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:11.160> can<00:02:11.340> keep<00:02:11.550> it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
cook the fruit we can keep it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.420 
cook the fruit we can keep it
losing<00:02:12.840> all<00:02:12.960> of<00:02:13.140> its<00:02:13.290> flavor<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:14.010> mean<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.340> has

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
losing all of its flavor I mean it has

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.030 
losing all of its flavor I mean it has
an<00:02:14.550> uncooked<00:02:14.940> flavor<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.980> we<00:02:16.980> don't

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
an uncooked flavor to it and we don't

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.320 
an uncooked flavor to it and we don't
have<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.340> brown<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.610> we<00:02:17.819> don't<00:02:17.970> have<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.150> cook

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
have to brown it we don't have to cook

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.080 
have to brown it we don't have to cook
it<00:02:18.420> like<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.520> vacuum<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.880> fried

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
it like that so the vacuum of fried

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.730 
it like that so the vacuum of fried
bananas<00:02:21.480> have<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.660> really<00:02:21.990> nice<00:02:22.140> crunch<00:02:22.500> to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
bananas have a really nice crunch to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.130 
bananas have a really nice crunch to
them<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:23.910> by<00:02:24.150> far<00:02:24.360> my<00:02:24.420> favorite<00:02:24.990> out<00:02:25.110> of

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
them this is by far my favorite out of

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.710 
them this is by far my favorite out of
the<00:02:25.290> three<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:26.430> normal<00:02:26.940> fried<00:02:27.150> bananas<00:02:27.600> are<00:02:27.690> a

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
the three the normal fried bananas are a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.830 
the three the normal fried bananas are a
little<00:02:27.870> soft<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.590> little<00:02:29.370> squishy<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.000> these

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
little soft a little squishy and these

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.290 
little soft a little squishy and these
have<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.080> nice<00:02:31.260> crispy<00:02:31.770> outside<00:02:31.980> but<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:33.060> taste

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
have a nice crispy outside but the taste

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.510 
have a nice crispy outside but the taste
is<00:02:33.540> kind<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.990> burnt<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.530> mean<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.920> does<00:02:35.070> taste<00:02:35.370> a

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
is kind of burnt I mean it does taste a

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.980 
is kind of burnt I mean it does taste a
bit<00:02:35.640> like<00:02:35.790> charcoal<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:36.390> that's<00:02:36.540> kind<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.810> too

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
bit like charcoal so that's kind of too

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.979 
bit like charcoal so that's kind of too
much<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:38.340> here's<00:02:38.610> how<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.730> did<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.239> started

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
much so here's how I did it I started

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.449 
much so here's how I did it I started
with<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.140> commercial<00:02:40.680> stainless<00:02:41.220> steel

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
with a commercial stainless steel

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.160 
with a commercial stainless steel
pressure<00:02:41.819> cooker<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.450> bought<00:02:42.720> at<00:02:42.930> Bed

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
pressure cooker that I bought at Bed

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.620 
pressure cooker that I bought at Bed
Bath<00:02:43.200> &amp;<00:02:43.560> Beyond<00:02:43.830> today<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.370> removed<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.300> handle

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
Bath &amp; Beyond today I removed the handle

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.030 
Bath &amp; Beyond today I removed the handle
from<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.959> lid<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.260> all<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.620> safety<00:02:46.860> features

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
from the lid and all the safety features

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.460 
from the lid and all the safety features
and<00:02:47.610> noticed<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.660> had<00:02:48.690> two<00:02:49.170> holes

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
and noticed that it had two holes

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.100 
and noticed that it had two holes
already<00:02:49.860> drilled<00:02:50.010> for<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:51.269> pressure<00:02:51.720> relief

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
already drilled for the pressure relief

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
already drilled for the pressure relief
valve<00:02:52.410> in<00:02:52.650> like<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.950> normal<00:02:53.280> relief<00:02:53.610> valve<00:02:53.910> I

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
valve in like the normal relief valve I

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.229 
valve in like the normal relief valve I
loosely<00:02:56.130> screwed<00:02:56.459> in<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.670> couple<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.060> eighth

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
loosely screwed in a couple of eighth

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.350 
loosely screwed in a couple of eighth
inch<00:02:57.480> brass<00:02:58.019> pipe<00:02:58.380> fittings<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.130> then<00:02:59.910> silver

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
inch brass pipe fittings and then silver

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.729 
inch brass pipe fittings and then silver
soldered<00:03:00.750> them<00:03:00.840> on<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.170> other<00:03:01.320> side<00:03:01.470> I

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
soldered them on the other side I

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.750 
soldered them on the other side I
connected<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.830> chamber<00:03:05.190> up<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.430> my<00:03:05.550> vacuum

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
connected the chamber up to my vacuum

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.940 
connected the chamber up to my vacuum
pump<00:03:06.300> and<00:03:06.510> pumped<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.290> down<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.860> then

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
pump and pumped it down and then

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.400 
pump and pumped it down and then
realized<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.519> had<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> problem<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:09.810> seal<00:03:10.170> that

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
realized I had a problem the seal that

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.440 
realized I had a problem the seal that
comes<00:03:10.709> with<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.190> pressure<00:03:11.580> cooker<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.209> meant

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
comes with this pressure cooker is meant

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.860 
comes with this pressure cooker is meant
to<00:03:12.630> be<00:03:12.780> inflated<00:03:13.470> by<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.890> pressure<00:03:14.340> so<00:03:15.180> if<00:03:15.600> you

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
to be inflated by the pressure so if you

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.660 
to be inflated by the pressure so if you
try<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.110> pull<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.380> vacuum<00:03:16.650> inside<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.190> pot<00:03:17.459> like

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
try to pull a vacuum inside a pot like

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.729 
try to pull a vacuum inside a pot like
this<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:18.090> seal<00:03:18.329> actually<00:03:18.630> pulls<00:03:19.079> itself<00:03:19.470> in

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
this the seal actually pulls itself in

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.940 
this the seal actually pulls itself in
and<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.370> breaks<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.880> seal<00:03:21.320> so<00:03:22.320> I<00:03:22.350> took<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.739> piece

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
and it breaks the seal so I took a piece

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.610 
and it breaks the seal so I took a piece
of<00:03:23.100> stainless<00:03:23.430> steel<00:03:23.820> welding<00:03:24.720> rod<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.230> sort

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
of stainless steel welding rod and sort

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.699 
of stainless steel welding rod and sort
of<00:03:25.680> bent<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.040> into<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.370> circle<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.709> under

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
of bent it into a circle and under

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.440 
of bent it into a circle and under
spring<00:03:29.040> pressure<00:03:29.310> basically<00:03:29.820> put<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.090> inside

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
spring pressure basically put it inside

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.330 
spring pressure basically put it inside
the<00:03:30.690> seal<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.350> would<00:03:31.500> hold<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.860> seal<00:03:32.100> out

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
the seal so that would hold the seal out

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.789 
the seal so that would hold the seal out
to<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.670> outside<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.480> this<00:03:34.140> actually<00:03:34.590> worked

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
to the outside and this actually worked

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.520 
to the outside and this actually worked
just<00:03:35.100> fine<00:03:35.220> for<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.730> while<00:03:36.170> after<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.200> couple

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
just fine for a while after a couple

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.350 
just fine for a while after a couple
runs<00:03:37.769> there<00:03:38.040> was<00:03:38.130> enough<00:03:38.340> oil<00:03:38.610> kind<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.150> around

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
runs there was enough oil kind of around

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.479 
runs there was enough oil kind of around
the<00:03:39.540> lid<00:03:39.720> area<00:03:40.079> that<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.470> seal<00:03:40.950> was<00:03:41.220> still

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
the lid area that the seal was still

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.000 
the lid area that the seal was still
slippery<00:03:41.880> enough<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.630> pull<00:03:43.110> itself<00:03:43.470> in<00:03:43.739> when

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
slippery enough to pull itself in when

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.759 
slippery enough to pull itself in when
when<00:03:44.280> vacuum<00:03:44.670> was<00:03:44.790> applied<00:03:45.350> so<00:03:46.350> if<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.620> were

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
when vacuum was applied so if I were

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.920 
when vacuum was applied so if I were
going<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.190> keep<00:03:47.970> using<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.420> setup<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.810> would

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
going to keep using this setup I would

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.330 
going to keep using this setup I would
have<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.140> come<00:03:49.290> up<00:03:49.410> with<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.560> basic<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.920> stronger

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
have to come up with a basic a stronger

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.670 
have to come up with a basic a stronger
ring<00:03:50.640> maybe<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.299> continuous<00:03:51.930> ring<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.590> it

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
ring maybe a continuous ring so that it

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.600 
ring maybe a continuous ring so that it
won't<00:03:52.799> collapse<00:03:53.130> in<00:03:53.430> on<00:03:53.519> itself<00:03:53.579> I<00:03:55.519> added<00:03:56.519> a

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
won't collapse in on itself I added a

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.039 
won't collapse in on itself I added a
cold<00:03:56.850> trap<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.390> system<00:03:57.870> which<00:03:58.019> is

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
cold trap to the system which is

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.870 
cold trap to the system which is
basically<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.739> thermos<00:03:59.280> filled<00:03:59.579> with

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
basically a thermos filled with

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.990 
basically a thermos filled with
denatured<00:04:00.540> alcohol<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:01.290> dry<00:04:01.739> ice<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.430> the

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
denatured alcohol and dry ice and the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.850 
denatured alcohol and dry ice and the
idea<00:04:03.329> here<00:04:03.690> is<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:03.810> all<00:04:04.079> of<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.320> water<00:04:04.470> that

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
idea here is that all of the water that

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.560 
idea here is that all of the water that
we're<00:04:05.010> going<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.250> pull<00:04:05.549> out<00:04:05.730> of<00:04:05.760> those<00:04:06.000> bananas

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
we're going to pull out of those bananas

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.479 
we're going to pull out of those bananas
is<00:04:06.780> going<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.350> end<00:04:07.590> up<00:04:07.739> in<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:07.980> cold<00:04:08.190> trap

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
is going to end up in the cold trap

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.240 
is going to end up in the cold trap
instead<00:04:08.880> of<00:04:09.030> in<00:04:09.150> my<00:04:09.329> vacuum<00:04:09.570> pump<00:04:10.109> so<00:04:10.920> I<00:04:10.950> talked

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
instead of in my vacuum pump so I talked

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.560 
instead of in my vacuum pump so I talked
about<00:04:11.310> how<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.609> make<00:04:11.790> this<00:04:11.970> in<00:04:12.180> an<00:04:12.269> earlier

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
about how to make this in an earlier

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.599 
about how to make this in an earlier
video<00:04:12.780> in<00:04:13.079> fact<00:04:13.260> in<00:04:13.410> my<00:04:13.530> astronaut<00:04:14.430> ice<00:04:14.579> cream

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
video in fact in my astronaut ice cream

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.270 
video in fact in my astronaut ice cream
video<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:16.169> amount<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.530> water<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:16.950> fairly

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
video and the amount of water is fairly

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.190 
video and the amount of water is fairly
substantial<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.090> if<00:04:18.329> all<00:04:18.479> of<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.630> water<00:04:18.870> went

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
substantial so if all of that water went

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.589 
substantial so if all of that water went
into<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.500> vacuum<00:04:19.739> pump<00:04:20.160> it<00:04:20.820> would<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.510> know

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
into the vacuum pump it would you know

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.180 
into the vacuum pump it would you know
rust<00:04:21.870> up<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.320> if<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.470> was<00:04:22.590> enough<00:04:22.770> water<00:04:22.950> it

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
rust up and if it was enough water it

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.600 
rust up and if it was enough water it
might<00:04:23.280> actually<00:04:23.640> lock<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:23.970> pump<00:04:24.210> up

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
might actually lock the pump up

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.580 
might actually lock the pump up
I'm<00:04:26.610> using<00:04:26.880> an<00:04:27.120> induction<00:04:27.510> cooktop<00:04:27.930> which

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
I'm using an induction cooktop which

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.020 
I'm using an induction cooktop which
I'll<00:04:28.740> probably<00:04:28.890> take<00:04:29.310> apart<00:04:29.610> in<00:04:29.790> another

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
I'll probably take apart in another

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.520 
I'll probably take apart in another
video<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.690> see<00:04:30.840> how<00:04:30.960> it<00:04:31.080> works

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
video to see how it works

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.190 
video to see how it works
it<00:04:31.920> has<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.160> precision<00:04:33.000> temperature<00:04:33.420> control

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
it has a precision temperature control

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.870 
it has a precision temperature control
on<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.500> front<00:04:34.770> so<00:04:34.950> that<00:04:34.980> I<00:04:35.070> can<00:04:35.310> dial<00:04:35.580> in<00:04:35.760> the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
on the front so that I can dial in the

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.490 
on the front so that I can dial in the
temperature<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:36.360> I<00:04:36.510> want<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.930> pot<00:04:37.140> to<00:04:37.320> be

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
temperature that I want the pot to be

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.410 
temperature that I want the pot to be
and<00:04:37.740> that's<00:04:38.280> actually<00:04:38.670> very<00:04:38.850> close<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.330> the

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
and that's actually very close to the

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.030 
and that's actually very close to the
temperature<00:04:39.720> that<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.140> oil<00:04:40.320> is<00:04:40.560> in<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.770> pot

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
temperature that the oil is in the pot

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.040 
temperature that the oil is in the pot
I'm<00:04:41.340> kind<00:04:41.970> of<00:04:42.000> curious<00:04:42.240> how<00:04:42.510> it<00:04:42.660> knows<00:04:42.840> the

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
I'm kind of curious how it knows the

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.660 
I'm kind of curious how it knows the
exact<00:04:43.320> temperature<00:04:43.560> it<00:04:43.980> might<00:04:44.160> be<00:04:44.310> doing<00:04:44.490> a

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
exact temperature it might be doing a

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.640 
exact temperature it might be doing a
trick<00:04:44.940> with<00:04:45.420> the<00:04:45.570> actual<00:04:45.900> magnetics<00:04:46.500> to

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
trick with the actual magnetics to

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.430 
trick with the actual magnetics to
determine<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.160> temperature<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.760> the<00:04:47.880> steel

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
determine the temperature of the steel

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.750 
determine the temperature of the steel
however<00:04:49.440> think<00:04:49.770> it's<00:04:49.890> also<00:04:50.040> likely<00:04:50.610> that

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
however think it's also likely that

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.060 
however think it's also likely that
there's<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:51.000> temperature<00:04:51.510> sensor<00:04:51.930> just<00:04:52.230> in<00:04:52.410> the

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
there's a temperature sensor just in the

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.320 
there's a temperature sensor just in the
base<00:04:53.250> either<00:04:53.580> IR<00:04:54.060> or<00:04:54.090> just<00:04:54.570> contact<00:04:56.240> for<00:04:57.240> the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
base either IR or just contact for the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.360 
base either IR or just contact for the
vacuum<00:04:57.510> frying<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.230> got<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.560> oil<00:04:58.710> up<00:04:58.980> to<00:04:59.160> about

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
vacuum frying I got the oil up to about

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.360 
vacuum frying I got the oil up to about
110<00:05:00.120> degrees<00:05:00.150> C<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:01.080> then<00:05:01.650> loaded<00:05:01.980> the<00:05:02.070> banana

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
110 degrees C and then loaded the banana

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.850 
110 degrees C and then loaded the banana
slices<00:05:02.640> in<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.150> pot<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.630> put<00:05:04.140> the<00:05:04.260> lid<00:05:04.410> on<00:05:04.440> and

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
slices in the pot and put the lid on and

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.010 
slices in the pot and put the lid on and
pull<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.430> vacuum<00:05:05.880> as<00:05:06.120> well<00:05:06.180> as<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.810> vacuum

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
pull the vacuum as well as the vacuum

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.380 
pull the vacuum as well as the vacuum
pump<00:05:07.350> could<00:05:07.590> manage<00:05:07.950> so<00:05:08.730> I<00:05:08.760> think<00:05:08.910> in<00:05:09.270> the

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
pump could manage so I think in the

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.000 
pump could manage so I think in the
literature<00:05:09.660> there's<00:05:09.990> sometimes<00:05:10.230> specify<00:05:10.980> a

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
literature there's sometimes specify a

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.180 
literature there's sometimes specify a
very<00:05:11.310> low<00:05:11.520> pressure<00:05:12.200> that's<00:05:13.200> you<00:05:13.620> know<00:05:13.740> above

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
very low pressure that's you know above

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.770 
very low pressure that's you know above
what<00:05:14.460> a<00:05:14.490> vacuum<00:05:14.700> pump<00:05:15.090> can<00:05:15.300> make<00:05:15.480> to<00:05:15.630> there's

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
what a vacuum pump can make to there's

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.930 
what a vacuum pump can make to there's
some<00:05:15.960> regulation<00:05:16.530> going<00:05:16.770> on<00:05:17.010> but<00:05:17.700> in<00:05:17.790> my<00:05:17.880> case

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
some regulation going on but in my case

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.270 
some regulation going on but in my case
I<00:05:18.300> just<00:05:18.330> did<00:05:18.660> as<00:05:18.930> much<00:05:19.380> vacuum<00:05:19.680> as<00:05:19.950> the<00:05:20.040> pump

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
I just did as much vacuum as the pump

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.270 
I just did as much vacuum as the pump
could<00:05:20.430> handle<00:05:20.760> I<00:05:21.710> cooked<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.860> bananas<00:05:23.250> for

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
could handle I cooked the bananas for

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.760 
could handle I cooked the bananas for
about<00:05:23.580> 12<00:05:23.910> minutes<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.420> then<00:05:24.990> opens<00:05:25.440> the<00:05:25.530> pot

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
about 12 minutes and then opens the pot

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.480 
about 12 minutes and then opens the pot
up<00:05:25.950> and<00:05:26.100> took<00:05:26.280> them<00:05:26.460> out<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:28.890> atmosphere<00:05:29.040> at

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
up and took them out the atmosphere at

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.700 
up and took them out the atmosphere at
cooking<00:05:29.820> was<00:05:30.030> pretty<00:05:30.330> standard<00:05:30.630> I<00:05:31.020> raised<00:05:31.500> the

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
cooking was pretty standard I raised the

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.330 
cooking was pretty standard I raised the
oil<00:05:31.890> temperature<00:05:32.160> to<00:05:32.790> about<00:05:33.680> 170<00:05:34.680> degrees<00:05:34.710> C

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
oil temperature to about 170 degrees C

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.080 
oil temperature to about 170 degrees C
and<00:05:36.050> cooked<00:05:37.050> them<00:05:37.260> for<00:05:37.650> a<00:05:37.680> little<00:05:38.280> under<00:05:38.700> 10

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
and cooked them for a little under 10

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.060 
and cooked them for a little under 10
minutes<00:05:39.300> so<00:05:40.050> I<00:05:40.080> know<00:05:40.200> I'm<00:05:40.380> varying<00:05:40.980> the

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
minutes so I know I'm varying the

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.670 
minutes so I know I'm varying the
cooking<00:05:41.400> time<00:05:41.640> as<00:05:41.820> well<00:05:42.000> but<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.870> surface<00:05:43.380> had

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
cooking time as well but the surface had

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.650 
cooking time as well but the surface had
become<00:05:43.950> so<00:05:44.220> scorched<00:05:44.700> that<00:05:44.850> I<00:05:44.970> realized<00:05:45.420> that

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
become so scorched that I realized that

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.350 
become so scorched that I realized that
it<00:05:45.810> was<00:05:46.110> was<00:05:46.320> not<00:05:46.350> going<00:05:46.680> to<00:05:46.740> be<00:05:46.860> a<00:05:47.360> desirable

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
it was was not going to be a desirable

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.530 
it was was not going to be a desirable
thing<00:05:48.600> if<00:05:48.900> it<00:05:49.020> really<00:05:49.170> cooks<00:05:49.470> that<00:05:49.680> much<00:05:50.540> for

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
thing if it really cooks that much for

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.120 
thing if it really cooks that much for
the<00:05:51.630> pressure<00:05:51.870> cooking<00:05:52.230> I<00:05:52.440> changed<00:05:52.860> one<00:05:53.010> of

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
the pressure cooking I changed one of

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.340 
the pressure cooking I changed one of
the<00:05:53.220> fittings<00:05:53.580> on<00:05:53.790> the<00:05:53.940> lid<00:05:54.150> and<00:05:54.390> then<00:05:55.080> raised

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
the fittings on the lid and then raised

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.830 
the fittings on the lid and then raised
the<00:05:55.590> oil<00:05:55.770> temperature<00:05:56.040> to<00:05:56.520> about<00:05:56.610> 230<00:05:57.480> degrees

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
the oil temperature to about 230 degrees

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.890 
the oil temperature to about 230 degrees
C<00:05:58.140> and<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:59.100> idea<00:05:59.460> with<00:05:59.670> the<00:05:59.900> temperature

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
C and the idea with the temperature

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.840 
C and the idea with the temperature
changes<00:06:01.350> is<00:06:01.500> to<00:06:01.530> match<00:06:01.920> the<00:06:01.950> vapor<00:06:02.400> pressure

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
changes is to match the vapor pressure

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.330 
changes is to match the vapor pressure
of<00:06:03.000> the<00:06:03.150> water<00:06:03.270> in<00:06:03.720> the<00:06:03.810> food<00:06:04.020> so<00:06:04.920> with<00:06:05.190> the

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
of the water in the food so with the

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.130 
of the water in the food so with the
additional<00:06:05.760> pressure<00:06:06.120> in<00:06:06.390> the<00:06:06.510> chamber<00:06:06.720> I

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
additional pressure in the chamber I

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.170 
additional pressure in the chamber I
want<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:07.740> water<00:06:07.890> to<00:06:08.190> have<00:06:08.370> just<00:06:08.790> about<00:06:08.970> the

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
want the water to have just about the

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.950 
want the water to have just about the
same<00:06:10.160> propensity<00:06:11.160> to<00:06:11.550> leave<00:06:11.760> the<00:06:11.970> food<00:06:12.210> so

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
same propensity to leave the food so

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.050 
same propensity to leave the food so
that<00:06:12.990> temperature<00:06:13.350> change<00:06:14.000> corresponds<00:06:15.000> to

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
that temperature change corresponds to

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.320 
that temperature change corresponds to
the<00:06:15.240> pressure<00:06:15.510> change<00:06:15.990> in<00:06:16.940> theory<00:06:17.940> this<00:06:18.090> means

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
the pressure change in theory this means

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.910 
the pressure change in theory this means
that<00:06:18.540> the<00:06:18.660> food<00:06:18.870> would<00:06:19.020> be<00:06:19.080> equally<00:06:19.560> dried

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920 
that the food would be equally dried

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.520 
that the food would be equally dried
since<00:06:20.370> the<00:06:20.520> water<00:06:20.700> has<00:06:21.030> just<00:06:21.930> as<00:06:22.050> much<00:06:22.170> for

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
since the water has just as much for

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.260 
since the water has just as much for
reason<00:06:22.980> to<00:06:23.130> leave<00:06:23.280> the<00:06:23.520> food<00:06:23.730> with<00:06:24.120> these

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
reason to leave the food with these

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.780 
reason to leave the food with these
different<00:06:24.660> conditions<00:06:25.370> however<00:06:26.370> the<00:06:26.640> higher

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
different conditions however the higher

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.430 
different conditions however the higher
temperature<00:06:27.330> means<00:06:27.600> that<00:06:27.810> more<00:06:27.990> cooking

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
temperature means that more cooking

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.440 
temperature means that more cooking
process<00:06:29.040> will<00:06:29.250> happen<00:06:29.430> and<00:06:29.820> that's<00:06:30.210> exactly

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
process will happen and that's exactly

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.290 
process will happen and that's exactly
what<00:06:30.750> we<00:06:30.840> can<00:06:30.990> see<00:06:31.230> here<00:06:31.260> I<00:06:32.060> used<00:06:33.060> my

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
what we can see here I used my

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.940 
what we can see here I used my
compressed<00:06:33.750> air<00:06:33.930> nozzle<00:06:34.350> to<00:06:34.500> add<00:06:34.680> some

compressed air nozzle to add some
pressure<00:06:35.160> to<00:06:35.340> the<00:06:35.460> chamber<00:06:35.970> and<00:06:36.180> tried<00:06:36.750> to

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
pressure to the chamber and tried to

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.820 
pressure to the chamber and tried to
keep<00:06:37.050> it<00:06:37.229> at<00:06:37.440> just

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
keep it at just

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.850 
keep it at just
over<00:06:38.070> one<00:06:38.250> atmosphere<00:06:38.880> of<00:06:39.380> course<00:06:40.380> taking<00:06:40.770> the

food<00:06:41.010> out<00:06:41.190> is<00:06:41.430> more<00:06:41.610> difficult<00:06:41.820> with<00:06:42.180> the

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
food out is more difficult with the

don't think we really need the dry ice

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.810 
don't think we really need the dry ice
for<00:07:00.660> the<00:07:00.750> cold<00:07:00.990> trap<00:07:01.290> since<00:07:02.220> the<00:07:02.400> pressures

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
for the cold trap since the pressures

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.820 
for the cold trap since the pressures
are<00:07:03.000> a<00:07:03.030> bit<00:07:03.240> higher<00:07:03.510> I<00:07:03.900> think<00:07:04.470> we<00:07:04.560> could<00:07:04.710> get

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
are a bit higher I think we could get

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.950 
are a bit higher I think we could get
away<00:07:04.980> with<00:07:05.220> a<00:07:05.250> less<00:07:05.550> good<00:07:05.790> vacuum<00:07:06.300> pump<00:07:06.630> and<00:07:06.810> a

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
away with a less good vacuum pump and a

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.780 
away with a less good vacuum pump and a
less<00:07:07.170> good<00:07:07.380> cold<00:07:07.710> trap<00:07:08.010> and<00:07:08.220> still<00:07:08.460> get<00:07:08.610> some

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:08.790 
less good cold trap and still get some

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.620 
less good cold trap and still get some
pretty<00:07:09.000> good<00:07:09.180> results<00:07:10.760> okay<00:07:11.760> see<00:07:12.240> you<00:07:12.420> next

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630 
pretty good results okay see you next

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.350 
pretty good results okay see you next
time<00:07:12.840> bye
