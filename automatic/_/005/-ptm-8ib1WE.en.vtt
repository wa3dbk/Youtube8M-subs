 Hi guys, how are you? All right, who? 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.290
 This is Monique, and welcome to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.289
 County 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.990
 well we my previous videos and received 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.840
 some comments in a personal tone 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.300
 asking me how I can move 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.970
 the objects freely and how I do 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.519
 to go up and down and they kind to 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.800
 put that cushion on the couch 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.809
 work goals like these the fac 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.530
 and only that it is not a start table that is the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.620
 sofa 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.250
 there is how to put the objectives here 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.530
 bulletin board using this good shift 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.379
 Guess what I'm going to do is teach the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.600
 you how i do it 's good 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.420
 the first thing will be to rise and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.910
 Descending the objects is very simple . 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.710
 I love this chip because it's like that. 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.760
 With him can you do that kind of 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.309
 garnish as I told you 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.619
 the objects here I will not do because I do not 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.900
 has a hand for the fact of kira there 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.490
 you can put the goals here 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.729
 spider veins here I went to put up with 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.320
 this club gets to shift the cushions 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.840
 also like there 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.290
 the first thing you squeeze 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.290
 found shift and c will open up at 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:28.040
 corner to wrote boy the check 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.360
 I write move objects 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.250
 I just forgot the baby because I'm 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:39.840
 accustomed to one of those in 3 in that tone 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:44.960
 baby new point and jackson active now 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.960
 there is nothing else to do up there 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.579
 sorry 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.880
 adding now objects can rise and 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:58.490
 down not catch who suffers example 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:02.819
 You press 9 to take over 0 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.520
 0 to go down but it has to be 9 and 10 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:09.360
 keyboard in the part of letters there some have 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.649
 the symbols in the case opens parentheses 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.989
 closes parentheses 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.519
 It is so up and down of the objects was 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.750
 a serious team very easy on simple no 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.760
 mystery is taking the part I 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.620
 I forgot the baby up there on the mobile web 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:29.010
 smart objects now for 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.870
 remove objects freely and also 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.930
 something very simple has nothing to 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.940
 mystery is already activated the sheik still 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.920
 object 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:45.600
 now we can take any object here 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:47.579
 the ps in rhymes tightens out the figure of the 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:54.019
 time by leaving objects to rotate and 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:54.019
 freely with the high holding always 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.650
 closed 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:06.689
 So it 's these people not forgetting to 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.749
 up and down the object 9 in the case opens 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:14.849
 parentheses and 0 closes parentheses for 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:18.090
 beat well simple to turn the epr 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.760
 object freely to move and 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.939
 free to find 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.519
 ensuring out and with the object 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:28.829
 selected looks will move will turn to 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.260
 do what you want 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.209
 with these people have a good time 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.629
 has enough cushion on the sofa or 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.180
 easily clams fill with objects in the 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.669
 your tables do a crazy game 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.590
