00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.740
 Hi again! In the midst of everyday haste, the treatment of shoes is often left to the fly. 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.380
 However, all the shoes need treatment. 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.380
 And now we meet Martha Hanna Pikkarainen 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.740
 which tells you how to keep your shoes in good condition for longer. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.860
 Hey Hanna. Mun have to admit that I'm a lousy care to keep the shoes. 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.480
 Where should I get started? 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.880
 At the time of purchase, check with the seller how to handle the shoes 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.380
 and you have substances and equipment at home. 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.000
 At least in the spring, salt stains are found in almost every shoe. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.640
 How do I get rid of them? 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.640
 Immediately fresh, for example, with Marseille soap or vinegar solution will certainly leave. 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.680
 Sit when there are leather shoes ... a thing familiar from the army, or plaque. 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.680
 How to dress shoes properly? 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.720
 First, the shoes must be clean and dry before they are plated. 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.460
 The plank is then applied by rotary movements and then allowed to dry. 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.400
 Brush and polish afterwards. 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.060
 The plank is chosen according to how the shoes are scratched or scratched. 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.760
 That is, a quick or a colorless one is enough if there is little maintenance. 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.060
 And on the other hand, if there are more scratches or the like has to take a shoe colored plank. 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.020
 Okay, what other tips do you have for shoe maintenance? 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.520
 It is good to have more shoes. ElikkÃ¤ does not wear the same shoes every day. 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.760
 They may dry out and rest in the middle. 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.220
 Sit is good to open the cords when you put on your shoes. 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.440
 And a shoe spoon could be good to use. Shoes are kept airy. 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.300
 That is, not a plastic bag in the bag ... but they can be in a paper bag or box. 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.140
 For a hot tennis fan like me, can I wash my shoes? 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.000
 It is also good to check with the seller at the time of purchase, but a lot of people today can put on the machine. 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.500
 So, protect your new shoes with a treatment cream. 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.400
 Remember to plankta and take care of your shoes often and let your shoes rest.
