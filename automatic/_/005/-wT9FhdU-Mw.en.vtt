the<00:01:00.030> wavy<00:01:00.239> bits<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.809> going<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> top

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the wavy bits and going up to the top

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.219 
the wavy bits and going up to the top
near<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.010> pointy<00:01:02.460> bits<00:01:02.670> easiest<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.899> lined<00:01:04.110> up

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
near the pointy bits easiest it lined up

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.020 
near the pointy bits easiest it lined up
better<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> top<00:01:05.070> got<00:01:05.280> sewn<00:01:05.549> shut<00:01:05.580> better

better and the top got sewn shut better
hop<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.020> all<00:01:07.290> six<00:01:07.590> sounds<00:01:07.979> at<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
hop in and so all six sounds at the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.679 
hop in and so all six sounds at the
bottom<00:01:08.490> together<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.150> end<00:01:09.360> up<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
bottom together so you end up with a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.630 
bottom together so you end up with a
circular<00:01:10.170> bottom<00:01:10.530> with<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> wavy<00:01:11.189> bets<00:01:11.460> on
