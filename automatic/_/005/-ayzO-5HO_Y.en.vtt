00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.130
 interested stalker I took to 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.689
 home a good 30 and so let's say they are 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.460
 been a little busy because he wants japan 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.550
 I warn you that this is a video made 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.330
 totally with the phallus and who wants 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.939
 meaning intend 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.380
 it is a very fast thing in the sense that there is 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.170
 I wanted to give you more than anything else 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.579
 updates along with dear hernan io 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.860
 I'm playing to record the gameplay 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.200
 what you see while I talk so I could 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.180
 fall into autism I cardio reassume you 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.789
 because I'm listening, a fool wants to do 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.430
 a comment that is repeating but is not a 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.170
 some betting live comments not live 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.000
 fuck i'm a genius i'm i can do 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.640
 these things are still talked about today 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.350
 mainly two things first and me 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.449
 I enjoy it but very quickly because some of it 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.379
 they asked me the question had i 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.780
 doubts etc. 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.799
 I just emphasize and I think he can't 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.500
 subscribe to that absolutely videos 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.270
 that you will see on me I enjoy it in the sense if 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.830
 you will see them because maybe we can 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.000
 go to the videos so to make us 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.850
 know other people then too 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.210
 they will be however to evaluate they will be 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.340
 video we normally do ie not 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.710
 is that out of six on that channel 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.090
 there's the fashion that I know to say about me 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.679
 I have to say, why not on that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.240
 channel us the stupidest drug is 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.280
 a thing related to aid because they have 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.229
 invented the term to laugh together 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.210
 to their community etc. we are 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.859
 that is, our videos are ours and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.210
 I think you can subscribe I don't know 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.770
 than by not editing a video where I live 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.939
 bulldog to zero the people you in a while 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.950
 how come anyway guys on this don't 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.649
 you have to ask yourself problems I mean c 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.509
 you should know me above all 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.640
 since this is my channel 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.030
 now let's talk about more interesting things myself 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.250
 and bonk hernan we will go to make us mid-August 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.759
 romantic together with the gamescom a 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.219
 colony 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.299
 but if we should, yes, unless it falls 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.369
 so we don't get the plane 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:08.459
 or that in any case we boys 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.120
 let's go to gamescom in colony and that 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.310
 what will happen is we will go down 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.540
 basically to try to give you more 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.730
 hardware information 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.170
 I saw the games with last year and 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.430
 we made the trek in the car 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.950
 with friends we decided this year to 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.989
 go there with kern han that my friend 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.940
 pro and I will take it with me precisely for 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.750
 try to tear thanks also to 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.280
 our network 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.310
 maybe it will help us in the organization 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.590
 interviews with someone from the gameplay 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.840
 register directly there because yes 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.989
 assumes that it will be presented to 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.510
 gamescom as in all the battlefield 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.920
 past we say a second map that is 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.010
 what we should theoretically do 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.620
 catch us in the beta in early September 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.930
 something like the ohlins October e 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.120
 so we will try to record some 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.680
 literno 6 look at what and we'll see 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.359
 also other for eni mezzucci everything 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.299
 this simply to get a 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.700
 muscle spend 2 3 nights with me in 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.280
 burglary room and if you complain that 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.950
 shit stories president no anyway 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.530
 yes in short we will try to do a lot 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.590
 report I immediately tried to understand 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.050
 what are the 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.060
 which will be introduced on wired line 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.830
 so how do you know a sick person about this 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.510
 miss as you know, however, a small thing 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.030
 I will bring back instant so I don't have to 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.530
 to ask me, I will instead investigate 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.319
 on the things that explode they do 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.940
 laughing about sports stuff is so why 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.670
 because I'm still guys this 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.709
 the extra update I would like to tell you 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.110
 that we go there obviously with the mission 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.920
 to understand something more they killed 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.660
 from the obvious defibrillator 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.420
 sorry we will play the mission too 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.950
 to understand something more about others 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.099
 games that interest us like rainbow 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.220
 six feet like cod advanced warfare for 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.079
 understand if something we like or not about 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.840
 other games like home front 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.090
 in short, a little fps of turn then 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.940
 obviously we do n't really have gherlan 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.920
 no and we have to investigate blondes 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.430
 there are more beautiful German and 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.349
 Italian 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.780

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.540
