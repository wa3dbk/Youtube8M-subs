and a multi melter
so<00:06:19.569> when<00:06:19.689> I<00:06:19.719> bring<00:06:19.960> this<00:06:20.110> on<00:06:20.289> the<00:06:20.409> table<00:06:20.740> I<00:06:20.860> fly

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:21.129 
so when I bring this on the table I fly

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:22.980 
so when I bring this on the table I fly
it<00:06:21.189> right<00:06:21.430> now<00:06:21.580> enemy<00:06:21.909> Flyers<00:06:22.180> and<00:06:22.539> just<00:06:22.689> blast

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
it right now enemy Flyers and just blast

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.010 
it right now enemy Flyers and just blast
away<00:06:23.259> and<00:06:24.210> most<00:06:25.210> of<00:06:25.389> them<00:06:25.509> are<00:06:25.599> pretty<00:06:25.749> fragile

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
away and most of them are pretty fragile

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.909 
away and most of them are pretty fragile
so<00:06:26.860> I<00:06:27.389> it's<00:06:28.389> a<00:06:28.479> pretty<00:06:28.659> tough<00:06:28.930> model<00:06:29.439> plus<00:06:29.740> you

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 
so I it's a pretty tough model plus you

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:31.559 
so I it's a pretty tough model plus you
can<00:06:30.099> add<00:06:30.279> the<00:06:30.490> hurricane<00:06:30.909> Boulter's<00:06:31.300> to<00:06:31.419> make

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:31.569 
can add the hurricane Boulter's to make

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:33.540 
can add the hurricane Boulter's to make
an<00:06:31.689> anti<00:06:31.960> infantry<00:06:32.439> or<00:06:32.919> an<00:06:32.979> assault<00:06:33.219> cannon

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
an anti infantry or an assault cannon

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.879 
an anti infantry or an assault cannon
which<00:06:33.819> is<00:06:33.939> also<00:06:34.210> a<00:06:34.240> good<00:06:34.449> choice<00:06:34.710> so<00:06:35.710> there's

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
which is also a good choice so there's

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:39.029 
which is also a good choice so there's
my<00:06:36.099> storm<00:06:36.789> Raven<00:06:37.300> but<00:06:38.139> that's<00:06:38.319> not<00:06:38.589> complete

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 
my storm Raven but that's not complete

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:42.320 
my storm Raven but that's not complete
this<00:06:39.219> is<00:06:39.370> about<00:06:39.520> 200<00:06:40.180> and<00:06:40.270> some<00:06:40.899> points<00:06:41.259> to<00:06:41.319> 15

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330
