or<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.000> false-9<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:43.129> Ultimate<00:00:44.129> Team<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.370> think

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
or the false-9 in Ultimate Team I think

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.010 
or the false-9 in Ultimate Team I think
that<00:00:44.700> would<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:44.940> amazing<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> centre

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
that would be amazing to have a centre

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.420 
that would be amazing to have a centre
forward<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> two<00:00:46.770> wing<00:00:46.950> combos

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
forward and then the two wing combos

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.250 
forward and then the two wing combos
with<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> defensive<00:00:48.690> mid<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.020> then<00:00:49.110> two

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
with the defensive mid and then two

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.439 
with the defensive mid and then two
sentiments<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.980> would<00:00:50.489> far<00:00:50.730> prefer<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.270> or

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
sentiments I would far prefer that or

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.389 
sentiments I would far prefer that or
I'd<00:00:51.539> prefer<00:00:51.719> them<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.289> 433<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
I'd prefer them to do 433 with the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.760 
I'd prefer them to do 433 with the
holding<00:00:53.850> mid<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.480> set<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> CDM<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.649> then

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
holding mid or set with the CDM and then

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.709 
holding mid or set with the CDM and then
maybe<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.039> LCM<00:00:56.550> RCM<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.600> would

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
maybe a LCM RCM I just think that would

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.080 
maybe a LCM RCM I just think that would
be<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> lot<00:00:58.440> better<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.340> bit<00:00:59.550> more<00:00:59.730> realistic

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
be a lot better and a bit more realistic

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.479 
be a lot better and a bit more realistic
I<00:01:00.449> make<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.469> know<00:01:01.559> tell<00:01:01.800> me<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:01.980> I'm<00:01:02.070> wrong<00:01:02.250> but

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
I make you know tell me if I'm wrong but

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.460 
I make you know tell me if I'm wrong but
I<00:01:02.730> think<00:01:03.239> most<00:01:03.420> teams<00:01:03.660> play<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> very

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
I think most teams play with a very

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.530 
I think most teams play with a very
holding<00:01:05.040> oriented<00:01:05.700> center<00:01:05.939> min<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.299> can

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
holding oriented center min now you can

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.420 
holding oriented center min now you can
kind<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.900> accomplish<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.439> by<00:01:07.619> using<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:08.070> cm

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
kind of accomplish this by using a cm

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.160 
kind of accomplish this by using a cm
with<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> high<00:01:09.180> defensive<00:01:09.689> work<00:01:09.840> right<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170

low<00:01:10.350> attacking<00:01:10.710> work<00:01:11.010> right<00:01:11.250> meaning<00:01:11.760> they'll

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
low attacking work right meaning they'll

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.240 
low attacking work right meaning they'll
probably<00:01:12.240> sit<00:01:12.750> behind<00:01:12.900> your<00:01:13.170> other<00:01:13.350> center

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
probably sit behind your other center

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.999 
probably sit behind your other center
mids<00:01:14.430> anyway<00:01:14.939> which<00:01:15.930> will<00:01:16.110> help<00:01:16.259> prevent

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
mids anyway which will help prevent

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.620 
mids anyway which will help prevent
against<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> counter<00:01:17.759> attacks<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.210> crusty

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
against the counter attacks but crusty

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.109 
against the counter attacks but crusty

back so Martine Bravo is there to pounce

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.230 
back so Martine Bravo is there to pounce
I'd<00:01:25.110> hit<00:01:25.229> wing<00:01:25.530> swap<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.610> Bravo<00:01:26.820> could<00:01:27.150> be

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
I'd hit wing swap so that Bravo could be

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.210 
I'd hit wing swap so that Bravo could be
able<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.479> cut<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.930> onto<00:01:28.259> his<00:01:28.409> left<00:01:28.680> foot<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.100> do

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
able to cut in onto his left foot to do

wing swap you hit up on the d-pad and

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
because when you see a team like this I

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.539 
because when you see a team like this I
generally<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.560> guys<00:03:13.709> thought<00:03:14.040> through<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
generally the guys thought through the

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.970 
generally the guys thought through the
pace<00:03:14.790> oriented<00:03:15.659> you<00:03:15.900> know<00:03:16.019> where<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.799> Pacey

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
pace oriented you know where the Pacey

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.710 
pace oriented you know where the Pacey
players<00:03:17.310> are<00:03:17.430> gonna<00:03:17.549> be<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.730> had<00:03:17.970> no<00:03:18.209> idea<00:03:18.389> what

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
players are gonna be I had no idea what

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.629 
players are gonna be I had no idea what
to<00:03:18.810> expect<00:03:19.199> as<00:03:19.349> the<00:03:19.769> Polish<00:03:20.010> League<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.370> just<00:03:20.549> a

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
to expect as the Polish League is just a

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.280 
to expect as the Polish League is just a
league<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:20.910> I'm<00:03:21.030> not<00:03:21.239> super<00:03:21.510> familiar<00:03:21.840> with

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
league that I'm not super familiar with

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.199 
league that I'm not super familiar with
and<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.560> can<00:03:22.769> lead<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.400> lot<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.910> problems

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
and this can lead to a lot of problems

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.939 
and this can lead to a lot of problems
in<00:03:24.299> Ultimate<00:03:24.629> Team<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:24.900> kind<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.500> take<00:03:25.650> pride<00:03:25.919> in

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
in Ultimate Team I kind of take pride in

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.220 
in Ultimate Team I kind of take pride in
knowing<00:03:26.129> at<00:03:26.609> least<00:03:27.180> which<00:03:27.510> footed<00:03:27.959> most

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
knowing at least which footed most

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.750 
knowing at least which footed most
players<00:03:28.470> are<00:03:28.709> that's<00:03:28.889> why<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.040> switch<00:03:29.340> teams<00:03:29.519> so

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
players are that's why I switch teams so

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.400 
players are that's why I switch teams so
frequently<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.389> get<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.540> feel<00:03:30.780> for<00:03:30.810> all<00:03:31.230> the

your opponent's players pretty well

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.409 
your opponent's players pretty well
you're<00:03:38.160> gonna<00:03:38.250> know<00:03:38.489> which<00:03:38.910> side<00:03:39.180> they're

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
you're gonna know which side they're

more than likely to try to cut in on to

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.559 
more than likely to try to cut in on to
shoot<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.340> can<00:03:41.489> defend<00:03:41.819> just<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.209> little

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
shoot and you can defend just a little

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.449 
shoot and you can defend just a little
bit<00:03:42.810> better<00:03:43.049> he<00:03:43.680> scores<00:03:43.949> a<00:03:44.010> goal<00:03:44.069> here<00:03:44.340> with

bit better he scores a goal here with
Komarovsky<00:03:44.970> over<00:03:45.690> my<00:03:45.870> keeper<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.470> little

header<00:03:47.160> then<00:03:47.370> he<00:03:47.459> could<00:03:47.579> send<00:03:47.790> another<00:03:48.120> one<00:03:48.239> it

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510

got in with the keeper and then shot it
straight<00:04:17.310> at<00:04:17.489> him<00:04:17.729> or<00:04:17.909> could<00:04:18.780> have<00:04:18.870> laid<00:04:18.959> it

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
straight at him or could have laid it

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.990 
straight at him or could have laid it
across<00:04:19.229> goal<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:20.190> past<00:04:20.400> went<00:04:20.639> behind<00:04:20.789> my

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
across goal and the past went behind my

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.120 
across goal and the past went behind my
player<00:04:21.359> or<00:04:21.599> something<00:04:21.989> like<00:04:22.079> that<00:04:22.139> and<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.979> was

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
player or something like that and it was

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.379 
player or something like that and it was
just<00:04:23.159> one<00:04:23.610> of<00:04:23.639> those<00:04:24.950> maybe<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.130> 4-3-3<00:04:26.639> isn't

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
just one of those maybe the 4-3-3 isn't

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:27.740 
just one of those maybe the 4-3-3 isn't
the<00:04:27.510> right

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
the right

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.390 
the right
formation<00:04:28.290> for<00:04:28.500> me<00:04:28.590> so<00:04:28.770> there's<00:04:29.160> only<00:04:29.280> one

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
formation for me so there's only one

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.830 
formation for me so there's only one
thing<00:04:29.670> to<00:04:29.790> do<00:04:29.880> at<00:04:29.970> this<00:04:30.090> point<00:04:30.300> time<00:04:30.450> that's<00:04:30.720> to

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
thing to do at this point time that's to

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.510 
thing to do at this point time that's to
switch<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.200> up<00:04:31.290> I<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:31.920> said<00:04:32.100> this<00:04:32.190> will<00:04:32.310> be<00:04:32.430> the

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
switch it up I and said this will be the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.980 
switch it up I and said this will be the
last<00:04:32.700> game<00:04:32.910> that<00:04:33.120> we'll<00:04:33.210> play<00:04:33.360> we<00:04:33.510> scored<00:04:33.720> a<00:04:33.750> 90

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
last game that we'll play we scored a 90
