00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.240
 hi guys here plus a tutorial from the site 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.420
 www.jjseventos.com.br play a good game 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.300
 and it's a game very much like the 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.730
 bochum I practically swear a copy 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.009
 so here basically when the game already 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.940
 starts already starts on this screen 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.670
 This game does not have the time in the game 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.410
 here's a couple of things. 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.239
 you can modify the options you can 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.090
 restart the game that will show how 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.800
 play I teach statistics and even 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.440
 who you can change the language if you 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.460
 I want to put the Portuguese of the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.020
 Brazil 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.960
 so what is the purpose of the game is 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:01.240
 get you to play this 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:03.250
 here in the upper part and when 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.379
 three balls are together 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.360
 you'll make them burst then in that 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.619
 In case beer is going to try to play close 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.450
 of networks 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.770
 So what happened now that you have 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.649
 the same score 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.119
 here is showing the number 5 you want 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:21.820
 say that if you do not burst bubbles 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.999
 after five times all the balls will go 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.210
 down a line in the case will do the 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:32.409
 possible to be able to burst now 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.999
 now it was 4 that I said at the beginning 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.999
 of the day will continue on 4 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.939
 because as you can see using the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.939
 mouse to power from side to side 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.689
 in this game mode never ends 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.820
 I even came down because you do not have 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.590
 time with basically what goes 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.340
 happen is this I do with 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.649
 that at 0 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.020
 if I know how to play she 'll burst more 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.530
 just to give an example I will not play there 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.049
 play here is a line 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.230
 so if you start committing many 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:18.600
 Errors goes down until you get here. 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.940
 lose now went to four times 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.920
 so if for four times you do not 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.250
 burst no bubble 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:32.220
 It will go down and so on. 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:34.980
 until it reaches zero in the case now in more 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:41.450
 two are always looking to put 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:44.450
 The Bubbles Together Touch Has The Pink Green 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.450
 orange 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.590
 ae 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.640
 You do not always want to burst even though 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.239
 it would be necessary not to go down but 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.290
 maybe you can create a strategy 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.290
 to later on in the case 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.060
 Rosa has nowhere to go, so I'll go. 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.980
 play here 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.390
 red is here I 'm going to play both there 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.959
 how much here but how much more 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.409
 chance to go down I'll play there and two 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.540
 still has not noticed a ball with the 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.269
 red bubble here then she 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.430
 disappeared because all the other 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.810
 exploded and she was alone. 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.810
 so if this is what happens 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.840
 so how do I know now that I have 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.310
 a routine on another rock 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.040
 I could play here but like the one who 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.430
 It's lower after playing here. 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:47.859
 burst blue burst together then 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:50.349
 basically a game works so let's 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.239
 keep playing until you're lost 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.919
 If you've been so good, never lose yourself. 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.280
 will continue to play here for hours and 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.970
