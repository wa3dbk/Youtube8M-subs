out<00:03:27.110> these<00:03:27.230> exercises<00:03:27.769> within<00:03:27.980> about<00:03:28.070> 10<00:03:28.430> 15

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
out these exercises within about 10 15

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.820 
out these exercises within about 10 15
minutes<00:03:28.910> well<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:29.780> would<00:03:30.170> start<00:03:30.440> with<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.560> little

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
minutes well I would start with a little

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.110 
minutes well I would start with a little
bit<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:31.010> warm<00:03:31.190> up<00:03:31.310> maybe<00:03:31.610> something<00:03:31.970> on<00:03:32.060> the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
bit of warm up maybe something on the

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.759 
bit of warm up maybe something on the
floor<00:03:32.299> just<00:03:32.540> like<00:03:32.660> your<00:03:32.840> old-school<00:03:33.110> crunches

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
floor just like your old-school crunches

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.320 
floor just like your old-school crunches
maybe<00:03:34.010> some<00:03:34.190> plank<00:03:34.459> side<00:03:34.730> playing<00:03:35.000> something

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
maybe some plank side playing something

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.880 
maybe some plank side playing something
like<00:03:35.450> that<00:03:35.630> just<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:36.260> get<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.500> core<00:03:36.680> nice<00:03:36.860> and

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
like that just to get the core nice and

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.640 
like that just to get the core nice and
warm<00:03:37.220> okay<00:03:37.640> then<00:03:38.000> get<00:03:38.150> over<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.510> your<00:03:38.540> bar<00:03:39.110> hit

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
warm okay then get over to your bar hit

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.390 
warm okay then get over to your bar hit
maybe<00:03:40.810> two<00:03:41.810> warm-up<00:03:42.440> sets<00:03:42.709> ten<00:03:43.070> to<00:03:43.190> twelve

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
maybe two warm-up sets ten to twelve

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.670 
maybe two warm-up sets ten to twelve
reps<00:03:43.489> of<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.090> regressions<00:03:44.720> so<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.410> bent<00:03:45.620> leg

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
reps of the regressions so the bent leg

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.920 
reps of the regressions so the bent leg
yep<00:03:46.430> then<00:03:46.579> I<00:03:46.640> twerk<00:03:46.880> maybe<00:03:47.120> two<00:03:47.329> to<00:03:47.480> three<00:03:47.510> sets

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
yep then I twerk maybe two to three sets

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.039 
yep then I twerk maybe two to three sets
ten<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:48.829> twelve<00:03:49.100> six<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.910> five<00:03:50.209> reps<00:03:50.510> each<00:03:50.750> side

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
ten to twelve six to five reps each side

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.680 
ten to twelve six to five reps each side
on<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.650> little<00:03:52.370> bit<00:03:52.459> harder<00:03:52.670> exercises<00:03:53.090> okay

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
on a little bit harder exercises okay

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.110 
on a little bit harder exercises okay
maybe<00:03:53.900> like<00:03:54.049> a<00:03:54.079> wiper<00:03:54.350> yea<00:03:55.040> or<00:03:55.310> alternate<00:03:55.940> back

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
maybe like a wiper yea or alternate back

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.640 
maybe like a wiper yea or alternate back
and<00:03:56.150> forth<00:03:56.299> maybe<00:03:56.630> wiper<00:03:56.959> then<00:03:57.380> you're<00:03:57.500> going

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
and forth maybe wiper then you're going

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.590 
and forth maybe wiper then you're going
straight<00:03:58.070> leg<00:03:58.280> raise<00:03:58.519> something<00:03:59.299> like<00:03:59.420> that

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
straight leg raise something like that

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.630 
straight leg raise something like that
little<00:03:59.780> variations<00:04:00.320> not<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.530> bad<00:04:00.680> idea<00:04:00.829> -<00:04:01.130> okay

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
little variations not a bad idea - okay

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.009 
little variations not a bad idea - okay
so<00:04:01.700> I<00:04:01.820> say<00:04:02.030> about<00:04:02.180> total<00:04:02.480> about<00:04:02.600> four<00:04:02.780> sets

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
so I say about total about four sets

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.229 
so I say about total about four sets
yeah<00:04:03.350> four<00:04:03.590> sets<00:04:03.829> these<00:04:04.340> are<00:04:04.489> alternating<00:04:05.060> or

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
yeah four sets these are alternating or

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.810 
yeah four sets these are alternating or
super<00:04:05.959> setting<00:04:06.230> them<00:04:06.350> nice<00:04:06.890> and<00:04:07.130> a<00:04:07.489> good<00:04:07.519> thing

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
super setting them nice and a good thing

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.580 
super setting them nice and a good thing
about<00:04:07.940> doing<00:04:08.060> these<00:04:08.480> it's<00:04:08.989> not<00:04:09.230> like<00:04:09.410> regular

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
about doing these it's not like regular
