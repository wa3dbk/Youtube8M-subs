00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
set up I hit the stair setup and this is

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.299 
set up I hit the stair setup and this is
a<00:00:11.849> wall<00:00:12.150> acting<00:00:12.750> like<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:13.349> wall<00:00:13.920> in<00:00:14.009> your<00:00:14.040> house

a wall acting like a wall in your house
and<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.150> redstone<00:00:15.570> wiring<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:16.020> gonna<00:00:16.170> go

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
and the redstone wiring is gonna go

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.560 
and the redstone wiring is gonna go
behind<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.789> so<00:00:17.789> first<00:00:17.940> off<00:00:18.119> we're<00:00:18.240> gonna<00:00:18.359> start

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
behind it so first off we're gonna start

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.689 
behind it so first off we're gonna start
out<00:00:18.660> start<00:00:19.050> off<00:00:19.140> with<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.439> top<00:00:19.710> stair<00:00:20.070> this

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
out start off with this top stair this

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.890 
out start off with this top stair this
is<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.850> most<00:00:21.029> important<00:00:21.390> part<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.750> whole

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
is the most important part of the whole

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.570 
is the most important part of the whole
thing<00:00:22.109> because<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.800> Terrier<00:00:23.130> has<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.460> go

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
thing because this Terrier has to go

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.609 
thing because this Terrier has to go
down<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.180> out<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> way<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.350> block

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
down and out of the way so this block

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.650 
down and out of the way so this block
can<00:00:25.650> come<00:00:25.980> across<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:27.240> let's<00:00:27.359> get<00:00:27.420> started

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
piston going up towards the staircase or

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.630 
piston going up towards the staircase or
towards<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> first<00:01:03.809> stair<00:01:04.460> maybe<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.519> want

sticky pistons on top of each other what

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.840 
sticky pistons on top of each other what
this<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.380> gonna<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.280> keep<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
this is gonna do this to keep it on the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.910 
this is gonna do this to keep it on the
bottom<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.240> gonna<00:01:12.299> take<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.200> sticky<00:01:13.560> piston

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
bottom is gonna take this sticky piston

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.219 
bottom is gonna take this sticky piston
and<00:01:14.100> drag<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.790> under<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.930> top

and drag it under and then this top

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.990 
and drag it under and then this top
piston<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.710> gonna<00:01:16.830> take<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> stair<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.700> drag

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
piston is gonna take the stair and drag

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.179 
piston is gonna take the stair and drag
it<00:01:18.119> under<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> wall<00:01:18.570> all<00:01:19.560> right<00:01:19.680> now<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:19.920> gotta

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
it under the wall all right now we gotta

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.399 
it under the wall all right now we gotta
set<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.490> up<00:01:20.700> I'm<00:01:21.360> gonna<00:01:21.509> get<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.320> this

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
set this up I'm gonna get this up this

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.570 
set this up I'm gonna get this up this
up<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:22.860> otherwise<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.400> won't

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
up just right otherwise it won't

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.560 
up just right otherwise it won't
otherwise<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.180> won't<00:01:24.330> work<00:01:26.210> all<00:01:27.210> right<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.509> you

otherwise it won't work all right so you
in<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> place<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.990> redstone<00:01:28.229> repeater<00:01:28.549> let<00:01:29.549> me

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
in a place of redstone repeater let me

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.319 
in a place of redstone repeater let me
do<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.820> first

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
do that first

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.969 
do that first
alright<00:01:30.869> now<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.110> want<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.380> set<00:01:31.770> up<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
alright now you want to set up the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.030 
alright now you want to set up the
Redstone<00:01:32.340> wiring<00:01:32.810> this<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.200> kind<00:01:34.979> of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
Redstone wiring this can be kind of

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.340 
Redstone wiring this can be kind of
difficult<00:01:35.420> let's<00:01:36.420> see<00:01:36.659> how<00:01:36.900> should<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.229> do

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
difficult let's see how should we do

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.429 
difficult let's see how should we do
this<00:01:38.210> we'll<00:01:39.210> place<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.420> right<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:40.140> let<00:01:40.350> me

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
this we'll place that right here let me

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.929 
this we'll place that right here let me
actually<00:01:40.590> need<00:01:40.799> some<00:01:40.920> more<00:01:41.070> space<00:01:41.310> right<00:01:41.579> now

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.730 

all<00:01:44.939> right<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.090> that's<00:01:45.450> set<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.560> will

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
all right so that's set up and I will

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.389

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
redstone can connect to that we don't

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.010 
redstone can connect to that we don't
need<00:03:19.989> that<00:03:20.110> one<00:03:20.260> right<00:03:20.440> there<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:22.020> now
