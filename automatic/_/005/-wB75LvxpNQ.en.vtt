00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
easy because if you starting off with

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.870 
easy because if you starting off with
around<00:00:30.869> 125<00:00:31.410> thousand<00:00:32.099> coins<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.550> method

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
around 125 thousand coins this method

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.459 
around 125 thousand coins this method
works<00:00:33.030> very<00:00:33.329> well<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.750> get<00:00:33.840> yourself<00:00:34.020> up<00:00:34.350> to

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
works very well to get yourself up to

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.790 
works very well to get yourself up to
that<00:00:34.500> first<00:00:34.860> 50<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.880> 100,000<00:00:36.809> coins<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
that first 50 to 100,000 coins and the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.959 
that first 50 to 100,000 coins and the
reason<00:00:38.040> for<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.430> because<00:00:38.460> there's<00:00:38.850> so

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
reason for that is because there's so

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.389 
reason for that is because there's so
many<00:00:39.090> open<00:00:39.480> bids<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.890> your

many open bids on this and and your

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.860 
many open bids on this and and your
likelihood<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.940> winning<00:00:42.030> these<00:00:42.420> bids<00:00:42.690> are

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
likelihood of winning these bids are

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.810 
likelihood of winning these bids are
very<00:00:43.170> very<00:00:43.410> high<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.219> recommend<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.700> go

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
very very high so I recommend you go

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
not going to find as many often bits but

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.960 
not going to find as many often bits but
when<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.739> do<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:52.950> can<00:02:53.160> usually<00:02:53.459> make<00:02:53.730> more
