Hey, guys.

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.250
It's Sarah.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.270
I'm here with CoverGirl to show you
how to get this smokey eye look.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.540
Let's get started.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.760
I'm starting out by
using my CoverGirl Quad.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.030
I'm using the third color and
applying it all over my lid.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.260
Most people do a neutral or
black or grey smokey eye,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.380
but I wanted to go a little
different and add a pop of color.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.932
So today, I'll be doing
a purple smokey eye.

00:00:25.932 --> 00:00:27.890
I'm gonna go back in with
the eye shadow later,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.710
but for now, I'm going to pick
up my Perfect Point Plus Eyeliner

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.746
and just do a very big cat eye.

00:00:35.746 --> 00:00:39.610
It doesn't matter if this is messy,
because we'll be blending it out later.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.260
Now, I'm going to take the back
of this Perfect Point Pencil

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.780
and I'm just gonna blend
it towards the eye shadow.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.500
You don't want any
sharp lines with this.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.700
We want it all very blended.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.700
I'm doing the same
thing on the other side.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.964
I always like to start with the outside
of the cat eye and work my way in.

00:01:05.964 --> 00:01:08.630
And again, it doesn't matter if
that's messy, because we're just

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.140
going to blend it through.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.270
Next, we're going to go in with
our darker shade of eye shadow

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.600
and work this more around that lash
line to give it more dimension.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.860
And just taking a dry brush, I'm
going to blend that all through again.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.040
Now, I'm going to take the
Perfect Point Plus Pencil again,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.760
and I'm just going to line
all around my eye with this.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.960
And fallout will happen.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.320
And we'll clean that up later.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.920
I'm using that dark shade again and
really working it through the look.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.630
Closer to the lash line
is where the darkest shade

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.910
should be with the eyeliner.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.138
And then you can blend through there.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.850
Now, I'm taking an angle
brush with the same shade

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.130
and pulling it underneath my eye,
connecting the top and the bottom lid.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.140
Next, we're going to
come in and highlight.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.890
And you don't want to
highlight too much--

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.460
just a very gradient, very blended
highlight on the inner corners

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.009
and browbone.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.450
I'm gonna clean up any fallout I had
from that with my CoverGirl Thick Stick

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.120
Concealer, and then blending
that out with my fingers.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.130
I'm going to finish up my eyes by
using my CoverGirl Lash Blast Volume.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.250
I love this mascara
when it comes to volume,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.290
and you really want to
have that for this look.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.920
I'm applying a thick coat
to my top and bottom lashes.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.610
Putting the mascara wand
right up to my eyelashes

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.520
and blinking gives my
lashes the best definition.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.460
To finish off this look, I'm just going
to touch up my eyebrows a little bit

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.910
with my CoverGirl Powder Brow.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.460
Shaping out your eyebrow
really makes your eye look pop.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.824
I'm just going to touch up my lips a
little bit with my CoverGirl Yummy Pink

00:03:00.824 --> 00:03:01.323
Lipstick.

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:07.480
That's my smokey eye look,
and I hope you liked it.
