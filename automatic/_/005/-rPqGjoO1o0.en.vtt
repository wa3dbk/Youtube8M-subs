a exo-m 18 3.5 inch I'll show that
comparing<00:01:14.550> to<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.120> so<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
comparing to this one so you get the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.700 
comparing to this one so you get the
regular<00:01:16.230> cardboard<00:01:17.180> box<00:01:18.180> with<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.020> Hinderer

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
knife written very lips so I did make a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.390 
knife written very lips so I did make a
video<00:01:32.010> of<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.990> collaboration<00:01:33.990> between<00:01:34.400> zero

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400

video of the collaboration between zero
tolerance<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.360> hinder<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.620> zero<00:01:38.040> tolerance

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
tolerance and hinder the zero tolerance

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.070 
tolerance and hinder the zero tolerance
Eclipse<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.510> I<00:01:39.600> actually<00:01:39.750> have<00:01:40.049> on

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
Eclipse that I actually have on

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.070 
Eclipse that I actually have on
pre-order<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.299> Rick<00:01:42.540> hinder

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080

pre-order but this is the Rick hinder
eclipse<00:01:45.950> okay<00:01:46.950> let's<00:01:47.220> take<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.670> detailed<00:01:48.030> look

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
eclipse okay let's take a detailed look

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.890 
eclipse okay let's take a detailed look
at<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.409> Hinderer<00:01:50.040> eclipse<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:51.720> a

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
at the Hinderer eclipse you can see a

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.180 
at the Hinderer eclipse you can see a
black<00:01:52.440> g10<00:01:53.070> scale<00:01:54.320> appears<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.560> be<00:01:55.680> using

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
black g10 scale appears to be using

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.870 
black g10 scale appears to be using
basically<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.240> same<00:01:57.570> hardware<00:01:58.320> as<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.430> X<00:01:59.610> I'm

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
basically the same hardware as the X I'm

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.859 
basically the same hardware as the X I'm
18<00:02:00.830> unsure<00:02:01.830> if<00:02:02.299> they<00:02:03.299> are<00:02:03.540> interchangeable

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
18 unsure if they are interchangeable

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.100 
18 unsure if they are interchangeable

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
this is the same size at 3.5 inch X I'm

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.839 
this is the same size at 3.5 inch X I'm
18<00:02:07.470> so<00:02:09.740> unsure<00:02:10.740> if<00:02:10.830> however<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.130> mentioned<00:02:11.610> this

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
18 so unsure if however I mentioned this

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.410 
18 so unsure if however I mentioned this
but<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.720> do<00:02:13.080> have<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.740> zero<00:02:14.220> tolerance<00:02:14.520> version

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
but I do have a zero tolerance version

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.820 
but I do have a zero tolerance version
of<00:02:15.569> the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
of the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.140 
of the
knife<00:02:16.180> on<00:02:17.180> pre-order<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.860> have<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.430> video<00:02:19.910> of

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
that knife that I had filmed a blade

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.820 
that knife that I had filmed a blade
show<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.330> believe<00:02:23.900> I've<00:02:24.050> already<00:02:24.170> posted<00:02:24.530> it

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
show I believe I've already posted it

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.490 
show I believe I've already posted it
but<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:25.610> can<00:02:25.760> see<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.030> Hinderer<00:02:26.630> logo<00:02:27.290> right

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
but you can see a Hinderer logo right

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.970 
but you can see a Hinderer logo right
there<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.520> tanto<00:02:29.510> not<00:02:30.350> really<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.740> fan

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
there this is a tanto not really a fan

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.430 
there this is a tanto not really a fan
of<00:02:31.010> tanto<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:31.640> I'm<00:02:31.880> not<00:02:32.030> sure<00:02:32.390> how<00:02:33.020> long<00:02:33.230> I'll

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
of tanto so I'm not sure how long I'll

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.040 
of tanto so I'm not sure how long I'll
actually<00:02:33.830> hold<00:02:34.010> on<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:34.400> knife<00:02:34.870> one<00:02:35.870> thing

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
actually hold on to this knife one thing

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.510 
actually hold on to this knife one thing
that<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.260> did<00:02:36.410> notice<00:02:36.650> about<00:02:36.770> this<00:02:37.100> tanto

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
that I did notice about this tanto

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.720 
that I did notice about this tanto
though<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:38.270> that<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.960> not<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.730> aggressive

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
though is that it is not that aggressive

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.330 
though is that it is not that aggressive
of<00:02:41.270> a<00:02:41.870> tanto<00:02:42.350> that<00:02:43.190> angle<00:02:43.850> is<00:02:43.940> not<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:46.250> can

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
of a tanto that angle is not so you can

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.060 
of a tanto that angle is not so you can
see<00:02:46.580> there<00:02:46.820> seems<00:02:47.480> like<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:47.810> will<00:02:48.050> be<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.650> nice

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
see there seems like it will be a nice

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.060 
see there seems like it will be a nice
slicer<00:02:49.850> still<00:02:50.350> let's<00:02:51.350> see<00:02:51.440> how<00:02:51.560> thin<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
slicer still let's see how thin the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.770 
slicer still let's see how thin the
edges<00:02:52.610> okay<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:54.280> lot<00:02:55.280> thinner<00:02:55.780> than

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
edges okay so that is a lot thinner than

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.730 
edges okay so that is a lot thinner than
the<00:02:57.410> span<00:02:57.860> toes<00:02:58.190> on<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:59.090> xm8<00:02:59.510> teams<00:02:59.870> were<00:03:00.140> so

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
the span toes on the xm8 teams were so

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.410 
the span toes on the xm8 teams were so
they<00:03:00.830> did<00:03:01.010> thin<00:03:01.220> out<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.520> edge<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:02.000> should<00:03:02.030> be

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
they did thin out the edge it should be

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.580 
they did thin out the edge it should be
a<00:03:02.630> much<00:03:03.050> better

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
a much better

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.650 
a much better
cutter<00:03:05.590> maybe<00:03:06.590> like<00:03:06.830> a<00:03:06.860> slicer<00:03:07.790> grind<00:03:08.090> on<00:03:08.630> a

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
cutter maybe like a slicer grind on a

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.650 
cutter maybe like a slicer grind on a
hinder<00:03:09.200> is<00:03:10.240> so<00:03:11.240> we<00:03:11.360> have<00:03:12.040> s35vn<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.540> don't<00:03:14.540> know

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
hinder is so we have s35vn I don't know

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.840 
hinder is so we have s35vn I don't know
if<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.870> mentioned<00:03:14.930> this<00:03:15.290> wedge<00:03:15.709> already<00:03:16.220> makes

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
if I mentioned this wedge already makes

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.170 
if I mentioned this wedge already makes
it<00:03:17.000> look<00:03:17.240> very<00:03:17.810> nice<00:03:18.080> kind<00:03:18.560> of<00:03:18.650> like<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.150> the

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
it look very nice kind of like is it the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.840 
it look very nice kind of like is it the
harpoon<00:03:20.720> grind<00:03:22.090> not<00:03:23.090> sure<00:03:23.980> okay<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.580> we<00:03:25.670> have

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
harpoon grind not sure okay so we have

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.640 
harpoon grind not sure okay so we have
the<00:03:26.120> frame<00:03:26.420> lock<00:03:26.630> of<00:03:26.840> course<00:03:26.989> we<00:03:27.200> have<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.380> lock

like a pretty early lock up nice you can

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.420 
like a pretty early lock up nice you can
see<00:03:48.580> it<00:03:49.580> actually<00:03:49.730> has<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.120> milling<00:03:50.690> out<00:03:50.870> there

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
see it actually has a milling out there

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.479

don't believe well other hinders do not

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.380 
don't believe well other hinders do not
have<00:03:55.850> that<00:03:56.060> so<00:03:56.900> that<00:03:57.019> is<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.230> new<00:03:57.560> feature<00:03:57.890> on

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
like a 90 degree angle that you're

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.509 
like a 90 degree angle that you're
pushing<00:04:15.920> up<00:04:16.160> against<00:04:16.549> right<00:04:16.700> there

you<00:04:30.300> also<00:04:30.450> have<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:31.170> depression<00:04:31.920> right<00:04:32.100> here

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
you also have that depression right here

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
me has some jumping up there but I have

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.850 
me has some jumping up there but I have
rather<00:04:42.030> long<00:04:42.390> thumbs<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.110> mine<00:04:43.680> doesn't

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
rather long thumbs and mine doesn't

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.150 
rather long thumbs and mine doesn't
reach<00:04:44.220> that<00:04:45.210> very<00:04:45.570> easily<00:04:45.780> unless<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.860> can't

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
reach that very easily unless a can't

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.810 
reach that very easily unless a can't
choke<00:04:47.430> up<00:04:47.700> on<00:04:47.880> it<00:04:49.820> does<00:04:50.820> not<00:04:50.850> have<00:04:51.510> a<00:04:51.870> coil<00:04:52.820> put

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
choke up on it does not have a coil put

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.470 
choke up on it does not have a coil put
your<00:04:53.940> finger<00:04:54.240> right<00:04:54.270> there<00:04:56.540> so<00:04:57.540> you<00:04:58.530> know<00:04:58.740> I

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
your finger right there so you know I

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.840 
your finger right there so you know I
really<00:05:00.480> like<00:05:01.140> this<00:05:01.350> knife<00:05:01.650> I<00:05:01.890> think<00:05:02.190> some<00:05:02.820> of

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
really like this knife I think some of

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.030 
really like this knife I think some of
the<00:05:02.970> upgrades<00:05:03.090> they've<00:05:03.540> done<00:05:03.750> are<00:05:04.170> very<00:05:04.200> nice

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
the upgrades they've done are very nice

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.270 
the upgrades they've done are very nice
like<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.610> double<00:05:06.000> finger<00:05:06.420> grooves<00:05:07.160> makes<00:05:08.160> it

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
like the double finger grooves makes it

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.020 
like the double finger grooves makes it
rather<00:05:08.430> comfortable<00:05:10.220> use<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.370> flipper<00:05:11.790> let's

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
rather comfortable use the flipper let's

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:22.480 
rather comfortable use the flipper let's
try<00:05:12.360> thumb<00:05:12.870> stud<00:05:13.260> a<00:05:15.920> little<00:05:16.920> bit<00:05:17.480> yeah<00:05:19.880> mmm<00:05:20.880> I

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
try thumb stud a little bit yeah mmm I

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.190 
try thumb stud a little bit yeah mmm I
like<00:05:23.490> open<00:05:23.940> you<00:05:24.150> know<00:05:24.240> with<00:05:24.390> thumb<00:05:24.690> stud<00:05:24.990> it's

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
like open you know with thumb stud it's

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.070 
like open you know with thumb stud it's
more<00:05:25.440> of<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:27.710> stop<00:05:28.710> pin<00:05:29.190> now<00:05:29.490> you<00:05:30.360> can<00:05:30.480> see<00:05:30.750> that

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
more of a stop pin now you can see that

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.290 
more of a stop pin now you can see that
it<00:05:31.350> can<00:05:31.530> be<00:05:31.590> rather<00:05:31.980> difficult<00:05:32.670> to<00:05:33.180> actually

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
it can be rather difficult to actually

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.400 
it can be rather difficult to actually
get<00:05:34.190> to<00:05:35.190> that<00:05:35.400> thumb<00:05:35.760> stud<00:05:36.150> because<00:05:36.390> of<00:05:37.170> this

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
get to that thumb stud because of this
