00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 by daniel von tablet i here on 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.450
 the droidcon 2013 in berlin and that is 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.490
 the brand new torino of the telecom 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.830
 and Hugendubel was developed together 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.349
 and now I show you in this video 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.809
 what the features and functions of the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.160
 new tourino are and if it's worth it 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.160
 ever to buy this ebook reader 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.289
 So that's the new e book reader 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.390
 the german land that is the tourino 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.439
 and for the moment he sleeps as you see 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.750
 and up there 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.879
 there you see it to start you have to 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.590
 just here this shiva shortly after 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.960
 pull right and he will do it again 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.269
 up and I think we just go around 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.400
 the house around we have a belief here 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.710
 6 inch large display that is a 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.360
 display that also very very sharp 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.339
 it is readable to come here right now 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.809
 Below is such a wheel that comes to you 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.440
 so always come when you for example 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.170
 in a book back and forth rejoices 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.949
 you come back to the menu again and again 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.280
 back 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.870
 otherwise we'll see one below 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.460
 Lasche and we do too 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.490
 on the right side none 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.020
 connections rome we have here one more 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.940
 lighting means you know the here 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.399
 turn on the lights when you go to 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.869
 example in the dark want to read 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.369
 makes no sense here in the case because 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.000
 It takes a lot of time to see them 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.950
 neither 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.060
 and then come to the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.729
 Settings can be so right 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.700
 bright behind you can see her beautiful 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.229
 polin and logo and down there it is 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.439
 from the German telecom 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.100
 been designed yes we do it all 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.770
 Just open this bottle and there you see 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.250
 we took a reset there 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.390
 then, of course, on the micro USB to charge 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.850
 and probably also books 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.799
 transfer from pc to example pdf 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.560
 should also be readable and 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.540
 another micro sd card slot that 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.439
 means you know the memory the 2 gb 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.090
 of course, also expand large memory 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.490
 Let's take a closer look at the menu 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.719
 up here we have a few books of 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.810
 the library and if we look into this 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.000
 Going in we see okay we have here 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.670
 Unfortunately, no wireless connection for that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.640
 device controls wlan and you have to 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.140
 also free 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.970
 telekom hotspots you really 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.930
 can use for free and they are there 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.209
 almost everywhere 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.400
 so whether at mcdonalds in each 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.040
 McDonald's store or at each 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.030
 big airport the telekom patient in 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.260
 found everywhere 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.170
 meanwhile they are even in 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.310
 built-in aircraft so when we go to 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.890
 example go to a book then sees 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.790
 you can read here wonderfully easy 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.930
 if you type right then change 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.660
 Of course the side you can of course 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.840
 also vision and up here you have the 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.640
 possibility of this book or resp 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.040
 this page has a bookmark too 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.630
 put if you look typed in the middle 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.100
 you get more options one man 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.100
 So, for example, on facebook 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.480
 Probably share pages or quotes 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.400
 You can change the font size here 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.560
 you see and of course the 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.900
 So marine whichever 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.250
 you like sailing and here 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.110
 there you can see the brightness again 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.720
 moment it is really bright here so that 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.310
 you can really go down that 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.380
 if it gets really dark then 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.420
 you can see there maybe now 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.920
 a no right one 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.200
 backlight but that is 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.690
 such a film that is illuminated and 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.860
 Thus, the display does not pop like 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.049
 example of a mobile phone in the 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.880
 darken one's eyes before that 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.470
 you hardly ever happen but it is 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.239
 really a very pleasant lighting 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.440
 so we go back to the menu there 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:45.049
 you can see it here you have of course 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.019
 also the possibility to go to the shop 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.510
 if you have the wlan and there books 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.280
 there are a thousand if not to buy 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.560
 millions of books all 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.200
 hugendubel of course offers it 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.329
 to buy her here too 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.489
 otherwise e books are about the same 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.860
 sometimes even a bit cheaper and here 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.690
 Do you have the opportunity once that 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.670
 options menu to go you can wlan 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:12.440
 you can switch on and off a few 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:15.019
 deposit customer data and as well 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.200
 you can see how popular it is here again 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.660
 memory is so 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.220
 All very very easy to keep 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.860
 really comes in this device immediately 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.210
 rightly so that was with me at least and 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.580
 if you really did not want that 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.230
 device somehow draws what it draws in 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.060
 This standby mode is not good at all 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.010
 then you can use this switch very far 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.700
 push right and a bit 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.620
 So wait always start and all 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.570
 push to the right as you can see here 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.850
 So it knows completely switch off 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.650
 if that's your drawer, for example 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.980
 but wanted to lay for a month as well 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.340
 so 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.880
 the battery lasts 60 days i believe 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.280
 then given so energy is only 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.910
 consumed when the display is updated 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.190
 and that brings just the big one 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.660
 battery advantage so he knows one loose 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.340
 month long with this tool you 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.200
 be on the road and the device 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.100
 only charge that is really 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.060
 problem-free 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.880
 we are priced at 99 euros and the 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.790
 is about the price of the kindle of 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.590
 amazon it keeps the question what he is 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.020
 would like to 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.700
 the kindle fire is so far with 120 euro 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.230
 I know 20 euros more expensive 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.110
 he also owns one 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.040
 backlight like the tourino 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.560
 However, you get here again 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.150
 free wlan hotspots from the telekom 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:36.900
 and I think that's a big advantage 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.520
 in my opinion if you are with the 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.170
 selection at hugendubel with the 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.720
 Book selection at hugendubel satisfied 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.300
 then you should have the tourino 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.520
 look closer because with 99 euros he is 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.830
 really cheap and has a great 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.620
 Processing a good battery life and 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.230
 the telekom hotspot bonus is real 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.060
 partially priceless 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.250
 So that's the tourino of the telekom 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.600
 and hugendubel I hope the video has 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.620
 you like it if so then give me up 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.600
 every case a thumbs up and down 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.780
 subscribe to the channel and very important 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.750
 the question of the video is you 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:13.320
 he buy the tourino for 99 euros or 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.360
 the amazon kindle paperworld for 120 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.190
 euro tells me about it in the comments 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.360
 and maybe you even have one 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.590
 Reasoning I am looking forward to everyone 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.400
 comment and of course, too 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.529
 reply 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.399
 So I'm there from tablet 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:25.399
 to see the fans
