it out so that's what we're going to be

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.279 
it out so that's what we're going to be
taking<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.730> look<00:00:29.760> at<00:00:30.000> today<00:00:30.420> you'll<00:00:30.990> see<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
taking a look at today you'll see the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.139 
taking a look at today you'll see the
game<00:00:31.439> supports<00:00:31.800> motion<00:00:32.309> sensing<00:00:32.759> controls

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
game supports motion sensing controls

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.100 
game supports motion sensing controls
one<00:00:33.420> would<00:00:33.630> hope<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.809> on<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.559> iPhone<00:00:35.100> and

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
one would hope so on the iPhone and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.290 
one would hope so on the iPhone and
graphics<00:00:37.110> look<00:00:37.350> fine<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.070> actually<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
graphics look fine and actually the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.740 
graphics look fine and actually the
graphics<00:00:39.719> within<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> game<00:00:40.469> itself<00:00:40.860> are<00:00:41.750> okay

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
graphics within the game itself are okay

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.049 
graphics within the game itself are okay
however<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> speed<00:00:44.340> at<00:00:44.640> which<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
however it's the speed at which the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.299 
however it's the speed at which the
graphics<00:00:45.450> pass<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.870> kind<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.110> looks<00:00:46.350> very<00:00:46.950> slow

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
graphics pass it kind of looks very slow

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.910 
graphics pass it kind of looks very slow
looks<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:47.789> perhaps<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.510> 25<00:00:49.410> or<00:00:49.649> 30

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
looks like perhaps you're going 25 or 30

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.720 
looks like perhaps you're going 25 or 30
miles<00:00:50.250> an<00:00:50.399> hour<00:00:50.520> instead<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.420> say<00:00:51.719> 150<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.730> 160

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
miles an hour instead of say 150 or 160

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.520 
miles an hour instead of say 150 or 160
so<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> couple<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.510> tips<00:00:54.719> here<00:00:54.989> once<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
so a couple of tips here once we get to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.639 
so a couple of tips here once we get to
the<00:00:55.949> race<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:57.480> couple<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.020> options<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.410> want<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the race a couple of options you want to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.619 
the race a couple of options you want to
check<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.239> set<00:01:00.510> to

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
check out one is to have this set to

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.420 
check out one is to have this set to
auto<00:01:00.840> accelerate<00:01:01.620> accelerators<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
auto accelerate accelerators on the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.950 
auto accelerate accelerators on the
right<00:01:02.640> brake<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> left<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:05.689> have<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.810> set

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
right brake is on the left I have it set

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.320 
right brake is on the left I have it set
to<00:01:07.020> auto<00:01:07.260> accelerate<00:01:07.860> right<00:01:08.040> now<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.090> looks

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
to auto accelerate right now so it looks

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.179 
to auto accelerate right now so it looks
good<00:01:09.540> my<00:01:09.869> main<00:01:10.140> problem<00:01:10.380> with<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.890> game

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
good my main problem with this game

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.710 
good my main problem with this game
comes<00:01:11.700> down<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.939> two<00:01:12.090> things<00:01:12.240> first<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.630> all

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
comes down to two things first of all

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.179 
comes down to two things first of all
you<00:01:12.840> might<00:01:12.990> notice<00:01:13.200> how<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> scenery<00:01:13.979> just

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
you might notice how the scenery just

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.560 
you might notice how the scenery just
doesn't<00:01:14.490> seem<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.790> going<00:01:14.909> by<00:01:15.180> all<00:01:15.390> that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
doesn't seem to be going by all that

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.640 
doesn't seem to be going by all that
fast<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.170> secondly<00:01:17.040> would<00:01:17.729> be<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> controls

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
fast and secondly would be the controls

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.990 
fast and secondly would be the controls
despite<00:01:19.650> being<00:01:19.830> able<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.280> change<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
despite being able to change the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.179 
despite being able to change the
sensitivity<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.840> found<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.740> able<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.009> make<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
sensitivity I found to be able to make a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.060 
sensitivity I found to be able to make a
turn<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:24.060> practically<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:25.040> put<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
turn you practically have to put the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.569 
turn you practically have to put the
iphone<00:01:27.110> vertically<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.320> order<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.280> to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
iphone vertically in order for it to

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.149 
iphone vertically in order for it to
pick<00:01:29.880> up<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.930> sensor<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.560> make<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.950> turn

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
pick up the the sensor and make the turn

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.679 
pick up the the sensor and make the turn
for<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.610> at<00:01:32.759> speed<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:36.000> other<00:01:36.240> than<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.659> I

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
for you at speed so other than that I

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.789 
for you at speed so other than that I
mean<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.110> seems<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.470> something<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
mean that seems like something that

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.850 
mean that seems like something that
could<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.189> fixed<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:39.030> some<00:01:39.240> sort<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.540> tweak

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
could be fixed with some sort of tweak

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.249 
could be fixed with some sort of tweak
in<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.070> control<00:01:41.490> scheme<00:01:41.899> that<00:01:42.899> would<00:01:43.079> make

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
in the control scheme that would make

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.289 
in the control scheme that would make
this<00:01:43.409> game<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.710> lot<00:01:44.070> better<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.759> graphics<00:01:45.180> are

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
this game a lot better the graphics are

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.539 
this game a lot better the graphics are
fine<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.990> cars<00:01:46.259> look<00:01:46.470> fine<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.100> gameplay

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
fine the cars look fine the gameplay

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.300 
fine the cars look fine the gameplay
itself<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:48.090> ok<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> actual<00:01:49.470> ability<00:01:50.159> to
