00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 only a few days ago we talked 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.150
 of the xperia z3 that came out in September and 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.890
 that we put as one of the best 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.860
 mobile market so far 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.540
 now we have news the xperia 74 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.429
 is around the corner is going to be 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.740
 presented in January and we already know 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.690
 features and also photographs 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.160
 so we're going to present all this to you 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.160
 then we start 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.320
 It Olate with itself out as so 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.239
 unfortunately if you just bought 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.070
 experiences of three you can go 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.539
 doing the harakiri but of all 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.370
 ways we have to talk about something 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.949
 positive in terms of the policies of 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.250
 Sun and is not missing two phones 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:41.260
 flag per year but rather politics 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.629
 of the updates and is that they finish 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.229
 of informing not long ago that they are going to 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.600
 update the entire range xperia z the z1 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.820
 arranged and the z3 to android lollipop 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.800
 so it's something truly positive 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.140
 because usually when lengthen one 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.059
 mobile like this when several 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.769
 versions do not update us in this case 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.170
 come back to the experience is one like that 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.909
 that is really good we are going 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.060
 talk a bit about the characteristics of 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.939
 this phone and one of the most called 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.619
 the attention is the increase of the screen 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.229
 we went from the 52 inches of the 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.390
 experience is 3 at 54 of xperia 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.610
 z4 and not only that but also 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.829
 it improves something very important for me that 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.869
 is the proportion of the screen with 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.640
 regarding the size of the mobile so 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.060
 will be seen further reduce 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.890
 frames 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.420
 and even the phone is going to round 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.840
 pretty more more than anything at the tips 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.270
 so it's a great goal to really be 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.479
 approaching my idea of â€‹â€‹how it should be 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.399
 a sound with good with everything that brings 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.740
 because they really are very telephones 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.179
 complete not only increases the size 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.179
 of the screen also increases the 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:51.490
 resolution finally we jump to 2 k 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:53.710
 that are 1440 x 2560 pixels and good a 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.289
 little there we get closer to what is the lg 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.090
 3 or the out 4 not that a little is being 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.340
 standardized and that really this 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.069
 always brings a bit of controversy more than 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.929
 nothing because it always ends up taking you away 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.869
 a little bit of processor power and 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.019
 also a bit on the side of the 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.680
 battery not something that really is 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.599
 worrying but good unfortunately 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.069
 we are going to have to get used to 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.650
 an increase in resolution that in 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.379
 definitely not going to notice too much 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.590
 We continue counting to alleviate the 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.569
 issue of increasing the resolution of 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.590
 the screen will lengthen a better 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.689
 805 snapdragon processor is not going to be the 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.939
 810 that 810 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:38.000
 it already supports 64 bits so we 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.220
 we make sure it's going to be a 32 bit 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.870
 this new phone is not going to take the step 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.689
 how are they giving good as they are going to give 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.250
 coming soon on many of the phones 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.349
 but we also find a 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.030
 significant increase in terms of 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.680
 ram memory is truly eye-catching 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.659
 see what the first phone will be like 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.930
 of the important ones that will lengthen 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:59.599
 four gigabytes of ram something that is a 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.489
 true madness but that really 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.920
 good better more than less if 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.069
 we compare for example with the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.620
 iphone 6 only one gigabyte we give ourselves 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.680
 realize that there is a stretch too 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.139
 huge long distances between the two 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.260
 so I really do not think that it 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:20.349
 use so much but 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.849
 is going really well on the side of 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.230
 the battery we are also with 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.269
 a pretty important increase 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.700
 surely also to alleviate the issue 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.799
 of the resolution increase and is that we 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.959
 we found with three thousand 420 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.239
 milliamps unlike the 3100 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.079
 who had experience 3 and this more 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.640
 that nothing will surely be to alleviate the 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.950
 increase in screen size and 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.870
 also the resolution so as 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.340
 minimum I imagine that it will keep the 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.189
 Same autonomy as the previous model 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.319
 that was really good on the other 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.959
 side as far as the cameras we know of 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.269
 that the rear camera is said to go to 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.849
 be of the same resolution we are 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.220
 talking about 20 7 megapixels but with 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.530
 a difference and it's that it's going to change 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.459
 the sensor will move to a new sensor 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.819
 surely the renewed and mx 230 of 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.530
 sonny what he promises is a better 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.810
 capture of light for when we take 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.950
 photographs with low luminosity in 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.959
 how much to the front camera we 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.989
 we find an increase in resolution 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.400
 since we jump from the 2.2 megapixels 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.219
 who had the xperia z 3 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.590
 48 that is going to have the xperia 74 something that 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:29.969
 really good is quite logical 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.830
 also all the companies are 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:34.259
 improving the front cameras because 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.270
 the use increases day by day good with this 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.560
 of the cee of the fis and others so good 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.240
 we hope that it will not only increase in 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.009
 resolution but also a little the 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.870
 sensor quality not picking up 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.330
 light with low brightness good things 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.120
 which are usually ordered normally by another 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.580
 side the operating system we already know we 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.919
 we imagine that it will come with android 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.199
 lollipop as good also say the 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.900
 rumors so really good for 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.210
 that side waiting for that good too 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.180
 read a little bit more the image 1 of 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.279
 android lollipop and it is not to that interface 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.430
 so bland from my point of view so 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:09.719
 formal rather if you want to call it that 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.909
 that really has us accustomed are 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:14.520
 and that for me from my point of view is 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.770
 one of the weakest points not in 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.360
 as to what you are taking out are and in 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.310
 about smartphones 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.129
 On the other hand we have to talk about a 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.110
 Biggest big brother is the xperia 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:28.289
 z4 ultra that is also advertised for 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.360
 these dates and that as a novelty 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.610
 main good we have to say that 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.909
 the screen is going to be 5.9 inches 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.680
 as discussed and also said it 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.840
 it's sounding pretty much that he's going to have 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.080
 an extremely thin thickness is going to be 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.960
 of only 57 millimeters something that 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.389
 it really makes us wonder if this can 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.460
 affect what has been talked about so much 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.830
 lately and that is that the phones that 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.490
 they are not doubled recently in a 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.770
 Comparison of good phones 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.860
 dubbing phones we find with 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.779
 that the zeta range of the xperia are the 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.279
 that more easily bend so 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:07.409
 I really hope that in this case 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:09.840
 this does not continue on the side of the 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.219
 finally experience is 4 ultra 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.159
 tell you that the filing date 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:16.050
 would be January 5 within the framework of 6 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.250
 which is a pretty technology fair 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.470
 important that develops in the 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.390
 vegas' 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.070
 not only that is not only going to 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.620
 present in January but also by 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.540
 what they say is opposed to the sale so 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.290
 truly if you are thinking about 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.700
 buy an xperia z maybe it suits you 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.880
 Wait a little longer and buy yourself 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.980
 directly the z4 otherwise tell you 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.130
 that you leave us your opinion to see or 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.860
 question about this device in 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.850
 particular here below right in the 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.500
 comments 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.510
 and also tell you that if you liked this 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.700
 video dale I like if less known 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.740
 subscribe to our channel more info in 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.450
 our web techno nauta dotcom there 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.820
 we will be hanging the new photos 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.950
 with being leaving this device and 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.790
 finally tell you what we see in 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.790
 the next video 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.419
 two 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.419
 and
