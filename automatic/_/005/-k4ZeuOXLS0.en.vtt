00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 relaxed mood today at noon on the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.470
 Final press conference of the handball 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.290
 emsdetten defeated second division tv 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.900
 greets the tva from the top of the table 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.650
 a snapshot of the trainer patrik 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.600
 liljestrand by no means surprised 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.020
 I know that we have that we have 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.600
 But I had a lot of problems 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.349
 think that our opponents in the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.480
 Filmfestspiele has samples alois and 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.009
 hildesheim will have more problem then 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.940
 and we could do that too 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.340
 benefit 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.170
 they say sorry to me 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.809
 education system to zero points no topic 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.480
 so i am very satisfied 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.250
 just this season confirms that 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.440
 team once more through one 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.390
 increased cohesion the mix 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.270
 from experienced people like elvis 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.190
 selmanovic stefan thünemann and patrik 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.680
 kvalvik and young players to 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.980
 example nils babin are a big one 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.960
 trump also defender patrick kvalvik 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.899
 raves about the team building in emsdetten 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.290
 he really had something incredible 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.350
 a good start and want to start 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.909
 we all really and it is easy 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.040
 so if it works then it really works 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.299
 and now we have the regieduo 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.170
 connect his team 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.320
 hingekriegt 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.540
 these yes and we all fight together 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.600
 and we just want to win the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.159
 all the time and that's totally it 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.380
 something different than last last season 132 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.540
 Thrown gates after five games are 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.820
 already a passable value of tva 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.650
 but impresses in this game time 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.170
 his defensive behavior stefan 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.630
 thünemann and patrik kvalvik perform in the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.200
 defense center and hard work 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.780
 so the door too together with goalkeeper 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.430
 do that very well now i was one man 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.430
 that will be difficult for the team 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.770
 if the 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.450
 So much work has to be done by ours 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.160
 opponent that she has a lot of work to do 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.100
 against our defense and against us 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.280
 will be tired then and then 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.650
 we'll take the easier tomorrow 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.410
 now comes the HC gain and straight 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.230
 now at the tva the staff is pressing 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.220
 Unfortunately, shouyang does not play with players 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.560
 how it looks 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.720
 so found her husband is ill i hope 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.760
 that will not be much worse tomorrow and 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.950
 then had vitalized with your 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.160
 Elbow problem has nothing to do with it too 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.959
 so in our thin squad there is one 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.540
 few small problems in front 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.540
 I do not know exactly how janko is not
