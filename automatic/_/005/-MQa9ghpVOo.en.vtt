00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.030

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.890
 frequency vice weighs on instagram you are 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:22.789

 as soon as I get the phone in my hand 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.240
 look if there are any new photos on 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:33.140
 instagram or all the messages that I have 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.590
 write you and as soon as i wake up calculation 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.210
 always about half an hour earlier 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.939
 when do I have to wake up because of me? 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.280
 like to download all the mail to me 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.109
 just look at all the tweets and 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.079
 look at all the photos on instagram 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:49.399
 precisely what you and I write to you 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.840
 photos that also publish the others 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.590
 people 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.959
 what is your worst photo on instagram 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.840
 my fan fiction 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:01.459
 I wish there are so many I would say all 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.220
 the trawl faces whenever I do 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.070
 photographer 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.009
 then by train in the morning at 5 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.610
 or with make-up removal I think that with 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.860
 the miserable in the 1800s then worse than it is 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.910
 the most successful beautiful photo 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.370
 photo that has been more successful 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.620
 definitely in marriage 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.160
 the one you liked most that 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.990
 you have that you have on the uncertain more 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.060
 I think it's that and thanks thanks 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.400
 really still for all the wishes 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.980
 that you write to me because slowly 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.140
 they are discovering all of them 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:41.250
 because then how many followers or to 10k 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.560
 so it means 10,000 and how many people 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:50.010
 then let's take a few how many 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:55.050
 people being me I follow with comfortable 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.030
 we make comfortable 664 people then that 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:03.050
 the last personal permission I like ad 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:06.500
 one of your photos then the last person is 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.500
 we can do it 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:18.480
 ml daniela daniela then mentions a person 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:21.060
 famous that follows a brand company 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.610
 I saw this this bathroom made by 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.830
 lots of other girls and they all have 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.209
 said the same thing the family thinks 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:33.330
 kardashian are the photos that come 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.690
 more look on instagram by whom but 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.220
 just the whole khloÃ© family 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:44.120
 cannes from the heat all and so I think 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.620
 to the kardashian family now are the 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.370
 people who have more members 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.590
 right on instagram carolina these 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.070
 affair there is always that little word e 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:04:00.410
 what do you always think is affected by a mild 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:01.640
 then show one to three photos that 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.150
 you prefer 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.190
 then here I will publish them and attach them to you 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.710
 my favorite pictures 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.190
 let's see a little bit I would say from that of the 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:17.570
 marriage will surely then publish 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:21.350
 a small column and then boh now apple 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.830
 I will choose the municipality anyway 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.410
 now you've seen them right now 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.720
 then what is the last photo that appears on the 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.310
 your profile the last photo that appears 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.060
 on my profile is that of my video 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.270
 novo e 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.000
 because precisely I realize that 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.389
 many people do not receive 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.990
 updates from youtube of new videos 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:49.290
 so every day I remind you that there is a 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.230
 new video online because I don't know how 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.970
 never but not all receive from youtube 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.450
 notice that a new one appears 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.460
 video so I try to remember it 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.830
 every day look what I published 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.960
 the new video published today it 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.690
 I will publish tomorrow so at least stay 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.300
 always up to date even if occasionally 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.419
 in fact this video escapes me and 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.740
 precisely about the day after I have 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:18.360
 published the video directly 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:20.250
 public the photo on instagram enough 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.650
 nothing these are all ten 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:27.180
 instagram tag questions like the sad 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.950

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:38.319

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:44.860
 licking his feet so it was like this 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.889
