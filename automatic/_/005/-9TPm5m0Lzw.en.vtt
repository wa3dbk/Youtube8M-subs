00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.640
 How fascinating will these be? 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.080
 characters that not only tell us how 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.150
 is the fashion in Peru but that 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.399
 they spread all their passion for what they do 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.410
 each one from his work I think he 

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:28.270
 amused and shows industry that is 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.270
 giving more and more to talk about him 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.730
 within all this growing and positive 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.620
 moved as does not mention the a sergio 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.420
 corbacho considered one of the best 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.190
 makeup artists of the world by many 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.110

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.290
 architect of the glamor of naomi watts and 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.150
 salma hayek I am a person who 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.629
 I definitely detest the shopping 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.910
 but nevertheless I admire and I love the 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.790
 personal style I love when I see 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:02.390
 that people have a style and are 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:05.269
 only I showed me the opportunity to 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.880
 to be able to expand all these things in a 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.549
 only character that is the character of the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.830
 coach the coach who is the person 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.320
 who trains the models trains 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.270
 practically to the whole show and I think 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.909
 that falls to me as the finger level because it's 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.920
 what I have done for so many years 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.790
 coaching so many people to so many 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.320
 people who need a guide a 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.590
 nudge to stand out in their 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.590
 careers 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.409
 a lot of time that I do my things 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.659
 just because I do not want to look like anyone 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.630
 who would say that in Peru was going to 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.659
 discover an amazing tailor who 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.790
 makes my pants sacks to my taste in the 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.070
 colors that I choose in what I have left 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.200
 well for me not to depend on a shopping 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.670
 prêt à porter that you run the risk of 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.530
 find things you do not have left 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.720
 Sergio moves with familiarity to where 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.729
 go from in madrid or new york to 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.799
 win which took us so we can 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.159
 get an idea of how your 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.159
 mind 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.550
 let's know then different 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.770
 experiences and interpretations of love 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.490
 an industry that increasingly gather more 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.490
 collaborators 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.260
 without the particular look of the photographer 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.240
 fashion would be something fleeting and ephemeral 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.400
 the catwalks the collections the 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.500
 models and even those on the street are 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.970
 known scenarios for tomato raffle what 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.950
 embraced to be a man within the 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.290
 photography and the things that here in the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.670
 Peru or the market is in a boy who 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.280
 one has to adapt also 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.350
 enough to what the client wants to me 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.280
 At least he calls me a lot when they want 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.280
 work natural light 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.090
 this time we had to know the work of 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.569
 rafa during a fashion photo shoot 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.160
 advertising 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.019
 well let's do a photo shoot 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.720

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.340
 sporty fashion and part what is the 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.090
 main indicator that in truth the 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.200
 fashion is working emerging 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.819
 developing more and more here the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.430
 fact that so many people come from outside 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.440
 to cover fashion events that in the 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.849
 peru and apart talking about people outside 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.130
 I also see that there are many productions 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.599
 of foreign magazines that come here to 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.599
 search the local settings 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.290

 some photos have wanted me and have and 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.739
 well they put together a folder with 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.870
 some things that they also gave to 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.349
 know what goes with the concept that 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.349
 wants sex 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.700
 Y
