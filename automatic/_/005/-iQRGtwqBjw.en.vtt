00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.330
 gold guillaume why because in fact 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 you can if you are not at 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.540
 current he varied see a movie 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.760
 dofus coming out I believe these things 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.869
 end of this year is the year 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.820
 next there had been a thriller there 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.860
 was called youth who were out 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.940
 who will be released in theaters 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.010
 in an animated film 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.190
 but there is so emma is in 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.350
 the universe of dofus and and ankama you 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.140
 propose something just super 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.540
 well they will actually propose to 9 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.880
 guild to be able to appear in the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.910
 movie only had their characters their 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.910
 blazon then their nickname and everything and I 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.900
 find it just great so we'll say 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.860
 a few in a few days a game 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.610
 contest will get you into the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.540
 posterity 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.649
 if you win it of course so that does not 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.360
 will not you against the rest of the world 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.019
 it will be you and your guild against the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.760
 rest of the world 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.400
 you will have to be creative combative a 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.760
 nice at etc to be able to appear 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.330
 in the feature film dofus so for that 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.890
 before you get into the battle 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.000
 a two-week registration phase 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.680
 will give you time to gather 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.910
 so that your guild can 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.170
 register there are only free of rights 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.950
 and the leaders who can register the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.420
 guild 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.210
 it is on them that everything is based 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.270
 registered in the news so there it will be 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.380
 actually a jennepin contest that I 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.910
 is great because it will not be 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.990
 that a simple trick actually for 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.460
 decide between you 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.600
 multiple left will be your abilities 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.640
 group organization 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.770
 so you a level 10 guild or a 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.100
 guild level 200 you have all your 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.260
 odds 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.170
 if you get to be a solid group 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.600
 solidarity and that you all have that 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.510
 finally in fact your level is but 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.730
 not necessarily ultra important because 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.470
 expected may want some stuff 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.160
 creativity I think stuff 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.920
 artistic houtain really like the dj 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.600
 d by then that's what made me tilt and 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.700
 the yak akon credit small batteries that 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.930
 think I have a chance to and that I was going 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.940
 who replies that it will be so 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.350
 in my opinion all the wars would dare to 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.130
 chance so if you want to appear 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.710
 in the legend 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.670
 and as they say here let's specify the 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.080
 we are not talking about a simple 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.060
 written mention in the part 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.980
 thanks for the movie no to the bread of 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.780
 skits created especially for 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.000
 you and your guild in the credits 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.320
 where your blazon and your guild name 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.050
 will appear yes 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.480
 so you have 9 guil that will be put 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.680
 forward and everyone that serene 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.420
