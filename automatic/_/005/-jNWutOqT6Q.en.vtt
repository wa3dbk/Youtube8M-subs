over<00:00:33.690> here<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:35.450> think<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.540> appears<00:00:36.930> actually

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
over here I think it appears actually

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.110 
over here I think it appears actually
after<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.809> beef<00:00:39.809> GTS<00:00:40.379> mission<00:00:41.120> but

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
after you do the beef GTS mission but

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.150 
after you do the beef GTS mission but
she'd<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.690> create<00:00:42.960> you'll<00:00:43.500> see<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> weird

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
she'd to create you'll see a weird

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.110 
she'd to create you'll see a weird
little<00:00:44.309> lightning<00:00:44.760> bolt<00:00:45.140> if<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.260> speed<00:00:46.559> up

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
little lightning bolt if you speed up

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.310 
little lightning bolt if you speed up
you<00:00:48.120> see<00:00:48.360> he<00:00:48.570> runs<00:00:48.840> quite<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> bit<00:00:49.530> quicker<00:00:49.739> too

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
you see he runs quite a bit quicker too

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.049 
you see he runs quite a bit quicker too
and<00:00:52.320> sometimes<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.430> kind<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.610> useless

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
and sometimes it's kind of useless

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.580
