um yep guess I'll open them up and

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.040 
um yep guess I'll open them up and
transform<00:01:09.970> door<00:01:10.090> now<00:01:12.690> all<00:01:13.690> right<00:01:13.810> here's

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
transform door now all right here's

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:23.040 
transform door now all right here's
payload<00:01:18.420> whoops<00:01:19.420> i<00:01:19.690> put<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.320> sound<00:01:20.560> room<00:01:22.050> it
