actually but it's so light and that's
because<00:01:53.210> obviously<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.720> doesn't<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
because obviously it doesn't have the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
actually let me put into perspective for

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.080 
actually let me put into perspective for
you<00:02:17.910> here's<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.020> regular<00:02:19.490> ps3<00:02:20.490> controller

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
you here's the regular ps3 controller

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.550 
you here's the regular ps3 controller
and<00:02:21.420> then<00:02:21.660> here's<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.230> guy<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:25.350> actually

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and then here's this guy and it actually

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.930 
and then here's this guy and it actually
seems<00:02:26.220> as<00:02:26.490> though<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:28.560> guy<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.460> little<00:02:29.790> bit

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
seems as though this guy is a little bit

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.120 
seems as though this guy is a little bit
smaller<00:02:30.330> but<00:02:30.570> that's<00:02:30.750> because<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.950> ace

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
smaller but that's because it's the ace

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.780 
smaller but that's because it's the ace
of<00:02:32.430> metrics<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:34.470> see<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.950> comes<00:02:35.280> up<00:02:35.490> quite<00:02:35.670> a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
of metrics you see this comes up quite a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.450 
of metrics you see this comes up quite a
bit<00:02:36.090> as<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.510> can<00:02:36.570> see<00:02:36.930> how<00:02:37.740> that's<00:02:37.860> lined<00:02:38.190> up

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
bit as you can see how that's lined up

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.000 
bit as you can see how that's lined up
with<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.970> regular<00:02:39.540> ps3<00:02:40.200> controller<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.830> see

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
with the regular ps3 controller you see

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.370 
with the regular ps3 controller you see
that<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.930> missus<00:02:43.320> comes<00:02:43.590> down<00:02:43.830> quite<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.220> bit

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
that so missus comes down quite a bit

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.840 
that so missus comes down quite a bit
now<00:02:46.380> this<00:02:46.590> is<00:02:46.710> because<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.160> can<00:02:47.310> hide<00:02:47.520> it<00:02:47.640> hold

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
now this is because you can hide it hold

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.180 
now this is because you can hide it hold
this<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.240> guess<00:02:48.480> one<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:48.960> two<00:02:49.140> ways<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:49.920> fits

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
this I guess one of two ways and it fits

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.250 
this I guess one of two ways and it fits
very<00:02:50.520> very<00:02:50.730> nice<00:02:50.970> into<00:02:51.390> your<00:02:51.540> hand<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:52.020> kind<00:02:52.230> of

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
very very nice into your hand it kind of

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.230 
very very nice into your hand it kind of
reminds<00:02:52.560> me<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.800> how<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.010> Xbox<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.760> designed

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
reminds me of how the Xbox is designed

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.720 
reminds me of how the Xbox is designed
the<00:02:54.690> ergonomic<00:02:55.320> grip<00:02:55.530> it's<00:02:55.740> very<00:02:55.980> similar<00:02:56.280> and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
the ergonomic grip it's very similar and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.120 
the ergonomic grip it's very similar and
that<00:02:56.970> kind<00:02:57.210> of<00:02:57.300> wish<00:02:57.480> how<00:02:57.720> ps3<00:02:58.680> controllers

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
that kind of wish how ps3 controllers

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.800 
that kind of wish how ps3 controllers
were<00:02:59.250> designed<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.670> tell<00:02:59.850> you<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.000> truth<00:03:00.270> and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
were designed to tell you the truth and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.020 
were designed to tell you the truth and
it<00:03:00.990> has<00:03:01.140> like<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.380> different<00:03:02.160> kind<00:03:02.460> of<00:03:02.580> finish

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
it has like a different kind of finish

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.150 
it has like a different kind of finish
on<00:03:03.270> here<00:03:03.570> it's<00:03:03.810> like<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:04.050> matte<00:03:04.320> finish<00:03:04.680> that

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
on here it's like a matte finish that

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.910 
on here it's like a matte finish that
feels<00:03:06.090> grippy<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:07.200> it's<00:03:07.380> like<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.650> special

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
feels grippy like it's like a special

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.310 
feels grippy like it's like a special
like<00:03:08.130> coating<00:03:09.090> almost<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.780> almost<00:03:09.840> feels<00:03:10.260> like

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
like coating almost it almost feels like

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.370 
like coating almost it almost feels like
a<00:03:10.440> thin<00:03:10.890> thin<00:03:11.370> kind<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.910> rubber<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:13.020> anyway

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
a thin thin kind of rubber so anyway

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.510 
a thin thin kind of rubber so anyway
this<00:03:13.790> asymmetrical<00:03:14.790> grip<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:17.280> can<00:03:17.310> either

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
this asymmetrical grip you can either

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.370 
this asymmetrical grip you can either
hold<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:17.940> in<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.060> traditional<00:03:18.209> way<00:03:18.630> like<00:03:19.080> this

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
hold it in a traditional way like this

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.280 
hold it in a traditional way like this
which<00:03:19.920> I'm<00:03:20.130> most<00:03:20.370> likely<00:03:20.610> well<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:22.050> push

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
which I'm most likely well and you push

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.580 
which I'm most likely well and you push
the<00:03:22.470> buttons<00:03:22.850> with<00:03:23.850> your<00:03:24.060> thumb<00:03:24.330> or<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.440> can

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
the buttons with your thumb or you can

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.670 
the buttons with your thumb or you can
hold<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.180> like<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.080> is<00:03:28.260> why<00:03:28.440> it's

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
hold it like this and this is why it's

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.170 
hold it like this and this is why it's
asymmetrical<00:03:29.550> because<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.880> gives<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.120> a

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
asymmetrical because it gives you a

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.449 
asymmetrical because it gives you a
better<00:03:30.420> grip<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.860> believe<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.310> can

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
better grip and I believe you can

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.000 
better grip and I believe you can
actually<00:03:32.640> put<00:03:33.540> your<00:03:33.690> fingers<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.770> know<00:03:34.800> if

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
actually put your fingers you know if

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.520 
actually put your fingers you know if
your<00:03:35.160> three<00:03:35.430> fingers<00:03:35.850> or<00:03:36.020> however<00:03:37.020> you<00:03:37.350> want

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
your three fingers or however you want

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.560 
your three fingers or however you want
to<00:03:37.620> do<00:03:37.770> it<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.489> can<00:03:38.670> do<00:03:38.820> different<00:03:39.180> kind

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
to do it and you can do different kind

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.640 
to do it and you can do different kind
of<00:03:39.660> button<00:03:39.989> combinations<00:03:40.739> this<00:03:40.980> way<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:43.470> it

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
of button combinations this way and it

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.510 
of button combinations this way and it
feels<00:03:44.130> very<00:03:44.280> stable<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.180> it's<00:03:45.330> easy<00:03:45.660> to

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
feels very stable and it's easy to

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.340 
feels very stable and it's easy to
control<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.850> left<00:03:48.570> part<00:03:48.870> left<00:03:49.230> joystick<00:03:51.350> so

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
control the left part left joystick so

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.310 
control the left part left joystick so
not<00:03:52.590> bad<00:03:52.800> at<00:03:52.980> all<00:03:53.100> so<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.790> have<00:03:53.910> options<00:03:54.630> and

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
not bad at all so you have options and

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
not bad at all so you have options and
options<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:57.030> know<00:03:57.150> period<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:58.100> l2<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.310> the

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
options you know period that l2 and the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.920 
options you know period that l2 and the
r2<00:04:00.260> they<00:04:01.260> don't<00:04:01.440> seem<00:04:01.709> precision<00:04:02.370> like<00:04:02.580> these

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
r2 they don't seem precision like these

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.130 
r2 they don't seem precision like these
you<00:04:03.930> hear<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.380> sounds<00:04:04.650> different<00:04:05.750> now<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.930> may

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
you hear it sounds different now you may

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.280 
you hear it sounds different now you may
ask<00:04:07.320> Wyatt<00:04:07.830> why<00:04:08.489> did<00:04:08.700> they<00:04:08.820> put<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.300> start<00:04:10.110> and

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
ask Wyatt why did they put the start and

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.670
