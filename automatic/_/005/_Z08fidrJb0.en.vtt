 hello guys with you again 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.110
 of course as always a alex beads on 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.960
 export program youth guys yes 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.770
 new today a shorter review of the game double 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.789
 double double 3 points and the 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.740
 basketball guys basketball this 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.170
 the only basketball that I played 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.990
 for money if honestly possible of course 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.700
 there are other basketball and but i'm not about them 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.000
 I know, but here's a tab dribble that I can 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.040
 tell about this game 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.770
 honestly i'm not a basketball fan 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.620
 that's so it can of course someone 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.899
 it's upsetting that because so many 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.649
 love the boards yes but I don't like basketball 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.059
 just but I don't like the kind of sport 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.949
 play it myself for me of course 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.110
 always interesting i mean i don't mind 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.699
 running checks on the ball while playing 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.879
 excusably but his time in childhood 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.549
 play basketball on dendy it was and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.340
 fun pour out from watching him in it 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.939
 not at all interesting but to play yourself on 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.390
 denyuzhku here it was yes 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.060
 so mushrooms gave these impressions what 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.930
 up rhythmic hellish won out teeming with their hooks 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.270
 not that the players and oblique mud chimes 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.750
 this one's been just exactly 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.049
 I do not know but sits on the citizens sat 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.570
 do you play your opponent score those 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.810
 almost every way here is just 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.299
 at the ball you ball up handsome 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.000
 you know the opponent so hard 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.390
 took the ball from him and you do not run this 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.640
 quality throws past attacks 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.429
 you get upset picks up your ball at home 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.289
 5 and give again, we just 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.119
 It dealt it is necessary that you do 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.670
 why are they so unlucky 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.289
 now you have to go to the opponent already 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.520
 three in 10 points you understand 10 there 86 because 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.009
 still you score 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.479
 and try to break away from everything already 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.479
 practically catching up with him 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.790
 call your smart goal from this video 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.769
 which is now seen 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.230
 engage would you be drawn with chic 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.709
 just like deities for that time 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:24.209
 this burst out tower two signs bright 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:27.690
 a picture and a peephole to hammer in the form of your yes 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.569
 everything is already reduced from one another to two 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.090
 points and I'll sing went full ass 5 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.440
 nothing will love again you just 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.350
 you suck in full 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.799
 and now the ass again reversible not to score 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:45.359
 you have already exceeded 6 pieces five more 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:48.269
 that again top 5 full burned them but you 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:52.440
 try you play end mystery game 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:55.230
 continues and in the end you win on 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.599
 help by efforts of course endless 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.900
 side of the minute won and it was 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:04.349
 endless joy to be honest 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.840
 against a friend was much more fun because 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:13.069
 what when you play compan 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:16.639
 like me even more but when you just 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:19.889
 so what the hell is going on the screen 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.450
 everyone doesn't know what to do 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.640
 got the ball ran 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.110
 toss over by eventually catching out 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.230
 you nobody can ball each other 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.140
 interfere here damn I do not know shorter than the corner 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.680
 it was the wildest fun in this one gave 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.709
 always just play fun and fun 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.780
 what's good naturally letting mushrooms 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.470
 Of course the graphics of the graphics in the game are very 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.260
 good graphics nice gameplay he 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.800
 simple there are no extra features 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.340
 that is, you know, there is a selection 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.760
 groove there is a punch all enough that is more 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.300
 no buttons no function in the game 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.600
 no 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.420
 it allows you to concentrate 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.670
 exclusively on gameplay 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:12.300
 concentrate yourself on the game you run and 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:16.359
 even count everything therefore yes there was a flu 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:21.760
 basketball for the day I understand that now 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:24.160
 there is n bottom dumb and you know that many 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.040
 can search for that real basketball 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.250
 even thatcher did not tell agree 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:34.020
 I agree, but I recently with my friend 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:37.120
 sat down to play and 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.840
 dugout you already tired of vodka cult not 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.350
 I want to delphi fum yes that's the benjuk played here 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.100
 I think so damn well 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.110
 well, let's go to the granto watch why in 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.510
 childhood won basketball and remember 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.940
 let's not even have swung it 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:58.940
 how about three hours depends 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:01.410
 understand at 3 o'clock, you think at 3 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.960
 pajero will all explain forever that game 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.360
 so in order to another great basketball 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.110
 swing play have fun 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.500
 but I think this is better than basketball at all. 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:17.010
 in all stories speaks faster than real 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.660
