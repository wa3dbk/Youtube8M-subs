00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
all these obstacles again more tedious

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.759 
all these obstacles again more tedious
than<00:02:23.400> fun<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:24.090> think<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.019> there's<00:02:25.350> nothing

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
than fun I think that there's nothing

inherently<00:02:26.250> wrong<00:02:26.489> with<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.180> game<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.510> it's

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
inherently wrong with this game and it's

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.740 
inherently wrong with this game and it's
fine<00:02:28.410> for<00:02:28.440> kids<00:02:28.950> but<00:02:29.519> at<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> same<00:02:29.910> time<00:02:30.150> you'd

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
fine for kids but at the same time you'd

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.210 
fine for kids but at the same time you'd
think<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.080> game<00:02:31.260> for<00:02:31.470> kids<00:02:31.620> would<00:02:31.830> be<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:31.980> little

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
think a game for kids would be a little

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.030 
think a game for kids would be a little
more<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.760> don't<00:02:33.390> fun<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:34.380> they<00:02:34.530> wouldn't<00:02:34.799> just

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
more I don't fun that they wouldn't just

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.920 
more I don't fun that they wouldn't just
put<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.400> monsters<00:02:35.850> behind<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.239> tedious<00:02:36.690> game

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
put the monsters behind a tedious game

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.690 
put the monsters behind a tedious game
of<00:02:37.200> unlocking<00:02:37.860> mini-games

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
of unlocking mini-games

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.580 
of unlocking mini-games
I<00:02:38.730> don't<00:02:39.150> know<00:02:39.209> just<00:02:39.450> just<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.870> strange<00:02:40.200> design

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
I don't know just just a strange design

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.710 
I don't know just just a strange design
choice<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:41.130> me<00:02:41.310> games<00:02:41.850> also<00:02:42.060> don't<00:02:42.360> explain

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
choice to me games also don't explain

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.509 
choice to me games also don't explain
themselves<00:02:42.959> much<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.799> it's<00:02:44.130> actually<00:02:44.310> a

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
themselves much so it's actually a

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:57.800 
themselves much so it's actually a
little<00:02:44.640> confusing<00:02:45.239> at<00:02:45.450> times<00:02:45.480> too

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.680 

but<00:02:58.810> for<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.319> avid<00:03:00.010> Moshlings<00:03:00.700> fan<00:03:01.000> yeah

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
but for the avid Moshlings fan yeah

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.420 
but for the avid Moshlings fan yeah
that's<00:03:02.290> probably<00:03:02.620> just<00:03:02.980> fine

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
that's probably just fine

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.940 
that's probably just fine
I<00:03:03.459> mean<00:03:03.849> they're<00:03:04.390> in<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.569> theme<00:03:04.870> park<00:03:05.440> try<00:03:05.709> not

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
I mean they're in a theme park try not

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.100 
I mean they're in a theme park try not
to<00:03:05.980> find<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.550> adorable<00:03:06.700> can't<00:03:07.390> be<00:03:07.540> done

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
to find that adorable can't be done

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.960 
to find that adorable can't be done
it's<00:03:08.680> Moshlings<00:03:09.190> theme<00:03:09.430> park<00:03:09.700> for<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.970> 3ds

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.000 

Oh
