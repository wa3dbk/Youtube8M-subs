hi everybody welcome to another career
tutorial<00:00:02.010> I'm<00:00:02.250> quite<00:00:02.490> man<00:00:02.639> we're<00:00:03.449> going<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.600> do

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
tutorial I'm quite man we're going to do

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.510 
tutorial I'm quite man we're going to do
this<00:00:03.840> time<00:00:04.020> three<00:00:04.140> are<00:00:04.230> going<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.500> make<00:00:04.560> steam

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
this time three are going to make steam

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.690 
this time three are going to make steam
and<00:00:05.790> we're<00:00:06.660> not<00:00:06.750> going<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:07.020> do<00:00:07.140> it<00:00:07.259> using

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
and we're not going to do it using

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.820 
and we're not going to do it using
clouds<00:00:08.700> or<00:00:09.240> fog<00:00:09.840> or<00:00:10.080> any<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> volumetric

clouds or fog or any of the volumetric
effects<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.400> think<00:00:11.580> we're<00:00:11.700> going<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.210> use

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
effects you think we're going to use

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.360 
effects you think we're going to use
what<00:00:13.049> we're<00:00:13.139> going<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.740> use<00:00:14.190> our

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
what we're going to do is use our

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.090 
what we're going to do is use our
particle<00:00:14.849> emitter<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.269> some<00:00:15.809> lights<00:00:16.020> let<00:00:17.010> me

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
particle emitter and some lights let me

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.990 
particle emitter and some lights let me
show<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.220> what<00:00:17.340> i'm<00:00:17.400> talkin<00:00:17.640> about<00:00:17.699> let's<00:00:17.820> go

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
show you what i'm talkin about let's go

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.060 
show you what i'm talkin about let's go
ahead<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.240> drop<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.230> particle<00:00:19.650> emitter<00:00:19.859> into

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
ahead and drop a particle emitter into

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.240 
ahead and drop a particle emitter into
our<00:00:20.160> scene<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:21.380> let's<00:00:22.380> do<00:00:22.560> some<00:00:22.740> stuff<00:00:22.980> here

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
our scene and let's do some stuff here

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.700 
our scene and let's do some stuff here
let's<00:00:23.670> go<00:00:23.760> ahead<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:23.939> change<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:25.050> shape<00:00:25.320> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
let's go ahead and change the shape to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.980 
let's go ahead and change the shape to
objects<00:00:26.510> because<00:00:27.510> we're<00:00:27.599> going<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.779> use<00:00:27.869> our

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
objects because we're going to use our

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.769 
objects because we're going to use our
lights<00:00:28.849> let's<00:00:29.849> change<00:00:30.090> our<00:00:30.210> mission<00:00:30.570> cube

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
lights let's change our mission cube

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:38.840 
lights let's change our mission cube
just<00:00:31.019> slightly<00:00:31.640> 3<00:00:34.309> by<00:00:35.660> 2<00:00:37.040> and<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.579> do<00:00:38.700> this

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
just slightly 3 by 2 and we do this

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.299 
just slightly 3 by 2 and we do this
because<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:40.260> focal<00:00:40.590> point<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> camera<00:00:41.219> is

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
because the focal point on the camera is

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.170 
because the focal point on the camera is
going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.520> help<00:00:41.989> shape<00:00:42.989> our<00:00:43.670> mission<00:00:44.670> cube<00:00:44.910> not

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
going to help shape our mission cube not

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.830 
going to help shape our mission cube not
so<00:00:45.329> much<00:00:45.450> like<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> cube<00:00:47.090> lifetimes<00:00:48.090> cool<00:00:48.390> for

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
so much like a cube lifetimes cool for

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.970 
so much like a cube lifetimes cool for
what<00:00:49.140> we're<00:00:49.289> doing<00:00:49.590> all<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.460> cool<00:00:51.980> let's

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
what we're doing all this is cool let's

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.080 
what we're doing all this is cool let's
go<00:00:53.070> ahead<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.219> generate<00:00:53.399> particles<00:00:53.940> before

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
go ahead and generate particles before

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.840 
go ahead and generate particles before
start<00:00:54.570> click<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.469> middle<00:00:55.710> here<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.129> go<00:00:56.250> 01

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
start click in the middle here and go 01

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.959 
start click in the middle here and go 01
and<00:00:57.980> we're<00:00:58.980> good<00:00:59.570> that's<00:01:00.570> all<00:01:00.780> good<00:01:01.070> now<00:01:02.070> let's

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
and we're good that's all good now let's

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.939 
and we're good that's all good now let's
go<00:01:03.300> ahead<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.449> work<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.899> our<00:01:04.019> shape<00:01:04.290> since<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
go ahead and work on our shape since the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.500 
go ahead and work on our shape since the
shape<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.869> objects<00:01:06.869> let's<00:01:07.619> go<00:01:07.740> ahead<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.920> add

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
shape is objects let's go ahead and add

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.710 
shape is objects let's go ahead and add
lights<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:11.000> we're<00:01:12.000> good<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> go<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.420> can't

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
lights and we're good to go you can't

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.149 
lights and we're good to go you can't
really<00:01:12.900> see<00:01:12.990> right<00:01:13.350> there<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:13.740> you're<00:01:14.040> good

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
really see right there but you're good

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.039 
really see right there but you're good
to<00:01:14.250> go<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.640> let's<00:01:15.570> go<00:01:15.630> ahead<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.780> turn<00:01:15.900> our

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
to go and let's go ahead and turn our

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.789 
to go and let's go ahead and turn our
gravity<00:01:16.470> off<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.009> minus<00:01:17.430> 10<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
gravity off this minus 10 is going to

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.890 
gravity off this minus 10 is going to
start<00:01:20.130> bringing<00:01:20.580> our<00:01:20.820> objects<00:01:21.330> back<00:01:21.509> down<00:01:21.750> at

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
start bringing our objects back down at

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.080 
start bringing our objects back down at
the<00:01:22.020> apex<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:23.189> really<00:01:23.430> doesn't<00:01:23.729> matter<00:01:23.820> since

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the apex it really doesn't matter since

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.789 
the apex it really doesn't matter since
we're<00:01:24.299> generating<00:01:24.630> particles<00:01:25.200> before<00:01:25.320> start

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
we're generating particles before start

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.999 
we're generating particles before start
but<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.180> an<00:01:27.450> animation<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.770> going<00:01:28.950> to

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
but if you do an animation it's going to

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.800 
but if you do an animation it's going to
be<00:01:29.070> really<00:01:29.220> noticeable<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.420> let's<00:01:30.720> go<00:01:30.780> ahead

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
be really noticeable so let's go ahead

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.969 
be really noticeable so let's go ahead
and<00:01:31.280> just<00:01:32.280> punch<00:01:33.210> 0<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.900> we're<00:01:34.740> good<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> go

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
and just punch 0 and we're good to go

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.270 
and just punch 0 and we're good to go
with<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:36.740> now<00:01:37.740> let's<00:01:37.890> go<00:01:37.950> ahead<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.100> focus

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
with that now let's go ahead and focus

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.500 
with that now let's go ahead and focus
on<00:01:38.549> our<00:01:38.640> light<00:01:38.930> of<00:01:39.930> course<00:01:40.170> 0

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
on our light of course 0

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:51.640 
on our light of course 0
and<00:01:42.310> change<00:01:43.310> our<00:01:43.610> light<00:01:44.060> into<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:47.020> bulb

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.740 

and<00:01:51.890> we're<00:01:52.670> good<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:52.910> go<00:01:52.940> let's<00:01:53.390> go<00:01:53.540> ahead<00:01:53.600> and

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
and we're good to go let's go ahead and

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.010 
and we're good to go let's go ahead and
go<00:01:53.990> in<00:01:54.080> our<00:01:54.200> particle<00:01:54.440> emitter<00:01:54.800> and<00:01:56.020> here's

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
go in our particle emitter and here's

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.600 
go in our particle emitter and here's
our<00:01:57.140> particles<00:01:57.590> here's<00:01:57.800> let's<00:01:58.370> go<00:01:58.460> ahead<00:01:58.520> and

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
our particles here's let's go ahead and

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.010 
our particles here's let's go ahead and
change<00:01:58.820> this<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.090> mesh<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.570> so<00:01:59.720> we<00:01:59.810> can<00:01:59.840> see

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
change this to mesh to so we can see

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.000 
change this to mesh to so we can see
what's<00:02:00.170> going<00:02:00.230> on<00:02:00.500> see<00:02:01.430> how<00:02:02.440> see<00:02:03.440> how<00:02:03.470> our<00:02:03.740> our

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
what's going on see how see how our our

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.520 
what's going on see how see how our our
light<00:02:04.820> bulbs<00:02:05.120> are<00:02:05.240> all<00:02:05.360> kind<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.630> clumped

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
light bulbs are all kind of clumped

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.690 
light bulbs are all kind of clumped
together<00:02:06.590> let's<00:02:06.980> quit<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:07.690> push<00:02:08.690> s<00:02:08.990> and<00:02:09.700> then

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
together let's quit and push s and then

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
together let's quit and push s and then
shrink<00:02:11.150> them<00:02:11.270> down<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.480> little<00:02:11.690> bit<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:13.720> that's

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
shrink them down a little bit and that's

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.580 
shrink them down a little bit and that's
good<00:02:14.990> that<00:02:15.500> is<00:02:16.010> fine<00:02:16.540> go<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.720> focus<00:02:18.080> on<00:02:18.380> that

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
good that is fine go and focus on that

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.290 
good that is fine go and focus on that
and<00:02:18.800> just<00:02:19.490> for<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.730> heck<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.060> let's<00:02:20.120> go

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
and just for the heck of it let's go

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.520 
and just for the heck of it let's go
ahead<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.450> drop<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.690> sphere<00:02:21.020> into<00:02:21.170> our<00:02:21.320> scene

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
ahead and drop a sphere into our scene

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.990 
ahead and drop a sphere into our scene
so<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.800> we<00:02:21.890> can<00:02:22.010> kind<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.340> see<00:02:22.520> what's<00:02:22.700> going

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
so that we can kind of see what's going

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.070 
so that we can kind of see what's going
on<00:02:23.120> as<00:02:23.420> far<00:02:24.350> as<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.580> way<00:02:25.730> our<00:02:26.000> fog<00:02:26.420> our<00:02:26.690> steam

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
on as far as the way our fog our steam

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.210 
on as far as the way our fog our steam
is<00:02:27.410> going<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.800> affect<00:02:28.130> our<00:02:30.040> objects<00:02:31.040> in<00:02:31.190> our

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
is going to affect our objects in our

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.440 
is going to affect our objects in our
scene<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:31.700> let's<00:02:31.820> go<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.060> put<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.300> behind

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
scene so let's go and put that behind

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.920 
scene so let's go and put that behind
there<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.080> let's<00:02:33.890> check<00:02:34.100> it<00:02:34.220> out<00:02:34.930> surrender

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
there and let's check it out surrender

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.810 
there and let's check it out surrender
and<00:02:37.150> yikes<00:02:38.890> what<00:02:39.890> happened<00:02:40.250> here<00:02:40.459> is<00:02:42.520> we<00:02:43.520> have

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
and yikes what happened here is we have

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.199 
and yikes what happened here is we have
a<00:02:44.740> two<00:02:45.740> hundred<00:02:45.920> particles<00:02:46.550> give<00:02:46.790> or<00:02:46.940> take

give or take 50 150 to 250 particles in

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.720 
give or take 50 150 to 250 particles in
the<00:02:53.720> scene<00:02:54.020> because<00:02:54.980> we<00:02:55.130> have<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.280> second<00:02:55.670> so

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
the scene because we have a second so

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.070 
the scene because we have a second so
worth<00:02:55.850> of<00:02:56.000> particles<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:57.910> all<00:02:58.910> 200<00:02:59.900> or

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
worth of particles and all 200 or

worth of particles and all 200 or
whatever<00:03:00.980> 200<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.519> those<00:03:01.700> are<00:03:02.440> emitting<00:03:03.440> light

whatever 200 of those are emitting light

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.949 
whatever 200 of those are emitting light
now<00:03:04.430> you<00:03:04.760> can<00:03:04.880> do<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.390> can<00:03:05.420> do<00:03:05.600> a<00:03:05.630> couple<00:03:05.900> of

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
now you can do you can do a couple of

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.470 
now you can do you can do a couple of
different<00:03:06.230> things<00:03:06.410> look<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:06.800> can<00:03:07.450> affect<00:03:08.450> the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
different things look you can affect the

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.120 
different things look you can affect the
brightness<00:03:08.930> if<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:09.170> want<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.739> can<00:03:09.830> affect

brightness if you want to you can affect

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.250 
brightness if you want to you can affect

the range range fall off but what we
want<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.530> do<00:03:12.709> is<00:03:13.010> go<00:03:13.370> up<00:03:13.430> here<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.790> top<00:03:13.850> and

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
want to do is go up here to the top and

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.350 
want to do is go up here to the top and
restrict<00:03:15.680> lighting<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.190> all<00:03:16.459> out<00:03:16.820> objects

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.050 

nothing<00:03:26.969> which<00:03:27.969> is<00:03:28.120> cool<00:03:28.329> because<00:03:29.849> we<00:03:30.849> didn't

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
nothing which is cool because we didn't

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.369 
nothing which is cool because we didn't
really<00:03:31.239> want<00:03:31.450> anything<00:03:31.510> in<00:03:31.930> there<00:03:32.079> anyway

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
really want anything in there anyway

really want anything in there anyway
it's<00:03:32.829> going<00:03:33.040> through<00:03:33.189> another<00:03:33.280> bulb<00:03:33.670> in<00:03:33.819> there

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
it's going through another bulb in there

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:39.720 
it's going through another bulb in there
and<00:03:34.090> give<00:03:34.209> us<00:03:34.299> some<00:03:34.329> light<00:03:36.780> perfect<00:03:37.780> now<00:03:38.730> we

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
and give us some light perfect now we

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.640 
and give us some light perfect now we
don't<00:03:39.819> really<00:03:40.090> want<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.450> lights<00:03:40.959> for<00:03:41.500> our

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
don't really want the lights for our

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.679 
don't really want the lights for our
particle<00:03:42.099> particle<00:03:42.790> emitter<00:03:43.120> what<00:03:43.329> we<00:03:43.450> want

particle particle emitter what we want

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.390 
particle particle emitter what we want
is<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.200> effects<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:45.010> lights<00:03:45.189> can

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
is the effects that the lights can

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.809 
is the effects that the lights can
generate<00:03:45.790> so<00:03:46.540> let's<00:03:46.810> go<00:03:46.870> ahead<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.819> click

generate so let's go ahead and click
these<00:03:49.060> up<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:49.629> go<00:03:50.469> down<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.769> our<00:03:50.919> light

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
these up and go down to our light

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.830 
these up and go down to our light
effects<00:03:51.669> and<00:03:52.239> let's<00:03:52.480> click<00:03:52.750> glow<00:03:53.219> and<00:03:54.840> yikes

see<00:03:56.530> how<00:03:56.680> that<00:03:56.739> is<00:03:57.090> now<00:03:58.139> there's<00:03:59.139> only<00:03:59.230> two

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
see how that is now there's only two

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.140 
see how that is now there's only two
sliders<00:03:59.769> here<00:04:00.099> there's<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.459> glow<00:04:00.609> size<00:04:00.909> and

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
sliders here there's the glow size and

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.209 
sliders here there's the glow size and
the<00:04:01.209> intensity<00:04:01.659> we<00:04:02.560> can<00:04:02.680> go<00:04:02.769> ahead<00:04:02.889> and<00:04:02.980> crank

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:03.219 
the intensity we can go ahead and crank

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:09.839 
the intensity we can go ahead and crank
these<00:04:03.400> down<00:04:03.699> to<00:04:03.939> five<00:04:04.299> apiece<00:04:08.519> now<00:04:09.519> let's<00:04:09.699> look

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
these down to five apiece now let's look

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.790 
these down to five apiece now let's look
at<00:04:10.000> it

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.840 

steamy<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:15.340> that's<00:04:16.340> pretty<00:04:16.519> much<00:04:16.640> your

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
steamy and that's pretty much your

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.120 
steamy and that's pretty much your
that's<00:04:17.090> pretty<00:04:17.330> much<00:04:17.420> a<00:04:17.480> stain<00:04:17.810> but<00:04:18.260> if<00:04:18.560> you

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
that's pretty much a stain but if you

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.110 
that's pretty much a stain but if you
want<00:04:19.280> to<00:04:19.340> take<00:04:19.459> it<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.580> little<00:04:19.700> bit<00:04:19.880> further

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
want to take it a little bit further

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.670 
give this thing a backdrop let's make a
color<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:27.400> let's<00:04:28.400> make<00:04:28.670> that<00:04:28.880> color<00:04:29.210> a<00:04:29.690> kind

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
color and let's make that color a kind

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.880 
color and let's make that color a kind
of<00:04:30.770> warm<00:04:31.010> color<00:04:34.960> let's<00:04:35.960> look<00:04:36.110> at<00:04:36.230> our<00:04:36.260> steam<00:04:36.560> on

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
of warm color let's look at our steam on

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.810 
of warm color let's look at our steam on
that<00:04:37.460> now<00:04:38.150> you<00:04:38.180> see<00:04:38.450> how<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:39.460> well<00:04:40.460> it's

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
that now you see how the well it's

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.760 
that now you see how the well it's
actually<00:04:40.940> kind<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.330> good<00:04:41.480> but<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:42.350> steam<00:04:42.590> when

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
actually kind of good but the steam when

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.680 
actually kind of good but the steam when
it<00:04:42.890> goes<00:04:43.010> against<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.400> background<00:04:43.610> what<00:04:44.570> you

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
it goes against the background what you

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.070 
it goes against the background what you
can<00:04:44.810> do<00:04:44.960> is<00:04:46.120> is<00:04:47.120> change<00:04:47.540> the<00:04:47.720> color<00:04:47.900> a<00:04:47.960> little

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
can do is is change the color a little

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.990 
can do is is change the color a little
bit<00:04:48.320> since<00:04:49.070> water<00:04:49.820> is<00:04:49.940> refractive<00:04:52.000> what's

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
bit since water is refractive what's

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.520 
bit since water is refractive what's
going<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.240> happen<00:04:53.540> if<00:04:53.630> you<00:04:53.750> put<00:04:53.780> whatever<00:04:54.290> your

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
going to happen if you put whatever your

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.950 
going to happen if you put whatever your
colors<00:04:54.830> are<00:04:54.950> in<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.190> scene<00:04:55.600> let's<00:04:56.600> go<00:04:56.900> ahead

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
colors are in the scene let's go ahead

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.010 
colors are in the scene let's go ahead
and<00:04:57.050> do<00:04:57.200> a<00:04:57.230> gradient

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.550 

yeah<00:05:03.680> that's<00:05:03.979> fine

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
yeah that's fine

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:13.170 
yeah that's fine
that's<00:05:06.160> fine<00:05:06.460> right<00:05:06.490> there<00:05:06.730> okay

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.200 

you<00:05:13.780> can<00:05:14.460> yeah<00:05:15.460> we<00:05:15.580> don't<00:05:15.669> need<00:05:15.820> this<00:05:15.940> fear

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
you can yeah we don't need this fear

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.780 
you can yeah we don't need this fear
anymore

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.760 

you<00:05:22.390> see<00:05:22.570> how<00:05:22.660> that<00:05:22.720> looks<00:05:22.840> what<00:05:23.350> you<00:05:23.470> can<00:05:23.620> do

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
you see how that looks what you can do

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.490 
you see how that looks what you can do
to<00:05:24.490> kind<00:05:24.640> of<00:05:24.760> help<00:05:25.090> it<00:05:25.540> blend<00:05:25.780> in<00:05:26.080> a<00:05:26.170> little<00:05:26.200> bit

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
to kind of help it blend in a little bit

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.570 
to kind of help it blend in a little bit
is<00:05:26.740> a<00:05:27.030> pick<00:05:28.030> a<00:05:28.060> color<00:05:28.360> if<00:05:28.960> you<00:05:29.650> have<00:05:29.860> a<00:05:29.890> warm

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
is a pick a color if you have a warm

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.190 
is a pick a color if you have a warm
scene<00:05:30.820> or<00:05:30.940> a<00:05:30.970> cool<00:05:31.150> scene<00:05:31.480> since<00:05:31.690> water<00:05:32.110> is

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
scene or a cool scene since water is

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.200 
scene or a cool scene since water is
refractive<00:05:32.830> you're<00:05:33.820> going<00:05:33.940> to<00:05:34.000> want<00:05:34.120> to

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
refractive you're going to want to

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.870 
refractive you're going to want to
probably<00:05:34.740> throw<00:05:35.740> a<00:05:35.770> little<00:05:35.950> bit<00:05:36.190> of<00:05:36.220> color<00:05:36.670> in

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
probably throw a little bit of color in

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.710 
probably throw a little bit of color in
there<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.270> kind<00:05:37.420> of<00:05:38.850> hide<00:05:39.850> the<00:05:40.030> factories<00:05:40.540> in

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
there to kind of hide the factories in

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.080 
there to kind of hide the factories in
effect

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.330 

and<00:05:45.210> that's<00:05:45.900> a<00:05:45.990> little<00:05:46.080> more<00:05:46.350> it<00:05:46.740> looks<00:05:47.220> like

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
and that's a little more it looks like

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.740 
and that's a little more it looks like
it<00:05:47.490> absorbs<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.210> light<00:05:48.360> a<00:05:48.419> little<00:05:48.480> more

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
it absorbs the light a little more

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.010 
it absorbs the light a little more
something<00:05:49.350> else<00:05:49.590> you<00:05:49.740> can<00:05:49.770> do<00:05:50.040> you<00:05:50.730> can

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
something else you can do you can

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.850 
something else you can do you can
duplicate<00:05:52.020> that<00:05:52.380> light<00:05:52.800> and<00:05:53.960> then<00:05:54.960> make<00:05:55.680> it<00:05:55.800> a

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
duplicate that light and then make it a

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.740 
duplicate that light and then make it a
different<00:05:56.040> color<00:05:56.220> a<00:05:56.760> lighter<00:05:57.479> or<00:05:57.600> darker

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
different color a lighter or darker

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.250 
different color a lighter or darker
color<00:05:59.270> I'm<00:06:00.270> just<00:06:00.360> going<00:06:00.570> to<00:06:00.600> make<00:06:00.690> that<00:06:00.840> red<00:06:01.110> so

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
color I'm just going to make that red so

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.430 
color I'm just going to make that red so
that<00:06:01.380> we<00:06:01.440> can<00:06:01.590> see<00:06:01.800> it

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.920 

and<00:06:06.560> see<00:06:07.220> how<00:06:07.400> it<00:06:07.760> mixes<00:06:08.180> in<00:06:08.330> there<00:06:08.510> if<00:06:08.720> that

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
and see how it mixes in there if that

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.690 
and see how it mixes in there if that
was<00:06:09.050> a<00:06:09.080> gray<00:06:09.440> it<00:06:10.100> would<00:06:10.250> look<00:06:10.400> like<00:06:10.460> that

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
was a gray it would look like that

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.200 
was a gray it would look like that
there's<00:06:10.970> density<00:06:11.720> in<00:06:11.840> the<00:06:11.960> in<00:06:12.230> the<00:06:12.290> steam<00:06:13.210> one

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
there's density in the in the steam one

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.840 
there's density in the in the steam one
one<00:06:14.570> other<00:06:14.690> thing<00:06:14.840> you<00:06:15.080> can<00:06:15.110> do<00:06:15.350> too<00:06:15.650> is<00:06:15.890> you

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
one other thing you can do too is you

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.340 
one other thing you can do too is you
can<00:06:16.970> go<00:06:17.090> to<00:06:17.180> the<00:06:17.270> effects<00:06:17.630> and<00:06:20.050> let's<00:06:21.050> go<00:06:21.200> ahead

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
can go to the effects and let's go ahead

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:27.370 
can go to the effects and let's go ahead
and<00:06:21.940> make<00:06:22.940> our<00:06:22.970> glow<00:06:23.330> size<00:06:24.280> 10<00:06:26.260> keep<00:06:27.260> the

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
and make our glow size 10 keep the

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:33.550 
and make our glow size 10 keep the
intensity<00:06:27.650> where<00:06:28.010> it's<00:06:28.130> at<00:06:28.310> now<00:06:32.380> see<00:06:33.380> that

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
intensity where it's at now see that

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.310 
intensity where it's at now see that
before

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.850 

and<00:06:37.410> after<00:06:38.450> see<00:06:39.450> how<00:06:39.540> much<00:06:39.720> how<00:06:40.410> much<00:06:40.590> more

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
and after see how much how much more

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.950 
and after see how much how much more
steam<00:06:41.190> you<00:06:41.340> got<00:06:41.520> play<00:06:42.330> around<00:06:42.510> with<00:06:42.690> a<00:06:42.720> little

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
steam you got play around with a little

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.600 
steam you got play around with a little
bit<00:06:43.140> it's<00:06:43.560> actually<00:06:44.130> a<00:06:44.190> pretty<00:06:44.340> cool<00:06:44.430> trick

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
bit it's actually a pretty cool trick

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.120 
bit it's actually a pretty cool trick
now<00:06:45.540> the<00:06:45.600> whole<00:06:46.020> reason<00:06:46.320> that<00:06:46.350> I<00:06:46.530> did<00:06:46.710> this<00:06:46.890> is

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
now the whole reason that I did this is

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.340 
now the whole reason that I did this is
so<00:06:47.280> that<00:06:47.430> we<00:06:47.520> can<00:06:47.700> so<00:06:48.630> I<00:06:48.660> can<00:06:48.720> kind<00:06:48.990> of<00:06:49.110> show<00:06:49.260> you

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
so that we can so I can kind of show you

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.980 
so that we can so I can kind of show you
that<00:06:49.500> a<00:06:50.190> lot<00:06:50.700> of<00:06:50.730> people<00:06:50.820> think<00:06:51.510> that<00:06:51.570> careers

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
that a lot of people think that careers

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.780 
that a lot of people think that careers
effects<00:06:52.380> are<00:06:52.530> kind<00:06:52.680> of<00:06:52.740> cheesy<00:06:53.040> and<00:06:53.580> not

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:53.790 
effects are kind of cheesy and not

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.970 
effects are kind of cheesy and not
really<00:06:54.030> what<00:06:54.180> they<00:06:54.330> want<00:06:54.600> but<00:06:55.290> I<00:06:55.590> beg<00:06:55.950> to

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
really what they want but I beg to

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.580 
really what they want but I beg to
differ<00:06:56.100> I<00:06:56.940> think<00:06:57.840> it's<00:06:57.990> a<00:06:58.080> matter<00:06:58.230> of<00:06:58.350> getting

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
differ I think it's a matter of getting
