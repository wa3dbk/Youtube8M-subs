the<00:03:15.340> carbon<00:03:15.730> felt<00:03:15.970> was<00:03:16.920> bitch<00:03:17.920> poke<00:03:18.310> holes

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
the carbon felt was bitch poke holes

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.120

through<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:19.150> what<00:03:19.299> I<00:03:19.329> did<00:03:19.450> is<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:19.930> just<00:03:20.070> took<00:03:21.070> a

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
through so what I did is I just took a

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.229 
through so what I did is I just took a
piece<00:03:21.370> of<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.640> narrow<00:03:21.910> shaft<00:03:22.329> and<00:03:22.750> press<00:03:23.620> down

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
piece of a narrow shaft and press down

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.180 
piece of a narrow shaft and press down
around<00:03:25.980> each<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.340> threads<00:03:27.610> there<00:03:29.190> until

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
around each of the threads there until

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.699 
around each of the threads there until
it<00:03:30.640> would<00:03:30.790> start<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.720> tear<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.350> just<00:03:32.530> kept

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
it would start to tear and just kept

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.800 
it would start to tear and just kept
pressing<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.430> took<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.640> razor<00:03:33.970> knife<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.720> just

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.960 
pressing and took a razor knife and just
cut<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.260> top<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:36.040> slightly<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:36.730> that

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
cut the top and to it slightly so that

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.750
