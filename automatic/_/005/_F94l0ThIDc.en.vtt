technology that they invented over in

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.390 
technology that they invented over in
Japan<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.739> first<00:00:40.949> thing<00:00:41.129> you'll<00:00:41.280> notice

that's really really different is the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.560 
that's really really different is the
mute<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.470> shape<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> mute<00:00:44.190> mute<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.360> now

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
mute the shape of the mute mute is now

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.590 
mute the shape of the mute mute is now
soup-like<00:00:46.379> featherweight<00:00:47.280> light<00:00:47.610> fits<00:00:48.390> all

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.189 
the way into the belt flush with the
belt<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.820> actually<00:00:50.969> keep<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.960> in

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
belt so you can actually keep this in

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
in my own house again so the technology

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.210 
in my own house again so the technology
that<00:01:12.600> we've<00:01:12.990> introduced<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.710> called<00:01:13.920> brass

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
that we've introduced is called brass

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.609 
that we've introduced is called brass
resonance<00:01:14.880> modeling<00:01:15.450> basically<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.470> old

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
resonance modeling basically the old

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.429 
resonance modeling basically the old
mute<00:01:16.920> had<00:01:17.160> a<00:01:17.190> microphone<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> sound<00:01:19.170> box

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
mute had a microphone to the sound box

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.499 
mute had a microphone to the sound box
to<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> headphones<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.939> what<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.390> was

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
to the headphones so what it was

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.350 
to the headphones so what it was
amplifying<00:01:22.200> was<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.759> sound<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
amplifying was the the sound of the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.390 
amplifying was the the sound of the
instrument<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:25.140> was<00:01:25.290> deadened<00:01:25.770> by<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.040> seal

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
instrument that was deadened by the seal

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.429 
instrument that was deadened by the seal
of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.640> mute<00:01:26.970> what<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.840> bet<00:01:28.020> what<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.259> did

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
of the mute what to bet what they did

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.020 
of the mute what to bet what they did
over<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.710> Japan<00:01:28.979> these<00:01:29.369> guys<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.700> super

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
over in Japan these guys are super

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.359 
over in Japan these guys are super
creative<00:01:30.180> they<00:01:31.020> took<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.439> live<00:01:31.680> sound<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
creative they took the live sound of the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.370 
creative they took the live sound of the
open<00:01:32.700> instrument<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.360> then<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.930> sound<00:01:34.170> of

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
open instrument and then the sound of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.800 
open instrument and then the sound of
the<00:01:34.470> muted<00:01:34.829> instrument<00:01:35.400> mesh<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.299> two<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the muted instrument mesh the two and

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.170 
the muted instrument mesh the two and
then<00:01:37.200> used<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.920> cancel<00:01:38.490> out<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.909> sound

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
then used that to cancel out the sound

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.420 
then used that to cancel out the sound
of<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> dead<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.840> mute<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.470> brass<00:01:40.770> resonance

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
of the dead and mute so brass resonance

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.899 
of the dead and mute so brass resonance
modeling<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:43.320> just

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
modeling and what you get is a just

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.999 
modeling and what you get is a just
unbelievably<00:01:44.909> realistic<00:01:45.780> sound<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.500> feel<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
unbelievably realistic sound and feel to

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.039 
unbelievably realistic sound and feel to

forget that you have a mute in the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.090 
forget that you have a mute in the
instrument<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:56.350> one<00:01:56.710> of<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:56.890> neatest

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
instrument and the one of the neatest

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.340 
instrument and the one of the neatest
parts<00:01:57.610> of<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.790> technology<00:01:58.480> is<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.870> they've

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
parts of the technology is that they've

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.890 
parts of the technology is that they've
actually<00:01:59.380> balanced<00:02:00.340> left<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.730> right<00:02:00.970> which

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
actually balanced left to right which

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.830 
actually balanced left to right which
instrument<00:02:02.650> is<00:02:03.070> which<00:02:03.460> so<00:02:04.150> if<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.450> plug<00:02:04.690> the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
instrument is which so if you plug the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.290 
instrument is which so if you plug the
trombone<00:02:05.320> mute<00:02:05.590> into<00:02:05.980> the<00:02:06.100> system<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:07.000> system

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.450 
trombone mute into the system the system
knows<00:02:07.720> that<00:02:07.750> it's<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.170> trombone<00:02:08.710> mute<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.190> it

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
knows that it's the trombone mute and it

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.190

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
gonna be RIT with the system so that you

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.950 
gonna be RIT with the system so that you
can<00:02:58.860> hear<00:02:58.980> how<00:02:59.190> realistic<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.150> sounds<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.780> hope
