March we'll start tilling the land with
a<00:00:51.960> rototiller<00:00:52.410> we'll<00:00:53.280> lay<00:00:53.489> our<00:00:53.520> plastic<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
a rototiller we'll lay our plastic and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.590 
a rototiller we'll lay our plastic and
then<00:00:54.989> shortly<00:00:55.739> after<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.129> after<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:57.000> get<00:00:57.449> all

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
then shortly after that after we get all

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.150 
then shortly after that after we get all
the<00:00:57.719> water<00:00:57.870> hooked<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.260> before<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.680> plant<00:00:58.920> we

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the water hooked up before we plant we

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.709 
the water hooked up before we plant we
usually<00:00:59.430> try<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> irrigation<00:01:00.359> all

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.540 
usually try to have the irrigation all
ready<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.079> roll<00:01:01.260> before<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.739> plant<00:01:01.949> our<00:01:02.250> field

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
ready to roll before we plant our field

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.399 
ready to roll before we plant our field
and<00:01:02.789> then<00:01:03.149> we'll<00:01:03.329> plant<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.750> field<00:01:04.019> most<00:01:04.260> the

and then we'll plant the field most the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.830 
and then we'll plant the field most the
time<00:01:04.589> around<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.909> tail<00:01:06.119> end<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.450> April

and then after that basically every week

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.179 
and then after that basically every week
we'll<00:01:09.390> plant<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.810> field<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:10.560> try<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.830> keep
