hi<00:00:02.679> this<00:00:03.550> video<00:00:03.730> is<00:00:03.879> going<00:00:03.969> to<00:00:04.120> be<00:00:04.240> about

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:04.479 
hi this video is going to be about

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:06.450 
hi this video is going to be about
deadlifts<00:00:05.229> of<00:00:05.470> the<00:00:05.589> benefits<00:00:06.009> of<00:00:06.100> deadlifts

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:06.460 
deadlifts of the benefits of deadlifts

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.490 
deadlifts of the benefits of deadlifts
of<00:00:06.790> variations<00:00:07.390> of<00:00:07.480> dentists<00:00:07.930> and<00:00:08.049> proper

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:08.500 
of variations of dentists and proper

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.129 
of variations of dentists and proper
safety<00:00:08.740> for<00:00:09.070> deadlifts<00:00:09.630> so<00:00:10.630> the<00:00:10.719> benefits<00:00:11.080> of

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.139 
safety for deadlifts so the benefits of

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.620 
safety for deadlifts so the benefits of
deadlifts<00:00:11.469> is<00:00:11.740> one<00:00:12.070> of<00:00:12.160> the<00:00:12.250> great<00:00:12.630> exercises

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
deadlifts is one of the great exercises

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.690 
deadlifts is one of the great exercises
that<00:00:14.049> works<00:00:14.349> kind<00:00:14.589> of<00:00:14.679> one<00:00:15.219> of<00:00:15.250> the<00:00:15.339> whole<00:00:15.490> body

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
that works kind of one of the whole body

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.990 
that works kind of one of the whole body
works<00:00:16.509> a<00:00:16.630> whole<00:00:16.779> posterior<00:00:17.349> chain<00:00:17.649> which<00:00:18.369> is<00:00:18.970> I

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
works a whole posterior chain which is I

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.179 
works a whole posterior chain which is I
guess<00:00:19.210> technical<00:00:20.050> clinical<00:00:20.590> fancy<00:00:21.009> way<00:00:21.160> to

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
guess technical clinical fancy way to

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.400 
guess technical clinical fancy way to
say<00:00:21.340> works<00:00:21.730> all<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:21.939> back<00:00:22.180> muscles<00:00:22.630> and<00:00:23.290> it

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
say works all the back muscles and it

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.220 
say works all the back muscles and it
works<00:00:23.560> them<00:00:23.800> in<00:00:23.919> synergy<00:00:24.279> so<00:00:25.230> depending<00:00:26.230> on

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
works them in synergy so depending on

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.290 
works them in synergy so depending on
the<00:00:26.410> variation<00:00:26.950> it<00:00:27.610> will<00:00:27.700> target<00:00:27.939> the<00:00:28.090> muscles

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
the variation it will target the muscles

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.440 
the variation it will target the muscles
in<00:00:28.720> different<00:00:29.649> proportions<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:31.029> for<00:00:31.239> the<00:00:31.300> most

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
in different proportions so for the most

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.990 
in different proportions so for the most
part<00:00:31.719> all<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.860> variations<00:00:33.460> work<00:00:33.850> the

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
part all the variations work the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.330 
part all the variations work the
hamstrings<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.930> glutes<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:35.800> erector<00:00:36.100> spinae

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
hamstrings the glutes the erector spinae

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.160 
hamstrings the glutes the erector spinae
muscles<00:00:36.370> which<00:00:37.180> is<00:00:37.330> actually<00:00:37.600> used<00:00:37.870> often

up here the rhomboids rear delts and

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.190 
up here the rhomboids rear delts and
forearms<00:00:48.579> when<00:00:49.210> you<00:00:49.300> have<00:00:49.420> to<00:00:49.510> hold<00:00:49.660> a<00:00:49.810> barbell

or the dumbbell in position it activates

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.470 
or the dumbbell in position it activates
those<00:00:52.989> muscles<00:00:53.700> so<00:00:54.700> there<00:00:54.820> are<00:00:54.910> two<00:00:55.120> main

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
those muscles so there are two main

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.600 
those muscles so there are two main
groups<00:00:55.690> or<00:00:56.200> two<00:00:56.500> types<00:00:56.710> of<00:00:56.829> variations<00:00:57.340> and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
groups or two types of variations and

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.950 
groups or two types of variations and
you<00:00:58.000> know<00:00:58.090> that<00:00:58.239> lots<00:00:58.360> of<00:00:58.540> different<00:00:58.810> names

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
you know that lots of different names

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.240 
you know that lots of different names
for<00:00:59.110> these<00:00:59.320> different<00:00:59.649> types<00:00:59.800> variation

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
for these different types variation

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.530 
for these different types variation
deadlifts<00:01:00.670> let's<00:01:00.850> not<00:01:01.000> get<00:01:01.120> caught<00:01:01.300> in<00:01:01.510> the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
deadlifts let's not get caught in the

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.180 
deadlifts let's not get caught in the
games<00:01:01.810> well<00:01:02.320> let's<00:01:02.470> make<00:01:02.620> sure<00:01:02.680> we<00:01:02.920> know<00:01:03.010> the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
games well let's make sure we know the

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.799 
games well let's make sure we know the
proper<00:01:03.489> form<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:03.940> do<00:01:04.089> them<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.449> how<00:01:04.540> to<00:01:04.600> do

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
proper form to do them and how to do

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.450 
proper form to do them and how to do
them<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:05.140> what<00:01:05.620> the<00:01:05.710> different<00:01:06.010> variations

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
them and what the different variations

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.920 
them and what the different variations
do<00:01:06.670> so<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.330> first<00:01:07.630> main<00:01:07.870> group<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.470> called

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
do so the first main group is called

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.600 
do so the first main group is called
conventional<00:01:10.930> deadlifts<00:01:11.380> sometimes<00:01:12.370> they've

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
conventional deadlifts sometimes they've

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.340 
conventional deadlifts sometimes they've
been<00:01:12.760> often<00:01:13.030> called<00:01:13.360> Russian<00:01:13.630> deadlifts<00:01:14.229> or

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
been often called Russian deadlifts or

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.250 
been often called Russian deadlifts or
bent<00:01:15.220> leg<00:01:15.430> deadlifts<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.479> actually<00:01:17.140> the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
bent leg deadlifts and actually the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.530 
bent leg deadlifts and actually the
first<00:01:17.440> part<00:01:17.770> of<00:01:18.010> a<00:01:18.340> clean<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:19.090> second<00:01:19.420> group

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
first part of a clean the second group

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.530 
first part of a clean the second group
are<00:01:19.900> often<00:01:20.170> called<00:01:20.380> Romanian<00:01:20.920> deadlifts<00:01:21.370> or

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
are often called Romanian deadlifts or

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.740 
are often called Romanian deadlifts or
straight<00:01:22.540> leg<00:01:22.690> dentist<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:24.220> that<00:01:25.060> target

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
straight leg dentist and that target

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.600 
straight leg dentist and that target
slightly<00:01:26.110> different<00:01:26.470> part<00:01:26.710> of<00:01:26.799> different

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
slightly different part of different

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.880 
slightly different part of different

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
ratio to posterior chain athletes more

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.740 
ratio to posterior chain athletes more
hamstrings<00:01:30.430> and<00:01:30.670> your<00:01:30.729> rector<00:01:31.060> spinae<00:01:31.180> and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
hamstrings and your rector spinae and

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.750 
hamstrings and your rector spinae and
blow<00:01:32.320> less<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.770> glutes<00:01:33.070> unlike<00:01:33.670> the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
blow less and glutes unlike the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.969 
blow less and glutes unlike the
conventional<00:01:33.880> goodness<00:01:34.570> so<00:01:35.409> after<00:01:35.740> the

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
conventional goodness so after the

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.800 
conventional goodness so after the
variation<00:01:36.460> is<00:01:36.549> the<00:01:36.640> main<00:01:36.820> thing<00:01:37.119> is<00:01:37.390> went<00:01:37.630> down

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
variation is the main thing is went down

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.210 
variation is the main thing is went down
like<00:01:38.020> I<00:01:38.080> said<00:01:38.320> when<00:01:38.470> done<00:01:38.650> properly<00:01:38.890> and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
like I said when done properly and

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.940 
like I said when done properly and
safely<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:40.119> proper<00:01:40.450> biomechanics<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:41.740> is<00:01:41.920> a

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
safely and proper biomechanics this is a

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.370 
safely and proper biomechanics this is a
great<00:01:42.220> exercise<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.729> work<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.990> posterior

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
great exercise to work the posterior

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.969 
great exercise to work the posterior
chain<00:01:44.970> safety<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:47.020> key<00:01:47.380> in<00:01:47.530> this<00:01:47.650> exercise

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
chain safety is key in this exercise

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.850 
chain safety is key in this exercise
though<00:01:48.369> it's<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:49.420> slightly<00:01:49.689> higher<00:01:50.049> risk<00:01:50.590> if

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
though it's a slightly higher risk if

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.859 
though it's a slightly higher risk if
you<00:01:51.040> don't<00:01:51.220> know<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.460> proper<00:01:51.640> form<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.210> you

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
you don't know the proper form and you

and<00:02:18.940> that's<00:02:19.060> how<00:02:19.180> my<00:02:19.360> back<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:20.050> right<00:02:20.230> now<00:02:20.380> it's

and that's how my back is right now it's

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.460 
and that's how my back is right now it's
an<00:02:20.710> unnatural<00:02:21.070> exposition<00:02:21.880> so<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.170> that's

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
an unnatural exposition so and that's

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.130 
an unnatural exposition so and that's
the<00:02:23.590> reason<00:02:23.860> why<00:02:23.890> we<00:02:24.220> don't<00:02:24.460> teach<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.150> or<00:02:26.050> I

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
the reason why we don't teach the or I

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.800 
the reason why we don't teach the or I
don't<00:02:26.380> teach<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:27.270> traditional<00:02:28.270> stiff<00:02:28.600> leg

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
don't teach the traditional stiff leg

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.870 
don't teach the traditional stiff leg
deadlift<00:02:29.200> because<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:30.190> traditional<00:02:30.640> stiff

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
deadlift because the traditional stiff

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.910

the magician overhand grip for all the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.970 
the magician overhand grip for all the
deadlifts<00:03:33.610> unless<00:03:34.150> you're<00:03:34.390> doing<00:03:34.660> a<00:03:34.980> deadlift

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
deadlifts unless you're doing a deadlift

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.850 
deadlifts unless you're doing a deadlift
competition<00:03:36.670> you<00:03:36.790> can<00:03:36.820> do<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.060> mixed<00:03:37.630> grip<00:03:37.870> and

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
competition you can do a mixed grip and

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.920 
competition you can do a mixed grip and
that's<00:03:39.010> actually<00:03:39.160> stronger<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:40.360> hold<00:03:40.600> on<00:03:40.780> to

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
that's actually stronger to hold on to

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.030 
that's actually stronger to hold on to
the<00:03:41.020> way<00:03:41.140> so<00:03:41.200> we<00:03:41.350> needed<00:03:41.590> higher<00:03:41.770> higher

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
the way so we needed higher higher

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.490 
the way so we needed higher higher
resistance<00:03:42.280> that<00:03:43.060> trip<00:03:43.360> is<00:03:43.480> stronger<00:03:43.870> however

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
resistance that trip is stronger however

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.560 
resistance that trip is stronger however
that's<00:03:44.650> totally<00:03:45.100> not<00:03:45.250> necessary<00:03:45.280> unless<00:03:46.150> I

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
that's totally not necessary unless I

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.720 
that's totally not necessary unless I
except<00:03:46.930> you're<00:03:46.960> doing<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.350> devilish

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730

to do that it's gotcha going to work the

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.980 
to do that it's gotcha going to work the
forearms<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.400> just<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:54.850> grab<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.240> grab<00:03:55.780> the

forearms to just to grab the grab the
grip<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.590> as<00:03:56.860> you<00:03:57.010> increase<00:03:57.310> in<00:03:57.670> resistance

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
grip and as you increase in resistance

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.060 
grip and as you increase in resistance
your<00:03:59.050> farms<00:03:59.440> actually<00:03:59.770> might<00:03:59.860> be<00:03:59.890> the

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
your farms actually might be the

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.100 
your farms actually might be the
limiting<00:04:00.670> factor<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.330> that<00:04:01.600> might<00:04:01.930> be<00:04:02.080> a

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
limiting factor and that might be a

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.390 
limiting factor and that might be a
challenging<00:04:02.590> I'll<00:04:02.740> who<00:04:02.830> launched<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.160> wait

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
challenging I'll who launched the wait

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.300 
challenging I'll who launched the wait
while<00:04:03.910> your<00:04:04.120> backside<00:04:04.660> actually<00:04:05.380> can<00:04:05.620> handle

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
while your backside actually can handle

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.740 
while your backside actually can handle
the<00:04:06.400> weight<00:04:06.550> but<00:04:07.000> actually<00:04:07.300> kind<00:04:07.480> of<00:04:07.540> good

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
the weight but actually kind of good

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.720 
the weight but actually kind of good
because<00:04:08.620> it<00:04:08.740> actually<00:04:08.950> builds<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.370> forearm

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
because it actually builds a forearm

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.220 
because it actually builds a forearm
strength<00:04:09.970> but<00:04:10.360> you<00:04:10.450> can<00:04:10.570> also<00:04:10.690> get<00:04:11.050> those

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
strength but you can also get those

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.780 
strength but you can also get those
straps<00:04:11.530> as<00:04:11.770> well<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.130> strapped<00:04:12.370> onto<00:04:12.550> your

straps as well and strapped onto your

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.520 
straps as well and strapped onto your
hands<00:04:13.120> so<00:04:13.930> what<00:04:14.110> we're<00:04:14.200> going<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.380> do<00:04:14.440> is<00:04:14.500> going

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
hands so what we're going to do is going

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.170 
hands so what we're going to do is going
to<00:04:14.680> take<00:04:14.800> a<00:04:14.830> wider<00:04:15.400> than<00:04:15.670> shoulder-width

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
to take a wider than shoulder-width

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.759 
to take a wider than shoulder-width
great<00:04:17.730> what<00:04:18.730> that<00:04:18.880> does<00:04:19.000> is<00:04:19.030> it<00:04:19.420> makes<00:04:20.049> room

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
great what that does is it makes room

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.370 
great what that does is it makes room
for<00:04:20.799> our<00:04:21.070> knees<00:04:21.250> we're<00:04:21.940> gonna<00:04:22.060> stand<00:04:22.360> your<00:04:23.140> gun

you<00:04:59.950> try<00:05:00.130> to<00:05:00.190> rotate<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.610> little<00:05:00.640> bit<00:05:00.850> more<00:05:01.060> so

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
you try to rotate a little bit more so

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.000 
you try to rotate a little bit more so
you<00:05:01.390> can<00:05:01.510> see<00:05:01.720> that<00:05:01.750> so<00:05:02.560> chest<00:05:02.830> up<00:05:02.980> shoulders

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
you can see that so chest up shoulders

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.000 
you can see that so chest up shoulders
back<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:04.060> can<00:05:04.210> go<00:05:04.300> down<00:05:04.560> you<00:05:05.560> can<00:05:05.710> hit<00:05:05.890> all

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
back you can go down you can hit all

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.230 
back you can go down you can hit all
right<00:05:06.280> for<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.580> wait<00:05:06.730> will<00:05:06.850> hit<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.090> ground

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
right for the wait will hit the ground

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.900 
right for the wait will hit the ground
and<00:05:07.630> then<00:05:08.020> back<00:05:08.230> up<00:05:08.440> now<00:05:09.250> we<00:05:09.310> do<00:05:09.490> this<00:05:09.669> kind<00:05:09.880> of

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
and then back up now we do this kind of

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.210 
and then back up now we do this kind of
bending<00:05:10.180> over<00:05:10.570> because<00:05:11.290> we<00:05:11.770> want<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.010> bar<00:05:12.190> to

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
bending over because we want the bar to

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.620 
bending over because we want the bar to
go<00:05:12.400> on<00:05:12.490> a<00:05:12.580> straight<00:05:12.820> line<00:05:13.000> up<00:05:13.300> and<00:05:13.480> down

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
go on a straight line up and down

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.659 
go on a straight line up and down
because<00:05:14.200> if<00:05:14.440> you<00:05:14.560> ever<00:05:14.650> did<00:05:14.950> you<00:05:15.370> might<00:05:15.490> see

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
because if you ever did you might see

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.490 
because if you ever did you might see
other<00:05:15.820> people<00:05:16.120> teach<00:05:16.330> it<00:05:16.510> like<00:05:16.990> a<00:05:17.020> little<00:05:17.320> more

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
other people teach it like a little more

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.920 
other people teach it like a little more
standing<00:05:18.340> up<00:05:18.490> but<00:05:19.060> then<00:05:19.240> you<00:05:19.450> have<00:05:19.600> to<00:05:19.630> bring

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
standing up but then you have to bring

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.020 
standing up but then you have to bring
the<00:05:20.050> bar<00:05:20.200> forward<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.710> clear<00:05:20.919> your<00:05:21.040> knees<00:05:21.250> so

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
the bar forward to clear your knees so

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.520 
the bar forward to clear your knees so
that's<00:05:22.180> why<00:05:22.360> I<00:05:22.390> acted<00:05:22.750> me<00:05:22.930> over<00:05:23.230> just<00:05:23.380> a<00:05:23.500> little

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
that's why I acted me over just a little

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.990 
that's why I acted me over just a little
bit<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:24.010> hips<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:24.340> this<00:05:24.580> will<00:05:24.700> bit<00:05:24.790> higher

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
bit the hips and this will bit higher

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.430 
bit the hips and this will bit higher
than<00:05:25.030> a<00:05:25.300> regular<00:05:25.540> swap

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.320 

and<00:05:30.610> that<00:05:31.610> is<00:05:31.820> how<00:05:32.030> you<00:05:32.060> do<00:05:34.330> conventional

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
and that is how you do conventional

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.660 
and that is how you do conventional
deadlift<00:05:35.840> I<00:05:36.140> now<00:05:36.800> go<00:05:37.010> over<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:37.370> second

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
deadlift I now go over the second

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.460 
deadlift I now go over the second
variation<00:05:37.940> of<00:05:38.390> often<00:05:38.810> copper<00:05:38.990> Romanian

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
variation of often copper Romanian

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.080 
variation of often copper Romanian
deadlifts<00:05:39.890> and<00:05:40.040> it<00:05:40.310> goes<00:05:40.460> like<00:05:40.490> a<00:05:40.760> little<00:05:41.000> more

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
deadlifts and it goes like a little more

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.050 
deadlifts and it goes like a little more
historical<00:05:41.660> because<00:05:41.990> a<00:05:42.230> remaining<00:05:43.130> weight

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
historical because a remaining weight

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.550 
historical because a remaining weight
lifter<00:05:44.420> actually<00:05:44.780> came<00:05:44.960> up<00:05:44.990> to<00:05:45.260> the<00:05:45.350> exercise

River<00:07:21.860> and<00:07:22.100> I<00:07:22.730> don't<00:07:23.000> recommend<00:07:23.350> the<00:07:24.350> mix<00:07:24.590> trip

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830 
River and I don't recommend the mix trip

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.830 
River and I don't recommend the mix trip
I<00:07:25.010> mean<00:07:25.250> it<00:07:25.430> stronger<00:07:25.940> to<00:07:26.210> hold<00:07:26.389> higher<00:07:26.570> weight

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:26.840 
I mean it stronger to hold higher weight

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.470 
I mean it stronger to hold higher weight
but<00:07:27.350> then<00:07:27.500> you<00:07:27.620> lack<00:07:27.830> some<00:07:28.130> building<00:07:28.850> they<00:07:29.270> can

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:29.480 
but then you lack some building they can

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.610 
but then you lack some building they can
do<00:07:29.600> in<00:07:29.720> your<00:07:29.750> forearms<00:07:30.169> increase<00:07:30.500> your
