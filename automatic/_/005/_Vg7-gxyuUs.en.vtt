garden that is it as healthy-looking as

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.900 
garden that is it as healthy-looking as
the<00:03:20.330> new<00:03:20.540> rhubarb<00:03:20.959> but<00:03:21.230> it's<00:03:22.099> sentimental<00:03:22.430> so

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.190 
the new rhubarb but it's sentimental so
I<00:03:23.000> did<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:25.459> that's<00:03:25.790> pretty<00:03:26.690> much<00:03:26.900> what<00:03:27.170> I

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
I did it and that's pretty much what I

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.100 
I did it and that's pretty much what I
have<00:03:27.500> going<00:03:27.920> on<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.370> front<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:30.019> Z<00:03:31.599> is<00:03:32.599> the

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
have going on in the front and Z is the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.430 
have going on in the front and Z is the
path<00:03:33.349> that<00:03:33.380> I<00:03:33.709> put<00:03:33.980> in<00:03:34.100> last<00:03:34.340> year<00:03:35.319> that<00:03:36.319> I'm

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
path that I put in last year that I'm

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.070 
path that I put in last year that I'm
designing<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:37.340> incorporate<00:03:38.269> perennials<00:03:38.840> and

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
designing to incorporate perennials and

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.900 
designing to incorporate perennials and
plants<00:03:42.080> that<00:03:42.170> attract<00:03:42.470> pollinators<00:03:42.680> my<00:03:43.670> goal

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
plants that attract pollinators my goal

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.320 
plants that attract pollinators my goal
for<00:03:44.269> next<00:03:44.420> year<00:03:44.930> though<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.380> going<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.650> plant

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
for next year though is going to plant

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.520 
for next year though is going to plant
I'd<00:03:47.630> like<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.900> plant<00:03:48.670> flowering<00:03:50.319> plants<00:03:51.319> and

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
I'd like to plant flowering plants and

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.009 
I'd like to plant flowering plants and
think<00:03:52.459> that<00:03:52.610> bloom<00:03:52.849> earlier<00:03:53.480> in<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.810> season

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
think that bloom earlier in the season

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.470 
think that bloom earlier in the season
because<00:03:54.470> most<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:54.860> my<00:03:54.980> things<00:03:55.280> bloom<00:03:55.640> like<00:03:56.299> in

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
because most of my things bloom like in

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.690 
because most of my things bloom like in
July<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:56.959> August<00:03:57.110> so<00:03:57.500> this<00:03:57.680> is<00:03:57.830> awesome<00:03:58.459> for

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
July and August so this is awesome for

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.690 
July and August so this is awesome for
pollinators<00:03:59.470> later<00:04:00.470> but<00:04:01.099> not<00:04:01.250> really<00:04:01.549> right

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
pollinators later but not really right

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.420 
pollinators later but not really right
now<00:04:01.730> for<00:04:02.269> now<00:04:02.390> it's<00:04:02.690> just<00:04:02.799> nice<00:04:03.799> for<00:04:04.040> me

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
now for now it's just nice for me

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.060 
now for now it's just nice for me
so<00:04:05.390> I<00:04:05.780> planted<00:04:06.530> tons<00:04:06.769> of<00:04:06.890> grasses<00:04:08.109> my<00:04:09.109> Spanish

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
so I planted tons of grasses my Spanish

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.280 
so I planted tons of grasses my Spanish
lavender<00:04:10.609> is<00:04:10.940> looking<00:04:11.299> like<00:04:11.480> it<00:04:11.630> died<00:04:11.870> this

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
lavender is looking like it died this

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.180
