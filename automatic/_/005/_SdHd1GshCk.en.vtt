so<00:02:25.010> tacky<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:26.120> that<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.450> other<00:02:26.630> eye<00:02:26.720> shadow<00:02:27.140> is

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
so tacky so that the other eye shadow is

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:38.740 
so tacky so that the other eye shadow is
blending<00:02:27.920> easier<00:02:36.280> then<00:02:37.280> I'm<00:02:37.640> taking<00:02:38.060> the

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
blending easier then I'm taking the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.530 
blending easier then I'm taking the
color<00:02:38.990> unseen<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.570> I'm<00:02:41.570> using<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.320> as<00:02:42.560> a

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
color unseen and I'm using this as a

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.290 
color unseen and I'm using this as a
transitional<00:02:44.540> shade<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:46.489> is<00:02:46.640> going<00:02:46.910> all

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
transitional shade so this is going all

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.360 
transitional shade so this is going all
the<00:02:47.450> way<00:02:47.570> into<00:02:47.840> my<00:02:47.959> crease<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.980> little<00:02:49.280> bit

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
the way into my crease and a little bit

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.090 
the way into my crease and a little bit
higher<00:02:49.840> almost<00:02:50.840> up<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.020> my<00:02:51.260> brow<00:02:51.440> bone<00:02:51.680> but<00:02:51.890> not

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
higher almost up to my brow bone but not

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.820 
higher almost up to my brow bone but not
quite<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:53.720> always<00:02:53.989> want<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.200> make<00:02:54.260> sure<00:02:54.620> that

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
quite you always want to make sure that

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.370 
quite you always want to make sure that
you<00:02:54.980> do<00:02:55.340> use<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:56.030> transition<00:02:56.570> shade<00:02:56.720> when<00:02:57.080> doing

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
you do use a transition shade when doing

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.010 
you do use a transition shade when doing
a<00:02:57.560> dramatic<00:02:57.770> smokey<00:02:58.459> eye<00:02:58.640> like<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.180> because

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
a dramatic smokey eye like this because

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.020 
a dramatic smokey eye like this because
it<00:03:00.140> helps<00:03:00.440> all<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.920> eyeshadows<00:03:01.430> blend<00:03:01.730> in

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
it helps all the eyeshadows blend in

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.290 
it helps all the eyeshadows blend in
seaming<00:03:02.690> seaming<00:03:03.350> lessly<00:03:03.650> together<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.670> hope

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
seaming seaming lessly together I hope

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:22.140 
seaming seaming lessly together I hope
I'm<00:03:05.450> saying<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.870> word<00:03:06.020> right

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.440 

now<00:03:22.780> I'm<00:03:23.049> taking<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.680> color<00:03:23.890> enigma<00:03:24.700> this<00:03:25.299> is

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
now I'm taking the color enigma this is

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.869 
now I'm taking the color enigma this is
a<00:03:25.480> beautiful<00:03:26.049> burgundy<00:03:26.650> red<00:03:26.680> sort<00:03:27.489> of<00:03:27.580> color

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
a beautiful burgundy red sort of color

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.660 
a beautiful burgundy red sort of color
and<00:03:28.239> this<00:03:29.080> is<00:03:29.230> going<00:03:29.470> directly<00:03:30.010> into<00:03:30.250> my

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
and this is going directly into my

00:03:30.670 --> 00:04:02.460 
and this is going directly into my
crease

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.310 

now<00:04:03.130> I'm<00:04:03.430> taking<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:04.240> color<00:04:04.540> dark<00:04:04.900> matter

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
now I'm taking the color dark matter

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.450 
now I'm taking the color dark matter
which<00:04:05.560> is<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.220> black<00:04:06.460> color<00:04:06.700> out<00:04:07.150> of<00:04:07.180> the

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
which is the black color out of the

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.760 
which is the black color out of the
stack<00:04:09.460> and<00:04:10.030> I'm<00:04:10.570> applying<00:04:10.780> these<00:04:11.170> directly

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
stack and I'm applying these directly

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.870 
stack and I'm applying these directly
onto<00:04:12.100> my<00:04:12.400> eyelid<00:04:13.120> making<00:04:13.690> sure<00:04:13.990> that<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:15.400> pack

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
onto my eyelid making sure that I pack

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.330 
onto my eyelid making sure that I pack
it<00:04:15.910> on<00:04:16.209> lightly<00:04:17.170> so<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.650> don't<00:04:17.950> get<00:04:18.130> any

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
it on lightly so that I don't get any

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.750 
it on lightly so that I don't get any
fallout<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:19.150> surprisingly<00:04:19.959> I<00:04:20.110> didn't<00:04:20.760> and

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
fallout and surprisingly I didn't and

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.690 
fallout and surprisingly I didn't and
I'm<00:04:21.910> also<00:04:22.180> going<00:04:22.630> into<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.140> crease<00:04:23.700> slightly

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
I'm also going into the crease slightly

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.010 
I'm also going into the crease slightly
with<00:04:25.210> that<00:04:25.480> I<00:04:26.250> have<00:04:27.250> rather<00:04:27.520> large<00:04:27.730> eyelids<00:04:28.690> so

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
with that I have rather large eyelids so

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.160 
with that I have rather large eyelids so
I<00:04:29.560> can<00:04:30.100> fit<00:04:30.640> quite<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:31.030> lot<00:04:31.270> of<00:04:31.360> eyeshadow<00:04:31.570> on<00:04:32.140> my

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
I can fit quite a lot of eyeshadow on my

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.700 
I can fit quite a lot of eyeshadow on my
eyes<00:04:33.100> so<00:04:33.760> if<00:04:34.060> you<00:04:34.240> have<00:04:34.660> more<00:04:34.960> smaller<00:04:35.410> eyes

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
eyes so if you have more smaller eyes

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.620 
eyes so if you have more smaller eyes
and<00:04:35.980> more<00:04:36.100> hooded<00:04:36.490> eyes<00:04:36.700> I'd<00:04:37.030> recommend<00:04:37.570> just

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
and more hooded eyes I'd recommend just

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.510 
and more hooded eyes I'd recommend just
staying<00:04:37.990> as<00:04:38.230> close<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.770> your<00:04:38.890> lash<00:04:39.070> line<00:04:39.130> as

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
staying as close to your lash line as

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.640 
staying as close to your lash line as
you<00:04:39.670> possibly<00:04:40.060> can<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.420> not<00:04:40.750> taking<00:04:41.260> it<00:04:41.380> too

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
you possibly can and not taking it too

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.540 
you possibly can and not taking it too
high<00:04:41.890> because<00:04:42.550> that's<00:04:42.940> how<00:04:43.180> you<00:04:44.010> get<00:04:45.010> panda

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
high because that's how you get panda

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.520 
high because that's how you get panda
eyes<00:04:45.760> and<00:04:46.180> I'm<00:04:46.330> just<00:04:46.510> packing<00:04:46.750> that<00:04:46.960> on<00:04:47.290> until

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
eyes and I'm just packing that on until

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.510 
eyes and I'm just packing that on until
I<00:04:47.710> get<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:48.220> color<00:04:48.250> intensity<00:04:49.090> that<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:49.720> want

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
I get the color intensity that I want

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.780 
I get the color intensity that I want
then<00:04:51.520> I'm<00:04:51.670> just<00:04:51.880> going<00:04:52.090> back<00:04:52.330> and<00:04:52.390> forth<00:04:52.900> with

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
then I'm just going back and forth with

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.990 
then I'm just going back and forth with
enigma<00:04:55.020> just<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.380> further<00:04:57.130> blend<00:04:57.370> up<00:04:57.760> that

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
enigma just to further blend up that

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.180 
enigma just to further blend up that
black<00:04:58.330> and<00:04:58.540> make<00:04:59.140> sure<00:04:59.350> there<00:04:59.560> are<00:04:59.680> no<00:04:59.830> harsh

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
black and make sure there are no harsh

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.740 
black and make sure there are no harsh
lines<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:00.820> so<00:05:00.970> that<00:05:01.150> there<00:05:01.330> is<00:05:01.450> a<00:05:01.480> nice

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
lines and so that there is a nice

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.650 
lines and so that there is a nice
gradient<00:05:02.500> effect<00:05:02.890> happening<00:05:03.640> now<00:05:04.270> to<00:05:04.330> balance

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
gradient effect happening now to balance

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.500 
gradient effect happening now to balance
out<00:05:04.990> this<00:05:05.320> dramatic<00:05:06.010> look<00:05:06.250> I'm<00:05:06.490> taking<00:05:06.790> blue

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
out this dramatic look I'm taking blue

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.390 
out this dramatic look I'm taking blue
on<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:08.110> my<00:05:08.410> bottom<00:05:08.620> lash<00:05:09.010> line

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
on to my bottom lash line

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.940 
on to my bottom lash line
and<00:05:09.730> then<00:05:10.570> I<00:05:10.600> will<00:05:11.020> also<00:05:11.050> take<00:05:12.000> unseen<00:05:13.000> and

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
and then I will also take unseen and

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.490 
and then I will also take unseen and
then<00:05:14.950> I<00:05:15.310> will<00:05:15.610> take<00:05:15.850> enigma<00:05:16.600> and<00:05:16.930> then<00:05:17.110> also

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
then I will take enigma and then also

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.560 
then I will take enigma and then also
dark<00:05:17.919> matter<00:05:18.190> so<00:05:18.430> I'm<00:05:18.520> kind<00:05:18.820> of<00:05:18.880> repeating<00:05:19.419> the

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
dark matter so I'm kind of repeating the

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.290 
dark matter so I'm kind of repeating the
same<00:05:19.780> steps<00:05:20.140> that<00:05:20.230> I<00:05:20.380> did<00:05:20.440> to<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.430> top<00:05:21.790> of<00:05:22.030> my

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
same steps that I did to the top of my

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.750 
same steps that I did to the top of my
eyes<00:05:22.510> to<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.020> bottom<00:05:23.350> just<00:05:24.130> to<00:05:24.310> balance<00:05:24.460> it

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
eyes to the bottom just to balance it

00:05:24.760 --> 00:06:22.670 
eyes to the bottom just to balance it
out

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680
