00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
when's the best time to catch Cod and

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.590 
when's the best time to catch Cod and
anytime<00:00:05.130> really<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.970> best<00:00:06.120> time<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.359> catch

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
anytime really is the best time to catch

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.009 
anytime really is the best time to catch
Cod<00:00:06.930> with<00:00:07.500> Akkad<00:00:08.160> in<00:00:08.429> particular<00:00:09.030> can<00:00:09.870> be<00:00:09.900> a

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
Cod with Akkad in particular can be a

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.190 
Cod with Akkad in particular can be a
lot<00:00:10.170> more<00:00:10.320> difficult<00:00:10.980> but<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:12.269> fact<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.750> that

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
lot more difficult but the fact is that

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.250 
lot more difficult but the fact is that
we<00:00:13.349> get<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.559> lot<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.740> bigger<00:00:14.099> Cod<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:14.519> winter

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
we get a lot of bigger Cod in winter

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
bit of a unnotice that I actually caught

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.419 
bit of a unnotice that I actually caught
most<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.410> me<00:00:28.500> fish<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.830> was<00:00:28.920> wearing<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> big

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
most of me fish I was wearing a big

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.490 
most of me fish I was wearing a big
bully<00:00:29.760> jumper<00:00:30.210> which<00:00:30.599> gives<00:00:30.869> me<00:00:30.960> an<00:00:31.080> indicator

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
bully jumper which gives me an indicator

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.549 
bully jumper which gives me an indicator
must<00:00:31.769> have<00:00:31.920> been<00:00:32.040> down<00:00:32.219> cold<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:33.450> one<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
must have been down cold now one of the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.190 
must have been down cold now one of the
main<00:00:34.800> reasons<00:00:35.280> behind<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.000> when<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.020> caught

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
main reasons behind it is when it caught

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.780 
main reasons behind it is when it caught
in<00:00:37.350> particular<00:00:38.510> basically<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.520> bigger

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
in particular basically the the bigger

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.240 
in particular basically the the bigger
Breda<00:00:42.149> Cod<00:00:42.510> there<00:00:43.170> feeding<00:00:43.410> up<00:00:43.649> during<00:00:44.070> those

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
Breda Cod there feeding up during those

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.100 
Breda Cod there feeding up during those
winter<00:00:44.610> months<00:00:44.789> ready<00:00:45.239> for<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> breeding

winter months ready for the breeding

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.350 
winter months ready for the breeding
time<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.680> September<00:00:47.190> October<00:00:47.309> November<00:00:47.700> and

time in September October November and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.880 
time in September October November and
I'm<00:00:49.170> assuming<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.309> metabolism<00:00:50.850> isn't<00:00:51.210> as

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
I'm assuming the metabolism isn't as

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.170 
I'm assuming the metabolism isn't as
doesn't<00:00:52.890> slow<00:00:53.070> down<00:00:53.100> as<00:00:53.489> much<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> little

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
doesn't slow down as much as the little

doesn't slow down as much as the little
caught<00:00:54.390> they<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.750> handle<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> colder<00:00:55.500> water

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
caught they can handle the colder water

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.040 
caught they can handle the colder water
better<00:00:56.010> they're<00:00:56.879> moving<00:00:57.239> around<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
better they're moving around in the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.630 
better they're moving around in the
river<00:00:58.230> systems<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.190> impoundment

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
chasing winter Cod forget about the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.370 
chasing winter Cod forget about the
early<00:01:05.549> morning<00:01:06.000> late<00:01:06.240> afternoon<00:01:06.810> scenario

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
early morning late afternoon scenario

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.899 
early morning late afternoon scenario
that<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.740> would<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> summertime<00:01:08.580> that's

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
that you would in the summertime that's

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.719 
that you would in the summertime that's
more<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> fisherman<00:01:09.720> thing<00:01:10.159> Cod<00:01:11.159> need<00:01:11.430> warm

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
more a fisherman thing Cod need warm

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.240 
more a fisherman thing Cod need warm
water<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.360> even<00:01:12.990> if<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.350> half<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.710> degree<00:01:13.860> or

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
water so even if we get half a degree or

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.429 
water so even if we get half a degree or
1<00:01:14.430> degree<00:01:14.760> rise<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> water<00:01:15.840> temperature

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
1 degree rise in the water temperature

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.320 
1 degree rise in the water temperature
it's<00:01:16.920> an<00:01:17.100> indicator<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.670> Cod<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> things

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it's an indicator that Cod the things

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.730 
it's an indicator that Cod the things
warming<00:01:18.750> up<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.960> little<00:01:19.140> bit<00:01:19.290> they<00:01:19.380> become<00:01:19.710> a

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
warming up a little bit they become a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800 
warming up a little bit they become a
little<00:01:20.009> bit<00:01:20.100> more<00:01:20.280> active<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.150> most<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
little bit more active so most of the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.539 
little bit more active so most of the
caught<00:01:21.990> off<00:01:22.140> court<00:01:22.409> over<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> over<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> last

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
should target these fish gentleman's

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.190 
should target these fish gentleman's
hours<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> better<00:01:36.600> word<00:01:36.840> there's

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
hours for one of a better word there's
