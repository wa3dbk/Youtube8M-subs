magazine okay so there are a couple of

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.029 
magazine okay so there are a couple of
things<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.090> stand<00:00:57.390> out<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.809> me<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.530> point

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
things that stand out for me the point

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.830 
things that stand out for me the point
for<00:00:59.250> vertical<00:00:59.640> vehicle<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> point<00:01:00.629> 3

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
for vertical vehicle and the point 3

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.100 
for vertical vehicle and the point 3
right<00:01:01.230> recoil<00:01:01.710> seems<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.149> somewhat<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.019> an

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
right recoil seems to be somewhat of an

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.899 
right recoil seems to be somewhat of an
issue<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:04.409> me<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> use<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.189> gun<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.610> couple

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
issue for me I use this gun in a couple

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.600 
issue for me I use this gun in a couple
of<00:01:05.939> matches<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.540> couple<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.590> modes<00:01:07.830> are<00:01:08.100> used

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
of matches on a couple of modes are used

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.609 
of matches on a couple of modes are used
up<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.970> played<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> couple<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.689> games<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:10.049> TDM<00:01:10.470> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
up I played a couple of games on TDM and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.359 
up I played a couple of games on TDM and
I<00:01:10.650> played<00:01:10.860> one<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.130> Rush<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.470> for<00:01:13.470> me<00:01:13.619> every

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
I played one on Rush and for me every

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.850 
I played one on Rush and for me every
game<00:01:14.729> mode<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.090> played<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.229> every<00:01:16.530> time<00:01:16.560> I

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
game mode I played you know every time I

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.160 
game mode I played you know every time I
played<00:01:17.070> with<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.850> recoil<00:01:18.360> seem<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.080> an

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
played with it the recoil seem to be an

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.649 
played with it the recoil seem to be an
issue<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.470> me<00:01:19.880> especially<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.450> Lloyd

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
issue for me especially with this Lloyd

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.899 
issue for me especially with this Lloyd
out<00:01:21.900> using<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.979> slider<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.520> didn't<00:01:23.790> really

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
out using the slider it didn't really

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.520 
out using the slider it didn't really
help<00:01:24.119> having<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.540> bipod<00:01:24.990> because<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
help having a bipod because the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.490 
help having a bipod because the
side-to-side<00:01:25.890> recoil<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:27.060> too<00:01:27.270> much

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
side-to-side recoil is just too much

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.050 
side-to-side recoil is just too much
that's<00:01:28.500> why<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.680> recommend<00:01:29.189> using<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.640> foregrip

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that's why I recommend using a foregrip

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.390 
that's why I recommend using a foregrip
instead<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.780> bipod<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.040> need<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
instead of a bipod because you need to

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.060 
instead of a bipod because you need to
control<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.970> side-to-side<00:01:33.270> recoil<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.409> agree

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
control that side-to-side recoil I agree

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.380 
control that side-to-side recoil I agree
with<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.369> flash<00:01:35.549> suppressor<00:01:35.939> because<00:01:36.270> it

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
with the flash suppressor because it

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.240 
with the flash suppressor because it
does<00:01:36.540> reduce<00:01:36.720> vertical<00:01:37.320> recoil<00:01:37.470> not<00:01:37.950> only

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
does reduce vertical recoil not only

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.460 
does reduce vertical recoil not only
that<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.700> removes<00:01:39.420> flesh<00:01:39.750> from<00:01:39.900> your<00:01:40.020> guns<00:01:40.259> so

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that it removes flesh from your guns so

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.020 
that it removes flesh from your guns so
that's<00:01:40.650> awesome<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.220> well<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.729> site<00:01:41.909> you

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
that's awesome as well the site you

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.480 
that's awesome as well the site you
recommended<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.689> me<00:01:42.720> was<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.200> holographic<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
recommended to me was the holographic to

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.450 
recommended to me was the holographic to
me<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:45.030> not<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.570> best<00:01:45.780> attachment<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:47.340> your

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
me it's not the best attachment for your

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.490 
me it's not the best attachment for your
sights<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:48.210> me<00:01:48.329> I'd<00:01:48.450> rather<00:01:48.630> go<00:01:48.869> with<00:01:49.020> Cobra

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
sights to me I'd rather go with Cobra

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.780 
sights to me I'd rather go with Cobra
because<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:50.009> you're<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.430> using<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
because if you're going to be using a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.370 
because if you're going to be using a
bipod<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.360> want<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.570> be<00:01:51.659> seeing<00:01:51.869> as<00:01:51.990> much<00:01:52.170> of

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
bipod you want to be seeing as much of

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.319 
bipod you want to be seeing as much of
the<00:01:52.470> screen<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:52.979> possible<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.060> want<00:01:54.240> to

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the screen as possible and you want to

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.819 
the screen as possible and you want to
be<00:01:54.390> able<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.689> see<00:01:54.840> those<00:01:55.020> guys<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:55.500> soon<00:01:55.649> as

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
be able to see those guys as soon as

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
possible even if you're going to go with

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510 
possible even if you're going to go with
a<00:01:57.659> foregrip<00:01:58.079> i'd<00:01:58.259> recommend<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.829> Cobra<00:01:59.280> all

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
a foregrip i'd recommend the Cobra all

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.639 
a foregrip i'd recommend the Cobra all
the<00:01:59.880> ideas<00:02:00.270> because<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> need<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> zoom<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.469> as

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the ideas because you need a zoom in as

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.100 
the ideas because you need a zoom in as
quick<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.100> possible<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:03.210> thing<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.899> hasn't

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
quick as possible the thing is it hasn't

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.020 
quick as possible the thing is it hasn't
got<00:02:04.439> its<00:02:04.680> got<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.860> decent<00:02:05.130> ratified<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:05.909> it

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
got its got a decent ratified but it

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.639 
got its got a decent ratified but it
hasn't<00:02:06.329> got<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.540> rate<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.719> fire<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.530> an

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
hasn't got the rate of fire like an

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.320 
hasn't got the rate of fire like an
m16a3<00:02:08.369> with<00:02:08.700> 800<00:02:09.239> or<00:02:09.360> an<00:02:09.450> AK<00:02:09.869> with<00:02:10.140> 900<00:02:10.709> you

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
m16a3 with 800 or an AK with 900 you

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.150 
m16a3 with 800 or an AK with 900 you
need<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.780> go<00:02:11.930> into<00:02:12.080> your<00:02:12.230> site's<00:02:12.470> very<00:02:12.830> quickly

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
need to go into your site's very quickly

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.460 
need to go into your site's very quickly
to<00:02:13.340> take<00:02:13.760> on<00:02:13.910> those<00:02:14.090> assault<00:02:14.480> rifles<00:02:14.900> if<00:02:15.260> you

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
to take on those assault rifles if you

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.780 
to take on those assault rifles if you
have<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.620> holographic<00:02:16.100> you<00:02:16.400> know<00:02:16.550> you'll<00:02:16.700> be

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
have a holographic you know you'll be

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.130 
have a holographic you know you'll be
trying<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.120> get<00:02:17.240> your<00:02:17.420> aim<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:17.750> everything

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
trying to get your aim and everything

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.840 
trying to get your aim and everything
and<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.590> can<00:02:18.740> see<00:02:18.890> in<00:02:18.980> this<00:02:19.070> match<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.520> haven't

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
and you can see in this match I haven't

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.270 
and you can see in this match I haven't
got<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.180> best<00:02:20.360> aim<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:21.650> maybe<00:02:21.860> that's<00:02:22.160> just

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
got the best aim and maybe that's just

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.790 
got the best aim and maybe that's just
because<00:02:22.490> I<00:02:22.730> was<00:02:22.850> off<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.270> day<00:02:23.480> but<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.410> me<00:02:24.560> it

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
because I was off that day but to me it

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.500 
because I was off that day but to me it
was<00:02:24.950> because<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.580> holographic<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.360> had

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
was because of a holographic and I had

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.780 
was because of a holographic and I had
to<00:02:26.630> sort<00:02:26.960> of<00:02:27.080> look<00:02:27.380> around<00:02:27.560> my<00:02:27.980> sights<00:02:28.310> almost

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
to sort of look around my sights almost

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.090 
to sort of look around my sights almost
and<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.870> was<00:02:29.990> really<00:02:30.230> hard<00:02:30.440> for<00:02:30.470> me<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.800> hit<00:02:30.950> the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
and it was really hard for me to hit the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.680 
and it was really hard for me to hit the
target<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.700> be<00:02:31.820> sure<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.060> keep<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:32.330> in<00:02:32.570> mind

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
target so be sure to keep that in mind

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.050 
target so be sure to keep that in mind
also<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.440> other<00:02:33.530> cool<00:02:33.770> thing<00:02:33.800> about<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.370> mg36

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
also the other cool thing about the mg36

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.450 
also the other cool thing about the mg36
is<00:02:35.570> it<00:02:35.690> has<00:02:35.840> 50<00:02:36.260> rounds<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.740> clip<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.220> course

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
is it has 50 rounds of a clip of course

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.850 
is it has 50 rounds of a clip of course
it's<00:02:37.670> an<00:02:37.760> lmg<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.510> does<00:02:38.690> have<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.590> lot<00:02:39.830> of

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
it's an lmg so it does have a lot of

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.320 
it's an lmg so it does have a lot of
bullets<00:02:40.280> in<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.520> clip<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:40.940> that's<00:02:41.120> always

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
bullets in the clip so that's always

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.750 
bullets in the clip so that's always
good<00:02:41.750> as<00:02:41.900> well<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.620> couple<00:02:43.130> of<00:02:43.280> negatives

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
good as well a couple of negatives

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.690 
good as well a couple of negatives
though<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.390> looks<00:02:44.780> like<00:02:45.020> a<00:02:45.050> penis<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:46.580> has

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
though it looks like a penis and it has

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.140 
though it looks like a penis and it has
a<00:02:46.730> lot<00:02:46.880> of<00:02:46.910> recoil<00:02:48.220> so<00:02:49.220> keep<00:02:49.430> them<00:02:49.610> two<00:02:49.850> things

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
a lot of recoil so keep them two things

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.930 
a lot of recoil so keep them two things
in<00:02:50.330> mind<00:02:50.360> i<00:02:50.840> recommend<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:52.100> trying<00:02:52.640> out<00:02:52.820> this

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
in mind i recommend you trying out this

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.520 
in mind i recommend you trying out this
gun<00:02:53.180> because<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.660> lot<00:02:53.870> of<00:02:53.990> fun<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.350> use

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
gun because it is a lot of fun to use

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.190 
gun because it is a lot of fun to use
don't<00:02:54.860> get<00:02:55.010> me<00:02:55.130> wrong<00:02:55.480> despite<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.660> being<00:02:56.690> look

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
don't get me wrong despite it being look

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.740 
don't get me wrong despite it being look
like<00:02:57.410> looking<00:02:58.040> like<00:02:58.280> something<00:02:58.910> i<00:02:59.209> don't<00:02:59.600> want
