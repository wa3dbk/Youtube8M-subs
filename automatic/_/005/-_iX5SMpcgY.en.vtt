00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 Welcome to and snapshot conception 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.009
 there are finally a few again 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.990
 Changes for these players among us and 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.580
 not the map maker and among others 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.929
 For example, a new monster is one of them 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.530
 more about that and another as always 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.530
 after the metro 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.800
 so and I do not want you to stay up late 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.050
 The torture is the new monster 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.150
 the change meant that is an end 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.500
 Variant of the zebrafish and the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.580
 people can see change means grab 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.470
 the little 4 even on 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.120
 the interesting thing is these features 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.650
 ponte the current time only then 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.879
 if you drive the end of me or the 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.379
 Teleport away 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.540
 or if you yourself an end 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.850
 thrown balls have not yet 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.750
 more detailed information about it but the whole 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.230
 also was not in moya with him 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.300
 spoken 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.260
 That is the creation of Werner Baum 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.300
 does not even have a colleague 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.410
 talked about but he is planning something 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.120
 big with it and many speculations 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.979
 Run out of that is what with 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.510
 Maybe the dragon has to come 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:55.500
 finally at some point our house 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.940
 tame kites 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.769
 even cooler it does not imagine us 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.260
 can your ideas just in the 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.790
 Comments and the end of may are in themselves 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.860
 just like silverfish have four 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.489
 make heart hurt 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.229
 but not as much as 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.060
 Silverfish and can not be in blocks 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.979
 go in two minutes after the spore 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.470
 she and she can be here else 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.810
 not rather the inventory texture of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.159
 wilmsdorff from sound has changed 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.270
 but if you have placed them then 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.619
 is he nothing different at all i know 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.439
 not exactly why or if I am 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.380
 imagine and what and why it is 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.000
 so point there are many many 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.439
 Changes that affect minecraft 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.420
 one of them finally became the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.950
 Pacemaker changed that too 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.600
 can push really means and 1 5 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.740
 walking can take the coal and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.649
 drive off and then press others 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.210
 mainka purpose but what you just here 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.920
 could not recognize what 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.810
 new is that also means derail 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.859
 can pack if these are too fast 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.780
 we are here in my cards and give 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.310
 then this little something offers 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.170
 The minecraft like to hit machines 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.060
 that's why it can happen if mine 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.049
 Charles Bridge should then go up 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.609
 it happens that these too 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.679
 dismiss or have no buck up there 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.539
 to drive if I'm too fast so 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.130
 here again a mainka teamsport that 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.409
 Go here for an oven minecraft 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.280
 just fast and you see the whole 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.140
 does not even want it 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.939
 Do not drive up because the blocks 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.530
 lift the whole 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.360
 Physic system has been redistributed 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.800
 what collision query and so far as the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.180
 means it should be better if you now 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.590
 around corners you do not drive so in the 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.180
 block disappears or if blog over 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.319
 One is when you sit inside and 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.400
 Much much more is in any case 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.060
 very nice that she finally 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.750
 worry about 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.280
 So let's move on 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.420
 a change many of you even 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.490
 will not interest you or you 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.530
 is not known or will use 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.730
 is that the metadata be expanded 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.170
 that means it's not that much anymore 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.040
 blog is for example a wooden plank 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.240
 the id has 5 colon 15.2 later 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.220
 if it should be different colors 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.560
 but remaining start 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.360
 that will all still some regulates 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.130
 currently with their game and therefore if 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.690
 We appear here but in the future 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.730
 it will be different as well as already 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.140
 the number one was taken out and 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.730
 by now all took this are indoors 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.590
 that will be similar from the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.700
 Numbers will be names and that will be 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.489
 get blogs much easier to use 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.130
 but apparently more in the 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.750
 next snapshots some mans paris 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.709
 have been updated for example to change 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.470
 if now something faster if 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.910
 so they run 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.140
 they 're just faster and they can 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.040
 Therefore beat themselves faster 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.010
 they are declining 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.360
 Now it's just something 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.160
 faster and if we do not sprint 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.320
 will have caught up eventually 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.330
 We can quickly move on 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.830
 because for example the silverfish now 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.480
 also do break now and then are now 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.890
 no longer move permanently then thinks 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.020
 she sometimes joachim bock me more 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.660
 make team integrate what now 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.799
 Of course it does not happen 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.799
 show effect I stop finally 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.480
 it does not seem necessary 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.959
 pay attention so it has seen short 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.280
 Waiting that was important to the coolest 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.360
 grandpa the change will come soon 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.890
 First of all, something else should sound again 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.030
 no necessary change is now 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.620
 they have to kill everybody and 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.870
 then i will show you the coolest of mine 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.760
 opinion, and indeed are now creeper 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.290
 a little more cautious in a comparison 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.510
 the air is another and has a different fear 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.650
 valuable to run away so go up 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.600
 and the body goes away very quickly me 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.260
 I think that's funny, I do not know her 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.000
 It probably will not 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.049
 like me but me 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.880
 I celebrate it important that the 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.290
 doll have fear of each other and that 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.160
 he 'll annoy her again here 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.910
 with a whole break down well or too 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.910
 do not start running 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.019
 I love these critters mf3 mode or 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.000
 also the bucks screen for some exists 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.010
 Now a new ad and this one 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.300
 status variant of blocks as well 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.530
 I do just now what already told but 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.600
 Here you can do it a bit better 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.370
 see because there are smaller ones 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.840
 subvariants of these blocks between 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.940
 we see our corner here on the top right 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.410
 that grass blog also story 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.880
 could be what force is 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.590
 because there is no snow on it 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.750
 The same is true of other blocks 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.610
 like porsche or similar but with much 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.140
 sight this is not yet installed 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.640
 emphasis is still on that 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.530
 probably still installed such as 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.030
 heart attack whether this is on or off 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.100
 a runway whether this is extended or 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.460
 not or water whether this flows or 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.660
 not and much more 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.940
 but that was the change of the snap shot 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.960
 14 b 11a and I have to say there are 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.160
 finally some cool new ones 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.970
 things and I hope that will too 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.919
 even more in the course of the next one 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.910
 snapshots because the update can still one 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.380
 little to wait 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.390
 the whole story with the kite 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.410
 old change and the like interested 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.150
 me very much and I hope there is still to come 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.260
 a lot why just write me if you are 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.460
 want more or if you actually 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.990
 ideas have that in the comments and 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.919
 then you can also discuss it and 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.150
 then I would say and say of 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.919
 next time many spectators again 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.419
 the happy rating there and if not 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.640
 You could have done that in april 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.320
 then stay informed next updates 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.220
 but again a lot to look at 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.220
 next time and protect
