is<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.320> not<00:00:58.350> available<00:00:59.070> because<00:00:59.730> it's

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
is it's not available because it's

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.819

something<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.269> customized<00:01:00.750> myself<00:01:01.230> maybe

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
something I customized myself maybe

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.970 
something I customized myself maybe
someday<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.399> won't<00:01:02.519> be<00:01:02.670> available<00:01:03.739> I'm<00:01:04.739> gonna

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
someday it won't be available I'm gonna

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.740 
someday it won't be available I'm gonna
use<00:01:05.160> an<00:01:05.340> off<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.790> ground<00:01:06.030> cast<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.660> this

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
use an off the ground cast for this

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.899 
use an off the ground cast for this
demonstration<00:01:07.320> today<00:01:07.560> I'm<00:01:08.310> going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> cast<00:01:08.729> it

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
demonstration today I'm going to cast it

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.580 
demonstration today I'm going to cast it
across<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.390> football<00:01:09.750> field<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.470> you

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
across the football field so that you

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.289 
across the football field so that you
have<00:01:10.740> some<00:01:10.979> sort<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.250> frame<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.640> reference<00:01:12.090> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
have some sort of frame of reference and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.330 
have some sort of frame of reference and
so<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.470> don't<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> impression<00:01:13.920> I'm

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
so that you don't get the impression I'm

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.690 
so that you don't get the impression I'm
lying<00:01:14.580> about<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.090> distances<00:01:16.310> off<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.490> ground

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
lying about the distances off the ground

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.280 
lying about the distances off the ground
cast<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> really<00:01:18.750> great<00:01:18.960> long<00:01:19.259> distance

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
cast is a really great long distance

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.789 
cast is a really great long distance
cast<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:20.970> bread<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.240> butter<00:01:21.360> cast

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
cast it's my bread and butter cast

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.740 
cast it's my bread and butter cast
obviously<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.920> don't<00:01:23.159> plug<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.610> 150<00:01:24.450> yards

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
obviously you don't plug it 150 yards

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.330 
obviously you don't plug it 150 yards
balancing<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.409> rocks<00:01:25.680> or<00:01:25.860> anything<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.280> that

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
balancing on rocks or anything like that

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.030 
balancing on rocks or anything like that
you<00:01:26.759> all<00:01:26.880> usually<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> from<00:01:28.500> sand<00:01:28.799> beaches

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
you all usually do it from sand beaches

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.429 
you all usually do it from sand beaches
where<00:01:29.909> there's<00:01:30.060> good<00:01:30.240> footing<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.020> sand

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
where there's good footing and sand

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.800 
where there's good footing and sand
beaches<00:01:31.680> make<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.090> fine<00:01:33.299> place<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
beaches make for just a fine place to

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.940 
beaches make for just a fine place to
off<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.170> ground<00:01:34.380> cast

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
off the ground cast

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.719 
off the ground cast
I<00:01:35.640> could<00:01:36.030> also<00:01:36.149> pendulum<00:01:36.810> cast<00:01:37.640> for<00:01:38.640> this

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
I could also pendulum cast for this

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.670 
I could also pendulum cast for this
demonstration<00:01:38.970> too<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:40.110> I'd<00:01:40.200> rather<00:01:40.409> just

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
demonstration too but I'd rather just

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.889 
demonstration too but I'd rather just
use<00:01:40.860> my<00:01:41.070> bread-and-butter<00:01:41.880> cast<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> cast

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
use my bread-and-butter cast and a cast

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.389 
use my bread-and-butter cast and a cast
that<00:01:43.079> most<00:01:43.649> people<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.130> learn<00:01:44.880> pretty<00:01:45.540> easily

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
that most people can learn pretty easily

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.770 
that most people can learn pretty easily

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
yards in each endzone is ten yards that

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.670 
yards in each endzone is ten yards that
equals<00:02:49.380> 120<00:02:50.069> yards<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:51.330> 120<00:02:52.080> yards<00:02:52.200> between
