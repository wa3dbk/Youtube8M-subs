00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.130

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.930
 weekly private usually comes whole 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.869
 been very busy with banjotown ten 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.980
 first and especially the server there I want 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.360
 then just a moment 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.980
 emphasize that the server really 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.630
 so much ice these last days 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.370
 I have not paid attention to again 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.300
 server and I'm just really dying now 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.570
 spammed 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.390
 with emails from 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.890
 that things just really go wrong 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.510
 we seem by me they are themselves that I am 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.489
 all thing has to settle that is just 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.890
 cunt really hard because now take quite today 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.440
 a large part under life and yes yes 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.210
 I'd actually rather not have 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.649
 so yes it is a little pussy i can too 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.000
 takes a day off from that server 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.690
 in between really daily 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.879
 busy with 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.530
 so that is first and second I have 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.250
 Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday a video 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.320
 to upload 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.640
 banjotown I don't have a video today 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.549
 uploaded on my at least from agent 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.740
 service then I go saw him online 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.570
 because I just didn't have a video to come 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.380
 because i like this video in the morning 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.390
 and in the morning go one hangs up 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.030
 go to the server and record the video there 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.810
 only was is so my upload was in the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.159
 evening and strangely interrupted 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.990
 I have him so late in the afternoon 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.040
 so of course throw four every day online 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.299
 upload video 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.110
 since my internet is not that whole 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.579
 fast I could not rule on the server 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.990
 it is the even things uploaded can 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.340
 that's why we don't use the internet anymore 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.490
 I have also agreed maybe one 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.600
 mother then maybe to new one 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.640
 called new internet switch 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.460
 ziggo and let's just take a look 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.780
 what kpn is just really really bad and 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.939
 team roles hope but that is none 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.710
 internet provider only one 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.329
 telephone subscription supplier but that 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.409
 is also very just those two anyway 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.700
 never take it 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.350
 really not i am very satisfied with it 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.119
 that male audience has a marche of 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.920
 subscriptions how that is really bad 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.829

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:50.050
 well looked at just think what

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.140
 Look at the screen again physically 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.820
 correct so yes I look a bit cross-eyed 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.340
 I watch myself because I have another one 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.570
 a question for you because i am so 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.700
 banned to play a new lets 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.320

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.480

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.590
 and I'm going anyway a plastic 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.760

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.280
 in the description in the moves or a 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.230
 description in the comments below again 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.490
 and want to put down or must already 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.260
 they play very nicely because then 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.820
 can I start with that article 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.620
 upload with two skin of course like 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.390
 always 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.590
 okay if I explained why my 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.600
 last week of weekly chat 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.430
 that I put on the list I with you then 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.160
 also explained from classic I have grass 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.140
 hollow explained and now I'm going to ask which 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.150
 game he knows our choice of rest and that 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.860
 roll 5 and it becomes a coop 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.300
 conscious level five a horror game with 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.310
 a little shooting action in between 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.670
 they are very cool game I might be the one 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.890
 hal maybe pokémon heartgold 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.570
 gwen if you are really pokémon viewers 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.820
 maybe that's nice for you but it 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.380
 and for the rest I actually have 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.060
 a question mark what I serve with my god 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.950
 I must go now let's you play but 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.240
 they also say the portal very often 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.920
 but portal is just not a game form 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.680
 since it requires a lot of thinking 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.030
 and think and let's play at my go 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.350
 just not very well together like you 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.180
 maybe have noticed in some 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.430
 let's play's is also bento episode 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.959
 just really 10 minutes busy for it 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.070
 answer but then so cynical yes I have 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.230
 just there at one point in one 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.140
 of the last episode is really 15 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.030
 minutes in response and yes 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.830
 portal is not for me you know 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.890
 I just could n't do very well 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.210
 think while I'm playing 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.500
 so yes that would portal too 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.180
 probably not let's play so if 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.040
 you have a nice let's play 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.470
 want to see mine or just have fun 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.330
 game know yes what you might really be 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.410
 fucking cool then you should like that 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.700
 just leave it here in the 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.410
 comments below 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.120
 or yes just say that you prefer 5 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.520
 want or so or also my heart cord 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.180
 that would be really cool if 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.280
 you want that 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.990
 So yeah currently relatively little to say 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.370
 so I'm going to end this video so the 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.720
 this week's question is just which game 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.550
 should I play and I last week even though 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.780
 just set there wasn't really like that 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.670
 great response 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.760
 I now have 1000 subsribers at least 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.770
 almost twelve hundred hey so I'm going 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.240
 just low the new subscribers 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.050
 play milk factory so I had the choice 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.760
 so off 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.950
 so 3 or 5 or pokémon heart gold or 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.930
 so question mark if you have that question mark 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.060
 fill it in, you can just do it here 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.200
 put down in so there comes for whom 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.310
 which you the nicer than the vegetables you have 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.420
 you will see more subscribe again 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.070
 next time next time we go 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.920
 then again weekly chat will do more 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:27.280
 uploaded on Sunday and happy or 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.350
 maybe then everything is a little bit again 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.880
 calm down in my channel way case 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.540
 my life with what I am going to do 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.340
 men 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.340
 only thing then again until then
