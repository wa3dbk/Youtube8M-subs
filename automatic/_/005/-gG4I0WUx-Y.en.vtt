00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.400
 welcome to this instructional video 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.100
 here we will look at how people can make a very nice birth announcement card themselves 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.610
 for example, tickets are subdivided into this category 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:15.699
 incinerator example 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.800
 I choose louse 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.840
 I am not you is very nice 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.740
 I see the front and back in the downtown, the clip is also there 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.640
 use this card 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.440
 don't go crazy in March 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.080
 there are two streets from the city hall and the money in nature 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.120
 I'm going for a March standard 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.880
 now we can start making the card 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.670
 incident name after much back and forth of the ticket 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.900
 I start by changing the name into the name of the sound check 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.870
 yes only two time 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.159
 and then I read 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.170
 everything has changed from not experiencing yourself 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.360
 the stentor the clogs 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.360
 who gets Kevin put it so it looks neat 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.460
 the Utrecht judge 8 degrees away that there are also coach do 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.460
 and before that 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.900
 ing the lime frame something i like a bit more the couple was this one 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.410
 mh 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.410
 after I was sitting, the tanker got the flowers 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.010
 and I continue to the inside 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.010
 I also have their participation in that 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.330
 and the text for a born who loves passion k after us 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.110
 I like that a bit more 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.430
 really and in France of course the birth date of a son and I say 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.630
 me in the middle 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.630
 and change I did not succeed police clogs 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.220
 in shrinking devices snooker text does not stand in the way 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.840
 and is very handy for visiting 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.840
 put the correct address on your birth announcement card 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.090
 In addition, I do not want to say a separate sentence because I want the Fed 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.050
 looks could not be traced but i am sleeping so hence i have i go 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.050
 this year 12 to bike hits 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:20.369
 that is also a bit smaller that it is not placed there 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.099
 awful 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.339
 and I get ready 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:27.809
 to view it 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:31.159
 front I like the back and the inside well 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.779
 I finished ordering 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.370
 when ordered these cards 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.030
 there is no age a man runs away it is sick that gives no support 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.729
 the freshness 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:50.969
 I stand arrested and all others get a loan when there is after the start
