00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.639
 hello how are you I hope you are better and 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.500
 welcome everyone is a new day 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.540
 minecraft in the studio we will be 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.369
 seeing how to avoid practically 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.830
 You can say that all year round in a tnt to 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.000
 a very close range and yours that you 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.529
 I can work this because you can 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.880
 work for different things is a 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.140
 trick that really is very 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.269
 interesting can you work for 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.920
 mine for example what do you want look no longer 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.860
 he wants to hurt you and you want to look 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.120
 then practically quickly and put 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.800
 it's close to the area and it's not going to come out 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.360
 running true then then you can 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.280
 work for that or you can work 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.960
 to destroy things and you do not want to be 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.420
 I practically do not want to be 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.010
 spending food to heal you or so good 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.110
 the point is that it does not hurt you and it 's a 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.850
 interesting little trick not good what 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.400
 have we are is obviously latent 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.690
 the glass are emitting because with 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.030
 any other block the art mind you 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.159
 destroys but the video especially you 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.949
 protects as it absorbs or absorbs 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.299
 Tnt damage is something curious and good 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.339
 then the point is that we today 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.170
 we leave in passive then we go to 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.030
 receive exactly zero damage from the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.530
 tnt if we went in any 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.660
 another difficulty the only thing that we are going to 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.770
 receive doing half heart damage and 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.240
 without anything armed 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.490
 then right now they will see what I 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.320
 I mean with eye armor and we were 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.119
 of survival that is evidently 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.670
 isnt tnt I have to do enough 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.649
 damage is good we exploit can we 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.569
 behind the glass block like this 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.939
 perfectly be of harm but neither 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:30.439
 he did not even make me 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.079
 back or nothing bothers me in it 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.929
 occupies or the thrust that has the explosion 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.520
 even that is not strange then 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.860
 let's put it again so that 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.869
 you believe me neither in rivals is a 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.560
 fake then we are not here 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.729
 unemployed and but of the year it will be harm 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.259
 so how do I tell them if we change 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.880
 I find it hard difficulty or higher 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.009
 it's just going to be quick because what 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.939
 you have to try to record this I got 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.939
 a slam and he killed me 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.189
 over then we're doing what 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:03.640
 same in the difficulty we start to not going 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.899
 to make it hard for them to tell me what 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.310
 difficult and we will survive without the 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.800
 Senior and sina 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.959
 Half heart eye is the best thing that goes 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.099
 to become the maximum maximum maximum and 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.840
 if I heal you from flying then 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.720
 literally is how to evade all the damage 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.099
 when attending this trick then with the 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.430
 mustache works for various things 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.950
 to truly undermine whatever it may be 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.959
 see many uses and it 's interesting not 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.670
 then you must be clear that they do not know 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.920
 over the other is recording almost well 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.380
 happy dean friends the thing is very 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.330
 beautiful and the wool with three strokes where 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.510
 It is my giant and kill me 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.850
 but hey this is a small tutorial 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.500

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.640
 channel did not have how much and it costs nothing 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.620
