tent tents generally are going to be the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.630 
tent tents generally are going to be the
heaviest<00:00:35.680> selection<00:00:36.680> when<00:00:36.920> it<00:00:37.040> comes<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.610> a

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
heaviest selection when it comes to a

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.690 
heaviest selection when it comes to a
shelter<00:00:38.000> system<00:00:38.680> this<00:00:39.680> one<00:00:39.890> in<00:00:40.040> particular<00:00:40.130> is

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
shelter system this one in particular is

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.970 
shelter system this one in particular is
an<00:00:41.240> rei<00:00:41.680> quarter<00:00:42.680> dome<00:00:42.860> t2<00:00:43.870> and<00:00:44.870> this<00:00:45.680> weighs

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
an rei quarter dome t2 and this weighs

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.890 
an rei quarter dome t2 and this weighs
in<00:00:46.310> at<00:00:50.590> over<00:00:51.590> three<00:00:52.040> and<00:00:52.070> a<00:00:52.190> half<00:00:52.220> pounds<00:00:52.900> and

in at over three and a half pounds and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.610 
in at over three and a half pounds and
that's<00:00:54.080> not<00:00:54.170> including<00:00:55.450> the<00:00:56.450> tent<00:00:57.110> poles<00:00:57.350> that

that's not including the tent poles that

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.840 
that's not including the tent poles that
go<00:00:57.740> with<00:00:57.890> it<00:00:57.950> so<00:00:58.220> you're<00:00:58.340> looking<00:00:58.550> at<00:00:58.670> four

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
go with it so you're looking at four

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.370 
go with it so you're looking at four
pounds<00:00:59.270> um<00:01:01.210> there's<00:01:02.210> two<00:01:02.420> types<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.870> tents<00:01:03.200> out

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
pounds um there's two types of tents out

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.920 
pounds um there's two types of tents out
there<00:01:03.800> there's<00:01:04.400> a<00:01:04.519> three<00:01:04.729> season<00:01:04.909> tent<00:01:05.059> which

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
there there's a three season tent which

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.669 
there there's a three season tent which
primarily<00:01:06.650> has<00:01:07.189> more<00:01:07.579> mesh<00:01:08.170> for<00:01:09.170> ventilation

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:09.679 
primarily has more mesh for ventilation

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:12.130 
primarily has more mesh for ventilation
in<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.130> hot<00:01:10.460> Eric<00:01:10.759> hunter<00:01:11.179> times<00:01:11.899> of<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:12.109> year

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
in the hot Eric hunter times of the year

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.249 
in the hot Eric hunter times of the year
and<00:01:12.469> then<00:01:13.100> there's<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.939> four<00:01:14.240> season<00:01:14.659> which

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
and then there's the four season which

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.529 
and then there's the four season which
has<00:01:15.619> limited<00:01:16.369> mesh<00:01:16.609> which<00:01:16.880> is<00:01:16.909> mainly<00:01:17.240> a

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
has limited mesh which is mainly a

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:23.039 
has limited mesh which is mainly a
single<00:01:18.409> wall<00:01:19.689> which<00:01:20.689> does<00:01:20.990> allow<00:01:21.670> that<00:01:22.670> much

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
single wall which does allow that much

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.020 
single wall which does allow that much
heat<00:01:24.049> to<00:01:24.560> escape<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:25.039> tent<00:01:25.280> because<00:01:25.789> you're

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
heat to escape the tent because you're

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.429 
heat to escape the tent because you're
going<00:01:26.149> to<00:01:26.210> be<00:01:26.270> using<00:01:26.359> it<00:01:26.630> in<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.319> snowstorm

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
going to be using it in the snowstorm

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.309 
going to be using it in the snowstorm
there<00:01:30.439> are<00:01:30.619> lighter<00:01:31.009> versions<00:01:31.549> out<00:01:31.700> there<00:01:32.319> re

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
there are lighter versions out there re

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.889 
there are lighter versions out there re
I<00:01:33.530> make<00:01:33.889> some<00:01:34.100> pretty<00:01:34.130> lite<00:01:34.460> versions<00:01:34.939> barmet

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
possible roof most manufacturers use was

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.129 
possible roof most manufacturers use was
called<00:01:42.829> sell<00:01:43.159> nylon<00:01:43.609> which<00:01:44.299> is<00:01:44.509> in<00:01:44.780> waterproof

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:45.139 
called sell nylon which is in waterproof

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:49.270 
called sell nylon which is in waterproof
nylon<00:01:46.119> silicon<00:01:47.119> impregnated<00:01:47.630> in<00:01:47.689> it<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:48.219> lot<00:01:49.219> of

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
nylon silicon impregnated in it a lot of

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.879 
nylon silicon impregnated in it a lot of
the<00:01:49.429> cottage<00:01:50.060> industry<00:01:50.539> makers<00:01:50.929> are<00:01:51.109> making

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:51.889 
the cottage industry makers are making

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:55.870 
the cottage industry makers are making
these<00:01:52.039> out<00:01:52.340> of<00:01:53.560> Cuban<00:01:54.560> fiber<00:01:54.859> which<00:01:55.579> is<00:01:55.729> going

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
these out of Cuban fiber which is going

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.539 
these out of Cuban fiber which is going
to<00:01:55.939> cost<00:01:56.149> you<00:01:56.359> a<00:01:56.420> lot<00:01:56.569> of<00:01:56.749> money<00:01:56.780> or<00:01:57.549> they'll

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
to cost you a lot of money or they'll

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.769 
to cost you a lot of money or they'll
use<00:01:58.819> a<00:01:59.090> lighter<00:01:59.479> version<00:01:59.810> of<00:02:00.139> SIL<00:02:00.560> nylon<00:02:00.920> or

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:01.779 
use a lighter version of SIL nylon or

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:04.719 
use a lighter version of SIL nylon or
what's<00:02:02.779> called<00:02:03.020> spinnaker<00:02:03.679> which<00:02:04.579> is

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
what's called spinnaker which is

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.109 
what's called spinnaker which is
material<00:02:05.299> that's<00:02:05.560> lighter<00:02:06.560> then<00:02:07.249> still<00:02:07.700> nylon

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
material that's lighter then still nylon

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.449 
material that's lighter then still nylon
heavier<00:02:08.990> than<00:02:09.350> Cuban<00:02:09.679> fibers<00:02:10.039> how<00:02:10.190> like<00:02:10.340> the

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
heavier than Cuban fibers how like the

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.850 
heavier than Cuban fibers how like the
middle<00:02:10.729> ground<00:02:11.450> but<00:02:11.959> it<00:02:12.230> has<00:02:12.439> less

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
middle ground but it has less

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.750 
middle ground but it has less
packability<00:02:13.780> then<00:02:14.780> cupid<00:02:15.349> fiber

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
packability then cupid fiber

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.170 
packability then cupid fiber
so<00:02:15.909> now<00:02:16.090> I'm<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.540> it's<00:02:16.780> quite<00:02:16.959> noisy<00:02:18.030> it's<00:02:19.030> up

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
so now I'm and it's quite noisy it's up

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.809 
so now I'm and it's quite noisy it's up
to<00:02:19.299> you<00:02:19.450> which<00:02:19.810> way<00:02:19.959> you<00:02:20.019> want<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.260> go<00:02:20.319> with<00:02:20.409> it

but that's a tent the next one is a

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.890 
but that's a tent the next one is a
hammock<00:02:27.909> yeah<00:02:28.689> a<00:02:29.049> hammock<00:02:30.390> as<00:02:31.390> far<00:02:31.750> as
