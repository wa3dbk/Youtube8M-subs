breaks to the green energy world now I

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.160 
breaks to the green energy world now I
like<00:03:38.489> green<00:03:38.640> energy<00:03:38.970> as<00:03:39.060> well<00:03:39.090> but<00:03:39.989> that's

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
like green energy as well but that's

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.949 
like green energy as well but that's
about<00:03:40.350> 50<00:03:40.799> years<00:03:41.250> worth<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.790> what<00:03:42.299> oil<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.840> gas

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
about 50 years worth of what oil and gas

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.509 
about 50 years worth of what oil and gas
