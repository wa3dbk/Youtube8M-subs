00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
envelope velocity that allows you to

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.470 
envelope velocity that allows you to
make<00:03:44.080> it<00:03:44.260> go<00:03:44.410> slow<00:03:44.770> if<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.760> now<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.180> see<00:03:46.450> that

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
make it go slow if you now you see that

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.170

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
line you line the middle who the clip

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.059 
line you line the middle who the clip
going<00:03:52.180> up<00:03:52.560> makes<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:53.739> go<00:03:53.980> super<00:03:54.760> fast

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.130 

can't<00:03:57.760> even<00:03:57.849> see<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.299> because<00:03:58.569> my<00:03:58.719> computer<00:03:59.049> is

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
can't even see it because my computer is

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.929 
can't even see it because my computer is
slow<00:03:59.290> but<00:04:00.129> but<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.549> put<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.239> down<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:03.489> will<00:04:03.790> go

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
slow but but it put it down it will go

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.140 
slow but but it put it down it will go
slow<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.840> slow<00:04:05.319> motion<00:04:05.920> so<00:04:06.189> go<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.489> edit<00:04:06.939> and

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
slow and slow motion so go to edit and

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.559 
slow and slow motion so go to edit and
split<00:04:07.599> and<00:04:08.519> delete<00:04:09.519> what<00:04:09.939> you<00:04:10.030> don't<00:04:10.209> need<00:04:10.480> and

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
split and delete what you don't need and

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.719 
split and delete what you don't need and
make<00:04:13.569> it<00:04:13.719> longer<00:04:14.219> ok<00:04:15.509> so<00:04:16.509> now<00:04:16.750> let's<00:04:17.430> watch<00:04:18.430> as

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
make it longer ok so now let's watch as

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.400 
make it longer ok so now let's watch as
it<00:04:18.759> go<00:04:19.060> slow<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:21.400> makes<00:04:21.669> your<00:04:22.419> video<00:04:22.750> seemed

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
it go slow that makes your video seemed

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.249 
it go slow that makes your video seemed
a<00:04:23.440> bit<00:04:23.560> more<00:04:23.889> better<00:04:24.160> than<00:04:24.280> everything<00:04:24.699> rushed
