00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
thought assuming the traveler really did

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.849 
thought assuming the traveler really did
sacrifice<00:04:12.389> itself<00:04:12.720> lovingly<00:04:13.109> what<00:04:13.680> if<00:04:13.769> the

sacrifice itself lovingly what if the

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.800 
sacrifice itself lovingly what if the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
for the worse in some way what if it's

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.740 
for the worse in some way what if it's
mentally<00:04:17.579> damaged<00:04:17.880> beyond<00:04:18.120> repair<00:04:18.150> this

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
mentally damaged beyond repair this

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.449
