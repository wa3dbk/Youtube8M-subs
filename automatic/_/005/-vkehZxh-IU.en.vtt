Bishop<00:00:27.860> we<00:00:28.489> had<00:00:28.610> a<00:00:28.640> real<00:00:28.820> problem<00:00:28.970> with<00:00:29.270> little

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
Bishop we had a real problem with little

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.549 
Bishop we had a real problem with little
little<00:00:30.950> buddy<00:00:31.160> mr.<00:00:31.489> heater<00:00:31.989> it<00:00:32.989> would<00:00:33.170> come<00:00:33.350> on

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
little buddy mr. heater it would come on

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.830 
little buddy mr. heater it would come on
for<00:00:33.770> about<00:00:33.980> a<00:00:34.340> minute<00:00:34.880> then<00:00:35.360> it<00:00:35.510> would<00:00:35.630> just

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
for about a minute then it would just

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.160 
for about a minute then it would just
die<00:00:36.340> consistently<00:00:37.340> over<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:37.760> over<00:00:38.140> so<00:00:39.140> I

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
die consistently over and over so I

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.890 
die consistently over and over so I
started<00:00:39.559> thinking<00:00:39.710> about<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:40.430> I<00:00:41.270> start

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
started thinking about it and I start

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.750 
started thinking about it and I start
thinking<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.350> know<00:00:42.530> it's<00:00:43.010> got<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.400> be<00:00:43.610> the

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
thinking you know it's got to be the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.800 
thinking you know it's got to be the
oxygen<00:00:44.390> low<00:00:44.720> oxygen<00:00:45.470> sensor<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.100> so<00:00:47.060> I<00:00:47.330> set

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
oxygen low oxygen sensor and so I set

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.830 
oxygen low oxygen sensor and so I set
out<00:00:47.840> on<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.950> path<00:00:48.980> to<00:00:49.550> find<00:00:50.360> out<00:00:50.510> where<00:00:50.690> that

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
out on the path to find out where that

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.870 
out on the path to find out where that
little<00:00:51.050> bugger<00:00:51.380> is<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:51.950> what<00:00:52.160> to<00:00:52.310> do<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:52.490> fix

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
little bugger is and what to do to fix

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
front grill off and you can see if you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.460 
front grill off and you can see if you
just<00:00:59.210> take<00:00:59.450> and<00:00:59.630> pull<00:01:00.620> this<00:01:00.920> out<00:01:02.260> pull<00:01:03.260> this

and blew all this out here blew all the
dust<00:01:15.620> out<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.750> made<00:01:17.750> sure<00:01:17.780> there<00:01:18.200> wasn't<00:01:18.409> any

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
dust out and made sure there wasn't any

dust out and made sure there wasn't any
garbage<00:01:19.640> in<00:01:19.820> your<00:01:19.850> spiderwebs<00:01:20.690> and<00:01:20.930> stuff

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.930 
like that so once I blew that out then I
took<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.409> the<00:01:27.409> grill<00:01:27.710> back<00:01:27.920> on<00:01:28.220> went<00:01:28.760> around

to the back and then I took these four
screws<00:01:36.260> out<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:38.320> then<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:39.500> just<00:01:39.530> gently<00:01:40.159> lift

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
screws out and then you just gently lift

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.020

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.780 
up on this whole plate up like that and
pull<00:01:44.659> it<00:01:44.780> off<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.260> you<00:01:45.380> have<00:01:45.560> access<00:01:45.830> to<00:01:46.190> a

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
pull it off and you have access to a

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.630 
pull it off and you have access to a
little<00:01:47.510> hole<00:01:47.690> in<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.170> back<00:01:48.380> of<00:01:48.650> the<00:01:49.310> pilot

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
little hole in the back of the pilot

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.980 
little hole in the back of the pilot
area<00:01:50.619> inside<00:01:51.619> where<00:01:52.340> you'll<00:01:52.939> find<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.570> low

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
area inside where you'll find the low

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.490 
area inside where you'll find the low
oxygen<00:01:54.470> sensor<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.430> if<00:01:56.119> you<00:01:56.240> just<00:01:56.540> use<00:01:56.840> no

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
oxygen sensor and if you just use no

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.620 
oxygen sensor and if you just use no
more<00:01:57.680> than<00:01:57.740> fifteen<00:01:58.310> or<00:01:58.430> twenty<00:01:58.729> pounds<00:01:59.210> air

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
more than fifteen or twenty pounds air

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.020 
more than fifteen or twenty pounds air
pressure<00:01:59.900> to<00:02:00.260> blow<00:02:00.470> that<00:02:00.680> out<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:01.430> then<00:02:01.820> also

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
pressure to blow that out and then also

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.859 
pressure to blow that out and then also
I<00:02:02.240> used<00:02:02.510> a<00:02:02.659> q-tip<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.200> clean<00:02:03.439> out<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:03.950> little<00:02:04.220> bit

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
I used a q-tip to clean out a little bit

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.410 
I used a q-tip to clean out a little bit
then<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:06.049> can<00:02:06.229> take<00:02:06.439> and<00:02:06.619> put<00:02:06.830> all<00:02:07.070> this<00:02:07.420> back

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
then you can take and put all this back

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.770 
then you can take and put all this back
on<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.610> again<00:02:10.610> here's<00:02:10.879> the<00:02:11.060> four<00:02:11.299> screws

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
on and again here's the four screws

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.539 
on and again here's the four screws
align<00:02:12.379> those<00:02:12.620> holes<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:14.049> though<00:02:15.549> actually

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
align those holes and though actually

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.399 
align those holes and though actually
for<00:02:17.090> us<00:02:17.239> really<00:02:17.540> took<00:02:17.810> care<00:02:18.019> of<00:02:18.049> the<00:02:18.139> problem

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
for us really took care of the problem

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.819 
for us really took care of the problem
once<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:18.919> did<00:02:19.159> that<00:02:19.389> this<00:02:20.389> thing<00:02:20.689> worked<00:02:21.079> like<00:02:21.560> a

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
once I did that this thing worked like a

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:22.360 
once I did that this thing worked like a
charm

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
charm

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.360 
charm
like<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:22.670> always<00:02:23.000> does<00:02:23.569> except<00:02:24.500> for<00:02:24.709> one<00:02:24.830> thing

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
like it always does except for one thing

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.690 
like it always does except for one thing
notice<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.510> switch<00:02:26.810> up<00:02:27.049> here<00:02:27.349> is<00:02:27.700> sticking

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
notice the switch up here is sticking

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.940 
notice the switch up here is sticking
out<00:02:28.959> well<00:02:29.959> when<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.260> went<00:02:30.409> to<00:02:30.530> clear<00:02:30.769> it<00:02:30.860> all

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
out well when I went to clear it all

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.070 
out well when I went to clear it all
back<00:02:31.190> together

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
back together

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.979 
back together
the<00:02:33.080> fan<00:02:33.319> wouldn't<00:02:33.680> work<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:35.450> took<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.840> all

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
the fan wouldn't work so I took it all

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.869 
the fan wouldn't work so I took it all
apart<00:02:36.290> again<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.860> messed<00:02:37.099> around<00:02:37.250> made<00:02:37.700> sure

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
apart again and messed around made sure

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.149 
apart again and messed around made sure
all<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.120> wires<00:02:38.269> were<00:02:38.569> hooked<00:02:38.840> up<00:02:39.049> and<00:02:39.470> then<00:02:40.099> I

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
all the wires were hooked up and then I

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.940 
all the wires were hooked up and then I
thought<00:02:40.549> well<00:02:40.989> why<00:02:41.989> don't<00:02:42.170> I<00:02:42.260> just<00:02:42.470> take<00:02:42.709> this

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
thought well why don't I just take this

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.729 
thought well why don't I just take this
switch<00:02:43.370> apart<00:02:43.849> and<00:02:44.150> took<00:02:44.900> hook<00:02:45.470> these<00:02:45.680> two

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
switch apart and took hook these two

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.740 
switch apart and took hook these two
wires<00:02:46.159> together<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.819> sure<00:02:47.030> enough<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.480> fan

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
wires together and sure enough the fan

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.610 
wires together and sure enough the fan
came<00:02:48.079> on<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.400> obviously<00:02:49.909> we're<00:02:50.870> still<00:02:50.989> up<00:02:51.409> here

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620
