00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.240
 loli girl finds you today 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.600
 for a little video two years got 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.099
 and make-up of the day basically held 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.309
 the make up I will not attend seeing that 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.390
 I made a video tutorial for you 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.800
 make this make-up simply 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.470
 it's a make up that I intend to wear 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.169
 for Christmas probably a make-up enough 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.140
 simple but with pretty colorful lips 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.700
 with a past not say bright at 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.200
 eye level knowing that I 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.079
 will wear my lenses and fossils 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.420
 so the book will be much more festive 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.449
 and 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.399
 and look after that we'll say yes here we go 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.649
 to say that the most obvious I ask you 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.030
 still without the glasses 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.609
 so it's a make-up that I realized 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.309
 with the slick palette he has storm 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.870
 the illusion of a marveled the powder of 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.629
 diamond but as forever a trait of 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.239
 liner and pencil anyway so what 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.100
 dude please go watch the video on 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.039
 lipstick is the italian figc 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.189
 of nix and I do routine a 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.229
 classical 

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:04.089
 So here I think of course this guy 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.470
 hours with fossils and my 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.250
 lenses so that will do a lot more 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.050
 intense but for that so at the level of 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.970
 accessories I wear small curls 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.330
 I already have you 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.229
 and they come from the site favor deal 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.580
 I had taken the same with the stone 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.440
 black they are very cute and then 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.209
 especially they are very good at going out at 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.640
 maintained you'll see the outfit a 

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:26.560
 necklace mahÃ© pamiers in yellow gold with the 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.119
 bracelet that goes with 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.399

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.619
 ring this video is a little bit 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.479
 improvised at the level of the castling I 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.509
 wears a dress so that comes from the site 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.000
 rome - it's an American site that makes 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.229
 a lot of super super fashion outfit to 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.210
 death do you really have power 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.159
 find everything for every budget 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.710
 it's very nice there everywhere in the 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.940
 world 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.369
 I also made a short video 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.860
 specific where I presented you this 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.990
 dress and other items that I have 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.770
 chosen on this site 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 so this proof I decided to the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.100
 to wear today she's not going to 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.909
 everything with the lipstick that I wear 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.750
 but as I wanted to do this tutorial 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.280
 here it turns out 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.780
 I did both at the same time but I 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.429
 will obviously change from red to 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.710
 lips to go out I would put a red 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.930
 lipstick in cream peach tones but 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.010
 good here I have not changed so 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.050
 maybe it's going to snatch you 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.490
 the combination of two colors but 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.320
 do you say that I will not go out like 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.400

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.350

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.880

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.310
 dress yes I know it's two things 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.840
 totally independent 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.130
 as to govern besides so the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.430
 top of the dress is a Peter Pan collar 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.350
 beautiful with two species of 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.020
 small petals of fabric with tulle 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.239
 you have around a golden border 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.610

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.040
