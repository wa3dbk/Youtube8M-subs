00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
and sadly of course the eyes are still

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.039 
and sadly of course the eyes are still
the<00:02:13.760> same<00:02:13.939> whereas<00:02:14.360> they<00:02:14.540> have<00:02:14.750> not<00:02:14.900> been

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
the same whereas they have not been

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.850 
the same whereas they have not been
embroidered<00:02:15.610> whereas<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.730> eyelashes<00:02:17.329> are

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
embroidered whereas the eyelashes are

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.600 
embroidered whereas the eyelashes are
still<00:02:18.860> which<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:20.750> can't<00:02:20.959> just<00:02:21.400> it's<00:02:22.400> kind<00:02:22.579> of

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
still which you can't just it's kind of

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.610 
still which you can't just it's kind of
frustrating<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:23.150> they<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.450> embroidered<00:02:24.260> the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
frustrating that they I embroidered the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.270

eyelashes but not the whole I I think it

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.250 
eyelashes but not the whole I I think it
