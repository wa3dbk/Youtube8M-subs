00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.290 
folder and file hierarchy you can see on

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.019 
folder and file hierarchy you can see on
my<00:00:28.380> folders<00:00:28.829> I<00:00:28.950> have<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> couple<00:00:29.340> files<00:00:29.669> here

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
my folders I have a couple files here

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.720 
my folders I have a couple files here
for<00:00:30.689> files<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.110> can<00:00:31.320> be<00:00:31.380> opened<00:00:31.680> natively<00:00:32.520> in

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
for files that can be opened natively in

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.430 
for files that can be opened natively in
an<00:00:32.820> iPod<00:00:33.210> touch<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.899> would<00:00:34.080> be<00:00:34.140> an<00:00:34.230> image

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
an iPod touch and that would be an image

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.170 
an iPod touch and that would be an image
file<00:00:34.770> like<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.220> screenshot<00:00:35.580> here<00:00:36.000> or<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
file like this screenshot here or the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.210 
file like this screenshot here or the
PDF<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:37.080> pretty<00:00:37.350> simple<00:00:37.650> all<00:00:37.830> you<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.100> is

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
PDF it's pretty simple all you do is

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.070 
PDF it's pretty simple all you do is
find<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> file<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.940> then<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.150> tap<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.810> so

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
find the file and then you tap on it so

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.870 
find the file and then you tap on it so
I'm<00:00:40.470> going<00:00:40.560> to<00:00:40.620> tap<00:00:40.830> on<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.070> image<00:00:41.340> file<00:00:41.580> and

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
I'm going to tap on this image file and

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.820 
I'm going to tap on this image file and
it's<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.720> to<00:00:42.780> generate<00:00:42.930> me<00:00:43.380> it's<00:00:43.620> going<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
it's going to generate me it's going to

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.790 
it's going to generate me it's going to
generate<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.220> quick<00:00:44.460> preview<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.350> zoom<00:00:46.680> in

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
generate a quick preview you can zoom in

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.840 
generate a quick preview you can zoom in
and<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.040> all<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> things<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.700> usually

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
and do all the things that you usually

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.210 
and do all the things that you usually
do<00:00:48.240> with<00:00:50.180> with<00:00:51.530> viewing<00:00:52.530> photos<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.040> can

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
do with with viewing photos so you can

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.100 
do with with viewing photos so you can
pinch<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.880> zoom<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.450> other<00:00:54.600> tricks<00:00:54.930> like

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
pinch and zoom and do other tricks like

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.260 
pinch and zoom and do other tricks like
that<00:00:55.220> PDF<00:00:56.220> is<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> same<00:00:56.670> thing<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.000> will<00:00:57.120> open

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
that PDF is the same thing it will open

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.630 
that PDF is the same thing it will open
it<00:00:57.480> right<00:00:57.570> away<00:00:57.720> but<00:00:58.470> it's<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.040> little<00:00:59.340> bit<00:00:59.520> more

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
it right away but it's a little bit more

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.850 
it right away but it's a little bit more
tricky<00:00:59.910> when<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.329> using<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.930> format<00:01:01.590> that's

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
tricky when you're using a format that's

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.770 
tricky when you're using a format that's
not<00:01:02.100> native<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> iPod<00:01:03.060> touch<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.600> here's

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
not native to the iPod touch and here's

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.290 
not native to the iPod touch and here's
what<00:01:03.930> happens<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:05.009> is<00:01:05.220> an<00:01:05.399> ePub<00:01:05.970> file

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
what happens so this is an ePub file

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.440 
what happens so this is an ePub file
it's<00:01:06.690> kind<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.990> large<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.620> I<00:01:08.490> want<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.150> open<00:01:09.240> it

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
it's kind of large and I want to open it

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.600 
it's kind of large and I want to open it
up<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.200> device<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.040> what's<00:01:11.460> going<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
up on this device so what's going to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.890 
up on this device so what's going to
happen<00:01:11.940> is<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.240> going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> download<00:01:12.630> it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
happen is it's going to download it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.200 
happen is it's going to download it
first<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.500> by<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.979> way<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.030> an

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
iPhone or an iPod Touch Dropbox does not

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.510 
iPhone or an iPod Touch Dropbox does not
store<00:01:18.390> all<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.690> your<00:01:18.870> full<00:01:19.170> folders<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.220> files

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
like it does on your desktop version it

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.649 
like it does on your desktop version it
just<00:01:22.740> stores<00:01:23.640> an<00:01:23.790> index<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.299> then<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> can

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
just stores an index and then you can

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.270 
just stores an index and then you can
select<00:01:25.260> the<00:01:25.440> photos<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.890> want<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.159> download
