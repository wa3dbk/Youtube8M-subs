00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
of the story there are times it is a

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.100 
of the story there are times it is a
little<00:01:14.340> bit<00:01:14.490> slower<00:01:14.820> because<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.869> so

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
little bit slower because it is so

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.390 
little bit slower because it is so
character<00:01:16.470> driven<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:16.890> these<00:01:17.070> stories

and you're kind of wondering how

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240 
and you're kind of wondering how
everything<00:01:19.049> kind<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.320> intertwines<00:01:19.830> together

very hesitant to read this story because
I<00:02:10.560> knew<00:02:10.920> there<00:02:11.069> was<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.250> huge<00:02:11.430> plot<00:02:11.670> twist<00:02:11.910> I

I knew there was this huge plot twist I

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.450 
I knew there was this huge plot twist I
didn't

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
didn't

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.190 
didn't
came<00:02:12.610> out<00:02:12.700> but<00:02:12.850> ultimately<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.540> didn't<00:02:14.050> really

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
came out but ultimately I didn't really

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.510 
came out but ultimately I didn't really
end<00:02:14.320> up<00:02:14.410> thinking<00:02:14.590> with<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:14.860> plot<00:02:15.070> twist<00:02:15.190> at<00:02:15.400> all

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
end up thinking with a plot twist at all

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.550 
end up thinking with a plot twist at all
and<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:16.120> think<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.600> story<00:02:16.840> is<00:02:16.990> so<00:02:17.170> much<00:02:17.230> more

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
and I think the story is so much more

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.500 
and I think the story is so much more
than<00:02:17.740> its<00:02:17.830> plot<00:02:17.980> twists<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.640> lot<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.210> people

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510

this imagery that almost feels like

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.320 
this imagery that almost feels like
magical<00:02:41.470> realism<00:02:41.740> but<00:02:42.010> it's<00:02:42.160> not<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.850> I

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
magical realism but it's not and I

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
recommend the audiobook because I

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.750 
recommend the audiobook because I
honestly<00:03:23.320> could<00:03:23.560> not<00:03:23.590> stop<00:03:24.190> listening<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.610> it

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.820 
honestly could not stop listening to it
and<00:03:25.000> it's<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.210> fairly<00:03:25.420> short<00:03:25.570> audiobook<00:03:26.380> so

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
and it's a fairly short audiobook so

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.050 
and it's a fairly short audiobook so
it's<00:03:26.950> really<00:03:27.100> one<00:03:27.340> that<00:03:27.460> if<00:03:27.580> you<00:03:27.700> wanted<00:03:27.910> to

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
it's really one that if you wanted to

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.120 
it's really one that if you wanted to
you<00:03:28.240> could<00:03:28.360> listen<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.960> in<00:03:29.050> a<00:03:29.170> day<00:03:29.320> as<00:03:29.920> far

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
you could listen to it in a day as far

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.620 
you could listen to it in a day as far
as<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.370> plot<00:03:30.550> like<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:30.970> said<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.300> is<00:03:31.360> very

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
as the plot like I said it is very

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.880 
as the plot like I said it is very
character-driven<00:03:32.050> there<00:03:32.410> are<00:03:32.500> times<00:03:32.740> that

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
character-driven there are times that

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.290 
character-driven there are times that
you<00:03:32.980> might<00:03:33.100> feel<00:03:33.310> like<00:03:33.400> it's<00:03:33.580> slow<00:03:33.820> I<00:03:34.060> never

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
you might feel like it's slow I never

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.550 
you might feel like it's slow I never
really<00:03:34.570> did<00:03:34.720> because<00:03:35.020> I<00:03:35.080> was<00:03:35.200> always<00:03:35.290> kind<00:03:35.530> of

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
really did because I was always kind of

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.600 
really did because I was always kind of
wondering<00:03:35.920> how<00:03:36.040> everything<00:03:36.520> was

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
wondering how everything was

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.280 
wondering how everything was
interweaving<00:03:37.090> there's<00:03:37.360> also<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.780> romantic

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
interweaving there's also a romantic

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.410 
interweaving there's also a romantic
plotline<00:03:38.920> in<00:03:39.070> this<00:03:39.310> story<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:39.910> I<00:03:40.090> really

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
plotline in this story and I really

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.060 
plotline in this story and I really
enjoyed<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.870> element<00:03:41.110> as<00:03:41.170> well<00:03:41.290> again<00:03:41.770> I

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
enjoyed that element as well again I

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.280 
enjoyed that element as well again I
felt<00:03:42.580> it<00:03:42.640> was<00:03:42.730> realistic<00:03:43.210> and<00:03:43.720> I<00:03:44.050> really

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
felt it was realistic and I really

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.780 
felt it was realistic and I really
enjoyed<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.770> way<00:03:44.860> that<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.130> was<00:03:45.250> done<00:03:45.490> I

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
enjoyed the way that it was done I

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.820 
enjoyed the way that it was done I
absolutely<00:03:46.120> loved<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:47.110> I<00:03:47.410> found<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.740> to<00:03:47.800> be

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
absolutely loved it I found it to be

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.250 
absolutely loved it I found it to be
very<00:03:47.890> realistic<00:03:48.460> for<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.880> teenage<00:03:49.480> romance<00:03:50.020> and

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
very realistic for a teenage romance and

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.300 
very realistic for a teenage romance and
a<00:03:50.320> romance<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.800> would<00:03:50.920> kind<00:03:51.100> of<00:03:51.190> be

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
a romance that would kind of be

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.070 
a romance that would kind of be
happening<00:03:51.730> on<00:03:51.880> this<00:03:52.090> island<00:03:52.300> and<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.870> just

happening on this island and I just

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.480 
happening on this island and I just
really<00:03:53.320> enjoyed<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:53.650> element<00:03:54.160> but<00:03:54.190> again<00:03:54.460> I
