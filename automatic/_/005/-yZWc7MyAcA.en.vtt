bit about our base light here

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.959 
bit about our base light here
essentially<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.399> very<00:00:41.579> minimal

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
essentially it's a it's very minimal

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.040 
essentially it's a it's very minimal
eyes<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.329> only<00:00:42.480> connected<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
eyes it's only connected in the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.810 
eyes it's only connected in the
forefront<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> binding<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.610> little

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
forefront of the binding and a little

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.850 
forefront of the binding and a little
bit<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> rear<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.510> well<00:00:45.539> too<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:46.829> that

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
bit in the rear as well too so what that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.100 
bit in the rear as well too so what that
does<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.520> lets<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.030> reflects<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.629> lot<00:00:48.840> more

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
does is it lets it reflects a lot more

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.260 
does is it lets it reflects a lot more
naturally<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.700> work<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.059> in

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
naturally and you work that in

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.830 
naturally and you work that in
conjunction<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:53.270> one<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.390> go<00:00:54.570> hey

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
conjunction with the one that go hey

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.470 
conjunction with the one that go hey
there<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.379> go<00:00:55.500> thanks<00:00:55.920> bear<00:00:56.149> you<00:00:57.149> work<00:00:57.300> that

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
there we go thanks bear you work that

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.319 
there we go thanks bear you work that
with<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.170> split<00:00:58.500> disc<00:00:58.800> as<00:00:59.039> well<00:00:59.219> here<00:00:59.850> too<00:01:00.030> so

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
with the split disc as well here too so

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.389 
with the split disc as well here too so
that<00:01:00.539> works<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:01.289> conjunction<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.949> say<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.309> it

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
that works in conjunction we say that it

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.560 
that works in conjunction we say that it
probably<00:01:02.579> flex<00:01:02.879> about<00:01:03.090> seventy<00:01:03.449> percent

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
probably flex about seventy percent

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.230 
probably flex about seventy percent
easier<00:01:04.229> than<00:01:04.409> your<00:01:04.589> traditional<00:01:04.860> base<00:01:05.729> plated

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
easier than your traditional base plated

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.420 
easier than your traditional base plated
binding<00:01:06.720> very<00:01:07.500> cool<00:01:07.740> let<00:01:07.890> me<00:01:07.950> see<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.189> point

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
binding very cool let me see that point

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.190 
binding very cool let me see that point
for<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> second<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.119> show<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.049> that's

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
for a second just to show so that's

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.890 
for a second just to show so that's
really<00:01:10.409> cool<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.860> disc<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:12.270> really<00:01:12.630> just

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
really cool on that disc it really just

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.260 
really cool on that disc it really just
flexes<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.680> that's<00:01:13.950> not<00:01:14.130> how<00:01:14.400> obviously<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
flexes so that's not how obviously a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.670 
flexes so that's not how obviously a
regular<00:01:15.630> blade<00:01:15.780> faceplate<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.590> you're

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
regular blade faceplate that you're

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.770 
regular blade faceplate that you're
going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> find<00:01:17.040> out<00:01:17.189> every<00:01:17.640> other<00:01:17.790> finding

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
going to find out every other finding

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.929 
going to find out every other finding
out<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.380> no<00:01:19.530> flex<00:01:19.860> right<00:01:20.310> right<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.790> what

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
out there is no flex right right so what

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.969 
out there is no flex right right so what
it<00:01:21.030> does<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.450> lets<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> binding<00:01:22.259> flex<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.830> lot

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
it does it lets the binding flex a lot

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.649 
it does it lets the binding flex a lot
more<00:01:23.130> naturally<00:01:23.729> with<00:01:24.030> your<00:01:24.240> board<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
more naturally with your board it

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.600 
more naturally with your board it
doesn't<00:01:24.900> give<00:01:25.080> any<00:01:25.380> any<00:01:25.860> dead<00:01:26.280> spots

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
doesn't give any any dead spots

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.730 
doesn't give any any dead spots
whatsoever<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.479> definitely<00:01:27.720> has<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.200> much

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
whatsoever so it definitely has a much

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.039 
whatsoever so it definitely has a much
more<00:01:29.009> freer<00:01:29.520> type<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.970> feel<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.299> feels<00:01:30.570> feels

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
more freer type of feel it feels feels

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.670 
more freer type of feel it feels feels
awesome<00:01:31.490> yeah<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.820> top<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:34.020> lot

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
awesome yeah and on top of it to a lot

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.410 
awesome yeah and on top of it to a lot
of<00:01:34.799> times<00:01:34.979> where<00:01:35.280> boards<00:01:35.640> break<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.060> typically

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
of times where boards break is typically

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.770 
of times where boards break is typically
rate<00:01:36.720> around<00:01:37.110> your<00:01:37.799> ear<00:01:38.220> binding<00:01:38.880> area<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.509> it

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
rate around your ear binding area so it

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.719 
rate around your ear binding area so it
can<00:01:39.960> kind<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.259> degrees<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.799> your<00:01:41.520> board

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
can kind of degrees on your board

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.429 
can kind of degrees on your board
breakage<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.119> well<00:01:42.270> too<00:01:42.420> yeah<00:01:42.780> nice<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.350> then

the EBA fair that you're talking about
that<00:01:45.560> that<00:01:46.560> covers<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> yeah<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.850> what

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
that that covers that yeah this is what

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.300 
that that covers that yeah this is what
we<00:01:48.060> call<00:01:48.240> simmer<00:01:48.570> down<00:01:48.659> technology<00:01:49.470> it's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
we call simmer down technology it's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.950 
we call simmer down technology it's
basically<00:01:50.729> two<00:01:51.030> different<00:01:51.060> densities<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
basically two different densities of

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.280 
basically two different densities of
foam<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> outside<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.659> lateral<00:01:55.200> side

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
foam on the outside on the lateral side

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.050 
foam on the outside on the lateral side
of<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.799> pad<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.369> little<00:01:56.549> bit<00:01:56.640> harder<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
of the pad it's a little bit harder a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.459 
of the pad it's a little bit harder a
little<00:01:57.119> bit<00:01:57.360> stiffer<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.840> that's<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> little

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
little bit stiffer and that's a little

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.230 
little bit stiffer and that's a little
bit<00:01:58.560> softer<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> media<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.790> inside

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
bit softer on the media on the inside

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.300 
bit softer on the media on the inside
and<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.840> what<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.049> does<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.439> lets<00:02:01.829> your<00:02:01.979> boots

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and so what it does it lets your boots

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.170 
and so what it does it lets your boots
naturally<00:02:03.030> can't<00:02:03.450> with

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
naturally can't with

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.140 
naturally can't with
when<00:02:04.600> your<00:02:04.720> place<00:02:04.900> in<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.290> bindings<00:02:05.650> which

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
when your place in the bindings which

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.609 
when your place in the bindings which
once<00:02:07.150> you<00:02:07.240> get<00:02:07.390> some<00:02:07.570> of<00:02:07.600> those<00:02:07.720> wider<00:02:07.990> stances

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
once you get some of those wider stances

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.919 
once you get some of those wider stances
it<00:02:09.490> could<00:02:09.670> be<00:02:09.759> kind<00:02:10.060> of<00:02:10.240> harsh<00:02:10.479> on<00:02:10.660> your<00:02:10.750> knees

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
it could be kind of harsh on your knees

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.200 
it could be kind of harsh on your knees
so<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.200> lets<00:02:11.380> them<00:02:11.470> naturally<00:02:11.800> camp<00:02:12.700> in<00:02:12.940> where

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
so it lets them naturally camp in where

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.700 
so it lets them naturally camp in where
it<00:02:13.300> towards<00:02:13.540> one<00:02:13.690> another<00:02:13.720> that's<00:02:14.470> cool

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
it towards one another that's cool

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.690 
it towards one another that's cool
because<00:02:14.800> that's<00:02:15.010> sort<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.370> trend<00:02:15.610> right

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
because that's sort of the trend right

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.880 
because that's sort of the trend right
now<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.030> grab<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.570> really<00:02:16.990> wide<00:02:17.170> stance<00:02:17.590> so

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
now is to grab it really wide stance so

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.680 
now is to grab it really wide stance so
yeah<00:02:18.310> especially<00:02:18.940> with<00:02:19.030> like<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.300> rockered

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
yeah especially with like a rockered

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.030 
yeah especially with like a rockered
board<00:02:19.720> that's<00:02:20.230> really<00:02:20.560> going<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.740> help<00:02:20.800> you

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
board that's really going to help you

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.350 
board that's really going to help you
kind<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.280> give<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.490> get<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.120> extra

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
kind of give that get that extra

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.000 
kind of give that get that extra
leverage<00:02:22.660> over<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.350> outside<00:02:23.740> of<00:02:23.860> your

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
leverage over the outside of your

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.160 
leverage over the outside of your
binding<00:02:24.430> as<00:02:24.820> well<00:02:25.030> as<00:02:25.180> like<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.660> said<00:02:25.690> correct

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
binding as well as like you said correct

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.990 
binding as well as like you said correct
your<00:02:26.380> your<00:02:26.770> knees<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.280> cracker<00:02:27.520> our<00:02:27.730> stance

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
your your knees and cracker our stance

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.449 
your your knees and cracker our stance
yeah<00:02:28.510> just<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.930> real<00:02:29.110> good<00:02:29.320> natural<00:02:29.620> feel<00:02:29.950> very

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
yeah just a real good natural feel very

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.400 
yeah just a real good natural feel very
nice<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.970> then<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.930> chassis<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.350> this

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
nice and then so the chassis and this

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.050 
nice and then so the chassis and this
bindings<00:02:32.800> a<00:02:32.830> little<00:02:33.010> different<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.400> chest<00:02:33.790> yep

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
bindings a little different to chest yep

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.330 
bindings a little different to chest yep
the<00:02:34.570> way<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.870> we<00:02:34.959> do<00:02:35.080> our<00:02:35.110> chess<00:02:35.800> is<00:02:35.980> on<00:02:36.130> our

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the way that we do our chess is on our

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.430 
the way that we do our chess is on our
bindings<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.940> we<00:02:37.120> use<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.300> composite<00:02:37.720> material

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
bindings is we use a composite material

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.290 
bindings is we use a composite material
for<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.709> base<00:02:38.860> plates<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:39.520> we<00:02:40.150> use<00:02:40.270> a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
for the base plates so we use a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.510 
for the base plates so we use a
composite<00:02:40.570> because<00:02:41.080> softer<00:02:41.920> material<00:02:42.370> it

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
composite because softer material it

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.880 
composite because softer material it
absorbs<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.090> lot<00:02:43.120> more<00:02:43.420> less<00:02:43.900> chatter<00:02:44.290> better

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
absorbs a lot more less chatter better

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.760 
absorbs a lot more less chatter better
for<00:02:45.130> impact<00:02:45.520> and<00:02:45.760> then<00:02:46.209> we<00:02:46.450> for<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.620> heel

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
for impact and then we for the the heel

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.100 
for impact and then we for the the heel
cup<00:02:48.010> we<00:02:48.160> use<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.400> high-grade<00:02:48.940> aluminum<00:02:49.420> that

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
cup we use a high-grade aluminum that

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.870 
cup we use a high-grade aluminum that
extends<00:02:50.620> all<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:50.830> way<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.370> forefront<00:02:51.730> of

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
extends all the way to the forefront of

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.270 
extends all the way to the forefront of
the<00:02:51.970> binding<00:02:52.300> so<00:02:52.510> aluminum<00:02:53.440> much<00:02:53.770> stronger

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
the binding so aluminum much stronger

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.699 
the binding so aluminum much stronger
more<00:02:54.520> reactive<00:02:55.000> better<00:02:55.480> toe<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:55.959> heel<00:02:56.320> type<00:02:56.590> of

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
more reactive better toe to heel type of

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.740 
more reactive better toe to heel type of
response<00:02:56.920> as<00:02:57.340> well<00:02:57.580> get<00:02:58.239> that<00:02:58.390> power<00:02:58.630> that

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
response as well get that power that

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.000 
response as well get that power that
response<00:02:59.230> where<00:02:59.410> you<00:02:59.500> need<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.709> but<00:02:59.890> then

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
response where you need it but then

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.260 
response where you need it but then
you've<00:03:00.130> got<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.459> lightweight<00:03:00.850> what's<00:03:01.150> the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
you've got the lightweight what's the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.540 
you've got the lightweight what's the
best<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.600> both<00:03:01.690> worlds<00:03:02.110> yeah<00:03:02.650> nice<00:03:02.980> yep<00:03:03.340> and

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
best of both worlds yeah nice yep and

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.280 
best of both worlds yeah nice yep and
then<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.330> let's<00:03:04.480> talk<00:03:04.570> about<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.900> straps<00:03:05.170> a

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
then so let's talk about the straps a

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.560 
then so let's talk about the straps a
little<00:03:05.470> bit<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:06.459> is<00:03:06.610> our<00:03:06.760> throat<00:03:07.150> own<00:03:07.300> toe

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
little bit this is our throat own toe

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.780 
little bit this is our throat own toe
cap<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:07.989> it's<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.170> full<00:03:08.440> toe<00:03:08.680> wrap<00:03:08.920> it's<00:03:09.670> going

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
cap so it's a full toe wrap it's going

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.670 
cap so it's a full toe wrap it's going
to<00:03:09.820> keep<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.269> real<00:03:10.630> snug<00:03:11.019> real<00:03:11.380> secure

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
to keep you real snug real secure

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.199 
to keep you real snug real secure
perhaps<00:03:12.130> real<00:03:12.310> real<00:03:12.489> Knights<00:03:12.730> keeps<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.090> all

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
perhaps real real Knights keeps it all

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.789 
perhaps real real Knights keeps it all
the<00:03:13.360> way<00:03:13.450> locked<00:03:13.750> into<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.110> back<00:03:14.350> heel<00:03:14.680> loop

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
the way locked into the back heel loop

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.620 
the way locked into the back heel loop
