dancer<00:03:51.350> really<00:03:52.350> your<00:03:52.799> life<00:03:53.069> is<00:03:53.310> very<00:03:53.519> limited

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.559 
dancer really your life is very limited
I<00:03:54.269> think<00:03:54.569> if<00:03:54.750> right<00:03:54.989> maybe<00:03:55.290> 35<00:03:56.069> minute<00:03:56.970> 40<00:03:57.450> is

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
I think if right maybe 35 minute 40 is

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.960 
I think if right maybe 35 minute 40 is
stretching<00:03:58.109> it<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.859> hopefully<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.430> go<00:03:59.670> on<00:03:59.819> to

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
stretching it and hopefully you go on to

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.940 
stretching it and hopefully you go on to
other<00:04:00.120> things<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.930> know<00:04:01.109> and<00:04:01.290> if<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:01.650> want<00:04:01.859> to

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950
