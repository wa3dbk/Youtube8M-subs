00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 I'm here with the three most renowned thinkers in Brazil who 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.519
 and the ricardo who had just attended a roundtable of a 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:11.809
 lecture 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.819
 in an environment totally different from the work environment has a three 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:19.199
 hectares and ratified the importance of the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.819
 from the fields day-to-day subjects with the discussion environment as left 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.019
 I think the result that 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.800
 this rock fundamentalism report 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.480
 the horse sports championship by price increases is key 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.960
 simon tenenbaum that he's stuck moto stolen and that he always had a 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.290
 fatter the life-span 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.000
 is one of the most important things like the Coke and the north chain 7-0 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.400
 Everything's over 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.240
 one of the subjects discussed here was the importance of the formation of the end of the 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.200
 current year the importance of academic training 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.200
 How do you see it's amazing that the future here in Brazil 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.880
 of training 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.800
 like I said in the lecture are short courses still 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.980
 but the show-class is not to have a school of bullfighters scared wide contest 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.170
 how was a new beginning of the month 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.200
 there is a corey wing and that no doubt learning and going through 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.480
 any type of vocational training 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.860
 and we can not get the treatment to create a holiday for the day. 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.420
 night did not take too long demand very study requires a lot of practice 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.500
 and U.S 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.660
 God damnit, we can get out in a not too short time, but it's also gone. 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.860
 that I believe that in the next years we will be developing and reached the 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.580
 smoking was very young effective Brazil on top of that there they believe that a 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.950
 event like this may be the first step for us to evolve in this sense of 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.759
 organize better and became 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.900
 hence Brazilian culture 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.300
 no doubt mainly to 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.770
 to emphasize the importance 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.050
 I went back to the work of the cerrado 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.230
 talking about the creation of the horse a general way here we have veterinary 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.670
 creators the owners then the elias and integration is very important 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.520
 we got it was never done before
