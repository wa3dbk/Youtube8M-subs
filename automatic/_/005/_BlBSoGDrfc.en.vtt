00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.240 

something<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.120> think<00:00:12.750> about<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.139> lot<00:00:13.320> because<00:00:13.830> I

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
something I think about a lot because I

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.730 
something I think about a lot because I
don't<00:00:14.490> believe<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:15.059> talking<00:00:15.299> about

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
immigration purely in a Western context

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.880 
immigration purely in a Western context
I<00:00:18.420> think<00:00:18.449> that's<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.960> mistake<00:00:19.080> because<00:00:19.500> every

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
I think that's a mistake because every

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.779 
I think that's a mistake because every
country<00:00:20.310> as<00:00:20.960> immigrants<00:00:21.960> refugees<00:00:23.510> exile

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
country as immigrants refugees exile

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.050 
country as immigrants refugees exile
it's<00:00:26.300> a<00:00:26.480> discussion<00:00:26.869> that<00:00:27.050> should<00:00:27.349> take<00:00:27.529> place

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
it's a discussion that should take place

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.429 
it's a discussion that should take place
across<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.179> globe<00:00:29.570> I<00:00:29.749> think<00:00:29.989> you<00:00:30.140> know<00:00:30.230> just

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
across the globe I think you know just

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.080 
across the globe I think you know just
like<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:30.859> discussion<00:00:31.369> about<00:00:31.519> human<00:00:31.910> rights

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
like the discussion about human rights

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.869 
like the discussion about human rights
databases<00:00:32.870> it's<00:00:33.290> similar<00:00:34.040> to<00:00:34.190> mistake<00:00:34.699> to

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
databases it's similar to mistake to

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.630 
databases it's similar to mistake to

do<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:43.580> feel<00:03:43.910> about<00:03:43.970> that<00:03:44.560> you<00:03:45.560> know<00:03:45.770> that's

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
do you feel about that you know that's

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.790 
do you feel about that you know that's
not<00:03:46.130> for<00:03:46.340> me<00:03:46.370> to<00:03:46.510> really<00:03:47.510> comment<00:03:48.110> on<00:03:48.230> but<00:03:48.560> I

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
not for me to really comment on but I

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.220 
not for me to really comment on but I
see<00:03:49.340> from<00:03:49.640> from<00:03:50.090> an<00:03:50.180> Indian<00:03:50.480> perspective<00:03:50.630> I

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
see from from an Indian perspective I

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.650 
see from from an Indian perspective I
always<00:03:51.820> tend<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:52.940> look<00:03:53.030> at<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.270> world<00:03:53.390> from

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
always tend to look at the world from

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.440 
always tend to look at the world from
from<00:03:54.380> an<00:03:54.530> Indian<00:03:54.830> perspective<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:56.090> it's<00:03:56.270> such

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
from an Indian perspective and it's such

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.180 
from an Indian perspective and it's such
a<00:03:56.480> I<00:03:56.660> think<00:03:57.050> it's<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.230> tremendously<00:03:57.920> difficult

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
a I think it's a tremendously difficult

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.040 
a I think it's a tremendously difficult
discussion<00:03:58.910> that<00:03:59.030> so<00:03:59.210> many<00:03:59.390> nations<00:03:59.870> are

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
discussion that so many nations are

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.540 
discussion that so many nations are
going<00:04:00.350> through<00:04:00.620> is<00:04:00.800> how<00:04:01.070> exactly<00:04:01.930> you<00:04:02.930> know<00:04:03.050> to

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
going through is how exactly you know to

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.760 
going through is how exactly you know to
construct<00:04:04.550> this<00:04:05.110> conversation<00:04:06.110> with<00:04:06.350> the

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
construct this conversation with the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.730 
construct this conversation with the
center<00:04:07.550> of<00:04:07.580> power<00:04:08.230> because<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.500> power

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
center of power because the power

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.230 
center of power because the power
imbalance<00:04:10.310> has<00:04:10.370> remained<00:04:10.850> intact<00:04:11.270> or

imbalance has remained intact or

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.120 
imbalance has remained intact or
since<00:04:12.900> colonial<00:04:13.170> times<00:04:13.410> you<00:04:13.890> know<00:04:14.010> you're

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
since colonial times you know you're

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.910 
since colonial times you know you're
still<00:04:14.690> negotiating<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.990> immense<00:04:16.500> power

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920

divided and very much the subject of my
work<00:04:20.730> is<00:04:20.910> how<00:04:21.300> it<00:04:21.570> affects<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.140> on<00:04:22.410> a<00:04:22.950> personal

work is how it affects you on a personal

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.340 
work is how it affects you on a personal
level<00:04:23.520> when<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.090> are<00:04:24.420> obviously<00:04:24.750> on<00:04:25.320> the
