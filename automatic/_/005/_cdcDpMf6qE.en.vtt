as<00:05:14.720> many<00:05:15.020> hogs<00:05:15.349> were<00:05:15.919> raised<00:05:16.280> as<00:05:16.729> there<00:05:17.090> are

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
as many hogs were raised as there are

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.969 
as many hogs were raised as there are
today<00:05:17.599> they<00:05:18.410> were<00:05:18.470> raised<00:05:18.830> by<00:05:19.039> family<00:05:19.490> farmers

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
today they were raised by family farmers

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.950 
today they were raised by family farmers
we<00:05:21.979> had<00:05:22.190> competitive<00:05:22.910> markets<00:05:23.300> family

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
we had competitive markets family

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.779 
we had competitive markets family
farmers<00:05:24.380> could<00:05:24.560> make<00:05:24.740> a<00:05:24.770> living<00:05:25.039> raising<00:05:25.580> hogs

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
farmers could make a living raising hogs

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.159
