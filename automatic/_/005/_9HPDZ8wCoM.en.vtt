00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.940 
looking for breakaway opportunities all
the<00:02:40.040> time<00:02:40.249> so<00:02:40.669> watching<00:02:40.999> NHL<00:02:41.359> 12<00:02:41.659> he<00:02:42.590> starts

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
the time so watching NHL 12 he starts

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.920 
the time so watching NHL 12 he starts
coming<00:02:43.189> up<00:02:43.430> ice<00:02:43.639> while<00:02:44.419> the<00:02:44.540> puck<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.900> still

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
coming up ice while the puck is still

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.559 
coming up ice while the puck is still
loose<00:02:45.169> because<00:02:45.590> he<00:02:45.859> thinks<00:02:46.129> maybe<00:02:46.730> his<00:02:46.969> team's

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
loose because he thinks maybe his team's

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.240 
loose because he thinks maybe his team's
going<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.900> get<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.109> puck<00:02:48.319> that's<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:48.980> kind<00:02:49.189> of

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
going to get the puck that's the kind of

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.920 
going to get the puck that's the kind of
player<00:02:49.459> he<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.699> so<00:02:50.239> he's<00:02:50.389> going<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.599> take<00:02:50.780> that

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
player he is so he's going to take that

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.869 
player he is so he's going to take that
chance<00:02:51.230> in<00:02:51.439> this<00:02:51.769> case<00:02:51.980> he<00:02:52.159> does<00:02:52.340> get<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:52.669> puck

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
chance in this case he does get the puck

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.270 
chance in this case he does get the puck
and<00:02:53.060> goes<00:02:53.810> in<00:02:54.019> for<00:02:54.349> a<00:02:54.409> breakaway<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:54.829> scores

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
and goes in for a breakaway and scores

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.659 
and goes in for a breakaway and scores
that's<00:02:55.790> realistic<00:02:56.209> Alex<00:02:56.840> Ovechkin

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:57.669 
that's realistic Alex Ovechkin

00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:59.979 
that's realistic Alex Ovechkin
anticipation<00:02:58.669> is<00:02:58.939> also<00:02:59.209> just<00:02:59.449> as<00:02:59.599> important

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
anticipation is also just as important

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.860 
anticipation is also just as important
on<00:03:00.079> defense<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:01.219> let's<00:03:01.400> look<00:03:01.519> at<00:03:01.639> NHL<00:03:02.000> 11<00:03:02.150> you

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
on defense so let's look at NHL 11 you

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.390 
on defense so let's look at NHL 11 you
know<00:03:02.959> we<00:03:03.079> had<00:03:03.169> a<00:03:03.199> good<00:03:03.319> defense<00:03:03.769> but<00:03:04.159> they<00:03:04.310> were

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
know we had a good defense but they were

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.879 
know we had a good defense but they were
very<00:03:04.549> passive<00:03:05.180> they<00:03:05.930> were<00:03:05.989> reactive<00:03:06.650> not

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
very passive they were reactive not

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.129 
very passive they were reactive not
really<00:03:07.159> proactive<00:03:07.659> and<00:03:08.659> in<00:03:08.780> this<00:03:08.900> case

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
really proactive and in this case

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.349 
really proactive and in this case
Chicago<00:03:09.709> is<00:03:09.919> easily<00:03:10.579> able<00:03:10.699> to<00:03:11.000> gain<00:03:11.209> the
