you to be able to do that after that

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.480 
you to be able to do that after that
based<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.380> what<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.650> see<00:01:37.890> yourself<00:01:38.250> needing

within<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> champions<00:01:39.329> kit<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.079> create<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
within a champions kit you can create a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.859 
within a champions kit you can create a
list<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.979> bunch<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> champions<00:01:41.850> at<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.570> time

I<00:01:43.049> was<00:01:43.259> looking<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.740> learn<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.070> new<00:01:44.220> champion

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
I was looking to learn a new champion

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.130 
I was looking to learn a new champion
for<00:01:44.790> mid<00:01:44.970> lane<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.420> made<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> list<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.990> about

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
for mid lane so I made a list of about

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.780 
for mid lane so I made a list of about
eight<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.590> twelve<00:01:46.710> champions<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.399> fit<00:01:47.640> my

eight to twelve champions that fit my

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.880 
eight to twelve champions that fit my
criteria<00:01:47.990> from<00:01:48.990> there<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.619> take<00:01:49.740> out

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
criteria from there you can take out

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.649 
criteria from there you can take out
champions<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.820> can't<00:01:51.240> really<00:01:51.420> see

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
champions that you just can't really see

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.539 
champions that you just can't really see

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
afraid to play off meta picks especially

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.219 
afraid to play off meta picks especially
since<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.729> kind<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.270> Sola<00:02:00.540> q<00:02:00.810> anyways

since it is kind of just Sola q anyways

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.990 
since it is kind of just Sola q anyways
it's<00:02:01.710> better<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.130> play<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.340> champion<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:02.850> you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
it's better to play a champion that you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.850 
it's better to play a champion that you
can<00:02:03.149> do<00:02:03.270> well<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.719> then<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> champion<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.770> is

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
can do well on then a champion that is

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.679 
can do well on then a champion that is

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
lane and I was great at playing the

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.160 
lane and I was great at playing the
really<00:02:17.370> aggressive<00:02:17.879> assassin<00:02:18.540> playstyle<00:02:18.959> and

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
really aggressive assassin playstyle and

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.110 
really aggressive assassin playstyle and

starting team fights with her after her

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.970 
starting team fights with her after her
changes<00:02:21.510> however<00:02:21.629> even<00:02:22.200> when<00:02:22.349> she<00:02:22.500> was<00:02:22.530> really

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
changes however even when she was really

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.429 
changes however even when she was really
really<00:02:23.340> overpowered<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.150> had<00:02:24.299> a<00:02:24.329> 58%<00:02:25.049> win

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.110 
really overpowered and had a 58% win
rate<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.739> solo<00:02:25.980> queue<00:02:26.189> across<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.700> board<00:02:26.969> I

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
rate and solo queue across the board I

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.149 
rate and solo queue across the board I
actually<00:02:27.420> performed<00:02:27.829> terribly<00:02:28.829> on<00:02:28.950> her

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
actually performed terribly on her

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.830 
actually performed terribly on her
because<00:02:29.489> she<00:02:29.640> shifted<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.150> being<00:02:30.359> more<00:02:30.629> of<00:02:30.720> a

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
because she shifted to being more of a

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.440 
because she shifted to being more of a
kite<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.409> poke<00:02:31.769> mage<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.340> got<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:32.849> lot<00:02:33.150> worse

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
kite and poke mage and got a lot worse

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.259 
kite and poke mage and got a lot worse
at<00:02:33.689> aggressive<00:02:34.200> play<00:02:34.379> initiations<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:36.120> my

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
at aggressive play initiations and so my

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.390 
at aggressive play initiations and so my
win<00:02:36.540> rate<00:02:36.569> on<00:02:36.930> her<00:02:37.049> plummeted<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.859> actually

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
win rate on her plummeted to of actually

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.970 
win rate on her plummeted to of actually
around<00:02:38.579> 20%<00:02:39.450> or<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:39.629> despite<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.530> fact<00:02:40.889> that

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
around 20% or so despite the fact that

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.890 
around 20% or so despite the fact that
she<00:02:41.159> was<00:02:41.310> easily<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.879> strongest<00:02:41.939> champion<00:02:42.810> in

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
she was easily the strongest champion in

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.899 
she was easily the strongest champion in
the<00:02:42.989> game<00:02:43.019> at<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.469> time<00:02:43.590> since<00:02:44.489> she<00:02:44.670> no<00:02:44.879> longer

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
the game at the time since she no longer

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.660 
the game at the time since she no longer
fit<00:02:45.480> my<00:02:45.659> personal<00:02:46.200> playstyle<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:47.370> after

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
fit my personal playstyle so after

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.699 
fit my personal playstyle so after
narrowing<00:02:48.090> down<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.599> new<00:02:48.810> list<00:02:49.019> of<00:02:49.200> mid<00:02:49.379> laners

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
narrowing down a new list of mid laners

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.199 
narrowing down a new list of mid laners
to<00:02:49.859> around<00:02:50.099> three<00:02:50.340> or<00:02:50.370> four<00:02:50.549> champions<00:02:51.060> I

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
to around three or four champions I

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.420 
to around three or four champions I
ended<00:02:51.750> up<00:02:51.810> deciding<00:02:51.959> that<00:02:52.319> learning<00:02:52.889> animate

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
ended up deciding that learning animate

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.890 
ended up deciding that learning animate
would<00:02:53.609> actually<00:02:53.909> be<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.090> best<00:02:54.209> option<00:02:54.720> for<00:02:54.750> me

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
would actually be the best option for me

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.569 
would actually be the best option for me
since<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.319> fits<00:02:55.500> my<00:02:55.650> play<00:02:55.859> style<00:02:56.040> really<00:02:56.400> well

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
since it fits my play style really well

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.550 
since it fits my play style really well
and<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:57.299> do<00:02:57.359> plan<00:02:57.659> on<00:02:57.780> learning<00:02:57.959> probably

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
and I do plan on learning probably

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.289 
and I do plan on learning probably
lasondra<00:02:59.159> next<00:02:59.549> when<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.090> get<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.269> a

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
lasondra next when you get to a

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.089 
lasondra next when you get to a
shortlist<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.959> just<00:03:01.169> a<00:03:01.230> handful<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.620> champions
