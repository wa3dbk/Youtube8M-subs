family it was really difficult but there

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.760 
family it was really difficult but there
was<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:45.030> some<00:01:45.479> way<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:45.869> able<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.140> persevere

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
was in some way I was able to persevere

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.380 
was in some way I was able to persevere
through<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.189> all<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.579> think<00:01:47.640> back<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.299> I'm

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
through it all and I think back and I'm

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.399 
through it all and I think back and I'm
like<00:01:48.479> wow<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> don't<00:01:48.990> know<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> could<00:01:49.320> have

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
like wow I don't know if I could have

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.100 
like wow I don't know if I could have
done<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.649> now<00:01:49.710> because<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.759> didn't<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.180> well

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
done that now because I didn't have well

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.830 
done that now because I didn't have well
I<00:01:52.470> didn't<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.759> sense<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.630> reality

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
I didn't have that sense of reality

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.889 
I didn't have that sense of reality
weighing<00:01:55.439> down<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.799> me<00:01:56.159> too<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.030> it's

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
weighing down on me too so it's

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.410 
weighing down on me too so it's
interesting<00:01:58.259> how<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.820> older<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.210> get<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
interesting how the older you get the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.319 
interesting how the older you get the
harder<00:02:00.689> life<00:02:01.259> seems<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.159> get<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.579> because<00:02:03.090> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
harder life seems to get to because you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.569 
harder life seems to get to because you
lose<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> little<00:02:03.840> bit<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.290> magic<00:02:04.579> it's
