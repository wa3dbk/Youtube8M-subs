 boxer and also as a fan of 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.670
 boxing good as we all hope that 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.060
 floyd mayweather then of a tremendous 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.340
 fight we know that a lot of people do not 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.990
 like floyd's boxing for even so that 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.019
 a man who combines his hand going well 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.670
 to be more inward and looking for 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.420
 out then 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.920
 as I eat a taste that I am the fight 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.710
 Manny Pacquiao has to do 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.350
 in looking for by combining the hand and 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.380
 looking like they do not have to floyd the fight 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.120
 of floyd to keep the furthest 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.400
 that can be manny pacquiao so that no 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.280
 can enter manny pacquiao counterattack 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.160
 to the blows I imagine that I wait in 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.850
 God that of a very good fight 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.100
 both and the one that better points the fight 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.150
 today they are going to fight in 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.870
 this square can be thought of a knockout 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.930
 or is an idea that must be ruled out 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.320
 not that fight no and not every one fights 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.490
 decision I'll write flower 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.170
 we know that a man that is difficult to 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.560
 he is seized by a man this one moves very 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.810
 well world there is really already he has 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.180
 a wonderful talent to spend a lot 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.000
 blow and although manny pacquiao a man 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.590
 what do I do this combines and is human 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.259
 but I bring that manny pacquiao 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.920
 well understanding a man well alive with 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.289
 much wisdom and in boxing he has 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.170
 sent the almost in all the fights and has 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.470
 done that job well because you say that 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.560
 Manny Pacquiao must counterattack when 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.770
 we know that floyd is the master of 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.460
 kickback good yesterday we had a class 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.159
 both on the beating of manny 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.979
 pacquiao and how he should hit on the 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.229
 moment when floyd mayweather 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.430
 combines his hand well another saw that the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.590
 hand 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.869
 the lower hand he holds flower in 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.190
 right then go to the right that 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.680
 comes then comes at the same time the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.170
 left by manny pacquiao 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.930
 manny pacquiao considers hitting 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.900
 quickly the blow that comes the flow 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.370
 same has to come the blow of manny 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.370
 pacquiao work that 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.240
 Manny Pacquiao has to do a quick 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.460
 backlash kickback at the fastest 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.860
 that can come any hand from 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.490
 floyd the same has to come the same 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.560
 from manny pacquiao because yes 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.740
 I still do not allow manny 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.380
 pacquiao 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.290
 sorry if we allow floyd 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.270
 mayweather is counterattacked as fast 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.500
 he does it and he will not touch him then 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.870
 you have to wait for the teeti of 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.170
 first to kick back the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.870
 your combination is my opinion prosthesis 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.250
 Expect Mayweather to hit you 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.620
 fear then he's never going to hit 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.600
 then wait first for him to come and 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.860
 then attack very quickly with much 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.920
 inverse 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.080
 now the matter of entering and leaving today 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.510
 can do that perfectly but in the 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.720
 manny case can enter 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.030
 and I'll keep going in probably not 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.010
 leave the insight's line of fire 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.959
 what he's talking about going in but 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.959
 without leaving or have to leave 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.090
 look at all the fights are not equal me 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:38.150
 I 'll tell you something manny pacquiao no 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.090
 you have to put up with it but if you were a delegate 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.260
 hold my hand to manny pacquiao I say 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:48.700
 that there is correctly the fight is over 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.700
 but if I know that manny pacquiao 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.220
 he is a man who is not going to hit 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.290
 then easily raised nothing because 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.810
 the bauer frame has a leg and combines 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:04.030
 well your hand already the image moves and 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:07.070
 when when you and you and you follow 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.620
 against hitting the combinations and not 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.540
 lets him recover the egg problem 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.220
 he has the possibility of winning but if 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.130
 one combines your hand signature footprint 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.380
 bars and you're going you're going fast 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.570
 the hand and has a set of legs that 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.880
 it moves that you go when you look 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.360
 who wants to combine what happens and not what 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.680
 you have 7 it was so I hope we wait 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.600
 a lot of action from your point of view or 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.700
 whether you are explaining all that 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.350
 we expect a fight that has too much 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:39.180
 action in each round 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:41.970
 there is variant variant fight in the 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.580
 fight this web form and manny pacquiao 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.920
 because not all every round 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.170
 are going to be the same low several depends the 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.000
 corner of floyd spender blake and neft 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.710
 sea ​​and paper plays in the corner with a 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.800
 fight of this Roman type 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.980
 as it has to pass hit combine the 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.720
 hand where the fighter hurts most 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.680
 then she like I tell you then 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.560
 the fight of manny pacquiao which a as 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.390
 I have always said and in because if 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.730
 you are hoping that if you are 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.980
 waiting for floyd mayweather has a 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.390
 hand speed and full when you look at it 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.450
 that what is hitting is no longer 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.990
 then what in pass hit and 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.910
 combining the hand in different way 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.970
 as long as you eat you can cut the 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.220
 ring to floyd and you can all everything be 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.320
 can with great intelligence always 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.050
 when one has sufficient conditions 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.420
 in the sole condition in which he commands 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.090
 after the fifth either of the two 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.430
 can go down and then I imagine that 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.230
 Manny Pacquiao has to be very 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.060
 careful because after the fifth manny 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.550
 pacquiao can lower the gas and comes 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.460
 firm webber already attacked for the fight and 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:55.540
 Then what happened was already Mayweather 1 2 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:58.480
 3 4 5 and how fast manny was 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.210
 Pacquiao is running out but he was coming 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.940
 the more it goes up more more 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.689
 combination then now what's going 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.569
 to touch 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:13.069
 Manny Pacquiao is left as stagnant 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:16.460
 and now I'm going to cartes because you 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:20.120
 finished the gas to manny pacquiao 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.800
 so there's a fight variant in the 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.210
 today 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.910
 in my opinion, everyone has the 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.220
 opinion of everyone but my opinion is 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:31.310
 that go to webber phlegm because a man 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.470
 very smart the day sends the day 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.940
 today and with all the fights he has 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.699
 had and always has sent because it is 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.349
 very smart in my opinion and manny 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.240
 pacquiao we do not know if he has the same 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:44.180
 trust 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.090
 from before they have blocked it and then 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.789
 we hope we say that we all wait in 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.660
 God that gives a good show 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:55.069
 mainly that people like 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:57.639
 the show finds boxing punch 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:57.639
 of each one
