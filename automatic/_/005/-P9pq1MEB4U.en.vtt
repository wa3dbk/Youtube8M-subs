00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.609
 the hi-fi guide of koba i hope all 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.170
 well then being in motion 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.940
 why their movement because I 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.290
 test a helmet that is in my hand is 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.509
 a highly anticipated helmet what new 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.719
 helmet bo peeled during a stage gain 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.160
 audio bo please it's the h8 I was starting 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.710
 by giving its name its price because it 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.900
 will still be a little bit 499 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.630
 euros for this helmet is a helmet that 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.359
 is the first wound bo helmet with a 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.640
 active noise reduction so a headset 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.380
 with a battery that lasts 14 hours in 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.730
 same time of course a death a usb port 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.340
 with everything that goes well with the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.219
 bluetooth with bruce pete x more 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.809
 so this is a first for bo pleasing 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.300
 so what do we pay when we 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.040
 pay 499 euros for a helmet and well 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.420
 it's very simple we pay a quality of 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.649
 making gestures a helmet is a 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.000
 true art object 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.379
 when we see a little bit how it is 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.059
 damn at the seams at the level 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.289
 of architecture level of quality 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.420
 instructions and we can say that 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.949
 really it is a very very beautiful headphones 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.199
 not happy he's so sweet 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.309
 so nice on the ears that 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.780
 ultimately when you drop your head in 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.460
 before a beautiful tends to fall because 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.019
 that it does not serve a lot it's a big 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.970
 big defect for a helmet and traveling 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.350
 everything when like me we do not have of course 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.549
 of hair to hold them in 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.560
 fatally the helmet breaks the figure 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.869
 very very quickly I listen to them and 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.820
 you have the result of my listening 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.140
 in this test bench it's a 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.030
 surprising headphones because we wait 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.100
 always bo something very 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.689
 very light very very light music 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.520
 classic and others is this one 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.720
 not at all when motivated 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.580
 I had round and a nice walkman 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.920
 behind the stela in kern 420 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.900
 against the motive well there is gravel of 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.670
 dynamic email and mediums forward 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.280
 he's going franco it's really enough 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.900
 surprising fishing case then occurs 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.079
 noise reduction works pretty well 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.759
 it's not the zik 2 0 it's not so 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.590
 well done at the level of reducing the 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.700
 noise from ambient noises my mails and 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.770
 10th nation is still really 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.509
 well since I tried it here in the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.060
 thalys because we are in thalys 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.290
 I try to plan it also it's a 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.180
 headphone is very nice but I 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.460
 personally if I like them a lot 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.659
 at the level of the mediums are when 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.149
 even very much forward and I find that the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.250
 product is expensive because 499 euros for 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.719
 a headset with noise reduction on 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.969
 pay the mark 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.619
 we pay a manufacturing but from you to 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.190
 I sincerely find helmets 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.050
 which may be cheaper 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.030
 - nice but that works just as well 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.950
 Well that's it said it's done 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.690
 have the following test in this page 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.870
 thank you very much hi fi guide Cowboys 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.680
 cowboy an echo buzz yen and thanks to the 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.940
