 I danced only putting a red tutu 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.310

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.340

 he covered it I almost died when I did not 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.130
 I listened to the air my heart was coming out 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.150
 out and see the little girl dancing that 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.240
 after 60 years 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.240

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.399
 because because yes 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.900
 but then what is good now I 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.940
 you're going to say why the time you dance to see 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.140
 how I dance already the trial with 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.140
 trials of it 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.360
 and not what moment but by chance not 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.640
 is that he said good to my grandmother danced 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.410
 the music of my grandmother who asked me 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.959
 sleeping beauty 'not this waltz of 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.300
 chance came to her by chance and 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.610
 when I showed him he was very nice 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.930
 the truth that is a pride that I believe 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.120
 that being the granddaughter and being here should be 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.650
 strong for her so obviously she 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.600
 I dedicate it to them is to be strong for you 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.820
 also that just the grandmother is 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.489
 looking there was very strong the truth that 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.500
 I will try to do it with nothing with 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.690
 much respect because it's a dance of 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.750
 many years and the truth that to do it in 5 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.930
 days cost but well let's do it 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.930
 best
