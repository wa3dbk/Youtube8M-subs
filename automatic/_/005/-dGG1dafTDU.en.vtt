regular<00:06:07.400> blue<00:06:07.879> disc<00:06:12.610> disc<00:06:13.610> my<00:06:14.120> mom<00:06:14.389> watched<00:06:14.689> it

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
regular blue disc disc my mom watched it

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.329

from<00:06:15.080> the<00:06:15.259> blu-ray<00:06:15.710> just<00:06:16.009> so<00:06:16.189> you<00:06:16.250> know

00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:16.339 
from the blu-ray just so you know

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:18.550 
from the blu-ray just so you know
because<00:06:16.759> I<00:06:16.849> think<00:06:16.909> that<00:06:17.419> because<00:06:18.289> that

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
because I think that because that

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.029 
because I think that because that
probably<00:06:18.889> has<00:06:19.339> the<00:06:20.029> better<00:06:20.270> or<00:06:20.509> quality<00:06:21.110> well

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 
probably has the better or quality well

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:23.740 
probably has the better or quality well
if<00:06:22.370> you<00:06:22.550> want<00:06:22.759> to<00:06:22.789> have<00:06:22.969> the<00:06:23.120> best<00:06:23.330> quality<00:06:23.479> you

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
if you want to have the best quality you

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.269 
if you want to have the best quality you
should<00:06:24.080> try<00:06:24.289> to<00:06:24.349> put<00:06:24.529> in<00:06:24.650> the<00:06:24.710> blu-ray<00:06:25.009> if<00:06:25.159> you

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:25.279 
should try to put in the blu-ray if you

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:27.969 
should try to put in the blu-ray if you
do<00:06:25.490> have<00:06:25.669> a<00:06:25.699> blu-ray<00:06:25.939> player<00:06:26.259> as<00:06:27.259> I<00:06:27.500> said<00:06:27.740> but

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
do have a blu-ray player as I said but

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:30.550 
do have a blu-ray player as I said but
even<00:06:28.879> so<00:06:29.150> even<00:06:29.539> if<00:06:29.629> you<00:06:29.719> don't<00:06:29.930> you'll<00:06:30.259> still

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
even so even if you don't you'll still

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.800 
even so even if you don't you'll still
you<00:06:30.740> could<00:06:30.889> still<00:06:31.099> have<00:06:31.279> the<00:06:31.400> DVD<00:06:31.849> be<00:06:32.599> with<00:06:32.719> the

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
you could still have the DVD be with the

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.559 
you could still have the DVD be with the
standard<00:06:33.289> quality<00:06:33.770> like<00:06:34.729> I<00:06:34.969> think<00:06:35.419> watching

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:35.569 
standard quality like I think watching

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:37.749 
standard quality like I think watching
