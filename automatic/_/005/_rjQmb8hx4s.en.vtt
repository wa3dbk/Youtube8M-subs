00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
and this I'm pretty sure that just works

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.450 
and this I'm pretty sure that just works
all<00:00:25.369> by<00:00:25.399> itself<00:00:26.860> it's<00:00:27.860> pretty<00:00:28.070> easy<00:00:28.279> to

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
all by itself it's pretty easy to
