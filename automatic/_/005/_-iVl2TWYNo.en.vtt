00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
do a new one and I think the problem was

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.929

that<00:00:24.810> with<00:00:25.560> my<00:00:25.710> previous<00:00:25.980> foundations<00:00:26.759> I

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
that with my previous foundations I

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.120
