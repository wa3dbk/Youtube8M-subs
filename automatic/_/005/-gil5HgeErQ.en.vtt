 m 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.490
 4 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.760

 how's it going to cost me it's going great 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.480
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.680
 any new video on my channel 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.079
 youtube so this is the second episode 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.090
 pomegranate spots on a band is strong 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.260
 so close I was in a hurry to get you out 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.460
 this video frankly it was a 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.170
 video that I was looking forward to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.460
 so we leave right away for the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.769
 first spot do you will place me on 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.870
 one and you go to the night aligned in 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.479
 your bottom cursor with the line 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.850
 which is on the soc a class tram 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.250
 basically to serve you to kill you come 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.990
 on the bennoo bomb that are in the process of 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.640
 defuse pose is a spot 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.800
 frankly super and he exhales that's who 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.140
 cavale is just beautiful frankly 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.320
 I have never entered spot yet in 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.460
 line but I expect a lot of these 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.470
 spots when I meet him I believe 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.880
 that I say but not what I like this 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.470
 spot it's really something 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.090
 beautiful you compare right now 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.509
 for the second so there you go 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.720
 pass 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.770
 you are going to put yourself in the spawn 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.020
 atlassi I do not tell you but from 6 to side 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.130
 of the big nerves duty blue containers 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.929
 there are not really the continent 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.729
 bless the dance corner there and you go 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.039
 pass your twisted or fake body 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.280
 of corsair vote as we call it already 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.470
 your bottom slider so a little near there 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.600
 in fact there is not really any method 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.119
 you would place in the first line 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.979
 tram on the left with in the middle 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.570
 there is no real method 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.460
 it's a bit random to place you at 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.560
 right middle of this small's spectrum 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.390
 line and and it goes and satellite in 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.130
 the sentinels spawn window to 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.520
 inside all take next to 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.670
 the hospital 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.689
 here is very good spot very good spot for 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.890
 dislodge the snipers that a week ago 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.289
 there from the beginning of the round it is 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.400
 frankly super helpful spot very 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.870
 recommendable I advise you 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.250
 now south door for the third 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.660
 spot so the third is really is 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.160
 well known you will put yourself to 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.810
 side of this small van the dole 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.820
 common points is and you go 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.440
 align the cursor is not playing with the 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.820
 tip of the building that you have I 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.140
 think because maybe is known 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.850
 so satellite out right in front of the 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.290
 window but there is no need to 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.060
 develop more for this spot it's 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.890
 really very well known a lot of people 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.239
 use like bottega sell all 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.160
 days I'm told in which is spawn 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.920
 here 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.330
 just a little reminder story of you 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.010
 show a little all equally in the way 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.300
 just as I have time I thank them 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.610
 community channels that blood that 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.569
 is really great fun and it's 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.160
 because they took my first 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.630
 episode but I was really super disappointed 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.069
 because I was expecting a lot 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.140
 here we are hoping we need 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.459
 for the 4th spot you will place me at 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.630
 side in the body of a double 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.220
 stopovers leaving the hospital 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.569
 next to this little blue thing there and you 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.400
 go align your bottom slider and 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.930
 your map on old bones next to this 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.569
 pylon by placing the cursor of the giro on 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.190
 highest possible of this slider this 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.230
 pylon and you'll see that it landed 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.060
 next to the garage between the garage and 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.709
 school so here I did not kill the first 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.930
 blow because I had misplaced for 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.700
 higuain who divided that you if you look 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.870
 this immersive video of toled for 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.819
 have shot this video 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.799
 this is very soft also wishes because 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.540
 than if you lay muddy mud and that 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.709
 the person is in the garage going 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.750
 necessarily go through there finally not 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.310
 necessarily but it goes very big things 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.290
 that happen that pass by there we 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.519
 see very good spots also and 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.630
 then we meet for the 5th 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.130
 spawn so there you go back to 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.810
 same place just now passing 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.580
 the bottom slider a little to the left 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.049
 and you will see that this time 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.640
 it's an ipad in the window but at 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.380
 outside so it's a bit like the 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.840
 spot of the car goes the third sound 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.940
 third spot that I showed you my 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.739
 a synth a little further so that's it 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.480
 does more damage at least guys in 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.930
 function of where the enemy finds his 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.310
 assets 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.930
 so here's the guys anyway this 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.200
