the<00:00:08.220> process<00:00:08.429> with<00:00:08.670> me<00:00:08.970> I've<00:00:09.210> just<00:00:09.450> in<00:00:10.490> getting

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
the process with me I've just in getting

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.669 
the process with me I've just in getting
this<00:00:11.639> small<00:00:12.120> clip<00:00:12.450> insert<00:00:12.840> into<00:00:13.170> my<00:00:13.440> small

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
this small clip insert into my small

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.910 
this small clip insert into my small
sebenza<00:00:14.000> so<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.929> probably<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.350> pretty<00:00:16.529> boring

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
sebenza so it's probably a pretty boring

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.640 
sebenza so it's probably a pretty boring
video<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.760> don't<00:00:18.510> know<00:00:18.660> exactly<00:00:19.020> why<00:00:19.320> I'm<00:00:19.529> doing

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
video I don't know exactly why I'm doing

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.609 
video I don't know exactly why I'm doing
it<00:00:19.890> I'm<00:00:20.220> guessing<00:00:20.960> it's<00:00:21.960> kind<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.140> short<00:00:22.350> and

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
it I'm guessing it's kind of short and

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.370 
it I'm guessing it's kind of short and
quick<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.400> guess<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.960> video<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.350> just

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
quick and I guess this video is just

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.800 
quick and I guess this video is just
partly<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.430> show<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.820> ease<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.060> sebenza

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
partly to show the ease of sebenza

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.080 
partly to show the ease of sebenza
switch<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.410> how<00:00:28.560> simplistic<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.519> designs<00:00:29.880> of

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
switch is how simplistic the designs of

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.350 
switch is how simplistic the designs of
design<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.140> yet<00:00:31.380> how<00:00:31.500> functional<00:00:31.880> so<00:00:32.880> here

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
design is but yet how functional so here

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.240 
design is but yet how functional so here
I'm<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:33.690> taking<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.250> ridiculously

little piece of titanium in strictly
aesthetic<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.730> don't<00:00:44.940> need<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.210> go<00:00:45.329> out<00:00:45.390> and

buy little inserts for your clip I'll
show<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.070> why<00:00:50.250> they<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.850> them<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.360> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
show you why they have them in just a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.720 
show you why they have them in just a
second<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.649> you're<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:52.949> using<00:00:53.190> an<00:00:53.399> Allen

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
second so you're just using an Allen

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.040 
second so you're just using an Allen
wrench<00:00:54.469> obviously<00:00:55.469> Allen<00:00:55.980> screws<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
wrench obviously Allen screws here and I

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.200 
wrench obviously Allen screws here and I
can<00:00:58.289> see<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.649> they<00:00:59.070> all<00:00:59.100> use<00:00:59.670> Allen<00:01:00.000> bits

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
can see that they all use Allen bits

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.420 
can see that they all use Allen bits
this<00:01:00.480> entire<00:01:00.809> knife<00:01:01.140> clip<00:01:01.710> included<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
there's only one screw for the clip so

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.280 
there's only one screw for the clip so
it's<00:01:05.309> extremely<00:01:05.909> easy<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.299> place<00:01:07.260> a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
it's extremely easy you just place a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.060 
it's extremely easy you just place a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
kind of its deep sunken so you know such

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.639 
kind of its deep sunken so you know such
an<00:01:46.860> expensive<00:01:47.189> knife<00:01:47.460> such<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> luxury<00:01:48.329> item

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.800 
an expensive knife such a luxury item
they<00:01:49.649> had<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.950> go<00:01:50.100> ahead<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.700> find<00:01:51.329> something

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
they had to go ahead and find something

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.020 
they had to go ahead and find something
to<00:01:52.140> fill<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.649> up<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.189> make<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.369> look<00:01:53.610> flush

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
to fill that up and make it look flush

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.630

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
and that's where the clip answer comes

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.880 
and that's where the clip answer comes
in<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.509> said<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:57.930> strictly<00:01:58.259> aesthetic

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
in like I said it's strictly aesthetic

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
pretty cool and yeah so let's do this so

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.390 
pretty cool and yeah so let's do this so
I'll<00:03:15.909> just<00:03:16.000> take<00:03:16.359> it<00:03:16.949> obviously<00:03:17.949> you<00:03:18.069> have<00:03:18.250> the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400

whole closer on one end than the other

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.869 
whole closer on one end than the other
so<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.459> makes<00:03:21.819> perfect<00:03:22.720> sense<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.229> just<00:03:23.879> slip

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
so that makes perfect sense so just slip

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.640 
so that makes perfect sense so just slip
it<00:03:25.000> right<00:03:25.030> over<00:03:25.419> and<00:03:26.400> fit<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.549> in<00:03:28.470> that's<00:03:29.470> what

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
it right over and fit it in that's what

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.349 
it right over and fit it in that's what
it's<00:03:29.769> going<00:03:29.859> to<00:03:29.919> look<00:03:29.979> like<00:03:30.129> it's<00:03:31.090> kind<00:03:31.299> of

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
it's going to look like it's kind of

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:32.969 
it's going to look like it's kind of
interesting<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.989> color<00:03:32.229> on<00:03:32.379> the<00:03:32.500> clip<00:03:32.739> is<00:03:32.769> a

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:32.979 
interesting the color on the clip is a

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.729 
interesting the color on the clip is a
lot<00:03:33.699> lighter<00:03:33.909> than<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.269> of<00:03:34.510> my<00:03:34.629> sebenza<00:03:35.019> I'm
