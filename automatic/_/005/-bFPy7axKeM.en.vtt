00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.150 
got a lot that i like I didn't I wasn't
the<00:00:50.340> best<00:00:50.610> I'm<00:00:51.000> never<00:00:51.239> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> be<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.600> best

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
the best I'm never going to be the best

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.920 
the best I'm never going to be the best
so<00:00:53.160> i<00:00:53.430> had<00:00:54.420> i<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:55.110> i<00:00:55.890> made<00:00:56.879> about<00:00:58.399> made<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> few

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
so i had i think i made about made a few

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.580 
so i had i think i made about made a few
characters<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.230> i<00:01:01.940> have<00:01:02.940> 4<00:01:04.159> 85<00:01:05.159> now<00:01:05.460> i<00:01:05.489> think

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
characters and i have 4 85 now i think

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.359 
characters and i have 4 85 now i think
almost<00:01:07.590> five<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:09.080> another<00:01:10.080> one<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.470> about<00:01:10.680> 60

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
almost five and another one is about 60

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.969 
almost five and another one is about 60
and<00:01:12.080> like<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.770> stopped

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
and like it's just because I stopped

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.899 
and like it's just because I stopped
playing<00:01:14.010> that's<00:01:14.430> why<00:01:14.640> didn't<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.530> 85

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
playing that's why didn't get it to 85

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
playing that's why didn't get it to 85
anyway<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.659> reason<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.049> made<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.350> new<00:01:19.590> one

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
anyway so the reason I made this new one

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.010 
anyway so the reason I made this new one
is<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.400> update<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.119> people<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:22.310> how<00:01:23.310> I'm<00:01:24.030> going

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
is to update you people on how I'm going

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.690 
is to update you people on how I'm going
with<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.350> like<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.920> guess<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.340> get<00:01:26.520> questions

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
with that like I guess I get questions

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.020 
with that like I guess I get questions
all<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> time<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.880> stopped<00:01:29.880> playing

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030

completely happy with it i think i think

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.530 
completely happy with it i think i think
it's<00:03:46.019> too<00:03:46.260> simple<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:47.010> mean<00:03:47.609> I<00:03:47.850> used<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.389> love

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
it's too simple I mean I used to love

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.040 
it's too simple I mean I used to love
spending<00:03:49.079> time<00:03:49.109> making<00:03:49.769> my<00:03:49.829> own<00:03:49.859> builds<00:03:50.430> and

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
spending time making my own builds and

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.110 
spending time making my own builds and
making<00:03:51.350> it<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.920> know<00:03:52.070> exactly<00:03:52.700> what<00:03:53.000> I<00:03:53.060> want

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
making it you know exactly what I want

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.300 
making it you know exactly what I want
but<00:03:53.510> now<00:03:53.660> it's<00:03:53.840> kind<00:03:54.050> of<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.890> know<00:03:54.950> you<00:03:55.100> pick

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
but now it's kind of you know you pick

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.150 
but now it's kind of you know you pick
one<00:03:55.580> thing<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.270> you<00:03:56.330> have<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:57.050> wait<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:57.980> many

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
one thing and you have to wait so many

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.220 
one thing and you have to wait so many
levels<00:03:58.400> before<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:59.030> pick<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.570> next<00:03:59.720> thing<00:04:00.020> I

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
levels before you pick the next thing I

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
levels before you pick the next thing I
mean<00:04:00.710> is<00:04:00.830> it<00:04:01.070> it's<00:04:01.970> just<00:04:02.300> the<00:04:03.170> change<00:04:03.530> is<00:04:03.890> a

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
mean is it it's just the change is a

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.030 
mean is it it's just the change is a
little<00:04:04.850> too<00:04:05.180> much<00:04:05.450> like<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:06.770> shouldn't

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
little too much like you shouldn't

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.660 
little too much like you shouldn't
simplify<00:04:07.670> things<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:09.190> you<00:04:10.190> kind<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.490> think

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
simplify things and you kind of think

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.980 
simplify things and you kind of think
when<00:04:10.910> you<00:04:11.030> make<00:04:11.180> something<00:04:11.210> new<00:04:11.630> you<00:04:11.750> want<00:04:11.870> it

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
when you make something new you want it

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.490 
when you make something new you want it
to<00:04:12.110> be<00:04:12.140> kind<00:04:12.470> of<00:04:12.590> harder<00:04:13.660> not<00:04:14.660> simpler<00:04:15.200> you

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
to be kind of harder not simpler you

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.680 
to be kind of harder not simpler you
know<00:04:15.650> because<00:04:16.519> you<00:04:17.269> know<00:04:17.390> you're<00:04:17.510> going<00:04:17.600> to

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
know because you know you're going to

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.500 
know because you know you're going to
get<00:04:17.780> these<00:04:17.959> these<00:04:18.560> noobs<00:04:18.980> that<00:04:19.250> just<00:04:19.459> come<00:04:20.420> on

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
get these these noobs that just come on

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.000 
get these these noobs that just come on
the<00:04:20.600> game<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:21.019> I'll<00:04:21.380> just<00:04:21.590> click<00:04:21.769> whatever

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
the game and I'll just click whatever

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.800 
the game and I'll just click whatever
one<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:22.460> then<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:22.880> then<00:04:23.150> it's<00:04:23.270> all<00:04:23.390> about<00:04:23.570> the

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
one and then and then it's all about the

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.230 
one and then and then it's all about the
gameplay<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:24.530> it<00:04:24.680> should<00:04:24.710> be<00:04:25.100> you<00:04:26.090> know

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
gameplay and that it should be you know

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.040 
gameplay and that it should be you know
but<00:04:26.630> just<00:04:28.060> doesn't<00:04:29.060> seem<00:04:29.240> like<00:04:29.270> my<00:04:29.660> cup<00:04:29.870> of<00:04:29.900> tea

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
but just doesn't seem like my cup of tea

but just doesn't seem like my cup of tea
I'm<00:04:30.500> not<00:04:30.800> very<00:04:31.010> excited<00:04:31.610> for<00:04:31.880> it<00:04:32.000> to<00:04:32.270> be<00:04:32.390> on

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.480 
I'm not very excited for it to be on
that<00:04:32.540> side<00:04:32.810> I<00:04:33.200> probably<00:04:33.740> won't<00:04:34.010> go<00:04:34.160> out<00:04:34.190> and
