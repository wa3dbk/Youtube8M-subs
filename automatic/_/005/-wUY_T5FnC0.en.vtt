show<00:02:03.899> performance<00:02:05.329> tractor<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.450> definitely

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
show performance tractor is definitely

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.240 
show performance tractor is definitely
something<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.229> should<00:02:07.350> look<00:02:07.710> into<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
something you should look into it

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.889 
something you should look into it
only<00:02:08.520> reason<00:02:08.849> because<00:02:09.149> they<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.750> many

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
only reason because they have so many

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.649 
only reason because they have so many
features<00:02:10.340> remix<00:02:11.340> decks

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659

features remix decks
sample<00:02:13.530> decks<00:02:14.599> so<00:02:15.599> many<00:02:15.900> effects<00:02:16.579> the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
timecode capability on that is tight if

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.300 
timecode capability on that is tight if
you're<00:02:20.400> using<00:02:21.379> time<00:02:22.379> code<00:02:22.620> vinyl<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:23.159> know

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
you're using time code vinyl I know

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.940 
you're using time code vinyl I know
their<00:02:23.909> time<00:02:24.269> code<00:02:24.510> vinyl<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:25.319> double<00:02:25.829> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
their time code vinyl is double the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.449 
their time code vinyl is double the
resolution<00:02:27.200> as<00:02:28.200> sirata<00:02:28.650> model<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.159> you<00:02:29.219> get<00:02:29.430> a

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
resolution as sirata model so you get a

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.690 
resolution as sirata model so you get a
tighter<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.599> closest<00:02:31.049> thing<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.099> real

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
tighter it's the closest thing to real

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.429 
tighter it's the closest thing to real
binary<00:02:32.969> can<00:02:33.329> get<00:02:33.540> as<00:02:33.689> far<00:02:33.870> as<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.079> timecode

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
binary can get as far as a timecode

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.209 
binary can get as far as a timecode
solution<00:02:34.980> now<00:02:35.909> if<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.870> know<00:02:36.989> Virtual<00:02:37.319> DJ<00:02:37.469> it's

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
solution now if you know Virtual DJ it's

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.099 
solution now if you know Virtual DJ it's
out<00:02:38.519> there<00:02:38.849> I<00:02:38.879> know<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:39.389> can<00:02:39.599> use<00:02:39.719> a<00:02:39.750> bunch<00:02:39.989> of

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
out there I know you can use a bunch of

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.409 
out there I know you can use a bunch of
sound<00:02:40.349> cards<00:02:40.709> with<00:02:40.919> it<00:02:40.950> make<00:02:41.939> a<00:02:41.969> do<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.209> video

just<00:03:19.379> makes<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.680> difficult

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
just makes it difficult

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.759 
just makes it difficult
um<00:03:20.669> and<00:03:20.939> then<00:03:21.239> DJs<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.319> other<00:03:22.439> promoters

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
because it's going to be hard you know

because it's going to be hard you know
every<00:03:28.319> DJ<00:03:28.470> booth<00:03:28.829> is<00:03:28.979> not<00:03:29.159> big<00:03:30.109> some<00:03:31.109> places

every DJ booth is not big some places
don't<00:03:31.530> have<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.799> DJ<00:03:32.069> booth<00:03:32.250> so<00:03:32.819> there<00:03:33.060> every

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
don't have a DJ booth so there every

don't have a DJ booth so there every
table<00:03:34.079> is<00:03:34.169> not<00:03:34.259> big<00:03:34.500> it's<00:03:34.739> like<00:03:34.889> the<00:03:35.009> 6<00:03:35.220> foot

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340

something to be Cerato only because it

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.939 
something to be Cerato only because it
you<00:03:48.959> know<00:03:50.090> it's<00:03:51.090> just<00:03:51.299> easier<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:52.049> plug<00:03:52.769> into

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949

like when you first look at it it could

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.509 
like when you first look at it it could
be<00:04:11.459> it's<00:04:11.939> very<00:04:12.060> complex<00:04:12.889> extremely<00:04:13.889> complex

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519

that's<00:05:31.539> mostly<00:05:31.960> for<00:05:32.050> tractor<00:05:32.620> I<00:05:32.860> can't

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
that's mostly for tractor I can't

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
Serato mapping forward so if I could

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.200 
Serato mapping forward so if I could
recommend<00:05:39.639> a<00:05:39.940> controller<00:05:40.449> I<00:05:41.280> say<00:05:42.280> I<00:05:42.580> recommend

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210
