00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
it abducts the cow you basically gets

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.370 
it abducts the cow you basically gets
great<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:01.630> while<00:03:02.630> you're<00:03:02.810> going<00:03:02.959> through<00:03:03.080> the

great so while you're going through the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.800 
great so while you're going through the
game<00:03:03.800> you'll<00:03:04.340> notice<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:05.000> these<00:03:05.240> sections

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
game you'll notice that these sections

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.160 
game you'll notice that these sections
kind<00:03:06.380> of<00:03:06.590> repeat<00:03:07.340> themselves<00:03:08.270> and<00:03:08.480> become<00:03:08.750> bit

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
kind of repeat themselves and become bit

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.880 
kind of repeat themselves and become bit
tedious<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.280> repetitive<00:03:10.900> for<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:12.260> game<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.740> its

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
tedious and repetitive for a game of its

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.350 
tedious and repetitive for a game of its
age<00:03:13.720> basically<00:03:14.920> there<00:03:15.920> are<00:03:16.280> sections<00:03:16.970> very

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
age basically there are sections very

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.140 
age basically there are sections very

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
look for the shooting part of this I

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.320 
look for the shooting part of this I
don't<00:03:59.720> know<00:03:59.930> it's<00:04:00.290> when<00:04:01.070> Jim's<00:04:01.400> riding<00:04:01.970> on<00:04:02.120> his

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.370 
don't know it's when Jim's riding on his
rocket<00:04:02.810> and<00:04:03.850> it's<00:04:04.850> just<00:04:05.390> really<00:04:05.840> hard<00:04:06.170> to

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
rocket and it's just really hard to

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.290 
rocket and it's just really hard to
explain<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.860> camera<00:04:07.310> view<00:04:07.489> they<00:04:07.940> went<00:04:08.180> with

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.270 
explain the camera view they went with
something<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.750> lot<00:04:08.900> different<00:04:09.530> than<00:04:09.590> what<00:04:10.100> they

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
something a lot different than what they

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.910 
something a lot different than what they
did<00:04:10.459> in<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:10.670> beginning<00:04:10.790> now<00:04:11.690> for<00:04:12.320> a<00:04:12.530> number

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
did in the beginning now for a number

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.070 
did in the beginning now for a number
two<00:04:13.160> these<00:04:13.519> guys<00:04:13.730> were<00:04:13.970> adventurous<00:04:14.660> and<00:04:14.870> they

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
two these guys were adventurous and they

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.740 
two these guys were adventurous and they
did<00:04:15.320> change<00:04:15.680> up<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.160> lot<00:04:16.519> of<00:04:16.549> things<00:04:17.209> for<00:04:17.540> this

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
did change up a lot of things for this

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.190 
did change up a lot of things for this
which<00:04:18.290> is<00:04:18.320> really<00:04:18.470> really<00:04:19.070> nice<00:04:19.310> but<00:04:20.299> some<00:04:21.049> of

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
which is really really nice but some of

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.080 
which is really really nice but some of
the<00:04:21.290> things<00:04:21.590> are<00:04:21.919> a<00:04:21.950> bit<00:04:22.580> stale<00:04:22.910> and

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
the things are a bit stale and

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.610 
the things are a bit stale and
repetitive<00:04:23.150> like<00:04:23.780> carrying<00:04:24.229> around<00:04:24.290> the

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
repetitive like carrying around the

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.290 
repetitive like carrying around the
things<00:04:24.919> to<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.610> end<00:04:25.760> of<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:25.970> level

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
things to the end of the level

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.440 
things to the end of the level
that's<00:04:26.720> definitely<00:04:27.430> what<00:04:28.430> really<00:04:28.940> got

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
that's definitely what really got

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.420 
that's definitely what really got
annoying<00:04:30.050> too

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
annoying too

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.120 
annoying too
me<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:31.150> game<00:04:31.390> ends<00:04:31.930> with<00:04:32.110> Jim<00:04:32.470> saving<00:04:33.010> the

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
me the game ends with Jim saving the

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.220 
me the game ends with Jim saving the
princess<00:04:33.430> but<00:04:34.330> all<00:04:34.540> three<00:04:34.900> of<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.050> characters

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
princess but all three of the characters

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.250 
princess but all three of the characters
eventually<00:04:36.190> turning<00:04:36.580> into<00:04:36.730> random<00:04:37.240> cows

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
eventually turning into random cows

that<00:06:08.620> were<00:06:08.860> my<00:06:09.340> new<00:06:09.640> so<00:06:10.830> overall<00:06:11.830> if<00:06:12.340> you're

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
that were my new so overall if you're

that were my new so overall if you're
interested<00:06:13.360> in<00:06:13.390> getting<00:06:13.600> this<00:06:13.930> you<00:06:14.260> can

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
interested in getting this you can

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.080 
interested in getting this you can
probably<00:06:14.650> find<00:06:14.920> it<00:06:15.100> on<00:06:15.250> the<00:06:15.370> Virtual<00:06:15.700> Console

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
probably find it on the Virtual Console

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.690 
probably find it on the Virtual Console
for<00:06:16.150> a<00:06:16.360> fairly<00:06:16.780> cheap<00:06:16.960> and<00:06:17.230> of<00:06:17.920> course<00:06:18.160> if<00:06:18.490> you

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
for a fairly cheap and of course if you

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.190 
for a fairly cheap and of course if you
have<00:06:18.970> to<00:06:19.150> have<00:06:19.270> a<00:06:19.300> Game<00:06:19.540> Boy<00:06:19.570> Advance<00:06:19.990> you

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
have to have a Game Boy Advance you

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.950 
have to have a Game Boy Advance you
probably<00:06:20.560> find<00:06:20.710> the<00:06:20.830> port<00:06:21.070> for<00:06:21.310> 2002<00:06:21.940> but<00:06:22.630> do

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
probably find the port for 2002 but do

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.870 
probably find the port for 2002 but do
remember<00:06:22.990> Game<00:06:23.740> Boy<00:06:23.920> Advance<00:06:24.250> is<00:06:24.490> scaled<00:06:24.760> down

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
remember Game Boy Advance is scaled down

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.690 
remember Game Boy Advance is scaled down
so<00:06:25.330> it<00:06:25.450> probably<00:06:25.720> has<00:06:26.200> not<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:27.010> best<00:06:27.220> graphics

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
so it probably has not the best graphics

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.960 
so it probably has not the best graphics
bad<00:06:28.180> sound<00:06:28.900> and<00:06:29.170> audio<00:06:29.320> and<00:06:29.830> perhaps<00:06:30.370> let<00:06:30.850> you

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
bad sound and audio and perhaps let you

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.190 
bad sound and audio and perhaps let you
gameplay<00:06:31.150> too<00:06:31.600> so<00:06:32.880> if<00:06:33.880> you're<00:06:34.600> in<00:06:34.930> the<00:06:35.080> mood

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
gameplay too so if you're in the mood

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.430

changing in the graphics in the end it

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.010 
changing in the graphics in the end it
is<00:06:59.740> very<00:07:00.490> similar<00:07:00.820> to<00:07:01.000> the<00:07:01.210> first<00:07:01.450> one<00:07:01.540> so<00:07:01.900> if
