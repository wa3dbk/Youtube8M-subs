00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.059
 you collaborate awakening in a new video of 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.360
 this channel this time we have the 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.160
 full review of sony xperia 4 un 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.310
 low-end sony device though 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.220
 the price is not so low wins out there from 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.609
 the 2,500 to 3,000 pesos so we're going to 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.949
 analyze how good it is in quality of 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.089
 camera performance and more things like that 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.400
 let's start talking about your 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.400
 physical appearance by the top 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.590
 opposite we have a small led that almost 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.800
 it is not visible to the naked eye next to us 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.360
 the front camera that is 2 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.760
 megapixels and we'll see later 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.650
 how does it work then we have there the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.900
 Brand logo and headset for 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.320
 the calls we have a screen 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.510
 of 5 inches with qhd resolution but 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.200
 with lowercase so it's a resolution 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.470
 not so high is 540 x 960 pixels like this 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.290
 that is not so high has also the 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.110
 integrated buttons to the screen so 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.490
 you will not have so much space in the 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.470
 screen is going to steal a little bit of 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.420
 space to that virtual pushbutton but in 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.310
 some games are already hidden these 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.990
 buttons although not at all 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.390
 down we're going to simply have the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.610
 microphone for calls although the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.229
 same way you have the headset for 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.210
 have a slightly more symmetrical design 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.649
 although also the frame below is a 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.360
 slightly larger than the above if we 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.369
 let's go to the right part from your 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.159
 profile can be seen as the frame 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.049
 plastic does not cover the screen 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.179
 crystal in a certain way the crystal 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.250
 excels in the design so I do not think 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.350
 that is too resistant if it falls 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.270
 let's find on the right side the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.130
 typical on / off button of 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.229
 sonic that looks very nice with the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.479
 volume keypad below the side 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.270
 only the port is going to be 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.189
 microusb to load and therefore in 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.530
 the bottom part will not be anything and 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.110
 at the top only the jack 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.000
 to connect the headphones the lid if 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.490
 it can be taken out and actually taken out of a 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.860
 way as easy because I tell you that from 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.810
 by itself it is already on exit the 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.810
 part of the screen so just 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.180
 you have to push the lid back and you 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.040
 takes out but the battery can not be removed 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.980
 just to introduce you 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.920
 microsim card or your microsd card 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.180
 so there it is, it's backwards and 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.519
 in this part of the back 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.500
 let's find the camera that is 5 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.909
 megapixels accompanied by its led flash 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.340
 that we will see later how 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.890
 works under the brand logo 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.620
 sony and down will be the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.569
 brand logo xperia and speaker 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.950
 located in the back we're going to 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.319
 focus a little more on the aspect 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.299
 of the screen the speaker the screen 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.370
 it has good quality maybe it does not have the 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.109
 better viewing angles but if they are 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.000
 good I've seen other screens that 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:49.310
 you just turn it around a bit and it does not 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.260
 see almost nothing this is not the case it's a 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.510
 good screen and the speaker has 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.000
 also a good breadth of 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.909
 frequencies a better range better said and 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.040
 has for example a good support for 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.220
 the bass and also for the treble as well 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.150
 that has a whole range of frequencies 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.310
 quite high with which you will be able to 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.650
 listen to good quality music but 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.139
 the volume is not that loud so you hear 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.090
 very good but you do not hear so so so 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.000
 strong so we 're just going to see 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.400
 a little test so you can see more or 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.260
 less as you hear but it is not the same 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.419
 because now it goes through the microphone and not 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.569
 you hear it live so let's see the 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.569
 test 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.090
 It's now turnaround to talk about 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.590
 the 2 megapixel cameras the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.079
 front let's start talking about 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.719
 she the truth is not very good when 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.549
 you have enough light come out well 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.290
 photos of the front camera and if we 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.420
 we went to talk about the back is the 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.519
 same case in automatic mode despite 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.409
 that is a 5 megapixel camera in the 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.239
 automatic mode of taking three and so 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.819
 so much already when you try to zoom in 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.950
 a photograph does not look very good so 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.269
 does not stand out in the appearance of the cameras 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.609
 the truth is that they are very cameras 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.829
 simple very basic when there is little 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.109
 light the back camera suffers too much 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.120
 because he can not make good approaches 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.389
 and the flash does not help too much 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.919
 too much to the photo so the camera in 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.990
 general terms is not very good at 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.870
 Although the software brings several 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.539
 photography modes including one for 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.220
 facial retouching focused on women 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.560
 to make them even 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.720
 simply with the pure software of the 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.570
 camera so it's something that could attract 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.880
 to the female audience to this camera but 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.979
 it's not very good quality so no 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.169
 highlights in this section we are going to talk 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.400
 now of the software where it brings some 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.560
 things 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.020
 incorporated into your device as per 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.150
 example the mini applications that you can 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.620
 open in small windows are 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.960
 only a few like the 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.970
 timer or a small web browser 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.220
 so they are not any application 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.770
 simply some useful applications 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.990
 you can open them in small windows and 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.330
 another thing that is pretty good is the 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.280
 stamina way that we already know they are and 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.680
 use it to save battery in your 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.759
 devices and in this case it comes with a 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.710
 ultra stamina mode that is like a 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:27.620
 similar with the ultra energy saving 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.720
 of the recent galaxy where it changes 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.220
 the wallpaper to black and white you 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.169
 let's just use a few 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.970
 applications but unlike the 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.590
 galaxy this does not let you add more 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.810
 applications so now that we're 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.699
 talking about this software and the 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.370
 battery above all let's talk a 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.870
 little bit how long the battery lasts and you 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.780
 I'm going to say more or less right now how much 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:51.199
 I have and how many hours of screen is what 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.490
 that the data that stands out the most because 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.580
 example right now I'm going to put you to use 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.520
 I have 63% battery and I used the 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.969
 screen for two hours already so like 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.699
 you see 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:04.189
 quite the battery 63 percent and two 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:06.349
 hours for you to give yourself an idea starting 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:08.119
 four hours of screen when and 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.979
 you have 10 percent battery is a 

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:11.419
 good duration so in this case 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.299
 we have two hours and it has been spent 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.129
 about 40% of battery and 

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:18.259
 that if we continue with this use that 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:20.869
 We have honestly given a little moderate 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:23.839
 we estimate that four hours of screen 

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:25.519
 still have about 20 or 15 per 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:27.589
 hundred so it lasts for 

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:29.599
 pretty remarkable battery in this 

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:31.039
 aspect if it stands out and we are going now to enter 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.049
 to talk about performance because there 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:35.509
 it also stands out quite obviously 

00:06:33.049 --> 00:06:37.189
 about your good brand competition and 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:39.439
 that in the low ranges do not usually put 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:42.589
 too much power and in this case it comes 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:45.589
 a 4-core mediatek processor 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:47.329
 1.3 giga hertz and with 8 gigabytes of 

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:49.879
 internal memory and 1 gb of ram 

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:51.860
 they make the device can go 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:53.419
 running well he also has kitkat 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.269
 forget to say it in the section of 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:58.819
 software so it runs well the games 

00:06:56.269 --> 00:07:00.169
 opens them well does not load very fast 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.849
 open the games but since you're 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.739
 inside you will not notice that you are 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:05.350
 working at all times that the audio is 

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:07.420
 cut to be cut 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.760
 nothing of that but what you will not be able to 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.400
 to do is to open for example two games at 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.440
 same time or be playing and leaving 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.840
 answer a message and return to the game 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.240
 as if the game is closed when 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.730
 you leave him so do not expect to have 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.920
 such as management optimized ramp 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.140
 performance I liked that you are not 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.380
 working so for a basic use and 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.880
 basic medium reaches enough so 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.620
 Now you know a little bit better 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.080
 xperia in 4 I hope you liked it 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:38.070
 this video remembers subscribing to the channel 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.070
 and see you next
