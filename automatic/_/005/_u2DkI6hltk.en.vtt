00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.460 

we're<00:00:12.509> gonna<00:00:12.599> go<00:00:12.780> ahead<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:12.960> start<00:00:15.470> filling

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
we're gonna go ahead and start filling

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.510 
we're gonna go ahead and start filling
up<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.920> brass<00:00:17.640> tube<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.750> sand<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
up the brass tube with sand and the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.670 
up the brass tube with sand and the
easiest<00:00:20.820> way<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.000> think<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.449> fill<00:00:22.289> up<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.500> tube

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
easiest way I think to fill up the tube

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.029 
easiest way I think to fill up the tube
is<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.039> take<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> little<00:00:23.400> piece<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.699> clay<00:00:24.119> and

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
is to take a little piece of clay and

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.999 
is to take a little piece of clay and
just<00:00:26.930> plug<00:00:27.930> off<00:00:28.140> one<00:00:28.439> end<00:00:30.410> so<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.740> sand

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
just plug off one end so that the sand

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.540 
just plug off one end so that the sand
doesn't<00:00:32.279> come<00:00:32.430> out<00:00:33.829> just<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.950> make<00:00:34.980> our<00:00:35.280> lives

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
doesn't come out just to make our lives

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.690 
doesn't come out just to make our lives
a<00:00:35.700> little<00:00:35.850> easier<00:00:36.920> and<00:00:37.920> then<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.980> fun<00:00:41.219> part<00:00:41.250> we

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
a little easier and then the fun part we

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.279 
a little easier and then the fun part we
just<00:00:41.730> take<00:00:42.059> some<00:00:42.090> sand<00:00:44.840> this<00:00:45.840> takes<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> little

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
just take some sand this takes a little

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.510 
just take some sand this takes a little
bit<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.530> time<00:00:48.230> definitely<00:00:49.230> worth<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.620> when

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
bit of time definitely worth it when

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.080 
bit of time definitely worth it when
this<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.640> finished<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.300> will<00:00:51.680> come<00:00:52.680> back<00:00:53.090> for
