00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.420 
course if there's one thing that you
should<00:05:02.260> learn<00:05:02.620> it's<00:05:02.889> never<00:05:03.160> free<00:05:03.430> dive<00:05:03.610> alone

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430

should learn it's never free dive alone
okay<00:05:06.430> so<00:05:06.490> that<00:05:06.760> was<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:06.940> seven<00:05:07.930> things<00:05:08.139> never

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
okay so that was it seven things never

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.000 
okay so that was it seven things never
to<00:05:08.650> do<00:05:08.830> that<00:05:09.460> free<00:05:09.669> divers<00:05:10.000> never<00:05:10.210> do<00:05:10.479> I<00:05:11.470> hope

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010
