how did octopuses get so intertwined
with<00:01:50.280> steampunk<00:01:50.850> well<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.420> think<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.110> thank

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
with steampunk well I think we can thank

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.600 
with steampunk well I think we can thank
Jules<00:01:52.649> Verne<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:53.220> that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
Jules Verne for that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.179 
Jules Verne for that
I<00:01:53.640> think<00:01:54.360> definitely<00:01:54.840> 20,000<00:01:55.799> Leagues<00:01:55.979> Under

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
I think definitely 20,000 Leagues Under

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.330 
I think definitely 20,000 Leagues Under
the<00:01:56.369> Sea<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> giant<00:01:58.350> squid<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.740> attacks

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the Sea and the giant squid that attacks

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.730 
the Sea and the giant squid that attacks
a<00:01:59.490> submarine<00:02:00.000> certainly<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.229> sort<00:02:01.590> of

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
a submarine certainly that sort of

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.920 
a submarine certainly that sort of
imagery<00:02:02.189> helps<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.909> fits<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.719> time

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
imagery helps and fits in the time

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.459 
imagery helps and fits in the time
period<00:02:04.200> there's<00:02:04.920> also<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.850> work<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.180> like

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
period there's also the work of like

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.889 
period there's also the work of like
Lovecraft<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.250> Kaku<00:02:08.629> mythology<00:02:09.629> that

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
Lovecraft and the Kaku mythology that

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.370 
Lovecraft and the Kaku mythology that
that<00:02:10.500> really<00:02:10.920> kind<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.250> feeds<00:02:11.520> into<00:02:11.819> that

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
that really kind of feeds into that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.730 
that really kind of feeds into that
so<00:02:12.500> there's<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.370> little<00:02:13.810> little<00:02:14.810> literary

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
so there's a little little literary

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.160 
so there's a little little literary
references<00:02:16.520> but<00:02:17.090> also<00:02:17.240> at<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.600> time<00:02:17.840> if<00:02:18.050> you

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
references but also at the time if you

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.840 
references but also at the time if you
think<00:02:18.200> about<00:02:18.440> Victorian<00:02:19.040> England

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
think about Victorian England

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.090 
think about Victorian England
octopuses<00:02:20.750> were<00:02:21.020> still<00:02:21.320> kind<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.710> questioning

in that we're not just drawing the
individual<00:02:53.480> panels<00:02:53.930> we<00:02:54.620> are<00:02:54.800> actually

individual panels we are actually

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.070 
individual panels we are actually
helping<00:02:55.550> craft<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.060> story<00:02:56.090> helping<00:02:56.840> create

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
the characters writing the script in

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.800 
the characters writing the script in
some<00:02:59.960> cases<00:03:00.200> as<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:01.250> did<00:03:01.610> help<00:03:02.210> to<00:03:02.240> a<00:03:02.390> story<00:03:02.690> on

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
some cases as I did help to a story on

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.130 
some cases as I did help to a story on
Winnie<00:03:02.990> the<00:03:03.050> Pooh<00:03:03.490> and<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.540> think<00:03:05.780> that's

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
Winnie the Pooh and so I think that's

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.230 
Winnie the Pooh and so I think that's
the<00:03:06.290> difference<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.830> some<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.240> storyboard

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
the difference to some of the storyboard

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.970 
the difference to some of the storyboard
that<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:08.810> see<00:03:09.050> coming<00:03:09.500> out<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.740> live-action
