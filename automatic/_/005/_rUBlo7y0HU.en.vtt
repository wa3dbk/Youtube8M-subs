doing has been so talked about

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.870 
doing has been so talked about
so<00:01:27.540> let's<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.930> over<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:29.610> obviously<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.150> runs

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.550
