00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.199 
color on it and I said think the inside
open<00:06:41.839> spacing<00:06:42.469> is<00:06:42.620> a<00:06:42.740> very<00:06:42.949> good<00:06:43.069> idea<00:06:43.339> as<00:06:43.849> well

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:44.209 
open spacing is a very good idea as well

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:47.290 
open spacing is a very good idea as well
and<00:06:45.050> I<00:06:45.259> think<00:06:45.529> if<00:06:45.709> all<00:06:46.009> this<00:06:46.279> can<00:06:46.550> be<00:06:46.580> combined

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
and I think if all this can be combined

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.449 
and I think if all this can be combined
into<00:06:47.539> a<00:06:47.680> cost-effective<00:06:48.680> I<00:06:48.860> will<00:06:49.099> be<00:06:49.249> very

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:49.459 
into a cost-effective I will be very

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:50.790 
into a cost-effective I will be very
