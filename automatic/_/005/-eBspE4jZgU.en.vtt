still around the kinks in those plays
the<00:00:59.460> developers<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.510> NC<00:01:00.719> double-a<00:01:00.989> 11<00:01:01.460> seem

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the developers for NC double-a 11 seem

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.070 
the developers for NC double-a 11 seem
to<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.670> messed<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.329> who's<00:01:03.629> covering<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
to have messed up on who's covering the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.450 
to have messed up on who's covering the

quarterback nice cover on the pitch man

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.410 
quarterback nice cover on the pitch man
it's<00:01:06.360> very<00:01:06.479> unrealistic<00:01:07.110> because<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
it's very unrealistic because the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.789 
it's very unrealistic because the
linebacker<00:01:09.420> shouldn't<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.930> covering<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
linebacker shouldn't be covering the

linebacker shouldn't be covering the
pitch<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.610> not<00:01:12.000> done<00:01:12.590> but<00:01:13.590> I'm<00:01:14.280> gonna

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
pitch it's just not done but I'm gonna

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.090 
pitch it's just not done but I'm gonna
try<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.700> get<00:01:14.909> those<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.330> soon<00:01:16.170> after<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.979> know

try to get those up soon after you know
I<00:01:17.130> got<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> lot<00:01:17.460> more<00:01:17.490> experimentation<00:01:18.119> but

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
I got a lot more experimentation but

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.120 
I got a lot more experimentation but
none<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.110> all<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.470> stuff<00:01:19.680> let's<00:01:19.860> get<00:01:20.040> on

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
none of all this stuff let's get on

the flexbone triple option the formation

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.560 
the flexbone triple option the formation
you<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.470> right<00:01:25.680> here<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.220> flex<00:01:26.880> phone<00:01:27.090> normal

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
you see right here is flex phone normal

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.480 
you see right here is flex phone normal
it's<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:28.020> balanced<00:01:28.409> formation<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.070> has<00:01:29.220> two

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it's a balanced formation it has two

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.780 
it's a balanced formation it has two
wing<00:01:29.729> backs<00:01:30.000> one<00:01:30.780> fullback<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> two<00:01:32.040> wide

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
receivers split out wide it's a balanced

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.190 
receivers split out wide it's a balanced
formation<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.479> said<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.020> my<00:01:37.170> earlier

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
formation like I said in my earlier

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.080 
formation like I said in my earlier
videos<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.430> kind<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.640> formation<00:01:38.880> I

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
videos this is the kind of formation I

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.179 
videos this is the kind of formation I
like<00:01:39.299> because<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.200> easily<00:01:40.710> flip<00:01:40.979> it

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
like because you can easily flip it

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.280 
like because you can easily flip it
either<00:01:41.790> direction<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.630> that's<00:01:43.020> especially

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
either direction and that's especially

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.649 
either direction and that's especially
dangerous<00:01:43.950> with<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> Flex<00:01:44.400> bone<00:01:44.640> because<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
dangerous with the Flex bone because it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.270 
dangerous with the Flex bone because it
gives<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.229> gives<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.530> user<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.860> lot<00:01:47.070> more

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
gives you it gives the user a lot more

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.219 
gives you it gives the user a lot more
options<00:01:47.430> where<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.060> take<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> football<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
options where to take the football and

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.780 
options where to take the football and
