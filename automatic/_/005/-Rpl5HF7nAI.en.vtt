pedals are these are nice small single
stompbox<00:00:29.789> style<00:00:30.180> pedals<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:31.349> makes<00:00:31.529> these

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
stompbox style pedals what makes these

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.439 
stompbox style pedals what makes these
very<00:00:31.980> unique<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.580> can<00:00:32.790> actually<00:00:32.940> use<00:00:33.150> up

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
very unique is you can actually use up

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.350 
very unique is you can actually use up
to<00:00:33.600> six<00:00:33.629> effects<00:00:34.559> simultaneously<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.149> can

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
to six effects simultaneously so you can

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.690 
to six effects simultaneously so you can
have<00:00:36.510> multiple<00:00:36.770> distortions<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.920> bottles

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700

pedal<00:00:53.070> unlike<00:00:53.460> some<00:00:53.700> others<00:00:53.969> where<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.719> would

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
pedal unlike some others where you would

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.600 
pedal unlike some others where you would
have<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> preset<00:00:55.559> patch<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.190> patches

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
have a preset patch and the patches

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.939 
have a preset patch and the patches
these<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.120> or<00:00:57.570> off<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.559> complete

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
these are on or off you have complete

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.130 
these are on or off you have complete
usability<00:00:59.610> of<00:00:59.640> all<00:01:00.000> six<00:01:00.329> effects<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.989> you

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
usability of all six effects that you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.229 
usability of all six effects that you
will<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.350> using<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:02.340> each<00:01:02.550> patch<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.090> you

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
will be using with each patch that you

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.060 
will be using with each patch that you
have<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.050> way<00:01:04.199> individually<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.039> can

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
have so that way individually you can

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.490 
have so that way individually you can
turn<00:01:05.309> them<00:01:05.520> on<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.729> off<00:01:06.110> with<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> great

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
turn them on and off with a great

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.230 
turn them on and off with a great
function<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.340> having<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.850> much<00:01:09.000> is

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
function of that and having so much is

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.179 
function of that and having so much is
that<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.869> your<00:01:09.900> back<00:01:10.260> end<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.890> could<00:01:11.070> do

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
that on your back end what you could do

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.850 
that on your back end what you could do
is<00:01:11.369> have<00:01:11.549> your<00:01:11.700> EQ<00:01:12.570> your<00:01:12.900> compression<00:01:13.590> your

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
is have your EQ your compression your

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.130 
is have your EQ your compression your
noise<00:01:14.070> reduction<00:01:14.460> set<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.450> then<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
noise reduction set up and then for the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.300 
noise reduction set up and then for the
patch<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.590> you're<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> see<00:01:17.130> up<00:01:17.280> front

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
patch that you're going to see up front

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.460 
patch that you're going to see up front
you<00:01:17.970> could<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> distortion<00:01:19.259> or<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you could have it as a distortion or a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.289 
you could have it as a distortion or a
delay<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.400> want<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.700> able<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.150> turn

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
delay that you want to be able to turn

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.230 
delay that you want to be able to turn
on<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.750> off<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> MS<00:01:23.280> 50g<00:01:23.939> for

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
on and off so this is the MS 50g for

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.859 
on and off so this is the MS 50g for
guitar<00:01:24.570> over<00:01:25.350> here<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.950> ms<00:01:26.250> 70<00:01:26.939> CDR

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
guitar over here we have the ms 70 CDR

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.200 
guitar over here we have the ms 70 CDR
so<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.740> strictly<00:01:29.040> chorus<00:01:29.670> delay<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
so this is strictly chorus delay and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.090 
so this is strictly chorus delay and
reverb<00:01:30.390> now<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.409> you're<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> get

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
reverb now with that you're going to get

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.420 
reverb now with that you're going to get
a<00:01:32.369> lot<00:01:32.700> more<00:01:33.170> corliss<00:01:34.170> delay<00:01:34.680> reverb<00:01:34.920> effects

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
a lot more corliss delay reverb effects

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.249 
a lot more corliss delay reverb effects
there's<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:35.939> 50<00:01:36.329> effects<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.869> total

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
there's going to be 50 effects in total

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.719 
there's going to be 50 effects in total
but<00:01:37.710> they're<00:01:37.890> offering<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> lot<00:01:38.579> more

but they're offering you a lot more

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.120 
but they're offering you a lot more
parameters<00:01:39.270> within<00:01:39.659> those<00:01:39.900> effects<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.950> is

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
parameters within those effects this is

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.760 
parameters within those effects this is
a<00:01:41.159> stereo<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.329> stereo<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.590> way<00:01:43.710> you

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
a stereo in and a stereo out so way you

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.980 
a stereo in and a stereo out so way you
can<00:01:43.979> use<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.159> keyboard<00:01:44.970> players<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.689> great

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
can use it keyboard players it's a great

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.499 
can use it keyboard players it's a great
thing<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:46.829> them<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.399> using<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.329> use
