think<00:01:51.310> when<00:01:51.549> you're<00:01:51.670> on<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:51.850> road<00:01:52.090> in<00:01:52.329> a

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
think when you're on the road in a

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.959 
think when you're on the road in a
playoff<00:01:53.049> game<00:01:53.200> winner<00:01:53.619> they're<00:01:54.520> coming<00:01:54.850> off

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
playoff game winner they're coming off

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.620 
playoff game winner they're coming off
just<00:01:55.240> playing<00:01:55.479> last<00:01:55.780> Wednesday<00:01:56.289> and

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
just playing last Wednesday and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.999 
just playing last Wednesday and
you<00:01:56.990> know<00:01:57.079> it<00:01:57.200> have<00:01:57.290> been<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.439> week<00:01:57.619> since<00:01:57.649> we

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
you know it have been a week since we

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.240 
you know it have been a week since we
had<00:01:58.130> played<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.610> think<00:01:59.770> given<00:02:00.770> up<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:01.009> know

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
had played I think given up to know

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.620 
had played I think given up to know
early<00:02:01.460> goals<00:02:01.700> certainly<00:02:02.119> put<00:02:02.329> you<00:02:02.450> in<00:02:02.509> your

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
early goals certainly put you in your

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.330 
early goals certainly put you in your
heels<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:03.020> little<00:02:03.140> bit<00:02:03.439> I<00:02:03.680> thought<00:02:04.039> we<00:02:04.189> got

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
heels a little bit I thought we got

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.910 
heels a little bit I thought we got
better<00:02:04.640> as<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.060> as<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.509> game<00:02:06.229> went<00:02:06.380> along<00:02:06.500> I

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
better as the as the game went along I

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.199 
better as the as the game went along I
thought<00:02:07.100> our<00:02:07.220> second<00:02:07.610> gear<00:02:07.729> is<00:02:07.820> much<00:02:07.970> better

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
thought our second gear is much better

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.509 
thought our second gear is much better
than<00:02:08.269> our<00:02:08.450> first<00:02:08.950> we<00:02:09.950> didn't<00:02:10.099> give<00:02:10.220> him<00:02:10.250> nearly

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
than our first we didn't give him nearly

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.509 
than our first we didn't give him nearly
as<00:02:10.640> many<00:02:10.759> chances<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:11.950> thought<00:02:12.950> into<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.250> third

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
as many chances I thought into the third

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.100 
as many chances I thought into the third
we<00:02:13.550> lost<00:02:13.880> our<00:02:14.090> legs<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.450> little<00:02:14.569> bit<00:02:14.690> we<00:02:14.930> just

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
we lost our legs a little bit we just

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.509 
we lost our legs a little bit we just
didn't<00:02:15.319> seem<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.590> have<00:02:15.680> his<00:02:15.830> skating<00:02:16.069> legs<00:02:16.310> we

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
didn't seem to have his skating legs we

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.570 
didn't seem to have his skating legs we
had<00:02:16.670> earlier<00:02:16.880> in<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.360> game<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:18.010> it's<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.280> you

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
had earlier in the game so it's a you

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.130 
had earlier in the game so it's a you
know<00:02:19.670> it's<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:19.910> loss<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.510> think<00:02:20.720> there's<00:02:20.930> things

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
know it's a loss I think there's things

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.900 
know it's a loss I think there's things
we<00:02:21.200> can<00:02:21.440> build<00:02:21.620> chrome<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.040> think<00:02:22.220> we<00:02:22.340> learned<00:02:22.580> a

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
we can build chrome I think we learned a

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.370 
we can build chrome I think we learned a
little<00:02:23.330> bit<00:02:23.420> tight<00:02:23.750> we're<00:02:23.930> going<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.110> have<00:02:24.230> to

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
little bit tight we're going to have to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.809 
little bit tight we're going to have to
fly<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.739> tomorrow<00:02:25.099> we<00:02:25.220> have<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.459> play<00:02:25.610> better

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
fly that tomorrow we have to play better

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.610 
fly that tomorrow we have to play better
but<00:02:26.120> credit<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.780> them<00:02:26.900> they<00:02:27.050> played<00:02:27.230> real<00:02:27.440> good

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
but credit to them they played real good

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.470 
but credit to them they played real good

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
story Chancellor hard to come by this

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.770 
story Chancellor hard to come by this
red<00:02:29.840> ones<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.290> we

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.059 

what<00:02:33.500> do<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:34.540> well<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.569> think<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.950> know<00:02:37.040> it

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
what do you well I think you know it

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.860 
what do you well I think you know it
starts<00:02:37.490> by<00:02:37.610> getting<00:02:37.760> out<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.030> your<00:02:38.090> end<00:02:38.330> better

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
starts by getting out of your end better

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.270 
starts by getting out of your end better
and<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.319> think<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.590> more<00:02:39.770> time<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.040> spend<00:02:40.100> on

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
and I think the more time you spend on

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.530 
and I think the more time you spend on
the<00:02:40.370> other<00:02:40.490> teams<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.000> better<00:02:41.180> off<00:02:41.360> you

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
the other teams in the better off you

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.610 
the other teams in the better off you
are<00:02:41.569> we<00:02:41.750> got<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:41.959> get<00:02:42.020> a<00:02:42.080> little<00:02:42.170> more<00:02:42.319> traffic

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
are we got to get a little more traffic

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.750 
are we got to get a little more traffic
and<00:02:42.920> going<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.160> make<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.400> harder<00:02:43.640> and

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
and going to make it harder and

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.500 
and going to make it harder and
Markstrom<00:02:44.180> for<00:02:44.360> sure<00:02:44.680> but<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.740> think<00:02:46.510> one

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
Markstrom for sure but I think one

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.790 
Markstrom for sure but I think one
team's<00:02:47.720> gonna<00:02:47.840> put<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.200> aileron<00:02:48.440> reveals

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
team's gonna put the aileron reveals

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.190 
team's gonna put the aileron reveals
they<00:02:49.340> put<00:02:49.550> us<00:02:49.670> on<00:02:49.819> our<00:02:49.850> heels<00:02:50.090> enough<00:02:50.959> in<00:02:51.110> the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
they put us on our heels enough in the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.710 
they put us on our heels enough in the
first<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.800> also<00:02:52.459> didn't<00:02:52.790> think<00:02:52.940> we<00:02:53.030> executed<00:02:53.209> we

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
first I also didn't think we executed we

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.170 
first I also didn't think we executed we
had<00:02:53.840> about<00:02:54.170> three<00:02:54.530> three<00:02:54.800> on<00:02:54.830> tues<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:56.030> could

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
had about three three on tues that could

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.790 
had about three three on tues that could
have<00:02:56.270> resulted<00:02:56.360> in<00:02:56.780> good<00:02:56.959> chances<00:02:57.380> for<00:02:57.650> that

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
have resulted in good chances for that

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.199 
have resulted in good chances for that
we<00:02:57.890> just<00:02:57.920> didn't<00:02:58.280> execute<00:02:58.370> on<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.850> rushes<00:02:59.180> we

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
we just didn't execute on the rushes we

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.610 
we just didn't execute on the rushes we
execute<00:02:59.660> on<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.840> rush<00:03:00.020> maybe<00:03:00.290> we<00:03:00.380> feel

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
execute on the rush maybe we feel

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.509 
execute on the rush maybe we feel
different<00:03:01.010> about<00:03:01.069> how<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.310> period<00:03:06.519> being

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519
