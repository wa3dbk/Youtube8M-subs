00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
currants and if I just move here we've

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.710 
currants and if I just move here we've
got<00:00:28.150> quite<00:00:29.150> a<00:00:29.210> few<00:00:29.320> grain<00:00:30.939> there's<00:00:31.939> lots<00:00:32.540> and

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
got quite a few grain there's lots and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.330 
got quite a few grain there's lots and
lots<00:00:32.840> of<00:00:33.080> red<00:00:33.290> currants<00:00:33.710> in<00:00:33.770> there<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.160> it's

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
lots of red currants in there and it's

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.670 
lots of red currants in there and it's
all<00:00:34.490> time<00:00:34.760> to<00:00:34.910> start<00:00:35.180> harvesting<00:00:35.390> them<00:00:35.900> we've

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
all time to start harvesting them we've

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.610 
all time to start harvesting them we've
got<00:00:36.980> more<00:00:37.700> up<00:00:37.820> here<00:00:37.850> as<00:00:38.180> well<00:00:38.360> and<00:00:38.600> then<00:00:38.930> the

got more up here as well and then the

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.229 
got more up here as well and then the
four<00:00:39.829> bushes<00:00:40.160> over<00:00:40.310> there<00:00:40.430> white<00:00:40.820> counts

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
four bushes over there white counts

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.690 
four bushes over there white counts
which<00:00:41.390> aren't<00:00:41.600> quite<00:00:41.660> ready<00:00:41.960> but<00:00:42.230> in<00:00:43.100> today's

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
which aren't quite ready but in today's

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.820 
which aren't quite ready but in today's
video<00:00:44.180> I'll<00:00:44.300> just<00:00:44.450> be<00:00:44.600> showing<00:00:44.630> you<00:00:44.990> how

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
video I'll just be showing you how

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.070 
video I'll just be showing you how
simple<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.910> easy<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:48.110> is<00:00:48.260> to<00:00:48.730> freeze<00:00:50.080> currants

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
simple and easy it is to freeze currants

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.510 
simple and easy it is to freeze currants
which<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:51.380> can<00:00:51.530> then<00:00:51.710> use<00:00:51.740> later<00:00:52.100> for<00:00:52.250> either

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
which you can then use later for either

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.540 
which you can then use later for either
making<00:00:53.240> jam<00:00:54.020> in<00:00:54.320> like<00:00:54.530> December<00:00:54.680> or<00:00:55.130> something

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
making jam in like December or something

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.670 
making jam in like December or something
or<00:00:55.730> even<00:00:55.850> making<00:00:56.600> like<00:00:56.750> a<00:00:56.780> red<00:00:57.050> currant<00:00:57.320> pie

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
or even making like a red currant pie

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.490 
or even making like a red currant pie
just<00:00:58.280> whenever<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:58.760> want<00:00:58.970> so<00:00:59.240> let's<00:01:00.020> start<00:01:00.290> by

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
just whenever you want so let's start by

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.580 
just whenever you want so let's start by
going<00:01:00.710> one<00:01:01.040> bush<00:01:01.280> at<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.490> time<00:01:02.440> harvesting<00:01:03.440> them

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
going one bush at a time harvesting them

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.010 
going one bush at a time harvesting them
now<00:01:04.580> with<00:01:04.699> red<00:01:05.150> currants<00:01:05.630> when<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:05.930> are

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
now with red currants when you are

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.590 
now with red currants when you are
picking<00:01:06.409> them<00:01:06.759> and<00:01:07.759> you<00:01:08.119> know<00:01:08.299> you're<00:01:08.450> going

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
picking them and you know you're going

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.870 
picking them and you know you're going
to<00:01:08.630> be<00:01:08.750> harvesting<00:01:08.960> them<00:01:09.380> one<00:01:10.070> thing<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:10.520> can

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
to be harvesting them one thing you can

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
to be harvesting them one thing you can
do<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:12.530> save<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:12.770> bit<00:01:13.009> of<00:01:13.040> time<00:01:13.570> so<00:01:14.570> actually

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
do to save a bit of time so actually

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.039 
do to save a bit of time so actually
just<00:01:14.930> pick<00:01:15.439> all<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.770> this<00:01:16.070> by<00:01:16.969> a<00:01:17.210> cluster<00:01:17.840> and

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
just pick all of this by a cluster and

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.679 
just pick all of this by a cluster and
then<00:01:18.590> what<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.399> can<00:01:19.549> do<00:01:19.759> is<00:01:19.999> you<00:01:20.210> can<00:01:20.299> freeze

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
then what you can do is you can freeze

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.810 
then what you can do is you can freeze
them<00:01:20.719> for<00:01:21.200> about<00:01:21.649> three<00:01:21.979> hours<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:22.520> then<00:01:22.640> you

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
them for about three hours and then you

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.179 
them for about three hours and then you
can<00:01:22.999> go<00:01:23.149> down<00:01:23.390> with<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.600> fork<00:01:24.020> I'm<00:01:24.710> basically

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
can go down with a fork I'm basically

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.419 
can go down with a fork I'm basically
sleight<00:01:26.119> of<00:01:26.299> fork<00:01:26.960> down<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.439> stem<00:01:27.799> which

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
sleight of fork down the stem which

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.910 
sleight of fork down the stem which
releases<00:01:28.759> all<00:01:29.210> of<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.390> red<00:01:29.659> currants<00:01:30.109> so<00:01:30.259> thus

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
releases all of the red currants so thus

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.190 
releases all of the red currants so thus
if<00:01:31.130> you<00:01:31.280> don't<00:01:31.700> have<00:01:31.850> much<00:01:32.149> time<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:32.990> can<00:01:33.109> do

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
if you don't have much time you can do

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.399 
if you don't have much time you can do
that<00:01:33.229> but<00:01:33.710> I'm<00:01:33.829> going<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.009> do<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:34.460> bit<00:01:34.939> of<00:01:34.969> both

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
that but I'm going to do a bit of both

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.429 
that but I'm going to do a bit of both
for<00:01:36.409> freezing<00:01:36.649> but<00:01:37.579> this<00:01:37.700> is<00:01:37.850> mainly<00:01:38.060> with

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
for freezing but this is mainly with

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.109 
for freezing but this is mainly with
black<00:01:39.439> currants<00:01:39.829> and<00:01:39.890> red<00:01:40.069> currants<00:01:40.460> because

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
black currants and red currants because

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.620 
black currants and red currants because
the<00:01:41.719> main<00:01:41.869> reason<00:01:42.259> is<00:01:42.850> when<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:43.969> do<00:01:44.119> pick<00:01:44.420> them

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
the main reason is when you do pick them

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.200 
the main reason is when you do pick them
off<00:01:44.990> like<00:01:45.350> their<00:01:45.560> stem<00:01:45.859> the<00:01:46.819> juice<00:01:47.030> is

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
off like their stem the juice is

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.760 
off like their stem the juice is
connecting<00:01:47.689> then<00:01:47.840> it<00:01:47.960> can<00:01:48.170> make<00:01:48.409> all<00:01:48.619> the

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
connecting then it can make all the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.190 
connecting then it can make all the
currents<00:01:49.219> clustered<00:01:49.729> together<00:01:49.909> then<00:01:50.689> they<00:01:51.020> go

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
currents clustered together then they go

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.840 
currents clustered together then they go
a<00:01:51.229> bit<00:01:51.469> squashy

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.320 

you

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.090 

so<00:02:05.990> I've<00:02:06.110> got<00:02:06.260> a<00:02:06.290> good<00:02:06.530> amount<00:02:06.680> of<00:02:06.860> read

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
so I've got a good amount of read

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.490 
so I've got a good amount of read
comments<00:02:07.520> here<00:02:07.730> it's<00:02:08.630> quite<00:02:08.870> nice<00:02:09.020> sweet<00:02:09.350> to

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
comments here it's quite nice sweet to

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.850 
comments here it's quite nice sweet to
them

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
them

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.810 
them
I'll<00:02:10.550> weigh<00:02:11.210> it<00:02:11.330> out<00:02:11.480> later<00:02:11.900> on<00:02:12.140> but<00:02:12.820> first

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
I'll weigh it out later on but first

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.610 
I'll weigh it out later on but first
thing<00:02:14.030> we<00:02:14.390> well<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.990> next<00:02:15.140> thing<00:02:15.260> we<00:02:15.410> then

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
thing we well the next thing we then

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.800 
thing we well the next thing we then
need<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.770> do<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.760> give<00:02:16.940> them<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.270> good<00:02:17.510> rinse

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
need to do is to give them a good rinse

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.500 
need to do is to give them a good rinse
so<00:02:18.230> weighed<00:02:18.440> them<00:02:18.740> they've<00:02:19.310> come<00:02:19.940> out<00:02:19.970> just

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
so weighed them they've come out just

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.220 
so weighed them they've come out just
over<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:21.170> pound<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:23.120> I'd<00:02:23.390> say<00:02:23.630> just<00:02:23.660> under<00:02:24.050> a

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
over a pound and so I'd say just under a

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.260 
over a pound and so I'd say just under a
pound<00:02:24.260> because<00:02:24.860> take<00:02:25.100> away<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.550> bit<00:02:26.000> of<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.150> way

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
pound because take away a bit of the way

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.930 
pound because take away a bit of the way
to<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.750> stalks<00:02:27.050> but<00:02:27.290> now<00:02:27.440> just<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:28.070> give<00:02:28.700> them<00:02:28.820> a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
to the stalks but now just I give them a

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:49.120 
to the stalks but now just I give them a
nice<00:02:29.120> wash<00:02:29.540> under<00:02:29.930> some<00:02:30.110> water

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.280 

so<00:02:50.130> here<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.490> can<00:02:50.700> see<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.180> freezer<00:02:52.140> bag

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
so here that I can see is a freezer bag

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.030 
so here that I can see is a freezer bag
and<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:53.010> got<00:02:53.250> one<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.820> ties<00:02:54.240> here<00:02:54.740> for<00:02:55.740> tying

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
and I got one of the ties here for tying

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.060 
and I got one of the ties here for tying
it<00:02:56.450> but<00:02:57.450> it's<00:02:57.600> just<00:02:57.630> going<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.960> demonstrate<00:02:58.200> if

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
it but it's just going to demonstrate if

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.390 
it but it's just going to demonstrate if
I<00:02:59.250> find<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.790> nice<00:02:59.940> one<00:03:00.560> kind<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.650> demonstrate

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
I find a nice one kind of demonstrate

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.090 
I find a nice one kind of demonstrate
how<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.890> fork<00:03:05.220> works<00:03:05.550> when<00:03:06.420> you're<00:03:07.100> after

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
how the the fork works when you're after

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.710 
how the the fork works when you're after
about<00:03:08.400> three<00:03:08.730> hours<00:03:08.760> when<00:03:09.180> they<00:03:09.270> have<00:03:09.450> those

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
about three hours when they have those

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.710 
about three hours when they have those
frozen<00:03:10.380> you're<00:03:11.040> just<00:03:11.190> going<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.510> grab<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.570> by

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
frozen you're just going to grab it by

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.090 
frozen you're just going to grab it by
the<00:03:12.750> stalk<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.820> you're<00:03:14.820> going<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.000> pull<00:03:15.300> down

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.320 

and<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.640> releases<00:03:21.770> all<00:03:22.770> of<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:22.970> red<00:03:23.970> currants

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
and it releases all of the red currants

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.670 
and it releases all of the red currants
into<00:03:24.540> there<00:03:24.690> there<00:03:24.870> may<00:03:24.960> be<00:03:24.990> a<00:03:25.140> bit<00:03:25.320> of<00:03:25.410> stock

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
into there there may be a bit of stock

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.980 
into there there may be a bit of stock
left<00:03:26.150> but<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.270> works<00:03:27.420> better<00:03:27.630> when<00:03:27.810> it's

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
left but it works better when it's

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.500 
left but it works better when it's
frozen<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.620> then<00:03:29.340> obviously<00:03:30.060> when<00:03:30.360> you're

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
frozen and then obviously when you're

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.600 
frozen and then obviously when you're
cooking<00:03:30.720> or<00:03:31.200> if<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.620> even<00:03:31.740> make<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.190> jelly

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
cooking or if you even make you jelly

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.180 
cooking or if you even make you jelly
you<00:03:33.180> don't<00:03:33.390> even<00:03:33.600> need<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.930> worry<00:03:34.350> about<00:03:34.680> any

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
you don't even need to worry about any

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.260 
you don't even need to worry about any
stocks<00:03:35.580> because<00:03:35.790> you're<00:03:36.030> going<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.210> be

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
stocks because you're going to be

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.270 
stocks because you're going to be
squeezing<00:03:36.600> out<00:03:36.780> anyway<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.410> bet<00:03:37.950> yeah<00:03:38.070> that's

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
squeezing out anyway I bet yeah that's

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:50.509 
squeezing out anyway I bet yeah that's
basically<00:03:38.460> yeah<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:41.810> tip<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:43.530> would<00:03:44.070> work

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.869 

there<00:03:51.519> you<00:03:51.579> go

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:04.130 

and<00:03:56.879> then<00:03:57.180> tie<00:03:57.659> it<00:03:57.719> up<00:03:58.400> very<00:03:59.400> simple<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:03.140> tie

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
and then tie it up very simple and tie

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:12.500 
and then tie it up very simple and tie
the<00:04:04.200> tie<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:11.489> then<00:04:11.579> all<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.819> need<00:04:11.909> to<00:04:12.090> do<00:04:12.299> now

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
the tie and then all I need to do now

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.660 
the tie and then all I need to do now
just<00:04:12.989> give<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.349> a<00:04:13.379> quick<00:04:13.530> label<00:04:13.950> but<00:04:14.459> that's

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
just give it a quick label but that's

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.840 
just give it a quick label but that's
that's<00:04:15.060> all<00:04:15.209> you<00:04:15.299> have<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.599> do<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:16.609> these<00:04:17.609> cards

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
that's all you have to do to these cards

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.499 
that's all you have to do to these cards
is<00:04:18.060> so<00:04:18.209> simple<00:04:18.509> and<00:04:19.199> it's<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.680> great<00:04:19.919> way<00:04:20.130> of

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:20.509 
is so simple and it's a great way of

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:24.110 
is so simple and it's a great way of
using<00:04:21.509> them<00:04:21.840> later<00:04:22.800> on<00:04:23.039> in<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.310> year<00:04:23.460> yes<00:04:23.910> it

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
using them later on in the year yes it

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.999 
using them later on in the year yes it
does<00:04:24.330> take<00:04:24.600> quite<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.870> bit<00:04:25.050> of<00:04:25.110> time<00:04:25.380> picking

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009 
does take quite a bit of time picking

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.279 
does take quite a bit of time picking
them<00:04:26.310> but<00:04:26.759> if<00:04:26.880> you<00:04:27.000> get<00:04:27.210> some<00:04:27.479> like<00:04:27.630> friends<00:04:28.169> or

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
them but if you get some like friends or

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.860 
them but if you get some like friends or
family<00:04:28.650> over<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:29.370> then<00:04:30.000> makes<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.360> all<00:04:30.509> the

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
family over it then makes it all the

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.810 
family over it then makes it all the
more<00:04:31.199> worthwhile<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.160> then<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.370> can<00:04:32.520> share

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
more worthwhile and then you can share

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.870 
more worthwhile and then you can share
it<00:04:32.940> out<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.419> make<00:04:34.110> lots<00:04:34.289> of<00:04:34.470> nice<00:04:34.680> jam<00:04:35.099> so<00:04:35.699> I

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
it out and make lots of nice jam so I

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.520 
it out and make lots of nice jam so I
hope<00:04:36.000> you<00:04:36.120> found<00:04:36.270> this<00:04:36.419> useful<00:04:36.479> I'll<00:04:37.139> see<00:04:37.440> you

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530
