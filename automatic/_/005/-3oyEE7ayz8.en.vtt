00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
demarcation and crinkling there because

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.080 
demarcation and crinkling there because
I'm<00:02:19.900> kind<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.230> doing<00:02:20.440> this<00:02:20.709> kind<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:21.730> squinting

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
and closing my eyes um I can't really do

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.759 
and closing my eyes um I can't really do
a<00:02:25.150> demonstration<00:02:25.410> obviously<00:02:26.410> because<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.620> was

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
a demonstration obviously because I was

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.009 
a demonstration obviously because I was
know<00:02:26.920> where<00:02:27.129> that<00:02:27.310> hell<00:02:27.400> I'm<00:02:28.030> doing<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.810> and

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
know where that hell I'm doing it and

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.740 
know where that hell I'm doing it and
right<00:02:29.200> now<00:02:29.319> I've<00:02:29.500> already<00:02:29.799> got<00:02:30.010> makeup<00:02:30.849> on<00:02:30.910> but

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
right now I've already got makeup on but

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.210 
right now I've already got makeup on but
literally<00:02:32.290> it's<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:34.650> right<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.860> center

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
literally it's this right in the center

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.580 
literally it's this right in the center
I<00:02:36.430> don't<00:02:37.390> even<00:02:37.450> know<00:02:37.629> what<00:02:37.810> I'm<00:02:37.840> doing<00:02:37.930> there's

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
I don't even know what I'm doing there's

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.229 
I don't even know what I'm doing there's
every<00:02:39.250> day<00:02:39.400> I'm<00:02:39.549> sure<00:02:39.580> it's<00:02:39.910> different

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
every day I'm sure it's different

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.820 
every day I'm sure it's different
because<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.450> can't<00:02:40.810> see<00:02:40.989> what<00:02:41.230> I'm<00:02:41.349> doing<00:02:41.379> so<00:02:41.799> I

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
because I can't see what I'm doing so I

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.470 
because I can't see what I'm doing so I
just<00:02:42.129> kind<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.340> feel<00:02:42.640> around<00:02:43.000> sort<00:02:43.299> of<00:02:43.360> the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
just kind of feel around sort of the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.030 
just kind of feel around sort of the
center<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.780> my<00:02:43.930> face<00:02:44.140> they're<00:02:44.440> just<00:02:44.470> do<00:02:44.829> that

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
center of my face they're just do that

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.150 
center of my face they're just do that
one<00:02:45.280> spritz<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.420> that's<00:02:47.079> it<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:47.530> don't<00:02:47.739> need<00:02:47.920> to

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
one spritz and that's it I don't need to

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.069 
one spritz and that's it I don't need to
cover<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.640> rest<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:49.030> my<00:02:49.180> face<00:02:49.450> my<00:02:49.750> problem

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
cover the rest of my face my problem

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.960 
cover the rest of my face my problem
areas<00:02:50.230> sort<00:02:50.739> of<00:02:50.829> here<00:02:51.099> and<00:02:51.340> then<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.610> rest<00:02:51.760> is

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
areas sort of here and then the rest is

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.640 
areas sort of here and then the rest is
just<00:02:52.030> fine<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:53.160> for<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.280> reason<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:55.530> love<00:02:56.530> it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
just fine so for that reason I love it

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.350 
just fine so for that reason I love it
because<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:57.040> use<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.489> little<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:57.940> if<00:02:58.209> you

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
because I use so little of it if you

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.119 
because I use so little of it if you
were<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.599> do<00:02:58.750> like<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:58.989> full<00:02:59.319> full<00:02:59.620> full<00:02:59.650> face

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
were to do like a full full full face

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.430 
were to do like a full full full face
I'm<00:03:00.790> pretty<00:03:01.299> sure<00:03:01.599> you'd<00:03:01.900> probably<00:03:02.140> have<00:03:02.379> to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
I'm pretty sure you'd probably have to

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.490 
I'm pretty sure you'd probably have to
towel<00:03:02.739> up<00:03:02.980> your<00:03:03.190> hair<00:03:03.489> or<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.989> know<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.319> might

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
towel up your hair or you know it might

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.960 
towel up your hair or you know it might
get<00:03:05.680> into<00:03:05.950> your<00:03:06.040> hairline<00:03:06.459> I've<00:03:06.579> been<00:03:06.700> asked

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
get into your hairline I've been asked

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.729 
get into your hairline I've been asked
that<00:03:07.000> question<00:03:07.120> for<00:03:07.569> me<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:08.049> doesn't<00:03:08.470> because

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
that question for me it doesn't because

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.199 
that question for me it doesn't because
I'm<00:03:08.860> literally<00:03:09.190> just<00:03:09.280> spraying<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.879> center

five minutes so um in that way you know
super<00:04:01.389> super<00:04:01.780> quick<00:04:01.989> it<00:04:02.349> feels<00:04:02.769> very<00:04:02.889> light

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
super super quick it feels very light

super super quick it feels very light
the<00:04:03.730> coverage<00:04:04.090> is<00:04:04.239> media<00:04:04.720> obviously<00:04:05.049> it<00:04:05.560> can

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
the coverage is media obviously it can

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.089 
the coverage is media obviously it can
go<00:04:05.859> really<00:04:06.069> really<00:04:06.549> full<00:04:06.940> um<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:08.410> wouldn't<00:04:08.980> say

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
go really really full um I wouldn't say

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.319 
go really really full um I wouldn't say
it<00:04:09.160> goes<00:04:09.310> super<00:04:09.639> super<00:04:09.970> sheer<00:04:10.209> it's

it goes super super sheer it's
definitely<00:04:10.660> more<00:04:10.780> than<00:04:10.959> a<00:04:11.049> tinted

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
definitely more than a tinted

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.349 
definitely more than a tinted
moisturizer<00:04:11.620> but<00:04:12.190> just<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:12.519> one<00:04:12.760> thing<00:04:12.790> just

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
moisturizer but just that one thing just

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.690 
moisturizer but just that one thing just
gives<00:04:13.599> me<00:04:13.690> enough<00:04:14.260> sort<00:04:14.829> of<00:04:14.919> coverage<00:04:15.280> but<00:04:15.489> it

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
gives me enough sort of coverage but it

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.690 
gives me enough sort of coverage but it
looks<00:04:15.910> natural<00:04:16.150> um<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:17.650> finish<00:04:18.130> will

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
looks natural um the finish will

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.610 
looks natural um the finish will
be<00:04:20.760> satiny<00:04:21.760> it's<00:04:22.600> not<00:04:22.720> super<00:04:23.140> super<00:04:23.440> Dewey

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.350 
be satiny it's not super super Dewey
it's<00:04:23.830> definitely<00:04:24.190> not<00:04:24.310> mad<00:04:24.550> I<00:04:24.790> can't<00:04:25.000> do<00:04:25.120> maths

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
so um the fragrance there is a bit of a

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.600 
so um the fragrance there is a bit of a
favorite<00:04:29.380> fragrance<00:04:29.920> it's<00:04:30.130> not<00:04:30.280> really
