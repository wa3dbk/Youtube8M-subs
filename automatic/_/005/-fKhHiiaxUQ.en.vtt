00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.160
 to make the cat scraper we go 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.260
 to need normal cardboard a piece of 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.900
 cloth to cover the base in my case I'll 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.939
 to use a hair roll a 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.939
 3 meter rope will be enough 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:21.400
 white glue silicone gun with the 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.110
 silicone bars two cans of 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.250
 potatoes that come in tubes 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.020
 cylindrical cutter scissors and some 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.480
 cat toy that can be hung 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.280
 like a ball or the mice that you see 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.109
 in the image the first thing we're going to 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.329
 do is going to be cut the cardboard in three 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:39.310
 pieces equal the size of the base 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.390
 may be the one we want the 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.280
 I have made 28 x 25 I do not remember because 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.430
 use those measures in particular because 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.329
 it would be more logical to put 25 x 25 but 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.010
 well I like I usually do some 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.739
 things without any sense then I stay 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.660
 well but let's use the measures 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.460
 that you want 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.710
 the next thing we're going to do is going to be 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.900
 mark where the stick would go 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.390
 so measure and with the pot of potatoes 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.280
 you draw the circle and we do it only in 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.650
 two of the cartons and then what 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.690
 We cut with a cutter now we can 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.910
 stick the cartons together with glue 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.220
 white once they're stuck we're going to 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.080
 put the cylindrical can in the hollow and 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.390
 let's mark how far the 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.000
 cardboard because then we're going to go around it 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.680
 with rope and so we'll know how far 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.780
 may this 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.000
 now let's paste the two boats between 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.220
 yes with silicone and to reinforce it and that 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.620
 do not take off , we tape you 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.510
 adhesive on the joint if it's for a cat 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.940
 big I advise you put a weight 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.590
 inside how stones can be 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.690
 start to surround the boats with the rope 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.000
 and for that we make a hole in the 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.650
 base of a boat with the help of 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.479
 scissors we have to do what 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.670
 big enough so you can 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.830
 enter the rope for him we put a 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.310
 little silicone at the edge of the hole 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.200
 and we already put the beginning of the rope to 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.840
 from there we started to cover everything 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.790
 winding the rope and adding one 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.590
 silicone droplet in certain parts 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.060
 so that it sticks 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.130
 to place the toys that will go 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.470
 hung what we have to do is 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.540
 stick the string in the boat and pass the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.520
 rope above and so we will continue 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.040
 rolling up to the mark that we have 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.019
 made to the boat at the beginning 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.900
 once we have it ready we 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.120
 would something like this now let's take the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.950
 base in this case as you see the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.920
 cans with reinforced tape 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.290
 bodybuilder and we put the fabric with the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.959
 that we are going to cover what we mark the 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.810
 circular hole we can help us to 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.930
 it with the boat and then we cut it 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.849
 with the cutter when we have the hole 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.190
 we will stick the fabric to the base with the glue 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.380
 white 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.750
 once we have it lined we can 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.460
 paste the scraper because the boat 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.010
 It has a little hole in the bottom 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.410
 it will not be able to stick completely and it will remain 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.210
 unstable so to fix it 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.300
 we will only cut a circle of 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.310
 cardboard and there and then we will stick 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.310
 we can paste everything to the base with 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.470
 silicone will be enough and this would be the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.870
 result is quite resistant and much 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.700
 cheaper than a store that 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.280
 the cat does not pay attention to him and that 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.380
 be afraid is another matter no 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.050
 I got him out of a miserable picture with 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.940
 the scraper I think even my dog 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.330
 He drew more attention and that hardly 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.130
 but oh so good lis is a failure 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.010
 of scraper but maybe other cats 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.110
 like if you like the tutorials of 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.630
 crafts you can subscribe to the channel 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.220
 and I like the video like it 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.300
 can you share in case someone 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.300
 interesting thanks 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.300
 no no 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.060
 i 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.230
