00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.350 
something that was not as big as him but
it's<00:02:57.230> it's<00:02:57.890> still<00:02:58.220> pretty<00:02:58.459> darn<00:02:58.760> baking<00:02:59.239> for

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
it's it's still pretty darn baking for

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.210 
it's it's still pretty darn baking for
the<00:02:59.540> size<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.110> fish<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:01.430> know<00:03:01.989> so<00:03:02.989> again<00:03:03.860> I

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
the size of the fish you know so again I

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.520 
the size of the fish you know so again I
had<00:03:04.850> to<00:03:05.000> work<00:03:05.180> hard<00:03:05.450> tonight<00:03:05.720> that's

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
had to work hard tonight that's

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.470 
had to work hard tonight that's
definitely<00:03:06.980> not<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.190> 30<00:03:07.549> fish<00:03:07.850> night<00:03:08.150> for<00:03:08.450> us

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
definitely not a 30 fish night for us

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:24.840 
definitely not a 30 fish night for us
but

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.120 

okay<00:03:25.480> we're<00:03:25.660> back<00:03:25.690> hey<00:03:26.590> we<00:03:26.740> did<00:03:26.890> pretty<00:03:27.010> good

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
okay we're back hey we did pretty good

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.970 
okay we're back hey we did pretty good
work<00:03:27.730> pretty<00:03:27.940> hard<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.300> get<00:03:28.420> those<00:03:28.600> fish<00:03:28.980> we

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
work pretty hard to get those fish we

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.970 
work pretty hard to get those fish we
both<00:03:30.280> missed<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.850> couple<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.500> think<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.560> golden

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
both missed a couple I think the golden

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.740 
both missed a couple I think the golden
rule<00:03:33.100> is<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.460> take<00:03:33.670> your<00:03:33.700> wife<00:03:34.120> fishing<00:03:34.630> with

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
rule is you take your wife fishing with

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.090 
rule is you take your wife fishing with
you<00:03:34.990> she's<00:03:35.260> definitely<00:03:35.680> going<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:35.890> catch<00:03:36.070> the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
you she's definitely going to catch the

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.130 
you she's definitely going to catch the
most<00:03:36.640> fish<00:03:36.820> that<00:03:37.480> was<00:03:37.660> certainly<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:38.110> case

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
most fish that was certainly the case

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.700 
most fish that was certainly the case
tonight<00:03:39.120> no<00:03:40.120> big<00:03:40.270> deal<00:03:40.300> that<00:03:41.020> just<00:03:41.230> means<00:03:41.350> that

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
tonight no big deal that just means that

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.200 
tonight no big deal that just means that
there's<00:03:41.890> more<00:03:42.070> fish<00:03:42.280> on<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.700> string<00:03:42.970> or<00:03:43.120> at
