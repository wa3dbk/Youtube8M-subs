and then they put their signature on it
and<00:02:21.890> send<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.130> off<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.250> its<00:02:22.490> final<00:02:22.670> home<00:02:22.880> when

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
and send it off to its final home when

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.210 
and send it off to its final home when
you<00:02:23.360> make<00:02:23.510> something<00:02:23.720> by<00:02:23.930> hand<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.350> has<00:02:24.890> some

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
you make something by hand it has some

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.399 
you make something by hand it has some
natural<00:02:25.670> variation<00:02:26.150> in<00:02:26.269> it<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.959> we<00:02:27.110> just<00:02:27.260> want

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
natural variation in it so we just want

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:28.570 
natural variation in it so we just want
to<00:02:27.470> make<00:02:27.560> sure<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.950> everything<00:02:28.489> is

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.080 
this is Victor Franco he's our lead
bench<00:02:34.070> tester<00:02:34.520> hi<00:02:34.790> Victor<00:02:35.950> so<00:02:36.950> when<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.880> see<00:02:38.060> a

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
bench tester hi Victor so when you see a

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.210 
bench tester hi Victor so when you see a
BF<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:40.870> ZF<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.050> Zack<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:42.860> that's<00:02:42.980> our<00:02:43.100> other

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
BF it ZF is Zack so that's our other

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.880 
BF it ZF is Zack so that's our other
bench<00:02:43.730> Chester<00:02:44.060> if<00:02:44.150> there's<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.560> VF<00:02:45.560> that's<00:02:45.800> a

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
bench Chester if there's a VF that's a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.710 
bench Chester if there's a VF that's a
Victor<00:02:46.160> Franko<00:02:46.520> and<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:46.790> means<00:02:47.000> machine

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
Victor Franko and that means machine

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.630

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
passed through his hand support KP so if

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.910 
passed through his hand support KP so if
I<00:02:49.760> go<00:02:50.030> home<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.510> take<00:02:50.690> apart<00:02:50.960> my<00:02:51.020> vocal<00:02:51.860> I'm

the kind of coffees that we all

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.350 
the kind of coffees that we all

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.670 
appreciate I think it's sort of hard to
argue<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.810> fact<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:24.170> roasting<00:03:24.560> them

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
argue the fact that roasting them

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.790 
argue the fact that roasting them
lighter<00:03:24.890> does<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.700> better<00:03:25.880> job<00:03:26.000> kind<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.810> giving

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
lighter does a better job kind of giving

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.490 
lighter does a better job kind of giving
them<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.280> attention<00:03:29.120> whoo<00:03:29.990> that<00:03:30.350> they
