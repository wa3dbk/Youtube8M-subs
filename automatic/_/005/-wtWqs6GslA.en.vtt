pearlescent<00:02:25.739> tinsel<00:02:29.599> going<00:02:30.599> over<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.989> top

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
pearlescent tinsel going over the top

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.770 
pearlescent tinsel going over the top
and<00:02:31.500> then<00:02:31.650> also<00:02:31.830> going<00:02:32.370> underneath<00:02:38.780> should

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
and then also going underneath should

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.059 
and then also going underneath should
only<00:02:39.930> take<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.170> four<00:02:40.500> or<00:02:40.590> five<00:02:40.739> wraps

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
only take you four or five wraps

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.190 
only take you four or five wraps
especially<00:02:42.060> on<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> smaller<00:02:42.620> Mighty<00:02:43.620> Mite<00:02:45.200> then

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
especially on a smaller Mighty Mite then

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.720 
especially on a smaller Mighty Mite then
when<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.379> get<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.829> thorax<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.519> can

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
when you get to the thorax you can

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.490 
when you get to the thorax you can
capture<00:02:48.000> both<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.510> tinsel<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:51.079> that<00:02:52.079> D<00:02:52.290> rib

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
capture both the tinsel and that D rib

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.849 
capture both the tinsel and that D rib
then<00:02:53.370> we<00:02:53.459> can<00:02:53.609> trim<00:02:53.879> both<00:02:55.280> out<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.640> way<00:02:57.859> and

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
then we can trim both out of the way and

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.650 
then we can trim both out of the way and
we<00:02:58.950> can<00:02:58.980> reposition<00:02:59.549> our<00:02:59.790> hook<00:02:59.970> here<00:03:00.209> now<00:03:00.420> that

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
we can reposition our hook here now that

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:09.830 
we can reposition our hook here now that
I've<00:03:01.200> got<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.560> tail<00:03:01.829> tied<00:03:02.160> in<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:09.660> what

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
that's done is it's created just a hint

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.789 
that's done is it's created just a hint
of<00:03:11.819> flash<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.420> segmentation<00:03:12.959> on<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.349> fly
