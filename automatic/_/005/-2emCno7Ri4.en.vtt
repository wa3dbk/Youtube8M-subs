this<00:00:34.050> exact<00:00:34.410> model<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:34.890> you're<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
this exact model here you're going to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.900 
this exact model here you're going to
need<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.579> total<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.000> 56<00:00:36.450> units<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.079> I've<00:00:37.710> used<00:00:38.280> 6

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
need a total of 56 units and I've used 6

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.709 
need a total of 56 units and I've used 6
black<00:00:39.090> units<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.719> 50<00:00:40.260> green<00:00:41.010> units<00:00:41.399> now<00:00:42.090> when

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
black units and 50 green units now when

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.060 
black units and 50 green units now when
I<00:00:42.750> was<00:00:42.899> looking<00:00:43.079> at<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.260> image<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.770> actually

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
I was looking at the image it actually

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.770 
I was looking at the image it actually
had<00:00:44.190> an<00:00:44.340> extra<00:00:44.610> layer<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> top<00:00:45.120> but

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
had an extra layer on the top but

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.779 
had an extra layer on the top but
instead<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.379> being<00:00:46.559> full<00:00:46.890> cute<00:00:47.190> units<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.700> was

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
instead of being full cute units it was

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.119 
instead of being full cute units it was
sort<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> half<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.289> keep<00:00:49.500> unit<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.070> I

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
sort of like a half a keep unit and I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.279 
sort of like a half a keep unit and I
can<00:00:50.309> really<00:00:50.520> add<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.390> want<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
can really add that so if you want to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.170 
can really add that so if you want to
add<00:00:52.350> another<00:00:52.590> row<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.010> top<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:54.000> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
add another row on top you can do that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.840 
add another row on top you can do that
if<00:00:54.300> you'd<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.930> which<00:00:55.110> case<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.559> would<00:00:55.680> be

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
if you'd like in which case it would be

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.779 
if you'd like in which case it would be
64<00:00:56.850> units<00:00:57.030> instead<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.870> 56<00:00:58.469> now<00:00:59.309> do<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
64 units instead of 56 now do the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.610 
64 units instead of 56 now do the
assembly<00:00:59.969> process<00:01:00.270> all<00:01:00.899> these<00:01:01.140> units<00:01:01.500> are

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
assembly process all these units are

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.410 
assembly process all these units are
actually<00:01:01.980> made<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.489> four<00:01:02.760> different<00:01:02.789> kinds

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
actually made up of four different kinds

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.960 
actually made up of four different kinds
of<00:01:03.449> units<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.019> first<00:01:04.409> unit<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:05.700> here

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
of units the first unit is this one here

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.429 
of units the first unit is this one here
and<00:01:06.150> we're<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> call<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.900> unit<00:01:07.200> 8

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
and we're going to call this unit 8

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.070 
and we're going to call this unit 8
which<00:01:08.070> has<00:01:08.250> full<00:01:08.490> flaps<00:01:08.729> sticking<00:01:09.119> out<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.990> let

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
which has full flaps sticking out so let

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.420 
which has full flaps sticking out so let
me<00:01:10.170> move<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:10.950> bit<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.310> it's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
me move this up a little bit so if it's

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700 
me move this up a little bit so if it's
a<00:01:11.490> little<00:01:11.610> bit<00:01:11.790> better<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:13.140> second<00:01:13.560> type<00:01:13.680> of

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
a little bit better the second type of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.620 
a little bit better the second type of
unit<00:01:14.130> we're<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.610> using<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.150> this

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
unit we're going to be using is this

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.840 
unit we're going to be using is this
here<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.110> we're<00:01:16.439> going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.680> call<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:16.950> unit<00:01:17.310> B

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
here and we're going to call this unit B

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.240 
here and we're going to call this unit B
that<00:01:19.330> looks<00:01:19.540> like<00:01:19.630> this<00:01:19.920> then<00:01:20.920> we're<00:01:21.040> going<00:01:21.189> to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
that looks like this then we're going to

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.429 
that looks like this then we're going to
be<00:01:21.430> using<00:01:21.820> this<00:01:21.939> unit<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.750> this<00:01:23.020> is<00:01:23.170> going<00:01:23.350> to

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
be using this unit and this is going to

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.660 
be using this unit and this is going to
be<00:01:23.560> called<00:01:23.799> unit<00:01:24.159> C<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:25.950> finally<00:01:26.950> we<00:01:27.250> have<00:01:27.430> our

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
be called unit C and finally we have our

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.359 
be called unit C and finally we have our
last<00:01:28.060> unit<00:01:28.270> here<00:01:28.659> and<00:01:29.110> this<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.040> going<00:01:30.190> to<00:01:30.280> be

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
last unit here and this is going to be

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.700 
last unit here and this is going to be
called<00:01:30.549> unity<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.630> during<00:01:32.170> this<00:01:32.259> tutorial

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
called unity and during this tutorial

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.320 
called unity and during this tutorial
I'm<00:01:32.799> going<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.040> be<00:01:33.220> basically<00:01:33.640> referring<00:01:34.149> to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
I'm going to be basically referring to

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.120 
I'm going to be basically referring to
each<00:01:34.540> of<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:34.780> units<00:01:34.810> by<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.259> alphabetical

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
each of the units by the alphabetical

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.340 
each of the units by the alphabetical
letter<00:01:36.310> so<00:01:36.580> just<00:01:36.909> pay<00:01:37.540> attention<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.049> and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
letter so just pay attention to that and

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.899 
letter so just pay attention to that and
the<00:01:38.950> rest<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.280> tutorial<00:01:39.640> should<00:01:39.759> be

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
the rest of the tutorial should be

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.700 
the rest of the tutorial should be
fairly<00:01:40.180> simple<00:01:40.479> and<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.110> should<00:01:41.289> be<00:01:41.380> able<00:01:41.560> to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
fairly simple and you should be able to

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.520 
fairly simple and you should be able to
assemble<00:01:42.009> it<00:01:42.190> yourself<00:01:42.220> fairly<00:01:43.090> easily<00:01:43.270> so<00:01:44.020> on

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
assemble it yourself fairly easily so on

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.840 
assemble it yourself fairly easily so on
that<00:01:44.710> note<00:01:44.740> let's<00:01:44.890> get<00:01:45.190> started<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:45.729> I'll

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
that note let's get started and I'll

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.479 
that note let's get started and I'll
show<00:01:46.000> you<00:01:46.060> how<00:01:46.149> to<00:01:46.210> make<00:01:46.299> this
