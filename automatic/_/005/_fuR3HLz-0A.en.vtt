00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:11.230
 and so already you save our friends here I am 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.740
 I want you 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:18.250
 iron that is despairing something 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.810
 prove using blogs set out on 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.939
 paper 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:30.160
 I came to practical such work 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:32.140
 the first layout was made this 340 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.780
 cubes of workers like that in this case 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.410
 going to figure out what power 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.480
 it can roughly develop this layout 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.239
 I was made specifically for 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.149
 to show how this engine 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.219
 that here is a lot of final fell for 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:55.440
 order to take power off four 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:57.930
 colors so here he arranges inside 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.359
 understands that part as you see 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.119
 inside that with two pistons of this 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.460
 cylinders you by itself understand what 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.050
 mass production of this however 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.990
 some went on their engine goes 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.660
 same in terms of the very 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.830
 production is a spring 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:23.259
 Further exactly the same although here 4 went 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.060
 your current for mass production is 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.450
 just for just two details i that is 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.530
 more 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:35.860
 stem end 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.340
 see here if for communication here 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.340
 still here are all the details 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.340
 all if both remove it using the drawings 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.989
 what does everything work there it means such 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.489
 troubles is obtained in terms of 

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:49.239
 understanding is required spatial 

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:52.110
 imagination 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:55.200
 Well, then let's say that's too 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.970
 one of the layouts was close the peacock here 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.600
 can do it here worked 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.940
 technology sky languor answer all 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.430
 spinning spinning one of the charges 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.200
 the address of the engine and Saturn what is it 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.880
 very difficult to manufacture what 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.240
 requires the highest precision and so 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.850
 further dear friends then everything is not 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.840
 so yes accuracy is really required 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.060
 very high irbit for example 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.340
 good base so everything done writes about 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.740
 on the botanical engine turn 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.350
 how now the rim started here is not 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.959
 Could watched to keep this holiday those 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.290
 which require this engine itself 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.959
 business 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.900
 but everything is very easy everything is permitted 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.989
 very easy I am allowed by 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.450
 profession helicopter but do it yourself 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.730
 made six packages and here it is 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.470
 effect of lending everything to a given tolerance 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.800
 all-all-all I mean everything worked 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.230
 why because I worked 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.980
 original manufacturing technology 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.320
 with which we could say so to share 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.739
 so here it is again 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.290
 emphasizes a very simply given 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.630
 I launched the model on the stand 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.900
 that's it, rogues can do it all well 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.519
 look here and i want you now 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.350
 show engine details 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.590
 more accurate layout because the details are not 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.050
 hardened not hot stick which 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.720
 helped 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.090
 was already liquidation stage at the end 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.000
 ends regulate so i dont 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:34.730
 managed to do everything right 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.920
 did not read to Lena and of course I started 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.570
 run it why not knees dance with 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.420
 It does not run the fish but nevertheless here 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.080
 fully this layout as it will pass 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.330
 natural size 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.150
 all-all-all means I have it here 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.550
 these details 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.790
 characteristics 1.6 liter displacement 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.960
 that with these leaders you can get 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.350
 Rybinsk engine-building charges 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.290
 made a beautiful view sleepy engine 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.150
 150 kilogram without horsepower 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.240
 u but there did not remove power 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.780
 1.6 tenths liter working volume 200 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.550
 horsepower power ie it 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.600
 good is it very good performance 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.459
 Here Iâ€™ll carry it, including this one 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.910
 here is the layout it is exactly the same working 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.300
 volume 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.130
 1 whole 62 only messi there completely with 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.250
 pain on all systems were about 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.770
 45 kilograms are modeled but you 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.040
 here I want to show some let's say 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.650
 so the details can firstly here this 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.200
 map this is carter that's expensive track that's 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.660
 This is the main part of the engine 200 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.210
 horsepower yes here's the picture detail 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.040
 dresses people live need fingers on that 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:54.800
 these here it really is very 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:05:00.120
 such is his things; this is all 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.639
 here and the east here is the piston plantation 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.320
 also very light detail that you have it all 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.639
 1.3 kilograms 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:14.130
 so if so too if acts without 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:15.570
 here's a crankshaft crankshaft 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.880
 too for what it can be kept 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.639
 little shop literally and this one 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:27.210
 part of it already I drained the power myself 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:29.820
 even easier here is the center to which for 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.430
 links here are actually all basic 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.979
 show details not virgin lands 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.449
 but here dear friends cylinder 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.300
 you can just really say 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:42.330
 model and very much pass green 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.220
 here I just made all the iron 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.260
 many times has modeled so 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.970
 simulate such a david draw kolyma 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.190
 so I was not a chance 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.979
 make it all so easy 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.139
 Well even further with him so much 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:58.760
 hour cylinders all along with 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:01.949
 units it turned out 45 kilograms 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.360
 that's the kind of thing else dear friends 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.440
 how to enter 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.440
 original size 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:19.620
 and here is an all-in- one here 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.530
 made of there even stronger you this 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.130
 I decided this was copyrighted 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:29.010
 evidence that is my invention 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:32.070
 if so who is interested here yet 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:36.150
 so done so here at the level here if 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:38.820
 they are all these things we want to finish 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.190
 dear friends, so what began that is 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.380
 This is me telling me not for the sake of what 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.680
 iron there some sort of show there though yes 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.080
 it is interesting that here I am to 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.560
 cooperation to someone there for the good 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.080
 please i would like this example 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.660
 show that any here is our language 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.670
 seemed common kinetic some 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:06.570
 conceptual such provisions here well 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:08.760
 get away practice and give in practice 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:12.660
 these are the results I am talking about 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:15.870
 here are fundamentally new things many 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:20.450
 friends thank you for your attention and success 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.450
 sobriety will be jesus in armor
