00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 this swarm road exhibition ces 2013 stand 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 archos didnâ€™t last year 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.990
 managed to find this one 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.790
 archos gamepad only found a tablet 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.700
 sandwich on now managed 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.770
 here it works it costs only 150 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.630
 dollars this is really important 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.939
 the main advantage is that its price tag 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.220
 very pleasant 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.880
 let's take a look at the body first and 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.949
 we have a 7-inch screen here on the right there 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.859
 buttons are standard buttons for all games 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.460
 here there are two two analogs enough 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.739
 conveniently about the same as on psp 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.260
 there are such small buttons 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.390
 select and start which is usually for 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.030
 Consoles used here there are two 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.559
 pin 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.550
 and more precisely it is l2 and r2 and two more of these 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.129
 here's the trigger too 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.620
 on top of the volume and power buttons 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.629
 food with dima by the way 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.680
 full output can be a loss 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.379
 play toys headphones to less 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.840
 shoot almost full 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.070
 and below we have a memory card slot 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.960
 and that is good too what is bad here 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.850
 little screen here 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.600
 not very high quality tent film is 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.700
 it was certainly done for such 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.830
 good price tag and therefore there is not very 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.170
 Dear took and used as you can see 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.430
 viewing angles so-so resolution 1468 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.950
 principle processor stands here 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.320
 dual core half giga rockwell 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.630
 and he assured us 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.340
 running faster from the game i'm not sure 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.950
 how fast it is running this game but 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.450
 In principle, all menus work quickly and 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.680
 in terms of price-quality ratio 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.600
 as we were told again he is better again 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.579
 same money 100 dollars to justify 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.259
 let's see how the toy goes on 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.189
 which we tested almost everything 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.840
 our devices dead trigger ladies here 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.280
 it will be possible to celebrate here with this 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.909
 by all 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.140
 buttons it by the way 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.520
 supported exactly on date 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.619
 the board here is already supported ded 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.210
 trigger and in other games in which not 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.819
 I'll show you a little later how 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.640
 you can do that there is support 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.980
 little know-how will be here this 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.140
 buttons assign screen buttons 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.989
 very cool this is a start for 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.150
 tags like this here it all looks in 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.280
 I don't notice strong brakes 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.629
 here's a hammer can shoot at zombies 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.250
 Likely to us many zombakov will 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.400
 a little brakes but basically everything 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.650
 It works smartly but the d-trigger it is generally in 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.629
 this plan is very good great 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.079
 adapted for different platforms in 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.510
 principle 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.329
 really goes on almost everything 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.310
 Well, sometimes of course it slows down but in general 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.470
 play play can play great 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.079
 expert completely different you push already 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.489
 not on the screen you have the whole screen is free you 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.409
 you can just press these buttons 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.109
 click here on this trigger very much 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:58.109
 nice management comfortable besides 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.790
 Tablet computers lightweight thin here from 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.739
 batteries it will work exactly 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.810
 if you play 3d toys in cool stuff 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.970
 would be 3-4 hours in any such 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.609
 light knife even less if you play 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.739
 Some kind of such kazualki something 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.900
 most likely you can lose there hours 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.659
 5 if you just use it there 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.090
 watch a video or listen to music there 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.060
 it is possible and at ten o'clock like that 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.920
 so alim constructor we unfortunately not 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.510
 said as for the other games which 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.370
 not adapted to this control here 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.449
 for example there is an example of good 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.150
 for example here is an example for example racing on 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.829
 two cycles in extreme 2 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.989
 Here on it and see here management 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.609
 carried out from the screen screen 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.740
 buttons as you probably know here they are 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:47.050
 here are these buttons and to assign 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.080
 one can not do anything as well, nothing can 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.870
 he is now definitely doing it for him 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.150
 such an operation we are not clicking on all these 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.890
 buttons nothing can work 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.400
 use screens but it is inconvenient 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.710
 if we have such great joysticks 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.760
 so click on this button pull 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:09.190
 next button and here we assign to 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.780
 one of the hardware son keys from 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.900
 to the left this is our right jump we will have 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.900
 but 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:31.180
 there is something else for 3x 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:35.110
 bullshit would suggest flooding so 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.660
 I only jump myself I accelerate a 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.270
 I control the corner with these buttons 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.070
 and everything works in almost any game 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.430
 this thing will work really 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.050
 it is convenient to add at least to Engry Birds 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.490
 but not only don't get up in 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.950
 any sin land such here and gran 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.100
 toys can be assigned hardware th 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.740
 archos gamepad is not on a good device 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.000
 worth only 150 dollars i 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.330
 I recall really very good 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.180
 price 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.040
