00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
reviews on it so far so I thought why

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.189 
reviews on it so far so I thought why
not<00:00:19.980> do<00:00:20.340> one<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:21.810> recently<00:00:21.990> purchased

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.740 
this about honestly a week ago or so and
I've<00:00:25.080> been<00:00:25.260> trying<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.400> really<00:00:27.359> like

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.599 
I've been trying it and I really like
this<00:00:27.990> product<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.529> think<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:28.890> great

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
this product I think it's great

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.490 
this product I think it's great
I<00:00:29.640> think<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.150> holds<00:00:30.539> down<00:00:30.570> your<00:00:30.869> brows<00:00:31.080> really

I think it holds down your brows really

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.200 
I think it holds down your brows really
nicely<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.130> gives<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> little<00:00:33.059> bit<00:00:33.180> of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
nicely and gives you a little bit of

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.729 
nicely and gives you a little bit of
volume<00:00:33.390> when<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.750> comes<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.020> your<00:00:34.110> eyelashes

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
volume when it comes to your eyelashes

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.080 
volume when it comes to your eyelashes
and<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.340> get<00:00:35.670> how<00:00:36.030> much<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.329> get<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.660> get

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
and you get how much do you get you get

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
0.28 fluid ounces

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.290 
0.28 fluid ounces
I<00:00:40.680> mean<00:00:40.950> that's<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.280> good<00:00:41.489> amount<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:42.000> product

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.810 
I mean that's a good amount of product
right<00:00:42.450> here<00:00:42.510> um<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:44.100> think<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.730> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.410 
because of that then I probably wouldn't
recommend<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:37.619> product<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.090> reason<00:01:39.329> is

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
recommend this product and the reason is

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.700 
recommend this product and the reason is
it<00:01:39.509> because<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.810> doesn't<00:01:40.200> hold<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.560> down<00:01:40.650> for

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
it because it doesn't hold it down for

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.280 
it because it doesn't hold it down for
that<00:01:41.009> long<00:01:41.220> I'm<00:01:41.579> wearing<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.360> today<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
that long I'm wearing it today and the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.810 
that long I'm wearing it today and the
issue<00:01:43.439> with<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.950> eventually

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
issue with this is that eventually

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.389 
issue with this is that eventually
you'll<00:01:45.060> put<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.750> lasts<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.409> about<00:01:46.500> 2-3

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
you'll put it on and lasts for about 2-3

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.980 
you'll put it on and lasts for about 2-3
hours<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.299> sudden<00:01:48.600> then<00:01:48.720> you'll

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
hours and all of a sudden then you'll

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.160 
hours and all of a sudden then you'll
see<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.770> kind<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.250> popping<00:01:50.820> up<00:01:51.170> it

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
see it just kind of popping up it

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.859 
see it just kind of popping up it
doesn't<00:01:52.409> hold<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.070> down<00:01:53.340> as<00:01:53.820> well<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> elf

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
doesn't hold it down as well as the elf

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.569 
doesn't hold it down as well as the elf
one<00:01:55.110> does<00:01:55.290> I'm<00:01:55.530> not<00:01:55.560> comparing<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:56.490> I

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
one does I'm not comparing it but if I

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.569 
one does I'm not comparing it but if I
was<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.360> guess<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.170> kind<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.380> am<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.130> doesn't

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
was I guess I kind of am but it doesn't

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.789 
was I guess I kind of am but it doesn't
hold<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.969> down<00:02:00.210> as<00:02:00.659> well<00:02:01.079> as<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.320> elf<00:02:01.439> one<00:02:01.590> does

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
hold it down as well as the elf one does

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.740 
hold it down as well as the elf one does
it<00:02:02.159> holds<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.490> down<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.180> two<00:02:03.600> three

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
it holds it down for like two three

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.330 
it holds it down for like two three
hours<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.380> then<00:02:04.530> you'll<00:02:04.649> start<00:02:04.860> seeing<00:02:05.130> some

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
hours but then you'll start seeing some

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.800 
hours but then you'll start seeing some
pop<00:02:05.490> up<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.850> kinda<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.180> reapply<00:02:06.570> em

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
pop up and you kinda have to reapply em

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.309

Winco<00:02:12.349> and<00:02:12.530> i<00:02:13.250> believe<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.209> sells<00:02:14.420> for<00:02:14.510> about

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
Winco and i believe it sells for about

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.920 
Winco and i believe it sells for about
$1.99<00:02:15.760> everywhere<00:02:16.760> I'm<00:02:17.030> not<00:02:17.390> quite<00:02:17.599> sure<00:02:17.629> on

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
$1.99 everywhere I'm not quite sure on

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.140 
$1.99 everywhere I'm not quite sure on
that<00:02:17.959> that's<00:02:18.890> what<00:02:19.129> the<00:02:19.220> wind<00:02:19.400> kill<00:02:19.549> price<00:02:19.819> was

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
that that's what the wind kill price was

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.869 
that that's what the wind kill price was
but<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.959> was<00:02:21.079> on<00:02:21.230> sale<00:02:21.530> for<00:02:21.590> 95<00:02:22.340> cents<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:22.819> I

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
but it was on sale for 95 cents so I

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.009 
but it was on sale for 95 cents so I
thought<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.120> should<00:02:23.360> just<00:02:23.390> pick<00:02:23.599> it<00:02:23.720> up<00:02:23.840> and

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
thought I should just pick it up and

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.470 
thought I should just pick it up and
give<00:02:24.319> it<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:24.470> try<00:02:24.709> um<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.459> really<00:02:25.849> like<00:02:25.879> it

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
give it a try um I really like it

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.509 
give it a try um I really like it
on<00:02:26.540> your<00:02:27.170> eyelashes<00:02:27.799> it<00:02:27.890> gives<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.190> quite<00:02:28.459> a

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
on your eyelashes it gives you quite a

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.309 
on your eyelashes it gives you quite a
bit<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:28.790> volume<00:02:28.909> and<00:02:29.390> not<00:02:29.480> too<00:02:29.780> much<00:02:29.989> but<00:02:30.260> it

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
bit of volume and not too much but it

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.699 
bit of volume and not too much but it
gives<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:31.069> good<00:02:31.579> amount<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:32.090> volume<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.900> I

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
gives you a good amount of volume and I

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.580 
gives you a good amount of volume and I
think<00:02:34.129> that<00:02:34.400> it's<00:02:34.730> really<00:02:35.390> affordable<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.200> no

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
think that it's really affordable and no

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.259 
think that it's really affordable and no
you<00:02:36.650> definitely<00:02:37.129> get<00:02:37.190> more<00:02:37.519> on<00:02:37.609> hair<00:02:37.879> than<00:02:38.150> the

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
you definitely get more on hair than the

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.030 
you definitely get more on hair than the
elf<00:02:38.450> one<00:02:38.659> I<00:02:38.810> don't<00:02:38.989> know<00:02:39.109> how<00:02:39.260> much<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.769> in<00:02:39.920> the
