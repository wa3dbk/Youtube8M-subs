00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.270
 and 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.610
 I started from the idea of â€‹â€‹making a 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.080
 show with direct tango material 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.700
 the earth in this dance there and 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.700
 would correspond to give back to 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.030
 is not yet midnight because we 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.060
 it gave us an open title actually 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.950
 with as a pending issue a 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.270
 waiting for something a hope too 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.270
 we liked this idea 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.740
 there is no artistic direction there 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.590
 has no technical direction everything 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.050
 is all together to laugh but not 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.870
 at midnight we already had 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.180
 departure we knew it was going to be a 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.430
 large number of acrobats who would 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.730
 have the rocker that integrates and the 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.250
 acrobatic worn and the lindy of the blow 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.840
 this in the 30s that we also 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.840
 worked pretty much from the start 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.890
 it's a social movement 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.750
 constatives who was born there are more 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.940
 of 30 years in the bronx and that is 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.819
 arrived in France in fact in 84 and I 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.470
 chose the roots in English for 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.849
 referencing makes this crisis on 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.340
 cua and it's true that the title in 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.260
 French the roots it refers to 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.290
 other things to another story 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.549
 so the roots and his flock and that's 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.549
 where we come from 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.660
 in this show I wanted to work 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.520
 with men for mac appears 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.630
 precisely of this energy being said 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.800
 gross for boys and bring them 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.180
 in any case elsewhere 2 the allies in 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.520
 this trip that is mine in this 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.800
 writing who is there who come with 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.800
 them on on this policy there 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.139
 a 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.220
 so 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:01.219
 yeah
