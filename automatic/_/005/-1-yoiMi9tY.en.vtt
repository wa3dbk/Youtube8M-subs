00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
cut differently I may slice some of them

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.539 
cut differently I may slice some of them
these<00:01:09.299> longer<00:01:09.930> peppers<00:01:10.380> what<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.009> do<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.520> just

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
these longer peppers what I do is I just

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.789 
these longer peppers what I do is I just
cut<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> top<00:01:12.360> off<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.170> then<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.560> make<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
cut the top off and then I just make a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.060 
cut the top off and then I just make a
splice<00:01:14.400> down<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> back<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:16.560> that's<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
splice down the back and that's so the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.359 
splice down the back and that's so the
juice<00:01:17.280> will<00:01:17.490> get<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.729> there<00:01:18.950> basically<00:01:19.950> what

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
juice will get in there basically what

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.100 
juice will get in there basically what
