to go outside the wall and adjust the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.890 
to go outside the wall and adjust the
shape<00:00:27.750> see<00:00:28.080> I'm<00:00:28.260> doing<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.830> outside<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> wall

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900

shape see I'm doing the outside the wall
baidu<00:00:30.900> outside<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> corner<00:00:31.650> mine<00:00:31.800> externally

baidu outside the corner mine externally

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.799 
baidu outside the corner mine externally
change<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.700> width<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.180> some<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.480> these<00:00:33.570> walls

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
change the width of some of these walls

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.959 
change the width of some of these walls
which<00:00:33.989> would<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.230> wrong<00:00:34.440> now<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.489> see<00:00:35.820> they're

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
which would be wrong now you see they're

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.819 
which would be wrong now you see they're
inside<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.450> wall<00:00:36.630> now<00:00:36.809> hit<00:00:36.989> escape<00:00:37.230> again<00:00:37.469> and

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
inside the wall now hit escape again and

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.670 
inside the wall now hit escape again and
we<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> properly<00:00:39.059> shaped<00:00:39.329> room<00:00:39.680> now

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
we have a properly shaped room now

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.900 
we have a properly shaped room now
another<00:00:40.890> note<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.309> i<00:00:41.370> should<00:00:41.550> say<00:00:43.399> this<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.610> i

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
another note that i should say this is i

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.760 
another note that i should say this is i
guess<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.690> kind<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.870> old<00:00:46.020> school<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.590> that

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
guess it's kind of old school to do that

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.590 
guess it's kind of old school to do that
because<00:00:46.920> using<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> mouse<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.090> look<00:00:48.450> around

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
because using the mouse to look around

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.479 
because using the mouse to look around
here<00:00:48.899> used<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.559> nightmare<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
here used to be a nightmare with the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.850 
here used to be a nightmare with the
older<00:00:50.760> versions<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.379> you

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
older versions but you can do that you

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.880 
older versions but you can do that you
can<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.340> by<00:00:53.570> holding<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.840> left<00:00:55.050> finding

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
can do that by holding the left finding

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.700 
can do that by holding the left finding
the<00:00:55.980> right<00:00:56.129> mouse<00:00:56.280> button<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.410> dragging<00:00:58.410> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the right mouse button and dragging and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.360 
the right mouse button and dragging and
you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.070> look<00:00:59.190> around<00:01:00.859> but<00:01:01.859> i<00:01:01.890> find<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.190> just

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
you can look around but i find it just

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.190 
you can look around but i find it just
easier<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:03.030> use<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.300> l<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:06.479> look<00:01:07.080> around

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
easier to just use the l and look around

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.590 
easier to just use the l and look around
and<00:01:07.740> also<00:01:07.979> i<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.189> use<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.610> look<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
and also i can use the a to look up and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.190 
and also i can use the a to look up and
the<00:01:10.110> z<00:01:10.350> look<00:01:11.100> down<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.510> strafe<00:01:12.780> using

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the z look down and I can strafe using

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.960 
the z look down and I can strafe using
the<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:15.450> comma<00:01:17.960> ok<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.430> now<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:20.850> a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the the comma ok so now that we have a

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.420 
the the comma ok so now that we have a
room<00:01:21.240> I'll<00:01:21.450> save<00:01:21.659> again<00:01:21.930> let's<00:01:22.920> put<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.250> some

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
room I'll save again let's put in some

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.770 
room I'll save again let's put in some
textures<00:01:23.820> let's<00:01:24.000> make<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.360> look<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.600> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
textures let's make this look like a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.450 
textures let's make this look like a
room<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.229> right<00:01:25.830> now<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.009> still<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.430> our

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
room and right now we still have our

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.300 
room and right now we still have our
tools<00:01:26.880> textures<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.380> want<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> select<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
tools textures and we want to select the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.580 
tools textures and we want to select the
summit<00:01:29.640> something<00:01:30.030> else<00:01:30.180> something<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:31.350> let's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
summit something else something so let's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.200 
summit something else something so let's
make<00:01:31.710> sure<00:01:31.740> everything's<00:01:32.220> deselected<00:01:32.820> escape

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
make sure everything's deselected escape

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.560 
make sure everything's deselected escape
let's<00:01:33.750> go<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.079> our<00:01:34.200> textures<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.979> go<00:01:35.250> to

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
let's go up to our textures and go to

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.690 
let's go up to our textures and go to
locale<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.710> case<00:01:37.920> go<00:01:38.159> back<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.490> all

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
locale and in this case go back to all

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.910 
locale and in this case go back to all
and<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.990> i'm<00:01:40.140> going<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> go<00:01:40.380> my<00:01:40.560> textures

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and now i'm going to go my textures

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.590 
and now i'm going to go my textures
again<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.790> i'm<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> go<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> surface

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
again and i'm going to go to surface

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.499 
again and i'm going to go to surface
type<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.259> select<00:01:43.740> something<00:01:43.979> else<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.509> like

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
type and select something else like like

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.649 
type and select something else like like
concrete<00:01:45.899> that's<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.649> basic<00:01:46.829> decks<00:01:47.159> right

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
concrete that's just a basic decks right

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.999 
concrete that's just a basic decks right
all<00:01:48.659> right<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.140> now<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.290> want<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:49.829> let

all right and now we want to just let

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.340
