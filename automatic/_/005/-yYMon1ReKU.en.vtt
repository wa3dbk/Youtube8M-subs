00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.800
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.630
 today again I grew blah lighting and 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.740
 today tell you how to play 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.590
 soviet prim p 7 level su 122 44 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.619
 the most important feature of this 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.810
 fri from everyone else this is her dynamic by 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.109
 Essentially, this is a pull based on 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.300
 chassis t-44 that gives and really 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.520
 considerable mobility and so let's 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.070
 let's talk about the characteristics of our car 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.739
 and find out its pros and cons stock 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.410
 the strength of our machine is 800 40 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.570
 units in principle this is enough but 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.050
 outstanding indicators call it 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.230
 can't 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.170
 the mass of our tank is 35 tons a 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.960
 engine power as much as 500 horsepower 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.000
 from all this its maximum 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.000
 speed she is forty seven 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.699
 kilometers per hour and the highway turns 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.239
 at a speed of 42 degrees per second in 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.850
 as a result, this Fri-Sau lags behind the t-44 total 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.040
 several kilometers and 2 degrees 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.240
 chassis turning speeds so everyone 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.479
 lovers st 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.880
 this pawn will definitely like the reservation 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.780
 The hull is completely analogous to the fact that 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.830
 is available at t-44 namely 95 millimeters in 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.439
 forehead 75 meters god and 45 millimeters garm 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.750
 but booking it up it has tremendous 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.799
 she has a great advantage 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.200
 sloping armor 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.530
 true they are located only on the frontal 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.720
 part so catch ricochet not penetration 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.299
 or just fillings and caterpillars like 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.130
 absolutely no problem now but this 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.740
 only if you are off balance 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.689
 in the top and if god forbid you file 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.290
 with level nine where can you 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.540
 to throw 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.780
 no corners will help you there 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.630
 go to the main thing our Fri Sau 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.439
 equipped with 122 millimeter guns 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.780
 which gives an average damage around 390 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.850
 units and our recharge rate 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.560
 the formidable weapon is 6.75 seconds 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.130
 the real cons of this weapon is his 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.830
 which takes three seconds and 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.500
 reset which is 0 41 per 100 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.510
 meters but for accuracy I would be too 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.790
 she certainly did not complain 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.740
 the ideal is the remote from not at all 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.800
 that side but this example shows 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:29.030
 that you can even get into a very tiny 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.950
 The object range of the review of this n is 330 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.640
 meters this is not the most outstanding 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.920
 indicator but similar has su-152 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.000
 well, the last is the range 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.300
 radio stations 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.310
 it is 700 meters so from just 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.820
 of the above we get 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.250
 just a great note on the subject 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.520
 that she just accept it gives the opportunity 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.650
 you farm farm and farm even if 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.140
 you merged like a frank moss you all 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.930
 equals go away plus repair 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.380
 completely destroyed TCP is 7 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.450
 thousand silver is pt universal and on 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.450
 you can play it any way you want 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.940
 if you like real style bydto 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.220
 be the first to take your bush and stay in 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.620
 his health is very low profile 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.740
 good masking and considerable one-time 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.170
 the damage gives it quite well to do it and by 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.300
 the truth is good since in battle 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.970
 against the ninth level you better not 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.090
 it is worth hanging out but if you hit 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.180
 in the top of what you can also easily become impudent 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.580
 but moderately by itself since all your 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.830
 specifications really 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.040
 shout about not just any 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.920
 mediocre Fri-Sau and you are a real middle 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.170
 tank only without a tower and distinctly 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.020
 understanding your weaknesses you can 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.130
 go ahead and demolish almost anyone on 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.410
 your way 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.240
 okay now let's talk about 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.360
 what equipment and what equipment 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.950
 we need in terms of equipment I would 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.900
 recommended you put in first 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.850
 queue rammer reinforced drives 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.440
 pickup because we do not leveling 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.930
 very fast and third module 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.180
 enlightened q but guys is all for 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.370
 more or less active style of play 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.560
 if you like to sit in the bushes then 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.710
 rammer camouflage net and horns 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.470
 will become your best friends 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.720
 in other words as you like best 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.330
 play well and need to pick your 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.670
 equipment for us all 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.550
 more than standard repair kit 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.740
 first aid kit and fire extinguisher although I dare 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.230
 note that our torture burns pretty 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.460
 rarely and fire extinguisher places can 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.500
 put doppake 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.440
 or twisted speed controller 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.150
 motor whole i think as seen from 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.340
 of this fight we can really 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.590
 heat this fri and especially these 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.830
 moments only confirm 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.980
 su 122 44 truth to me even 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.320
 like more than E25, still a one-off 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.410
 300 damage is much nicer than 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.270
 pick an opponent for 150 and now how 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.420
 Once there will be a moment where I show that 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.790
 need to do with all sorts of arrogant e25 by 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.670
 Essentially, I have half HP and he has half a hoop. 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.460
 but I make the first shot and quite a bit 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.650
 almost missing him to explode this 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.520
 arrogant lad tries to swirl me but 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.830
 I'm not t95 and I am based on t-44 and 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.830
 so he can't do it 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.960
 makes two more nasty breakthroughs and 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.990
 dying and in this fight it was mine 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.420
 the last victim of the enemy remained 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.610
 alive the last two Fri-shke is 7 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.830
 but I do not have time to them so let's 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.740
 sum up so the real advantages 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.670
 of our tank high mobility big 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.310
 one-time damage 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:43.330
 excellent armor slope thick 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.160
 gun mask low silhouette and high dpc 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.290
 minus the same can be attributed debt and 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.890
 mixing and not perfect accuracy 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.810
 in fact this is all with you was Yaroslav blah

 Dear friends
