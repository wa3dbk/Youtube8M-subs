different versions that's right I mean

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.600 
different versions that's right I mean
it's<00:00:35.379> a<00:00:35.440> camera<00:00:35.800> but<00:00:35.949> it's<00:00:36.070> also<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.430> same

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
it's a camera but it's also the same

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.700 
it's a camera but it's also the same
size<00:00:36.850> of<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.030> tennis<00:00:37.390> ball<00:00:37.690> so<00:00:37.989> you<00:00:38.500> know<00:00:38.589> if

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
size of the tennis ball so you know if

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.619 
size of the tennis ball so you know if
you<00:00:39.100> want<00:00:39.250> to<00:00:39.280> use<00:00:39.399> as<00:00:39.519> a<00:00:39.579> camera<00:00:39.850> we<00:00:39.970> can<00:00:40.120> we

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
you want to use as a camera we can we

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.299 
you want to use as a camera we can we
can<00:00:40.809> get<00:00:41.110> our<00:00:41.199> bats<00:00:41.409> and<00:00:41.710> go<00:00:41.949> another<00:00:42.100> game<00:00:42.250> a

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
can get our bats and go another game a

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.090 
can get our bats and go another game a
tennis<00:00:42.519> with<00:00:42.699> it<00:00:42.790> I<00:00:43.449> think<00:00:43.989> that<00:00:44.140> the<00:00:44.800> first

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
tennis with it I think that the first

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.380 
tennis with it I think that the first
thing<00:00:45.250> which<00:00:45.370> is<00:00:45.519> striking<00:00:46.030> about<00:00:46.089> this

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
camera is just the sheer size of it

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.009 
camera is just the sheer size of it

basically 13 stops of dynamic range in
that<00:01:08.979> camera<00:01:09.189> what<00:01:09.880> we've<00:01:10.030> done<00:01:10.180> is<00:01:10.299> we've

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
that camera what we've done is we've

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.510 
that camera what we've done is we've
ported<00:01:10.900> that<00:01:11.020> across<00:01:11.259> into<00:01:11.829> this<00:01:11.950> little<00:01:12.310> boy

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
ported that across into this little boy

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.910 
ported that across into this little boy
and<00:01:12.750> we've<00:01:13.750> put<00:01:13.930> an<00:01:14.020> SD<00:01:14.140> card<00:01:14.290> slot<00:01:14.590> on<00:01:14.829> the

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
and we've put an SD card slot on the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.010 
and we've put an SD card slot on the
side<00:01:15.240> which<00:01:16.240> means<00:01:16.390> that<00:01:16.540> you<00:01:16.630> can<00:01:16.780> record

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
side which means that you can record

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.980 
side which means that you can record
basically<00:01:17.380> 1080p<00:01:18.189> either<00:01:19.119> in<00:01:19.329> Pro<00:01:19.479> res<00:01:19.689> or<00:01:19.840> an

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
basically 1080p either in Pro res or an

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.200 
basically 1080p either in Pro res or an
draw<00:01:20.170> directly<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:20.920> that<00:01:21.070> SD<00:01:21.369> card<00:01:21.579> and<00:01:22.000> what

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
draw directly to that SD card and what

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.390 
draw directly to that SD card and what
sort<00:01:22.390> of<00:01:22.420> frame<00:01:22.570> rates<00:01:22.780> so<00:01:23.380> this<00:01:23.710> will<00:01:23.890> do<00:01:24.040> up

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
sort of frame rates so this will do up

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.420 
sort of frame rates so this will do up
to<00:01:24.670> 60<00:01:25.450> frames<00:01:25.570> per<00:01:25.780> second<00:01:26.170> that's<00:01:27.159> going<00:01:27.370> to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
to 60 frames per second that's going to

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.580 
to 60 frames per second that's going to
be<00:01:27.550> basically<00:01:28.210> is<00:01:28.390> going<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.080> be<00:01:29.170> rolling

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
be basically is going to be rolling

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
be basically is going to be rolling
shutter<00:01:30.510> you've<00:01:31.510> also<00:01:31.690> got<00:01:32.020> on<00:01:32.140> there<00:01:32.350> as<00:01:32.470> well

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
shutter you've also got on there as well

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.399 
shutter you've also got on there as well
things<00:01:33.610> like<00:01:33.729> HDMI<00:01:34.180> output<00:01:34.600> on<00:01:34.780> there<00:01:35.080> too<00:01:35.260> if

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
things like HDMI output on there too if

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.620 
things like HDMI output on there too if
you<00:01:35.500> want<00:01:35.620> actually<00:01:35.710> play<00:01:36.190> video<00:01:36.549> out<00:01:36.729> out<00:01:37.330> out

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
you want actually play video out out out

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.600 
you want actually play video out out out
of<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.960> camera<00:01:38.260> and<00:01:38.860> on<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.100> side<00:01:39.280> here<00:01:39.520> this

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
of the camera and on the side here this

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.830 
of the camera and on the side here this
is<00:01:39.760> this<00:01:39.909> is<00:01:40.030> something<00:01:40.270> which<00:01:40.360> is<00:01:40.450> quite<00:01:40.630> cool

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
is this is something which is quite cool

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.870 
is this is something which is quite cool
and<00:01:40.990> quite<00:01:41.140> unique<00:01:41.500> we<00:01:41.770> we<00:01:42.400> were<00:01:42.490> looking<00:01:42.760> at<00:01:42.850> a

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
and quite unique we we were looking at a

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.219 
and quite unique we we were looking at a
way<00:01:43.030> in<00:01:43.150> which<00:01:43.180> are<00:01:43.420> controlling<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.080> camera

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
way in which are controlling the camera

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.469 
way in which are controlling the camera
without<00:01:45.100> necessarily<00:01:45.820> having<00:01:46.120> to<00:01:46.210> have<00:01:46.450> that

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
without necessarily having to have that

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.070 
without necessarily having to have that
hands-on<00:01:47.049> so<00:01:47.740> we<00:01:48.130> put<00:01:48.580> this<00:01:48.670> 15<00:01:49.090> pin<00:01:49.330> expansion

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
hands-on so we put this 15 pin expansion

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.899 
hands-on so we put this 15 pin expansion
port<00:01:50.290> on<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.500> side<00:01:50.650> which<00:01:50.920> connects<00:01:51.310> via<00:01:51.610> s

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
port on the side which connects via s

cameras<00:01:59.229> up<00:01:59.320> in<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.530> air<00:01:59.680> basically<00:02:00.430> wants<00:02:00.640> to

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
cameras up in the air basically wants to

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.100 
cameras up in the air basically wants to
have<00:02:00.820> functionality<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.600> that<00:02:01.630> camera

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
have functionality of that camera

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.690 
have functionality of that camera
without<00:02:02.229> having<00:02:02.680> to<00:02:02.830> bring<00:02:03.189> the<00:02:03.310> drone<00:02:03.520> down

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
without having to bring the drone down

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.500 
without having to bring the drone down
and<00:02:04.000> reset<00:02:04.299> it

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
and reset it

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.440 
and reset it
so<00:02:05.110> with<00:02:05.500> PWM<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.400> get<00:02:06.610> around<00:02:06.820> about<00:02:07.060> four

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
so with PWM you get around about four

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.109 
so with PWM you get around about four
channels<00:02:07.840> which<00:02:08.170> means<00:02:08.379> you<00:02:08.470> can<00:02:08.619> connect

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
channels which means you can connect

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.699 
channels which means you can connect
you<00:02:09.299> can<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:09.989> actually<00:02:10.049> operate<00:02:10.379> for

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
you can you can actually operate for

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.380 
you can you can actually operate for
different<00:02:10.950> functions<00:02:11.069> but<00:02:11.549> with<00:02:11.940> s<00:02:12.030> Pradas<00:02:12.330> I

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
different functions but with s Pradas I

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.530 
different functions but with s Pradas I
think<00:02:12.540> it's<00:02:12.659> around<00:02:13.080> about<00:02:13.379> 18<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:15.030> all<00:02:15.330> the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
think it's around about 18 so all the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.539 
think it's around about 18 so all the
functionality<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.230> camera<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.890> all

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
functionality of that camera is all

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.270 
functionality of that camera is all
controllable<00:02:18.000> from<00:02:18.569> basically<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.530> distance

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
controllable from basically a distance

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.190 
controllable from basically a distance
okay<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.209> how<00:02:21.269> does<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.510> how<00:02:21.750> does<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.900> powerup

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
okay and how does it how does a powerup

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.630 
okay and how does it how does a powerup
what's<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.620> bet<00:02:22.769> what<00:02:22.920> sort<00:02:23.129> of<00:02:23.159> a<00:02:23.280> trees<00:02:23.519> it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
what's the bet what sort of a trees it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.789 
what's the bet what sort of a trees it
uses<00:02:23.940> an<00:02:24.030> internal<00:02:24.330> removable<00:02:24.989> yes<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.379> the

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
uses an internal removable yes so the

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:26.869 
uses an internal removable yes so the
great<00:02:25.980> thing<00:02:26.159> again<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:26.549> we've<00:02:26.700> bought

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
great thing again is that we've bought

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.100 
great thing again is that we've bought
an<00:02:26.970> external<00:02:27.329> battery<00:02:27.390> on<00:02:27.690> there<00:02:27.840> as<00:02:27.959> well

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
an external battery on there as well

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.380 
an external battery on there as well
which<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.290> canon<00:02:28.709> e6<00:02:29.129> so<00:02:29.790> anybody<00:02:30.180> who's

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
which is canon e6 so anybody who's

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.509 
which is canon e6 so anybody who's
working<00:02:30.599> with<00:02:30.750> typical<00:02:31.140> Canon<00:02:31.319> Canon<00:02:31.709> Canon

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
working with typical Canon Canon Canon

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.490 
working with typical Canon Canon Canon
cameras<00:02:32.970> will<00:02:33.180> know<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.349> is

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
cameras will know that that that is

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.930 
cameras will know that that that is
quite<00:02:34.620> familiar<00:02:34.829> I<00:02:35.220> think<00:02:35.549> they're<00:02:35.640> around

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
quite familiar I think they're around

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.119 
quite familiar I think they're around
about<00:02:36.329> $50<00:02:37.049> something<00:02:37.470> around<00:02:37.650> about<00:02:37.980> that

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
about $50 something around about that

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.100 
about $50 something around about that
amount<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:39.060> that'll<00:02:39.269> power<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.659> for<00:02:39.870> between

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
amount and that'll power it for between

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.900 
amount and that'll power it for between
an<00:02:40.440> hour<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.650> an<00:02:40.739> hour<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> half<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:41.790> was

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
an hour and an hour and a half so was

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.759 
an hour and an hour and a half so was
this<00:02:42.000> designed<00:02:42.420> by<00:02:42.569> Blackmagic<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.470> maybe

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
this designed by Blackmagic to maybe

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.400 
this designed by Blackmagic to maybe
replace<00:02:44.609> sort<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.209> existing<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:46.170> know<00:02:46.260> what

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
replace sort of existing you know what

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.259 
replace sort of existing you know what
you'd<00:02:46.560> use<00:02:46.709> for<00:02:46.739> for<00:02:47.310> an<00:02:47.370> action<00:02:47.640> cam<00:02:47.879> was<00:02:48.150> it

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
you'd use for for an action cam was it

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.089 
you'd use for for an action cam was it
more<00:02:48.420> designed<00:02:48.780> for<00:02:49.049> drones<00:02:49.379> and<00:02:49.680> gimble's

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
more designed for drones and gimble's

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.650 
more designed for drones and gimble's
what's<00:02:50.430> what's<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.060> design<00:02:51.299> reasoning

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
what's what's the design reasoning

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.720 
what's what's the design reasoning
behind<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:52.049> I<00:02:52.200> think<00:02:52.650> all<00:02:52.829> of<00:02:52.859> those<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.609> know

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
behind it I think all of those you know

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.160 
behind it I think all of those you know
I<00:02:53.760> think<00:02:53.879> that<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.420> know<00:02:54.510> when<00:02:54.659> you<00:02:54.780> start<00:02:55.019> to

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
I think that you know when you start to

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.690 
I think that you know when you start to
look<00:02:55.260> at<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:55.500> pocket<00:02:55.709> Cinema<00:02:56.069> Camera<00:02:56.099> which

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
look at the pocket Cinema Camera which

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.099 
look at the pocket Cinema Camera which
we<00:02:56.940> obviously<00:02:57.269> have<00:02:57.540> had<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:57.690> for<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.840> couple<00:02:57.959> of

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
we obviously have had it for a couple of

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.020 
we obviously have had it for a couple of
years<00:02:58.260> now<00:02:58.379> people<00:02:59.370> were<00:02:59.459> using<00:02:59.670> those<00:02:59.879> in

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
years now people were using those in

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.309 
years now people were using those in
lots<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.299> different<00:03:00.359> environments<00:03:01.140> they<00:03:01.260> were

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
lots of different environments they were

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.289 
lots of different environments they were
strapping<00:03:02.040> into<00:03:02.190> people's<00:03:02.459> arms<00:03:03.000> they<00:03:03.180> were

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
strapping into people's arms they were

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.849 
strapping into people's arms they were
strapping<00:03:03.659> them<00:03:03.720> on<00:03:03.870> people's<00:03:04.140> helmets<00:03:04.560> they

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
strapping them on people's helmets they

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.470 
strapping them on people's helmets they
were<00:03:04.980> putting<00:03:05.459> them<00:03:05.549> in<00:03:05.670> cars<00:03:05.909> they<00:03:06.420> were

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
were putting them in cars they were

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.569 
were putting them in cars they were
flying<00:03:06.900> him<00:03:07.079> in<00:03:07.170> drones<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.739> I<00:03:08.250> think<00:03:08.430> that

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
flying him in drones and I think that

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.220 
flying him in drones and I think that
one<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.030> challenges<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.629> had<00:03:09.900> was

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
one of the challenges that you had was

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.619 
one of the challenges that you had was
you<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.700> had<00:03:11.849> to<00:03:11.879> look<00:03:12.090> at<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.299> screen<00:03:12.599> on

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
you you had to look at that screen on

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.690 
you you had to look at that screen on
the<00:03:12.840> back<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.769> determine<00:03:14.280> whether<00:03:14.489> or<00:03:14.549> not

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
the back to determine whether or not

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.670 
the back to determine whether or not
everything<00:03:15.120> was<00:03:15.209> ready<00:03:15.389> to<00:03:15.540> go<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.870> then<00:03:16.530> when

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
everything was ready to go and then when

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.360 
everything was ready to go and then when
you<00:03:16.769> hit<00:03:16.919> record<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:18.329> had<00:03:18.480> no<00:03:18.750> real<00:03:18.989> visual

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
you hit record you had no real visual

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.140 
you hit record you had no real visual
representation<00:03:20.370> there<00:03:20.549> other<00:03:20.700> than<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.000> back

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
representation there other than the back

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.610 
representation there other than the back
screens<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.690> whether<00:03:21.870> or<00:03:21.930> not<00:03:22.109> it<00:03:22.319> was<00:03:22.380> being

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
screens the whether or not it was being

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.369 
screens the whether or not it was being
recorded<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.419> when<00:03:24.419> you<00:03:24.569> then<00:03:24.810> mounted<00:03:25.260> these

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
recorded and when you then mounted these
