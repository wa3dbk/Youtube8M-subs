in here and it in here and this part
close<00:00:36.280> so<00:00:36.670> that<00:00:37.170> enters<00:00:38.170> this<00:00:38.530> hole<00:00:38.860> in<00:00:39.220> here

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
close so that enters this hole in here

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:47.450 
close so that enters this hole in here
and<00:00:40.149> in<00:00:40.720> that<00:00:40.960> area<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:43.450> here<00:00:44.310> very<00:00:45.310> similar

also in tap area in here and then his

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.930 
also in tap area in here and then his
inside<00:01:20.080> are<00:01:20.320> there<00:01:21.240> because<00:01:22.240> this<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:26.080> is<00:01:26.229> so

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940

so thick joint and pin can be clean also

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.120 
so thick joint and pin can be clean also
that<00:01:33.850> fault

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
that fault

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.570 
that fault
Wow<00:01:36.130> which<00:01:36.370> one<00:01:36.400> and<00:01:37.030> then<00:01:37.510> I<00:01:37.690> recommend<00:01:38.580> that

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
Wow which one and then I recommend that

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.020 
Wow which one and then I recommend that
we<00:01:39.820> use<00:01:40.120> in<00:01:40.420> here<00:01:40.690> little<00:01:41.290> bit<00:01:41.440> oil<00:01:42.030> because

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
we use in here little bit oil because

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.140 
we use in here little bit oil because
oil<00:01:43.240> makes<00:01:43.690> this<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:45.159> part<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:46.030> move<00:01:46.299> easier

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
oil makes this this part to move easier

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.719 
oil makes this this part to move easier
the<00:01:49.150> patrol<00:01:49.540> enter<00:01:49.990> inside<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:52.290> there<00:01:53.290> is<00:01:53.409> no

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the patrol enter inside and there is no

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.219 
the patrol enter inside and there is no
not<00:01:54.729> then<00:01:55.500> there's<00:01:56.500> all<00:01:56.740> much<00:01:57.010> this<00:01:57.220> friction

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
not then there's all much this friction

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.969 
not then there's all much this friction
okay<00:01:59.229> then<00:01:59.530> are<00:01:59.710> inserted<00:02:00.460> here

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
okay then are inserted here

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.859 
okay then are inserted here
this<00:02:02.979> way<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.640> can<00:02:04.240> play<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:05.340> login<00:02:06.340> in<00:02:06.729> here<00:02:07.210> that

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
this way I can play a login in here that

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.910 
this way I can play a login in here that
I<00:02:08.250> forget<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.459> business<00:02:10.260> just<00:02:11.260> metallic

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
point what is in here and then I target

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:28.130 
point what is in here and then I target
this<00:02:16.629> hole<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.819> then<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.540> little<00:02:19.930> bit

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.310

then I need to buy her Martha bartender
in<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.630> end<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:45.340> little<00:02:46.030> bit<00:02:46.180> huh<00:02:46.330> Murray<00:02:46.530> then

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
in the end so little bit huh Murray then

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.380 
in the end so little bit huh Murray then
then<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:49.090> clean<00:02:49.600> them<00:02:49.870> again<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.920> then<00:02:51.880> we<00:02:52.120> have

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
then I clean them again and then we have

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.190 
then I clean them again and then we have
interesting<00:02:53.080> thing<00:02:53.350> I<00:02:53.590> clean<00:02:54.340> this<00:02:54.520> fault

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
interesting thing I clean this fault

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.510 
interesting thing I clean this fault
because<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.710> fault<00:02:57.460> is<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:59.110> one<00:02:59.320> I<00:02:59.740> think

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
because this fault is the one I think

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.260 
because this fault is the one I think
that<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.240> most<00:03:01.690> stick<00:03:02.320> test<00:03:02.700> part<00:03:03.700> in<00:03:04.000> this

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
that the most stick test part in this

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.980 
that the most stick test part in this
ends<00:03:04.600> in<00:03:04.810> this<00:03:05.500> port<00:03:05.860> I<00:03:06.160> will<00:03:06.910> take<00:03:07.180> then<00:03:07.480> solve

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
ends in this port I will take then solve

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.210 
ends in this port I will take then solve
this<00:03:08.580> fault

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.400 

something<00:03:12.910> like<00:03:14.760> 140<00:03:15.840> morbidity<00:03:16.840> due<00:03:17.170> to

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
something like 140 morbidity due to

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.720 
something like 140 morbidity due to
metal<00:03:17.860> spores<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:19.210> this<00:03:19.450> is<00:03:19.570> huge<00:03:19.930> amount

pores in that bowl and let's see when I

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.060 
pores in that bowl and let's see when I
take<00:03:25.450> my<00:03:26.010> moment<00:03:27.100> tool<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:27.940> clean<00:03:28.270> this

that has happened okay likely knows

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:46.220 
that has happened okay likely knows
these<00:03:38.740> pots<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:44.080> next<00:03:45.070> I<00:03:45.220> take<00:03:45.460> my<00:03:45.730> tool

piety an other way is that if this this

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.460 
piety an other way is that if this this
part<00:05:46.729> is<00:05:46.970> in<00:05:47.210> engine<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:48.110> you<00:05:48.259> have

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
part is in engine and you have

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.689 
part is in engine and you have
transmission<00:05:49.280> we<00:05:50.000> insert<00:05:50.599> gear<00:05:51.229> to<00:05:51.710> bond<00:05:51.919> and

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
transmission we insert gear to bond and

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.210 
transmission we insert gear to bond and
then<00:05:53.150> there<00:05:53.449> is<00:05:53.569> this<00:05:53.750> friction<00:05:54.289> but<00:05:54.500> now<00:05:54.740> and

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
then there is this friction but now and

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.689 
then there is this friction but now and
I<00:05:55.400> told<00:05:55.759> help<00:05:56.000> this<00:05:56.440> transmission<00:05:57.440> I<00:05:57.680> need<00:05:58.520> to

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
I told help this transmission I need to

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.350 
I told help this transmission I need to
lock<00:05:58.819> this<00:05:58.880> fly<00:05:59.720> ok<00:06:00.560> and<00:06:00.710> next<00:06:00.830> I<00:06:01.159> need<00:06:01.220> to<00:06:01.430> use
