00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 ai ai ai people that the twenty-first century and I 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.480
 I came back to tell you that you 've arrived. 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.400
 to me this week I read that not 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.500
 Nothing arrived, I did not receive anything from 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.389
 partnership, I did not buy anything either. 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.880
 I'm very busy, full of service 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.980
 so I treat me slowly I'm 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.570
 reading leftovers about site reviews 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.410
 that you have to do three every two 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.180
 weeks 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.410
 however, beyond that alone the reading 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.699
 It's very slow. 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.869
 I think this year will be much more 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.429
 slowly than last year 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.599
 get 110 pounds 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.180
 I think if I do not even come close 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.620
 This goal is really slow and I 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.440
 I know I'm going to have full service. 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.030
 so still good but anyway it's because of this 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.059
 is slower and handled more did not have 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.590
 this week lesson book the review for 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.670
 you on Saturdays and have already seen that I 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.730
 I really liked it because of that click. 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.190
 here and there is no one is a trilogy 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.370
 she has already released released this first and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.530
 released a second name August 31st of the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.770
 last year and the third has not yet 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.300
 title or date for release is I 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.260
 I loved the copy of the recording of the band 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.510
 wide're 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.610
 despite this leave free sheet thousand 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.250
 leaf painting left free half crooked 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.570
 and I think that in time it will come out 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.240
 I knew how to show the climate that the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.880
 author tries to pass the book is that 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.060
 the one who trains gloomy from the tales of 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.210
 channel tip is never one is with this body 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.329
 here it is because of the poem of educampo o 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.670
 crow never more more than the body 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.810
 repeatedly says never again during the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.829
 poem and I found it as soon as they 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.110
 tried to pass all this has become 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.390
 text but she could not 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.119
 jumping the main character does not 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.009
 convinced isabel I found xata xerÃ©m 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.640
 animated sun 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.560
 anyway she is she presents a series of 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.250
 possibilities does not develop 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.700
 no good characters can not 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.180
 gain pace and can not talk 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.369
 with us the author is consciously 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.730
 leaves them erased on Isabel's account 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.710
 which is very egocentric to the bar where 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.570
 O 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.160
 this is where the main character is 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.690
 a little short of what I expected until 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.980
 I hoped he would shine a little 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.470
 more than it shines 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.210
 I do not like it very much, it's not stored that 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.640
 expected much thought it was a pain to 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.550
 cost of the book's five stars and I 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.630
 was poorly book to read is I 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.420
 I finished reading 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.090
 the complete superintendent for you 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.230
 well as passing the eye on some 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.650
 parties are disgusted the same with the 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.650
 reading is but where the two stars the 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.230
 that you have in mind that I am 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.150
 tired of the young adult natural book 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.180
 so if you 're in that same footprint 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.030
 that I may be on account of this not having 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.640
 liked both beauty she starts the book 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.530
 well counting there what can have 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.470
 happened which may have resulted in 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.690
 edgar allan poe's death begins in rhythm 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.880
 super cool, the book pops right there 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.730
 then it really isobel I really 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.340
 completely lost in situations're it 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.630
 make friends she says make friends with 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.690
 very fast 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.130
 the character is maturing in not 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.590
 it's a gradual thing 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.480
 you do not feel a fluency in the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.110
 maturing the protagonist does not 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.290
 It's cool 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.270
 It's okay, it 's a show I started and that 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.820
 I can assure you that I do not 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.340
 I'm going to continue this is a book. 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.500
 reading a book also diagrammed to 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.200
 pandora had a job map of the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.100
 wonderful work of publishing this 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.470
 book is 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.930
 it's all sheik has illustrations of 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.180
 pages to give the same climate I 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.280
 I looked at the American cover and the cover on it. 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.430
 portuguese of d10 of the mexican capital 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.370
 search and if they want google gives 10 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:59.060
 even ends up Brazilian but so the text 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.940
 does not reflect the cover and the graphic 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.440
 translation and revision 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.980
 they are very good beauty 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.080
 so I 'm not reading yet but I 'm going 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.430
 start reading your book very quickly and 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.260
 if I should read this weekend 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.120
 recording on Saturday I think even 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.820

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.420

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.669
 Can I point out to you that we are one? 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.370

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.960
 seat of the black dagger brotherhood time 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.300

 There's a lot, I'm talking about this. 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.870
 new erotic footprint is like this 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.910
 masochistic mastery relationship 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.410
 Beauty said that I 'm talking I'm 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.350
 trying to find the book interesting 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.199
 I can tell you 50 shades of 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.940
 gray did not get it yet I already know the whole 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.770
 the story I already know which is the premise which 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.100
 the development was pm several schools 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.500
 I do not care, I already read some 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.610
 which I hated completely was the case of 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.500
