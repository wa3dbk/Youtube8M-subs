00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.590
 the possessions the hague anp rijswijk still merge so nicely but you will 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.600
 of course you will have better drivers that world 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.549
 have to send 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.289
 therefore, thereby helping what a driving test adjusted it is not 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.650
 harder it does not get easy huh but on the other hand I am becoming 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.909
 less relying on details looking for technician operations 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:31.289
 incident assessment as mentioned in the cbr, but much more in line with that 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.739
 the practices pay more attention to in sight pay more attention to the overall we 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.420
 the board of directors will therefore get more independent driving 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.420
 overall assessment than it is now 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.260
 if you would take the field exam, you could judge it a bit more 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.430
 has that ever spoken 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.430
 if you are here in Brussels 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.570
 qantas 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.170
 cyclists 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.160
 pedestrians a traffic light 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.720
 although we all do that 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.720
 That has 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.970
 plays money that has excellent traffic insight 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.640
 the cbr has briefly changed the practical exam on five main points 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.640
 what you are about to go into points much deeper 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.520
 the self-employed drive the candidate must be self-employed 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.340
 can drive from a to b but that can be done in three ways or he gets from the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.350
 examiner a certain point on no but because he gets a certain point 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.070
 route on 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.120
 whether to use the navigation system 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.990
 it is not so much a question of whether he indeed reaches the end point where it 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.990
 is whether that topic is his attention 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.940
 the anp 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.669
 for labor market 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.059
 new orleans 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.059
 from 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.330
 the second hazard recognition 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.930
 the formula is part of the practical exam but it is expanded 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.930
 the endstra were Thursday 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.049
 where about two hundred carp are welcome 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:53.849
 because the 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.009
 lots of fun different cares 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.009
 road users 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.469
 because they are there 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.469
 boom 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.499
 to the editors donk 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:13.449
 up to 3 special transactions 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:17.399
 the candidate is given a clear assignment sleeping place eleventh place 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:21.749
 at the moment but that should happen for example turning the car or a 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:22.499
 do groceries 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.499
 few times as close as possible to the supermarket 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.060
 environmentally conscious driving 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.089
 the new drive ie that safe and energetic proof enough 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:57.189
 for example with the demolition 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.189
 consistently high score 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.180
 finally 5 offers self-reflection 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.290
 this man in his own strength is the weaknesses 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.900
 the examiners will try during the 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.970
 Checking out if someone is aware was a limitation in it 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.530
 traffic 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.969
 how do you find yourself to be 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:34.969
 but 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:38.110
 you can be yourself 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.979
 well these were the most important changes in a row 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.120
 self-employed people drive hazard perception another way of special 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.059
 transactions 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:51.219
 environmentally conscious driving and self-reflection, it sounds quite logical in itself 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:55.059
 perhaps even simply late listening is that theo from reiki about to say 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.979
 yk
