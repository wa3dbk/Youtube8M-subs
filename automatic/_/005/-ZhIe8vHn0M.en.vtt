00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.230
I'm mechanized...just look at me.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.290
Without masked eyes

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:19.150
I look at you, you could do all I couldn't do, my son.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.240
So you're a Jedi now...for both of us...

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.090
you're a Jedi now.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.140
I've heard it said lightsabers are for killing Sith.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.250
I guess that's true.  They bring the light side to our land.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:01.270
But you're my dad, and you have taught me how to fight by fighting me

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.210
and by chopping off my hand.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.060
Well I don't know if my dad loves me now,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.200
but I know I'm who I am today because I dueled you.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.220
Like an X-Wing shoots the Death Star with proton torpedoes.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.170
Like Stormtroopers shoot at Rebels, but they can't hit Ewoks.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.140
Who can say if I am really a Jedi?

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.010
But because I dueled you...

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.100
I was with lightning shocked.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.090
Now I can see my son with my human eyes,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.220
but I can't breathe.  So, here's some wisdom I'll impart:

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:04.220
So much of me is made from wires and circuits, you'll have to see:

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.060
Choose Home DepotÂ© for spare parts.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.260
Now as I lie here on this cold floor,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.050
I can say I am so proud of you, for ev'ning the score.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.080
Like a Jawa only sells droids on Desert Tatooine.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.100
Like plot details I should not know down in Endor's woods.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.200
Who can say if I've been changed to the light side?

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.290
But because I dueled you...

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.050
Because I dueled you...

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.110
I will be dead for good/

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.110
You will be dead for good.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:53.130
Now let me take a breath, I ask forgiveness for those people that I choked to death.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.230
But then I guess we know there's blame to share.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.270
Wait a minute, no there isn't.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.270
That was me/

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.270
That was you.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.270
Like a Jawa only sells droids on Desert Tatooine/

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.270
Like an X-Wing shoots the Death Star with proton torpedoes.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.130
Like plot details I should not know down in Endor's woods/

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.130
Like how Ewoks eat us and live in Endor's woods.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.200
Who can say if you are really a Jedi?/ 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.200
Who can say if I am really a Jedi? 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.000
I do believe I have been changed to the light side/

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.000
I do believe you have been changed to the light side.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.250
But because I dueled you...

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.190
Because I dueled you...

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.090
Because I dueled you...

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.070
I will be dead.../

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.070
You will be dead...

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.230
for good.
