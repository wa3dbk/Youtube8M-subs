00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.790
 forever 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.980
 in short 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.530
 flipping through 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.530
 nechaev

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.830
 that is, if 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.830
 turned over 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.020
 continues 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.390
 such cases 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.930
 flipping through 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.990
 stasov see just 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.190

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.190
 So iphone 4 h became what get into the hall 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.970

 he could remember 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.159
 remember 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.419
 our goal is back 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.059
 earlier 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:15.959
 ignoring arad 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.959
 we are not 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.489
 but if after midnight 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.289
 application form 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.319

 m 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:22.229

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.259
 x 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:42.029
 2 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:54.159
 that is why such an opportunity was 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.589
 virtually identical 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:59.459

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.270
 apparently these functions 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.879
 all left 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.110
 in the background twice 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.669
