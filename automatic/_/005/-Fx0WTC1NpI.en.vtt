them on large dogs and it's not because

it's<00:02:05.220> just<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.640> large<00:02:05.910> dog<00:02:06.180> owners<00:02:06.540> tend<00:02:06.840> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
it's just that large dog owners tend to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.080 
it's just that large dog owners tend to
have<00:02:07.050> more<00:02:07.380> responsibility<00:02:08.130> feeling<00:02:08.940> that

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
rather than a small dog you just simply

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.270 
rather than a small dog you just simply
put<00:02:15.150> on<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> flexi<00:02:15.810> most<00:02:16.410> people<00:02:16.710> do<00:02:16.860> because

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
put on a flexi most people do because

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.130 
put on a flexi most people do because
they<00:02:17.910> think<00:02:17.940> it's<00:02:18.270> not<00:02:18.360> going<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.600> harm<00:02:18.720> anyone

they think it's not going to harm anyone
or<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:19.950> fact<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.400> think<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.790> walking<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.840> dog

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990

or in fact I think that walking a dog
beside<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.680> there's<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.550> great<00:02:23.730> bond<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.420> you

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
beside you there's a great bond and you

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.540 
beside you there's a great bond and you

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550

chest is this encourages a dog to pull
that<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:03.870> why<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.050> halter<00:03:04.500> allows<00:03:05.130> dogs<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.670> pull

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
that is why a halter allows dogs to pull

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.670 
that is why a halter allows dogs to pull
and<00:03:06.060> they<00:03:06.120> feel<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.450> need<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.720> pull<00:03:06.930> if<00:03:07.440> you

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
and they feel the need to pull if you

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.229 
and they feel the need to pull if you
feel<00:03:07.920> pressure<00:03:08.130> on<00:03:08.370> your<00:03:08.610> shoulder

you're not gonna lean back you're gonna

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.800 
you're not gonna lean back you're gonna
want<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.070> push<00:03:11.310> into<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:12.209> is<00:03:12.390> where<00:03:12.570> dogs

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
want to push into it this is where dogs

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.540 
want to push into it this is where dogs
usually<00:03:13.410> lower<00:03:13.560> their<00:03:13.770> head<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.160> they<00:03:14.310> pull

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
usually lower their head and they pull

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.880 
usually lower their head and they pull
this<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.300> why<00:03:15.420> halter<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:15.959> great<00:03:16.170> for<00:03:16.440> weight

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
this is why halter is great for weight
