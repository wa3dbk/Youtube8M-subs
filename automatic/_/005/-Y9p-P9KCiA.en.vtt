00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.520
 recording 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.670
 I said 'I'm sick of the pretenders' bands that you're not 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.710
 committed people with whom you want to be a national 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.360

 while they always ask me and 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.889
 are film experiences really are like four situations 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.329
 common that you have highlighted the account up 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.579

 hey start with a production a disco a new baby as we carry many 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:12.349
 that makes it difficult not because sometimes good is a great waste of money 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.519
 but in the end it is very worthwhile that they are complicated has returned this 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.359
 production 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.190

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.500
