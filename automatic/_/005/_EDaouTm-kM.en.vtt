00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
you can see how they've segmented this

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.700 
you can see how they've segmented this
role<00:02:24.390> design<00:02:24.750> instead<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.200> just<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.470> four

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
role design instead of just the four

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.800 
role design instead of just the four
bars<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.520> really<00:02:26.790> allows<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.300> kind<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.540> wrap

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
bars it really allows it to kind of wrap

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.780 
bars it really allows it to kind of wrap
across<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.560> hand<00:02:28.830> offer<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.610> nice

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
contoured fit to it and as we move into

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.730 
contoured fit to it and as we move into
the<00:02:32.790> glove<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.900> really<00:02:34.170> could<00:02:34.320> feel<00:02:34.350> that

part kind of hugs down on that portion

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.140 
part kind of hugs down on that portion
of<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.740> glove<00:02:37.920> reducing<00:02:38.820> some<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.090> that

also going up to the top I'm taking a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.010 
also going up to the top I'm taking a
look<00:03:02.010> at<00:03:02.130> that<00:03:02.250> cuff<00:03:02.520> again<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:03.720> has<00:03:03.990> a

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
look at that cuff again it has a

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.140 
look at that cuff again it has a
contoured<00:03:04.470> design<00:03:04.740> so<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.040> hugs<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.520> but<00:03:06.030> then

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
contoured design so it hugs it but then

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.280 
contoured design so it hugs it but then
again<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.600> see<00:03:06.840> here<00:03:07.020> that<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.230> really

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
again you can see here that it really

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.350 
again you can see here that it really
kind<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.650> flares<00:03:07.980> out<00:03:08.220> in<00:03:08.430> these<00:03:08.610> regions<00:03:09.150> with

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
kind of flares out in these regions with

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.030 
kind of flares out in these regions with
that<00:03:09.600> segment<00:03:10.170> right<00:03:10.290> there<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.740> allow<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:10.950> to

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
that segment right there to allow it to

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.620 
that segment right there to allow it to
kind<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.310> fold<00:03:11.550> out<00:03:11.730> that's<00:03:12.390> going<00:03:12.570> to

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
kind of fold out that's going to

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.390 
kind of fold out that's going to
increase<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.200> wrist<00:03:13.410> mobility<00:03:13.950> as<00:03:14.070> well<00:03:14.310> as

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
increase the wrist mobility as well as

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.400 
increase the wrist mobility as well as
this<00:03:14.640> piece<00:03:14.910> that's<00:03:15.180> attached<00:03:15.510> by<00:03:15.810> these

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
this piece that's attached by these

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.740 
this piece that's attached by these
elastic<00:03:17.040> straps<00:03:17.490> which<00:03:18.210> is<00:03:18.330> going<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.540> hug<00:03:18.720> a

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
elastic straps which is going to hug a

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.930 
elastic straps which is going to hug a
little<00:03:18.960> bit<00:03:19.170> closer<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:19.770> arm<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.790> when

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
little bit closer to the arm so when

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.220 
little bit closer to the arm so when
you're<00:03:21.060> in<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.420> have<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.630> wrist<00:03:22.050> mobility

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
you're in you have that wrist mobility

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.990 
you're in you have that wrist mobility
but<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:22.920> still<00:03:23.160> have<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.370> hugging

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
but you still have it hugging

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.340 
but you still have it hugging
against<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.600> arm<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:24.960> have<00:03:25.200> that

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
against the arm so you have that

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.720 
against the arm so you have that

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
the wrist mobility so there's a quick

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.760 
the wrist mobility so there's a quick
