00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.419 

I<00:00:10.160> think<00:00:11.160> when<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.490> human<00:00:11.849> community<00:00:12.480> began

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
I think when the human community began

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.670 
I think when the human community began
crafting<00:00:14.570> instruments<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.719> various<00:00:16.110> kinds

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
crafting instruments of various kinds

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.190 
crafting instruments of various kinds
the<00:00:16.860> flute<00:00:17.189> emulated<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.180> human<00:00:18.570> voice<00:00:18.810> so

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
the flute emulated the human voice so

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.800 
the flute emulated the human voice so
closely<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:20.009> that<00:00:21.000> was<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.419> preferred

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
closely that that was the preferred

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.069 
closely that that was the preferred

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
today is regarded as Sonora in fact the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.719 
today is regarded as Sonora in fact the
Spaniards<00:00:57.210> were<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> ones<00:00:57.750> who<00:00:57.930> said<00:00:58.430> it's<00:00:59.430> so

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
Spaniards were the ones who said it's so

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.119 
Spaniards were the ones who said it's so
very<00:01:00.000> much<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.269> Spain<00:01:00.930> where<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:01.830> come<00:01:02.100> from

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
very much like Spain where we come from

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.990 
very much like Spain where we come from
and<00:01:02.960> it's<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.170> very<00:01:04.379> much<00:01:04.729> different<00:01:05.729> too

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and it's so very much different too

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.060 
and it's so very much different too
because<00:01:06.450> there<00:01:06.720> are<00:01:06.810> many<00:01:07.140> birds<00:01:07.500> there<00:01:08.009> are

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
because there are many birds there are

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.520 
because there are many birds there are
many<00:01:08.220> animals<00:01:08.520> there<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.869> seems<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.229> be<00:01:10.290> all

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
many animals there there seems to be all

every day here in northern Sonora
there's<00:01:35.130> still<00:01:35.550> that<00:01:35.909> sound<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.350> quality<00:01:37.890> of

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
sound that inhabits everything that we

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.610 
sound that inhabits everything that we

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
time with music and I think that was a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.170 
time with music and I think that was a
proper<00:01:46.290> name<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:47.040> give<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.550> area<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
proper name to give to this area the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.860 
proper name to give to this area the
Sonoran<00:01:48.810> Desert<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:50.400> try<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> add<00:01:51.300> some<00:01:51.720> of

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
Sonoran Desert and I try to add some of

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.770 
Sonoran Desert and I try to add some of
that<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> flute<00:01:52.650> music<00:01:52.830> I<00:01:53.250> perform<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.600> a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that to the flute music I perform it's a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.620 
that to the flute music I perform it's a
challenge<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:56.010> I<00:01:56.190> enjoy<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.729> very<00:01:56.760> much

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
challenge and I enjoy it very much

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.679

how<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.049> flute<00:02:07.950> sound<00:02:09.319> is<00:02:10.790> not<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:12.090> top<00:02:12.510> of

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
how the flute sound is not on top of

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.960 
how the flute sound is not on top of
everything<00:02:13.260> like<00:02:13.440> I'm<00:02:13.709> not<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.220> soloist

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
but I'm a component of bringing together

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.960 
but I'm a component of bringing together
that<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.930> different<00:02:19.350> voices<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.610> vocal

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970

performance<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.459> adding<00:02:23.459> my<00:02:23.700> component<00:02:24.510> of

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
performance and adding my component of
