 owner so who knows I have one today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.339
 review of the essence gel nail polish 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.690
 the 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.510
 the last time had put one online 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.369
 and got a lot of coming from you 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.550
 once right and that's great 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.990
 you pointed out to me that i can only 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.610
 the shell drink use and you have 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.250
 of course also a top and a basecoat 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.010
 needed and these intestines also released 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.220
 only when I have your report 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.780
 I completely overlooked it or 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.390
 wasn't there at that moment I know 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.730
 it wasn't but it didn't look right either 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.340
 indicated on the shelves that you have this 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.440
 the two also needed some lights 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.330
 today the review for you and so that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.210
 I tell you my opinion about it 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.350
 and so what I shell snacks I find 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.159
 Besides that we have passed the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.780
 sometimes when saying this is the last one 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.600
 review this week and that means 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.970
 from now on only once a week 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.979
 reviewer places where does this come from 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.090
 not because I liked it I thought it was 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.080
 very nice I have it all right 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.570
 Viewed 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.010
 but i just notice i don't have any 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.330
 job so I don't have that much 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.680
 spend maintenance 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.229
 my youtube also has just one 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.659
 block and yes yes I also want shoplog 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.979
 record the next on my channel and not 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.810
 just reviews 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.520
 so I have to learn my money a bit 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.799
 spread and I like two weeks 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.539
 reopen reviews and upload 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.250
 that still you actually there is none 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.719
 money for us from the new spaces one 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.090
 times a review on that week 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.649
 another day a vlog will come online me 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.539
 don't know if you like me 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.799
 think it yourself now can be suspended 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.750
 and I have a lot of fun to 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.579
 you just have a look every week 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.289
 my life give it a week 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.030
 vlog the vlog that you see 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.079
 of the know for so what makes us with 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.119
 without 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.009
 and you will see it on Thursday 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.939
 so this is also to review and tell 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.799
 dozing off floor 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.020
 normally i start my review with 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.679
 tell what i think about the appearance 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.630
 that kind of thing and then drink 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.179
 I check it then say the longer 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.039
 stays put or what it does and I come 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.399
 then with one conclusion this is another 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.560
 review 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.840
 I have had a number and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.849
 we are now a week later and I can 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.250
 you see everything about what i order 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.220
 I think two layers of it now 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.900
 the chuck 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.830
 so the shine so you can see 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.010
 all pretty 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.840
 we really have to be good and long for an hour 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.680
 to dry 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.950
 it is now about yes, think ten minutes 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.440
 me later and it is not quite yet 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.310
 say dry blow rose but I just too 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.500
 already 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.080
 accidentally and her wearing things 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.660
 and you just sit in it again 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.910
 so it's not quite you actually 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.360
 completely dry but I'm going now the 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.700
 top briefly apply that it is possible 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.980
 I think so and then it has to be again 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.450
 dry well 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.090
 how we can dry again very well and the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.340
 color that I behave last week 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.099
 13 first, it offers a very beautiful 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.569
 soft pink color and I agree 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.390
 tried with and without 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.130
 yes base and top coat culinary to everything 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.720
 tell about whether you stay normal 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.730
 and he indeed stays longer 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.549
 sit without 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.380
 base and top coat bertie for me yes really 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.390

 brittle nails have me gonna spray my 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.950
 nails very very quickly 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.500
 my days are just really very wrap up 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.079
 soft and 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.730
 nail polish really do not come on 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.859
 my nails supervision awful 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.720
 because probably like you 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.819

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.250
 through just too much better sit 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.470
 base and top coat below this is the base 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.840
 cost white 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.569
 and this is the top coat in the silver 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.400
 sleeve ristie two days completely good 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.900
 sit two or three completely right there 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.350
 You can relax here on the third day 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.480
 to chip 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.209
 I have pumpkins and between review max 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.230
 I will now be a little later today 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.720
 day 3 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.200
 I got the lax in this on Tuesday 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.200
 is how it looks now 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.250
 This hand you are already going something chipo 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:23.150
 but it is not too bad and reading is therefore necessary 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.150
 really nice and chipping 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.010
 gosh this so bad they known of yes me 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.930
 actually wanted to get the song off 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.840
 from the third or fourth day on 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.400
 me from really hard backwards from the 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.320
 fourth day I actually already had one 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.810
 pick it up if the weather is n't really nice 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.810
 currently my nails look like this 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:52.500
 and more than half is just finished me 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.630
 have had six days on I have to 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.250
 confess honestly I am from four 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.729
 also go hand in hand picking 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.440
 it began releasing nails to u 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.810
 splitting 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.130
 so in advance by 4 it is really very bad 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.960
 gone downhill 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.030
 anyway the shell appears too expensive piece 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.310
 sit better with base and top coat 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.350
 yes they put that on anyway I have to quite 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.940
 many people heard that 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.650
 who actually yes better nails 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.139
 like me he stays for real week 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.349
 I also think I am very sorry 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:24.780
 speak about because yes your nails are 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:28.440
 also harder from when so say that 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.620
 with coat applies two lacquers shelf and 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.699
 the top coat farmer who nails one really 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.729
 louder 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.800
 alone with the shell shell anyway 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.599
 nail polish alone could if you use this 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.610
 used to that besides even harder that 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.440
 I noticed it before too 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.970
 I think a very big plus to 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.060
 because my nails are bad enough 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.760
 they belong further yes I think it is 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.539
 bad in terms of scheuermann better than expected 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.000
 just a few glimpses 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.470
 that is really looking at it then it says 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.729
 I believe 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.169
 I watch you this to the top coat x 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.909
 expressionist on the basecoat 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.940
 I think that's better than expected 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.530
 me that extremely grind cooking am this one 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.630
 colored because the color come anyway 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.430
 very soft 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.740
 I have the idea that he comes with this color 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.199
 but those buttons color from really piece 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.700
 more grip already on some nails 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.380
 so for 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.000
 still felt my dive that is whole 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.980
 very strong 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.780
 so it's just still like that then 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.000
 you can assume that it really thick six 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.830
 stays in place for days 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.750
 really have a good retentive plus puzzles 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.160
 never from nail polish and am very sorry
