the bottom of the pot you can see here

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.659 
the bottom of the pot you can see here
this<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:28.269> a<00:00:28.720> normal<00:00:29.259> cross<00:00:30.009> down<00:00:30.310> that<00:00:30.490> every

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
this is a normal cross down that every

this is a normal cross down that every
new<00:00:30.759> makes<00:00:30.939> titanium<00:00:31.419> this<00:00:31.539> one<00:00:31.630> has<00:00:31.750> not<00:00:31.900> been

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
new makes titanium this one has not been

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.680 
new makes titanium this one has not been
used<00:00:32.349> I<00:00:32.640> cut<00:00:33.640> this<00:00:33.820> one<00:00:34.000> down<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.450> can<00:00:34.540> see<00:00:34.630> how

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
used I cut this one down you can see how

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.190 
used I cut this one down you can see how
much<00:00:34.780> I<00:00:34.930> trimmed<00:00:35.170> off<00:00:35.320> the<00:00:35.470> edges<00:00:35.620> there<00:00:37.200> you

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
much I trimmed off the edges there you

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.600 
much I trimmed off the edges there you
can<00:00:38.289> kind<00:00:38.440> of<00:00:38.469> see<00:00:38.620> that<00:00:38.739> a<00:00:38.800> little<00:00:39.039> bit<00:00:39.280> trying

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
can kind of see that a little bit trying

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.680 
can kind of see that a little bit trying
to<00:00:39.670> find<00:00:39.789> a<00:00:39.850> better<00:00:40.000> spot<00:00:40.270> for<00:00:40.300> it<00:00:40.510> there<00:00:40.629> you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
to find a better spot for it there you

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.979 
to find a better spot for it there you
go

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
go

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.260 
go
you<00:00:41.289> see<00:00:41.440> how<00:00:41.500> much<00:00:41.620> I<00:00:41.710> cut<00:00:41.890> it<00:00:41.980> down<00:00:42.010> by<00:00:42.270> now

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
you see how much I cut it down by now

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.970 
you see how much I cut it down by now
you<00:00:44.260> simply<00:00:46.050> use<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.199> heat<00:00:47.350> exchanger<00:00:47.770> ring

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
you simply use the heat exchanger ring

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.790 
you simply use the heat exchanger ring
and<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.730> DX<00:00:49.000> set<00:00:49.270> to<00:00:50.109> slide<00:00:50.350> it<00:00:50.469> into<00:00:50.620> that

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
and the DX set to slide it into that

00:00:50.800 --> 00:01:01.830 
and the DX set to slide it into that
ring<00:00:51.270> take<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.390> one<00:00:52.510> that<00:00:52.600> mates<00:00:52.780> -<00:00:52.989> it<00:01:00.840> takes

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
ring take the one that mates - it takes

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.560 
ring take the one that mates - it takes
a<00:01:01.960> little<00:01:02.199> finagling<00:01:02.500> here<00:01:02.980> but<00:01:03.670> now<00:01:03.820> it<00:01:04.330> fits

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
a little finagling here but now it fits

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.520 
a little finagling here but now it fits
in<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:04.780> bottom<00:01:05.080> of<00:01:05.170> that<00:01:05.260> pot<00:01:06.090> pretty<00:01:07.090> easily

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
in the bottom of that pot pretty easily

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.649 
in the bottom of that pot pretty easily
and<00:01:08.530> this<00:01:08.950> is<00:01:09.070> just<00:01:09.189> a<00:01:09.250> quick<00:01:09.460> quick<00:01:10.270> job<00:01:10.479> so

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
and this is just a quick quick job so

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:11.820 
and this is just a quick quick job so
it's<00:01:10.750> not<00:01:10.810> gonna<00:01:10.930> be<00:01:10.990> fine-tuned<00:01:11.439> as<00:01:11.590> well<00:01:11.740> as

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
it's not gonna be fine-tuned as well as

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.899 
it's not gonna be fine-tuned as well as
it<00:01:11.950> should<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:15.430> now<00:01:15.549> we're<00:01:15.640> gonna<00:01:15.729> see

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
it should but now we're gonna see

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.850 
it should but now we're gonna see
whether<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.840> heat<00:01:17.020> exchanger<00:01:17.470> has<00:01:17.680> any

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
whether the heat exchanger has any

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.800 
whether the heat exchanger has any
effect<00:01:18.220> on<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.460> burn<00:01:18.640> time<00:01:18.850> with<00:01:19.630> the

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
effect on the burn time with the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.580 
effect on the burn time with the
titanium<00:01:20.110> stove<00:01:23.189> alright<00:01:24.329> we<00:01:25.329> have<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:26.380> cross

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
titanium stove alright we have the cross

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.649 
titanium stove alright we have the cross
stand<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.369> securely<00:01:27.729> mount<00:01:27.820> it<00:01:28.150> in<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.329> bottom

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
stand to securely mount it in the bottom

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.380 
stand to securely mount it in the bottom
of<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:29.170> Jetboil<00:01:30.009> pot<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:31.060> just<00:01:31.090> have<00:01:31.299> to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
of the Jetboil pot you just have to

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.550 
of the Jetboil pot you just have to
tweak<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.689> slightly<00:01:31.960> when<00:01:32.229> it's<00:01:32.350> in<00:01:32.439> there

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
tweak it slightly when it's in there

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.899 
tweak it slightly when it's in there
kind<00:01:32.680> of<00:01:32.740> give<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:33.009> quick<00:01:33.159> Bend<00:01:33.460> so<00:01:33.759> doesn't

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
kind of give it a quick Bend so doesn't

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.719 
kind of give it a quick Bend so doesn't
fall<00:01:34.119> out<00:01:34.149> when<00:01:34.869> it's<00:01:34.990> facing<00:01:35.170> down<00:01:35.530> our<00:01:36.430> water

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
fall out when it's facing down our water

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.730 
fall out when it's facing down our water
is<00:01:36.939> at<00:01:37.119> sixty<00:01:37.479> three<00:01:37.659> point<00:01:37.869> three<00:01:38.200> degrees

I did notice when using this for the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.100 
I did notice when using this for the
first<00:02:04.010> time<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.390> didn't<00:02:05.660> get<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.900> stove

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
first time that you didn't get the stove

crossed and turn let this go a few
seconds<00:02:14.450> here<00:02:14.570> just<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.840> kind<00:02:15.020> of<00:02:15.050> prime

minutes I'm gonna try to show you what
it<00:03:03.170> looks<00:03:03.350> like<00:03:03.530> inside<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.630> heat

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
it looks like inside the the heat

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.720 
it looks like inside the the heat
exchanger<00:03:06.260> sitting<00:03:07.040> over<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.370> stove<00:03:07.580> you<00:03:07.610> can

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
exchanger sitting over the stove you can

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.680 
exchanger sitting over the stove you can
see<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.000> flame<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.360> they're<00:03:08.450> really

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.390 
see the flame and they're really
starting<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.959> take<00:03:09.080> off<00:03:09.230> nicely<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:10.250> there's

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
really not a lot of heat coming out the

the water no vapor yet I was hoping to

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.550 
the water no vapor yet I was hoping to
see<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.130> little<00:04:20.430> bit<00:04:21.139> faster<00:04:22.139> rate<00:04:22.259> because<00:04:22.470> at

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
see a little bit faster rate because at

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.890 
see a little bit faster rate because at
the<00:04:22.650> DX<00:04:22.949> set<00:04:23.130> at<00:04:23.250> this<00:04:23.370> point<00:04:23.669> minute<00:04:24.419> six<00:04:24.690> we

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
the DX set at this point minute six we

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.249 
the DX set at this point minute six we
had<00:04:25.169> a<00:04:25.199> full<00:04:25.770> rolling<00:04:26.099> boil

had a full rolling boil

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.719 
had a full rolling boil
but<00:04:28.259> we<00:04:28.349> saw<00:04:28.530> looks<00:04:29.039> like<00:04:29.160> it's<00:04:29.280> still<00:04:29.400> burning

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
but we saw looks like it's still burning

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:37.490 
but we saw looks like it's still burning
strong<00:04:29.759> so<00:04:30.389> we'll<00:04:31.080> keep<00:04:31.229> going

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500

eight minutes cook time on half an ounce

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.920 
eight minutes cook time on half an ounce
of<00:04:43.470> alcohol<00:04:46.190> you<00:04:47.190> can<00:04:47.340> actually<00:04:47.490> hear<00:04:47.970> the

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
of alcohol you can actually hear the

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.730 
of alcohol you can actually hear the
water<00:04:49.140> starting<00:04:50.040> to<00:04:50.130> boil

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.940 

and<00:04:56.010> we<00:04:56.520> are<00:04:56.610> getting<00:04:56.790> small<00:04:57.210> bubbles<00:04:57.950> coming

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
and we are getting small bubbles coming

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.990 
and we are getting small bubbles coming
to<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.160> side<00:04:59.340> that<00:04:59.490> are<00:04:59.550> breaking<00:04:59.910> the

surface they starting to shimmer quite a

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.540 
surface they starting to shimmer quite a
bit<00:05:02.090> so<00:05:03.090> we<00:05:03.210> have<00:05:03.360> almost<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:04.350> full<00:05:05.310> rolling

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550

this stove

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:28.150 
this stove
we'll<00:05:21.450> check<00:05:21.660> in<00:05:21.840> here<00:05:21.990> another<00:05:22.140> minute

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.580 

all<00:05:28.730> right<00:05:28.940> we<00:05:29.090> were<00:05:29.180> at<00:05:29.270> nine<00:05:30.020> minutes<00:05:30.350> ten

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
all right we were at nine minutes ten

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.740 
all right we were at nine minutes ten
seconds<00:05:31.100> and<00:05:31.310> you<00:05:31.970> can<00:05:32.000> definitely<00:05:32.240> hear<00:05:32.540> this

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
seconds and you can definitely hear this

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.270 
seconds and you can definitely hear this
thing<00:05:32.930> is<00:05:33.020> starting<00:05:33.110> to<00:05:33.380> take<00:05:33.620> off<00:05:33.770> now<00:05:33.830> in

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
thing is starting to take off now in

we're at nine minutes thirty seconds
right<00:05:48.740> now<00:05:49.390> so<00:05:50.390> we<00:05:50.480> have<00:05:50.600> a<00:05:50.630> full<00:05:50.900> rolling<00:05:51.170> boil

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
right now so we have a full rolling boil

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.800 
right now so we have a full rolling boil
at<00:05:51.650> nine<00:05:51.830> minutes<00:05:52.100> 30<00:05:52.250> seconds<00:05:52.700> using<00:05:53.600> the

alcohol we had a full rolling boil and

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.140 
alcohol we had a full rolling boil and
we're<00:06:28.550> gonna<00:06:28.670> check<00:06:28.820> with<00:06:28.970> the<00:06:29.030> meat

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
we're gonna check with the meat

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.470 
we're gonna check with the meat
thermometer<00:06:29.380> to<00:06:30.380> see<00:06:30.530> what<00:06:30.710> temperature<00:06:31.190> the

the bottom of the pot I'm only setting
this<00:06:37.580> in<00:06:38.360> the<00:06:38.540> middle<00:06:38.750> of<00:06:38.870> the<00:06:38.960> water<00:06:39.140> just<00:06:39.380> to

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
this in the middle of the water just to

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:45.100 
this in the middle of the water just to
see<00:06:39.650> how<00:06:39.800> hot<00:06:40.040> it<00:06:40.220> got<00:06:40.400> to<00:06:42.580> 198<00:06:43.580> 199<00:06:44.110> 200

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
see how hot it got to 198 199 200

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:52.360 
see how hot it got to 198 199 200
degrees<00:06:45.410> 201<00:06:46.990> 202<00:06:47.990> 203<00:06:50.830> so<00:06:51.830> out<00:06:51.950> of<00:06:52.070> all<00:06:52.250> the

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.490 
systems we use the modded Jetboil pot
and<00:06:55.090> every<00:06:56.090> new<00:06:56.210> stove<00:06:56.480> got<00:06:56.990> the<00:06:57.140> water<00:06:57.320> the

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
and every new stove got the water the

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.440 
and every new stove got the water the
hottest<00:06:57.860> 203<00:06:58.490> degrees<00:06:58.610> to<00:06:58.940> a<00:06:58.970> full<00:06:59.210> rolling

is<00:07:05.120> now<00:07:05.240> my<00:07:05.540> new<00:07:05.570> system<00:07:06.050> to<00:07:06.200> use<00:07:06.410> we're<00:07:07.220> gonna

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 
is now my new system to use we're gonna

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.150 
is now my new system to use we're gonna
try<00:07:07.490> it<00:07:07.550> again<00:07:07.760> with<00:07:08.570> the<00:07:08.720> modded<00:07:09.620> Jetboil<00:07:09.950> pot

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
try it again with the modded Jetboil pot

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.370 
try it again with the modded Jetboil pot
just<00:07:10.490> sitting<00:07:10.760> on<00:07:10.880> one<00:07:11.210> layer<00:07:11.480> of<00:07:11.660> the<00:07:11.780> DX<00:07:12.140> set

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
just sitting on one layer of the DX set

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.350 
just sitting on one layer of the DX set
just<00:07:13.160> to<00:07:13.280> see<00:07:13.430> if<00:07:13.520> height<00:07:13.730> to<00:07:13.910> makes<00:07:14.060> an<00:07:14.210> issue

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
just to see if height to makes an issue

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.700 
just to see if height to makes an issue
with<00:07:14.600> the<00:07:14.720> flame<00:07:14.930> because<00:07:15.050> the<00:07:15.230> flame<00:07:15.440> really

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:15.710 
with the flame because the flame really

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.170 
with the flame because the flame really
wasn't<00:07:15.890> getting<00:07:16.070> very<00:07:16.430> big<00:07:16.610> underneath<00:07:16.970> there

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.180 
wasn't getting very big underneath there

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.790 
wasn't getting very big underneath there
we'll<00:07:17.780> see<00:07:17.960> if<00:07:18.050> that<00:07:18.080> makes<00:07:18.320> a<00:07:18.440> difference<00:07:18.710> in

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 
we'll see if that makes a difference in

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.250 
we'll see if that makes a difference in
the<00:07:18.860> next<00:07:18.980> test
