00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:04.960 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.590 

hi<00:00:05.960> there<00:00:06.200> in<00:00:06.890> this<00:00:07.130> episode<00:00:07.549> I<00:00:07.879> would<00:00:08.330> like<00:00:08.480> to

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:08.600 
hi there in this episode I would like to

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.199 
hi there in this episode I would like to
show<00:00:08.780> you<00:00:08.809> how<00:00:09.200> to<00:00:09.230> make<00:00:09.650> a<00:00:09.920> buttonhole<00:00:10.580> using

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:11.209 
show you how to make a buttonhole using

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.650 
show you how to make a buttonhole using
crochet<00:00:11.629> Castille<00:00:12.049> method<00:00:12.410> I<00:00:13.420> like<00:00:14.420> using

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
crochet Castille method I like using

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.529 
crochet Castille method I like using
this<00:00:14.900> method<00:00:15.320> because<00:00:15.709> the<00:00:16.369> cast-off<00:00:17.029> edge<00:00:17.240> is

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
this method because the cast-off edge is

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.630 
this method because the cast-off edge is
literally<00:00:18.380> identical<00:00:18.500> to<00:00:19.100> the<00:00:19.189> Caston<00:00:19.609> edge

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
literally identical to the Caston edge

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.390 
literally identical to the Caston edge
which<00:00:20.600> makes<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:21.050> buttonhole<00:00:21.500> look<00:00:22.039> quite

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
which makes the buttonhole look quite

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.660 
which makes the buttonhole look quite
neat<00:00:23.590> another<00:00:24.590> thing<00:00:24.800> about<00:00:24.920> this<00:00:25.310> kind<00:00:25.550> of

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
neat another thing about this kind of

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.910 
neat another thing about this kind of
buttonhole<00:00:26.180> is<00:00:26.420> that<00:00:26.720> it's<00:00:26.960> quite<00:00:27.230> strong<00:00:27.680> so

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
buttonhole is that it's quite strong so

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.109 
buttonhole is that it's quite strong so
that<00:00:28.550> it's<00:00:29.180> resistant<00:00:29.750> to<00:00:30.050> stretching<00:00:31.119> if

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
that it's resistant to stretching if

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.880 
that it's resistant to stretching if
you're<00:00:32.329> not<00:00:32.539> familiar<00:00:32.689> with<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.289> cut<00:00:33.469> crochet

then<00:02:31.860> using<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.400> crochet<00:02:32.640> hook<00:02:33.050> insert<00:02:34.050> the

then using a crochet hook insert the
hook<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.590> between<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:35.069> first<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.670> second

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
hook in between the first and the second

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.220 
hook in between the first and the second
stitches<00:02:36.959> on<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.470> Left<00:02:37.680> needle<00:02:37.769> like<00:02:38.489> this

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
stitches on the Left needle like this

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:47.990 
stitches on the Left needle like this
then<00:02:40.230> draw<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.800> loop<00:02:41.300> towards<00:02:42.300> you

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.420 

then<00:02:49.000> make<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.720> chain<00:02:50.380> stitch

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.250 

this<00:02:55.430> chain<00:02:55.819> stitch<00:02:56.120> doesn't<00:02:56.750> actually<00:02:56.900> count

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
this chain stitch doesn't actually count

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.490 
this chain stitch doesn't actually count
it<00:02:57.769> basically<00:02:58.280> keeps<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.450> yarn<00:02:59.690> at<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.319> right

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
it basically keeps the yarn at the right

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.850 
it basically keeps the yarn at the right
position<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.190> do<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.519> crochet<00:03:01.700> cast<00:03:02.060> on<00:03:02.860> so

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
position to do the crochet cast on so

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.500 
position to do the crochet cast on so
bring<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.430> hook<00:03:04.580> in<00:03:04.790> front<00:03:04.849> of<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.330> needle

now you can see the little chain stitch
that<00:03:36.860> doesn't<00:03:37.220> count<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.700> then<00:03:37.879> you<00:03:38.000> made

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
that doesn't count and then you made

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.009 
that doesn't count and then you made
four<00:03:38.599> stitches<00:03:40.150> after<00:03:41.150> making<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.810> last

four stitches after making the last
chain<00:03:42.620> stitch<00:03:42.830> you<00:03:43.280> don't<00:03:43.489> bring<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.849> working

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
chain stitch you don't bring the working

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.410 
chain stitch you don't bring the working
yarn<00:03:44.180> back<00:03:44.569> but<00:03:44.930> instead<00:03:45.080> put<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.160> loop<00:03:46.420> onto

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
yarn back but instead put the loop onto

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.920 
yarn back but instead put the loop onto
the<00:03:47.720> onto<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.800> needle<00:03:49.300> so<00:03:50.300> it<00:03:50.480> looks<00:03:50.660> like

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
the onto the needle so it looks like

00:03:50.930 --> 00:04:00.280 
the onto the needle so it looks like
you've<00:03:51.110> made<00:03:51.140> five<00:03:51.680> stitches<00:03:52.069> here

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.979

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
then turn the work around onto the right

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.839 
then turn the work around onto the right
side<00:04:03.019> and<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.709> first<00:04:03.920> thing<00:04:04.069> you<00:04:04.189> do<00:04:04.370> is<00:04:04.609> to

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
slip the first stitch on the left on to

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.270 
slip the first stitch on the left on to
the<00:04:07.219> right<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:07.819> then<00:04:08.390> pass<00:04:08.750> this<00:04:09.709> fifth

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
stitch at this point slightly tighten

this loop but then try not to tighten it
too<00:04:23.600> much<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:24.199> then<00:04:24.919> slip<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.430> stitch<00:04:25.669> back

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
onto the left needle and now you can see

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.439 
onto the left needle and now you can see
that<00:04:31.280> you've<00:04:31.460> caught<00:04:31.699> it<00:04:31.880> off<00:04:31.970> four<00:04:32.180> stitches

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449
