fairly loud I don't think this would go
nearly<00:04:12.440> as<00:04:12.530> deep<00:04:12.680> obviously<00:04:13.220> is<00:04:13.370> something

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
nearly as deep obviously is something

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.090 
nearly as deep obviously is something
like<00:04:13.790> beats<00:04:14.380> but<00:04:15.380> it's<00:04:15.500> got<00:04:15.770> some<00:04:15.950> good

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.620 

it's<00:04:26.890> got<00:04:27.040> some<00:04:27.220> decent<00:04:27.370> bass<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.300> mid-range

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
it's got some decent bass and mid-range

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.410 
it's got some decent bass and mid-range
I<00:04:29.520> haven't<00:04:30.520> found<00:04:30.670> anything<00:04:30.880> yet<00:04:31.060> they're

know listening to music you know so I

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.300 
know listening to music you know so I
won't<00:05:01.690> like<00:05:02.080> if<00:05:02.260> I'm<00:05:02.530> going<00:05:02.740> bad<00:05:02.920> with<00:05:02.980> my<00:05:03.130> wife

serve each other or whatever so this is

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.690 
serve each other or whatever so this is
pretty<00:05:08.560> decent<00:05:08.980> I<00:05:09.070> think<00:05:09.280> this<00:05:09.400> is<00:05:09.520> a<00:05:09.550> good

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
pretty decent I think this is a good

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.560 
pretty decent I think this is a good
investment<00:05:09.820> on<00:05:10.270> my<00:05:10.300> part<00:05:10.420> and<00:05:10.840> it<00:05:12.390> replaces<00:05:13.390> a

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
investment on my part and it replaces a

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.060 
investment on my part and it replaces a
previous<00:05:13.990> set<00:05:14.080> of<00:05:14.110> headphones<00:05:14.320> that<00:05:14.830> wore

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
previous set of headphones that wore

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.550 
previous set of headphones that wore
that<00:05:15.460> gave<00:05:16.150> out<00:05:16.360> over<00:05:16.570> time<00:05:16.930> so<00:05:17.200> that's<00:05:17.380> about

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
that gave out over time so that's about

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.040 
that gave out over time so that's about
