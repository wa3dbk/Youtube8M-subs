00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
I make turrets around my face and make

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.550 
I make turrets around my face and make
his<00:00:04.350> rever<00:00:04.919> useless<00:00:05.430> he<00:00:06.000> basically<00:00:06.560> wasted

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
his rever useless he basically wasted

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.890 
his rever useless he basically wasted
his<00:00:07.709> money<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:08.220> he<00:00:08.430> did<00:00:08.640> not<00:00:08.850> then<00:00:09.630> she<00:00:09.750> was

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
his money and he did not then she was

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.660 
his money and he did not then she was
not<00:00:10.080> able<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.410> keep<00:00:10.590> me<00:00:10.770> in<00:00:10.890> my<00:00:11.010> babies<00:00:11.340> because

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
not able to keep me in my babies because

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.940 
not able to keep me in my babies because
my<00:00:12.120> Therese<00:00:12.450> prevent<00:00:12.930> his<00:00:13.080> rear<00:00:13.290> from<00:00:13.620> getting

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
my Therese prevent his rear from getting

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.129 
my Therese prevent his rear from getting
into<00:00:14.160> my<00:00:14.400> face<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.610> therefore<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.420> my<00:00:15.810> units

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
into my face and therefore I my units

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.259 
into my face and therefore I my units
don't<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.619> stay<00:00:16.859> inside<00:00:17.099> I<00:00:17.580> try<00:00:18.210> to

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:18.269 
don't have to stay inside I try to

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.970 
don't have to stay inside I try to
defend<00:00:18.599> it<00:00:18.750> all<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.929> time<00:00:18.960> therefore<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.769> could

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
defend it all the time therefore I could

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.099 
defend it all the time therefore I could
push<00:00:20.130> out<00:00:20.339> when<00:00:20.730> he<00:00:21.689> sets<00:00:21.929> down<00:00:22.199> his<00:00:22.650> nexus<00:00:23.160> and

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
push out when he sets down his nexus and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.710 
push out when he sets down his nexus and
I<00:00:25.109> scan<00:00:25.919> them<00:00:26.070> again<00:00:27.140> nothing<00:00:28.140> unusual

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.590

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
and I'm still waiting until he puts down

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.979 
and I'm still waiting until he puts down
insert<00:00:34.020> axis<00:00:34.820> and<00:00:35.820> I'm<00:00:36.030> going<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.480> get<00:00:36.660> six

factories<00:00:37.470> as<00:00:37.649> soon<00:00:37.920> as<00:00:38.100> he<00:00:38.309> gets<00:00:38.730> his<00:00:38.850> first

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
factories as soon as he gets his first

factories as soon as he gets his first
as<00:00:40.079> soon<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:40.440> he<00:00:40.649> sets<00:00:41.100> down<00:00:41.280> his<00:00:41.520> four<00:00:41.699> hundred

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
out and i am going to set some pressure

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.759 
out and i am going to set some pressure

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the river you didn't do it much damage

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.170 
the river you didn't do it much damage
except<00:00:54.930> take<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.290> of<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.710> Walters<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.339> I

mine<00:00:57.449> again<00:00:57.960> oh<00:00:58.170> yeah<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.100> back<00:00:59.400> in<00:00:59.670> Python

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
mine again oh yeah and back in Python

unlike maps like tell across you can't
it's<00:01:02.699> harder<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.210> camp<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.650> get<00:01:04.949> your<00:01:05.100> second

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it's harder to camp to get your second

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.490 
it's harder to camp to get your second
natural<00:01:05.939> therefore<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.810> must<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.110> some<00:01:07.350> sort

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500

mass<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.479> would<00:01:18.689> cut<00:01:18.960> SUVs<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.330> will

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
mass and I would cut SUVs of it I will

mass and I would cut SUVs of it I will
soon<00:01:21.630> cut<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> series<00:01:22.490> after<00:01:23.490> those<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:23.939> done

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
soon cut a series after those are done

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.520 
soon cut a series after those are done
and<00:01:24.740> do<00:01:25.740> some<00:01:25.950> planning<00:01:26.280> push<00:01:26.930> my<00:01:27.930> upgrades<00:01:28.380> up

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
and do some planning push my upgrades up

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.950 
and do some planning push my upgrades up
or<00:01:28.710> complete<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.850> around<00:01:30.270> six<00:01:30.540> factories

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
or complete I have around six factories

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.980 
or complete I have around six factories
oh<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:32.100> call<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> mini-map<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.450> see<00:01:33.780> that

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
oh and now call the mini-map I see that

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.680 
oh and now call the mini-map I see that
he's<00:01:34.170> put<00:01:34.500> down<00:01:34.650> his<00:01:34.800> certain<00:01:35.610> axis<00:01:35.940> right

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
he's put down his certain axis right

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.600 
he's put down his certain axis right
there<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.200> I'm<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:37.920> move<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:38.550> soon

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
there and I'm going to move out as soon

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.450 
there and I'm going to move out as soon
as<00:01:38.970> possible<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.600> when<00:01:40.560> he<00:01:40.740> puts<00:01:40.980> that's<00:01:41.190> four

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
as possible I when he puts that's four

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.649 
as possible I when he puts that's four
hundred<00:01:41.670> dollars<00:01:41.700> at<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.150> beginning<00:01:42.480> of<00:01:42.540> the

hundred dollars at the beginning of the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.570 
hundred dollars at the beginning of the
game<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.050> a<00:01:43.080> lot<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.800> therefore<00:01:44.190> i'm<00:01:44.250> going<00:01:44.490> to

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
game is a lot and therefore i'm going to

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.090 
game is a lot and therefore i'm going to
take<00:01:44.760> advantage<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.300> it<00:01:45.440> this<00:01:46.440> is<00:01:46.680> crucial

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
take advantage of it this is crucial

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.370 
take advantage of it this is crucial
this<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.880> all<00:01:48.090> right<00:01:48.450> here<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.990> screw<00:01:49.290> up

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
this is all right here if I screw up

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.570 
this is all right here if I screw up
somehow<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:50.610> game<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.940> over<00:01:51.210> basically

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
do a decent amount damage I scan him he

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.600

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
moving in a line there near the edge so

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.719 
moving in a line there near the edge so
that<00:02:08.180> they<00:02:08.810> don't<00:02:08.990> get<00:02:09.200> flanked<00:02:09.710> but<00:02:10.550> when

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
that they don't get flanked but when

that they don't get flanked but when
they<00:02:10.850> get<00:02:10.970> flanked<00:02:11.270> is<00:02:11.360> bad<00:02:11.540> oh<00:02:11.720> my<00:02:11.960> god<00:02:12.110> he's

coming right now I did not get that time

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.570 
coming right now I did not get that time
to<00:02:14.270> lay<00:02:14.420> my<00:02:14.450> mind<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:16.070> tanks<00:02:16.430> are

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
to lay my mind and the tanks are

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.060 
to lay my mind and the tanks are
attacking<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:17.390> am<00:02:17.870> parking<00:02:18.260> my<00:02:18.500> tanks<00:02:18.830> on<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.170 
goons the vultures I dragged back far
enough<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.010> they<00:02:22.460> only<00:02:22.730> target<00:02:22.970> the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
enough so that they only target the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.290 
enough so that they only target the

therefore I am I could reinforce my

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.290 
therefore I am I could reinforce my
Walters<00:02:38.600> weight<00:02:39.170> much<00:02:39.350> faster<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.520> actually

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
Walters weight much faster and actually

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.760 
Walters weight much faster and actually
I<00:02:41.540> made<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.840> mistake<00:02:42.020> during<00:02:42.410> this<00:02:42.620> attack

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
I made a mistake during this attack

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.400 
I made a mistake during this attack
because<00:02:43.610> that<00:02:43.880> my<00:02:44.510> tanks<00:02:44.900> were<00:02:44.990> sort<00:02:45.350> of

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
because that my tanks were sort of

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.410 
because that my tanks were sort of
spread<00:02:45.800> out<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.400> pushed<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.940> should<00:02:47.330> have

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
spread out and I pushed I should have

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.350 
spread out and I pushed I should have
waited<00:02:47.750> until<00:02:48.020> they<00:02:48.530> were<00:02:48.560> closer<00:02:49.040> together

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
waited until they were closer together

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.330 
waited until they were closer together
before<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:50.450> moved<00:02:51.110> out<00:02:51.260> because<00:02:51.620> now<00:02:51.860> some

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
before I moved out because now some

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.040 
before I moved out because now some
tanks<00:02:52.730> were<00:02:52.880> so<00:02:53.030> far<00:02:53.240> behind<00:02:53.270> at<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.840> cutting

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
tanks were so far behind at the cutting

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.240 
tanks were so far behind at the cutting
in<00:02:54.230> their<00:02:54.320> reach<00:02:54.640> reach<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:56.110> target<00:02:57.250> so

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
in their reach reach the target so

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.740 
in their reach reach the target so
that's<00:02:58.519> something<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:59.030> should<00:02:59.060> remember<00:02:59.390> is

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
that's something you should remember is

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.100 
that's something you should remember is
to<00:02:59.930> recruit

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
to recruit

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.280 
to recruit
before<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:01.920> move<00:03:02.070> out<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.820> there<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.450> see<00:03:03.900> he

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
before you move out and there I see he

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.160 
before you move out and there I see he
has<00:03:04.440> reversed<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.070> see<00:03:05.760> job<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.180> camp<00:03:06.540> outside<00:03:06.930> I

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
has reversed I see job I camp outside I

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.650 
has reversed I see job I camp outside I
move<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.770> back<00:03:07.950> tanks<00:03:08.550> up<00:03:08.730> closer<00:03:09.270> so<00:03:09.630> they

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
move the back tanks up closer so they

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.000 
move the back tanks up closer so they
could<00:03:09.900> do<00:03:09.990> something<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:12.440> am<00:03:13.440> about<00:03:13.800> to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
could do something and I am about to

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.220 
could do something and I am about to
take<00:03:14.220> my<00:03:14.400> second<00:03:14.820> natural<00:03:15.210> because<00:03:15.390> right

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
take my second natural because right

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.030 
take my second natural because right
here<00:03:16.610> because<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.790> am<00:03:17.910> fairly<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.750> had<00:03:19.440> because<00:03:19.920> I

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
here because I am fairly I had because I

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.400 
here because I am fairly I had because I
have<00:03:20.190> capped<00:03:20.490> it<00:03:20.700> she<00:03:21.360> lost<00:03:21.540> map<00:03:21.810> control<00:03:22.230> he

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
have capped it she lost map control he

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.220 
have capped it she lost map control he
doesn't<00:03:22.710> know<00:03:22.770> what<00:03:22.920> I'm<00:03:23.040> doing<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:23.940> he's<00:03:24.570> for

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
doesn't know what I'm doing so he's for

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.510 
doesn't know what I'm doing so he's for
the<00:03:25.290> rest<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.650> game<00:03:25.800> right<00:03:26.010> now<00:03:26.070> he's

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
the rest of the game right now he's

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.699 
the rest of the game right now he's
gonna<00:03:26.700> be<00:03:26.970> trying<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.330> break<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.690> demonic<00:03:27.990> okay

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
gonna be trying to break a demonic okay

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.220 
gonna be trying to break a demonic okay
she<00:03:29.490> wasn't<00:03:29.700> able<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.150> transport<00:03:30.570> probes<00:03:30.900> I

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
she wasn't able to transport probes I

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.580 
she wasn't able to transport probes I
think<00:03:31.980> therefore<00:03:32.850> which<00:03:33.540> gives<00:03:33.959> me<00:03:34.230> the

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
think therefore which gives me the

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.830 
think therefore which gives me the
advantage<00:03:34.980> she'll<00:03:35.670> have<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.030> remake<00:03:36.450> all<00:03:36.690> his

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
advantage she'll have to remake all his

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.510 
advantage she'll have to remake all his
probes<00:03:37.140> for<00:03:37.440> mr.<00:03:37.740> natural<00:03:38.010> instead<00:03:38.459> of

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
probes for mr. natural instead of

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.320 
probes for mr. natural instead of
transporting<00:03:39.090> therefore<00:03:39.930> she<00:03:40.110> will<00:03:40.230> have

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
transporting therefore she will have

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.120 
transporting therefore she will have
have<00:03:42.330> a<00:03:42.360> longer<00:03:42.660> time<00:03:42.930> before<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.470> expo<00:03:43.890> can

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
have a longer time before the expo can

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.310 
have a longer time before the expo can
kick<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.340> well<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.270> can't<00:03:45.690> just<00:03:45.720> transport

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
kick it well I can't just transport

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.070 
kick it well I can't just transport
probes<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:47.010> my<00:03:47.130> second<00:03:47.489> natural<00:03:47.580> right<00:03:47.970> away

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
probes to my second natural right away

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.890 
probes to my second natural right away
and<00:03:50.490> you<00:03:51.490> see<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.700> haven't<00:03:52.030> started<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.450> armory

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
and you see I haven't started the armory

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.590 
and you see I haven't started the armory
yet<00:03:53.200> yeah<00:03:53.830> there<00:03:54.130> he<00:03:54.370> had<00:03:54.550> a<00:03:54.580> transport<00:03:55.090> any

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
yet yeah there he had a transport any

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.540 
yet yeah there he had a transport any
probes<00:03:55.990> yet<00:03:56.230> oh<00:03:56.410> my<00:03:57.630> micro<00:03:58.630> oh<00:03:58.870> whoa<00:03:59.370> he<00:04:00.370> had

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
probes yet oh my micro oh whoa he had

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.700 
probes yet oh my micro oh whoa he had
transported<00:04:01.060> any<00:04:01.300> probes<00:04:01.600> up<00:04:01.810> there<00:04:02.320> yet<00:04:02.530> so

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
transported any probes up there yet so

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.770 
transported any probes up there yet so
he<00:04:02.890> could<00:04:03.100> not<00:04:03.130> take<00:04:03.310> advantage<00:04:04.000> of<00:04:04.210> his

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
he could not take advantage of his

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.750 
he could not take advantage of his
expansion<00:04:05.260> he's<00:04:05.770> probably<00:04:05.980> going<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.370> sneak

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
expansion he's probably going to sneak

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.550 
expansion he's probably going to sneak
another<00:04:06.970> expansion<00:04:07.540> somewhere<00:04:08.050> where<00:04:08.530> she

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
another expansion somewhere where she

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.470 
another expansion somewhere where she
can't<00:04:09.040> transport<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.790> which<00:04:10.120> is<00:04:10.270> probably

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
can't transport it which is probably

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.020 
can't transport it which is probably
gonna<00:04:10.690> beat<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:10.930> island<00:04:11.500> because<00:04:11.860> can<00:04:12.790> sneak

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
gonna beat that island because can sneak

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.840 
gonna beat that island because can sneak
any<00:04:13.210> probes<00:04:13.570> out<00:04:13.870> side<00:04:14.860> of<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.190> base<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.640> some

they don't died two minds and then I'm

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.510 
they don't died two minds and then I'm
attacking<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.470> goons<00:04:23.650> i'm<00:04:23.800> targeting<00:04:23.980> goons

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
talking to girls with my tanks I'm shift

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.530 
talking to girls with my tanks I'm shift
collecting<00:04:29.320> a<00:04:29.410> waypoint<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:30.280> am<00:04:30.670> reinforcing

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
collecting a waypoint I am reinforcing

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.390 
collecting a waypoint I am reinforcing
my<00:04:31.630> Walters<00:04:32.020> back<00:04:32.260> it's<00:04:32.650> so<00:04:32.860> important<00:04:33.370> to

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
my Walters back it's so important to

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.360 
my Walters back it's so important to
reinforce<00:04:33.910> because<00:04:34.650> sent<00:04:35.650> up<00:04:35.770> closer<00:04:36.010> to<00:04:36.220> his

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
reinforce because sent up closer to his

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.040 
reinforce because sent up closer to his
space<00:04:36.580> he<00:04:36.610> can<00:04:36.970> reinforce<00:04:37.330> one<00:04:37.600> faster

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
space he can reinforce one faster

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.730 
space he can reinforce one faster
therefore<00:04:38.800> he<00:04:39.100> could<00:04:39.280> like<00:04:39.760> lose<00:04:40.390> some<00:04:40.870> units

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
therefore he could like lose some units

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.450 
therefore he could like lose some units
and<00:04:41.920> then<00:04:42.070> push<00:04:42.310> back<00:04:42.490> again<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:44.680> got

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
and then push back again and I got

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.610 
and then push back again and I got
reinforcements<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.450> I'm<00:04:46.870> going<00:04:47.080> to<00:04:47.110> mine<00:04:47.350> up

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
reinforcements and I'm going to mine up

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.110 
reinforcements and I'm going to mine up
his<00:04:48.570> mind<00:04:49.570> up<00:04:49.780> his<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.080> joke<00:04:50.890> again<00:04:51.160> and<00:04:51.400> I'm

massing units with my tanks and
launchers<00:05:06.110> oh<00:05:06.970> he's<00:05:07.970> charging<00:05:08.270> up<00:05:08.480> again

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
launchers oh he's charging up again

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.320

that's<00:05:09.530> not<00:05:09.710> a<00:05:09.740> very<00:05:09.920> smart<00:05:10.130> move<00:05:10.460> he's<00:05:11.030> trying

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
that's not a very smart move he's trying

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.700 
that's not a very smart move he's trying
to<00:05:11.390> take<00:05:11.570> out<00:05:11.750> that<00:05:11.900> one<00:05:12.140> tank<00:05:12.380> and<00:05:12.500> he's

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
to take out that one tank and he's

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.890 
to take out that one tank and he's
losing<00:05:12.950> so<00:05:13.280> many<00:05:13.340> zealots<00:05:13.730> on<00:05:14.120> here<00:05:14.330> that's

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
losing so many zealots on here that's

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.710 
losing so many zealots on here that's
not<00:05:15.170> a<00:05:15.200> smart<00:05:15.560> move<00:05:15.680> to<00:05:15.800> do<00:05:16.070> he's<00:05:16.910> lost<00:05:17.180> like<00:05:17.480> a

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
not a smart move to do he's lost like a

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.620 
not a smart move to do he's lost like a
60<00:05:18.650> loss<00:05:18.830> for<00:05:19.100> that<00:05:19.130> one<00:05:19.430> thing<00:05:19.610> I<00:05:19.880> think<00:05:20.120> but

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
60 loss for that one thing I think but

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.150 
60 loss for that one thing I think but
now<00:05:20.780> I'm<00:05:20.870> gonna<00:05:21.020> buy<00:05:21.230> up<00:05:21.380> his<00:05:21.530> face<00:05:21.680> again<00:05:22.010> I

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
now I'm gonna buy up his face again I

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.430 
now I'm gonna buy up his face again I
have<00:05:22.310> more<00:05:22.520> things<00:05:22.730> coming<00:05:23.090> up<00:05:23.180> and<00:05:23.540> I<00:05:24.200> have

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
have more things coming up and I have

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.980 
have more things coming up and I have
little<00:05:24.650> surplus<00:05:25.040> year<00:05:25.370> but<00:05:26.120> I<00:05:26.360> guess<00:05:26.600> that's

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
little surplus year but I guess that's

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.880 
little surplus year but I guess that's
okay<00:05:27.320> i<00:05:27.590> am<00:05:28.580> reinforcing<00:05:29.570> more<00:05:29.750> units<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.470> I'm

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
okay i am reinforcing more units and I'm

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.910 
okay i am reinforcing more units and I'm
thinking<00:05:31.730> that<00:05:32.060> I'm<00:05:33.020> gonna<00:05:33.740> make<00:05:33.890> some

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
thinking that I'm gonna make some

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.380 
thinking that I'm gonna make some
tourists<00:05:34.370> to<00:05:34.580> repel<00:05:35.240> some<00:05:35.690> observers<00:05:36.470> or<00:05:37.390> that

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
tourists to repel some observers or that

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
perhaps to get my some advantage and he
