00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
artist and then you see something like

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.740 
artist and then you see something like
this<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.629> go<00:00:57.930> maybe<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:59.480> because<00:01:00.480> it's

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
this you go maybe not because it's

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
really good artwork and it's so it means

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.050

writing<00:01:13.350> itself<00:01:13.710> which<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.520> found<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.909> be

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
writing itself which I found to be

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.420 
writing itself which I found to be
pretty<00:01:15.060> clever<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.020> liked<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.500> read<00:01:17.220> this

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
pretty clever and I liked it I read this

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.070 
pretty clever and I liked it I read this
first<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.180> was<00:01:18.299> long<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> little<00:01:18.990> bit

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
first one and it was long a little bit

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.749 
first one and it was long a little bit
longer<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:19.920> all<00:01:20.070> rhyming<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.640> I

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
longer and it was all rhyming and I

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.420 
longer and it was all rhyming and I
thought<00:01:21.140> like<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> very<00:01:23.159> quickly

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
thought like this but it very quickly

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.310 
thought like this but it very quickly
moves<00:01:23.790> into<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.509> sentence<00:01:24.900> per<00:01:25.080> page

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
moves into like one sentence per page

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.490 
moves into like one sentence per page
for<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> beautiful<00:01:26.250> page<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.670> should<00:01:26.820> say<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:28.020> so

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
for a beautiful page I should say and so

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.140 
for a beautiful page I should say and so
and<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.009> several<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.490> them<00:01:29.610> are<00:01:29.729> pretty<00:01:29.880> clever

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
and in several of them are pretty clever

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.300 
and in several of them are pretty clever
in<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.780> thought<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.020> was<00:01:31.140> fun<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:32.130> for

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
in that so I thought it was fun so for

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.649 
in that so I thought it was fun so for
me<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.520> writing<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.909> really<00:01:33.090> good<00:01:33.299> four<00:01:33.540> out

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
me the writing is really good four out

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.440 
me the writing is really good four out
of<00:01:33.689> five<00:01:33.900> stars<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> writing<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.939> concept

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
of five stars on the writing the concept

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.420 
of five stars on the writing the concept
of<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.689> snowman<00:01:36.930> living<00:01:37.799> throughout<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> year

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
of a snowman living throughout the year

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.700 
of a snowman living throughout the year
and<00:01:38.549> what<00:01:38.700> he<00:01:38.850> would<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.150> doing<00:01:39.710> oftentimes

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and what he would be doing oftentimes

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.670 
and what he would be doing oftentimes
it's<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:42.000> nothing<00:01:42.240> that's<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:43.110> this

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
it's it's it's nothing that's like this

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.469 
it's it's it's nothing that's like this
genius<00:01:44.220> thing<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:44.909> kind<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.240> funny

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
genius thing but it's just kind of funny

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.410 
genius thing but it's just kind of funny
to<00:01:45.659> think<00:01:45.869> about<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> snowman<00:01:46.560> go<00:01:46.590> into<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> zoo

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
to think about a snowman go into the zoo

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.870 
to think about a snowman go into the zoo
the<00:01:48.420> snowman<00:01:48.869> had<00:01:49.170> go<00:01:49.350> into<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> birthday<00:01:49.979> party

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the snowman had go into a birthday party

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.550 
the snowman had go into a birthday party
it's<00:01:51.210> snowman<00:01:51.509> watching<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> fireworks<00:01:52.170> on

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it's snowman watching the fireworks on

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.469 
it's snowman watching the fireworks on
the<00:01:52.590> fourth<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.950> July<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.280> mean<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.119> those<00:01:54.299> are

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the fourth of July I mean so those are

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.719 
the fourth of July I mean so those are
kind<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.079> funny<00:01:55.320> concepts<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.340> writing

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
kind of funny concepts the writing

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.940 
kind of funny concepts the writing
itself<00:01:57.060> isn't<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.570> amazing<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.469> it's<00:01:58.710> still

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
itself isn't like amazing but it's still

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.120 
itself isn't like amazing but it's still
it's<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.579> cool<00:01:59.820> idea<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:00.829> concept<00:02:01.829> here<00:02:02.040> is

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
it's a cool idea and so concept here is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.100 
it's a cool idea and so concept here is
probably<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.549> 5<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> 5<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.600> writing<00:02:03.930> here

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
probably a 5 out of 5 the writing here

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.109 
probably a 5 out of 5 the writing here
is<00:02:04.229> probably<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.590> 3<00:02:04.860> out<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.070> 5<00:02:05.130> but<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.670> still<00:02:05.939> is

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
is probably a 3 out of 5 but it still is

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.869 
is probably a 3 out of 5 but it still is
pretty<00:02:06.390> good<00:02:06.740> we<00:02:07.740> get<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> ending<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
pretty good we get to the ending and the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.770 
pretty good we get to the ending and the
ending<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> little<00:02:09.509> bit<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.720> a

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
ending is a little bit of a

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.119 
ending is a little bit of a
disappointment<00:02:10.050> for<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.590> rest<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.950> book

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
disappointment for the rest of the book

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.699 
disappointment for the rest of the book
being<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.640> interesting<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.660> fun

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
being so interesting and fun

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.170 
being so interesting and fun
we<00:02:13.980> get<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.340> end<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.670> it's<00:02:14.819> kind<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.030> like

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
we get to the end and it's kind of like

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.270 
we get to the end and it's kind of like
well<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.110> guess<00:02:16.409> that<00:02:16.590> makes<00:02:16.709> sense<00:02:16.769> you<00:02:17.159> know

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
well I guess that makes sense you know

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.740 
well I guess that makes sense you know
and<00:02:17.459> so<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.819> get<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.209> end<00:02:18.329> and<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.569> kind

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
and so you get to the end and it's kind

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.990 
and so you get to the end and it's kind
of<00:02:18.810> lackluster<00:02:18.989> after<00:02:19.650> all<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.730> would

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
of lackluster after all that I would

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.670 
of lackluster after all that I would
even<00:02:21.209> go<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.569> far<00:02:21.720> as<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.959> say<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.319> ending<00:02:22.560> is

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
even go so far as to say the ending is

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.050 
even go so far as to say the ending is
probably<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.040> two<00:02:23.189> and<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.400> half<00:02:23.549> out<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.849> five

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
probably a two and a half out of five

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.390 
probably a two and a half out of five
stars<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.959> really<00:02:25.290> pulls<00:02:25.650> down<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.950> value

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
stars and it really pulls down the value

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.949 
stars and it really pulls down the value
of<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.610> book<00:02:26.819> because<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.299> rest<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.599> it<00:02:27.689> is<00:02:27.810> so

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
of the book because the rest of it is so

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.440 
of the book because the rest of it is so
cute<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.349> clever<00:02:28.939> overall<00:02:29.939> though<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> can

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
cute and clever overall though I can

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.330 
cute and clever overall though I can
still<00:02:30.689> heartily<00:02:31.140> recommend<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.189> a
