now guys it's Robin I've just got my

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.860 
now guys it's Robin I've just got my
little<00:00:02.010> hobbyking<00:00:02.850> quad<00:00:03.120> with<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.480> multi

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
little hobbyking quad with the multi

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.260 
little hobbyking quad with the multi
wave<00:00:04.020> pro<00:00:04.319> board<00:00:04.560> just<00:00:05.460> once<00:00:05.700> again<00:00:05.940> showing

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
wave pro board just once again showing

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.830 
wave pro board just once again showing
you<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.629> GPS<00:00:07.319> hover<00:00:08.240> so<00:00:09.240> it's<00:00:09.360> moving<00:00:09.630> around

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
you the GPS hover so it's moving around

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.690 
you the GPS hover so it's moving around
quite<00:00:10.260> dramatically<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.490> height<00:00:11.670> is

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
quite dramatically and the height is

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.320 
quite dramatically and the height is
just<00:00:11.940> not<00:00:12.300> staying<00:00:12.690> consistent<00:00:12.780> at<00:00:13.320> all<00:00:14.330> quite

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
just not staying consistent at all quite

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.560 
just not staying consistent at all quite
windy<00:00:15.570> today<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:16.699> just<00:00:17.699> thought<00:00:17.910> I'd<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.539> a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
windy today I just thought I'd do a

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.330 
windy today I just thought I'd do a
quick<00:00:18.630> demonstration<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:19.650> squad<00:00:20.039> and

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
quick demonstration of this squad and

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.189 
quick demonstration of this squad and
then<00:00:20.670> I'll<00:00:20.789> compare<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.840> ones<00:00:22.020> with

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
then I'll compare it to the ones with

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.320 
then I'll compare it to the ones with
the<00:00:22.320> Naza<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.460> there's<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.910> huge<00:00:24.060> difference

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
the Naza so there's a huge difference

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.240 
the Naza so there's a huge difference
see<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.019> just<00:00:25.260> blew<00:00:25.470> back<00:00:25.680> about<00:00:25.980> five

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
see that just blew back about five

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.089 
see that just blew back about five
meters<00:00:26.640> then<00:00:30.170> it's<00:00:31.170> really<00:00:31.470> moving<00:00:31.740> all<00:00:32.070> over

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
meters then it's really moving all over

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.430 
meters then it's really moving all over
the<00:00:32.309> place<00:00:32.399> now<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.000> climbing<00:00:33.440> climbing

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the place now it's climbing climbing

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.660 
the place now it's climbing climbing
about<00:00:34.770> 40<00:00:35.160> feet<00:00:35.340> high<00:00:37.219> look<00:00:38.219> at<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.460> it's

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
about 40 feet high look at that it's

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.340 
about 40 feet high look at that it's
just<00:00:38.879> skyrocketing<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.690> haven't<00:00:39.960> even<00:00:40.050> touched

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
just skyrocketing I haven't even touched

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.430 
just skyrocketing I haven't even touched
the<00:00:40.559> controls<00:00:40.950> at<00:00:41.129> all<00:00:42.110> trying<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.140> work<00:00:43.290> that

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the controls at all trying to work that

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:53.840 
the controls at all trying to work that
one<00:00:43.590> out<00:00:51.949> okay<00:00:52.949> I'll<00:00:53.129> stop<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> video<00:00:53.640> then

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
one out okay I'll stop the video then

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.029 
one out okay I'll stop the video then
I'll<00:00:54.030> land<00:00:54.210> Enola<00:00:54.719> I'll<00:00:55.020> put<00:00:55.440> one<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.710> mine<00:00:55.860> as

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
I'll land Enola I'll put one of mine as

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.010 
I'll land Enola I'll put one of mine as
our<00:00:56.219> four<00:00:56.399> quizzes<00:00:56.579> quads<00:00:57.360> up<00:00:57.539> you'll<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
our four quizzes quads up you'll see the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
our four quizzes quads up you'll see the
difference<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> comparison

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
difference and just for a comparison

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.380 
difference and just for a comparison
there's<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.890> Cobra<00:01:01.890> King<00:01:02.100> X<00:01:02.280> six<00:01:02.640> 50s<00:01:03.149> with

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
there's the Cobra King X six 50s with

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.289 
there's the Cobra King X six 50s with
the<00:01:03.510> Naza<00:01:03.750> you'll<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:05.760> altitude<00:01:06.150> and

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
the Naza you'll see the the altitude and

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.820 
the Naza you'll see the the altitude and
position<00:01:06.659> hold<00:01:06.900> under<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.170> exactly<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> same

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
position hold under the exactly the same

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.880 
position hold under the exactly the same
wind<00:01:08.220> conditions<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.360> much<00:01:09.510> better

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
wind conditions is just so much better

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.289 
wind conditions is just so much better
there's<00:01:10.890> really<00:01:11.040> no<00:01:11.250> comparison<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:12.180> is

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
there's really no comparison it is

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.550 
there's really no comparison it is
moving<00:01:12.689> around<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.930> little<00:01:13.020> bit<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.409> it's

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
moving around a little bit but it's

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.130 
moving around a little bit but it's
basically<00:01:14.070> staying<00:01:14.340> within<00:01:14.810> within<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.900> meter

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
basically staying within within a meter

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.310 
basically staying within within a meter
of<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:17.100> same<00:01:17.280> position<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.900> heights<00:01:19.110> not

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
of the same position and the heights not

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.830 
of the same position and the heights not
deviating<00:01:19.950> by<00:01:20.070> more<00:01:20.310> than<00:01:20.460> two<00:01:21.299> or<00:01:21.390> three<00:01:21.420> feet
