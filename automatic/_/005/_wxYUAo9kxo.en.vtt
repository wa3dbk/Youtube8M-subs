00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello you dear welcome to 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.000
 mayday in suite amira and today with 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.710
 a valentines day special for wine and 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.360
 Tuesday is just around the corner 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.219
 and if you have something now 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.809
 needs to surprise your loved ones 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.300
 I have a great idea now 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.560
 for you and heart voves I became 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.820
 also a few times asked the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.480
 to do it and today it is finally 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.730
 so far 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.710
 First, we have to make sure that 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.820
 We also price the notch form of the wicki 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.010
 hinbekommen 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.840
 and there is a whole 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.090
 simple trick i have mine 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.550
 just such a one is already one 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.559
 bit dirty got march 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.360
 printed from the internet and the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.239
 Here I am laying under a baking paper 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.180
 a bit closer and from the quasi the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.710
 So, go ahead and draw 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.899
 just after 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.239
 and because of course we do not want that 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.160
 our bus to taste the meat 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.469
 would be pretty good 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.909
 Let's just turn it all over 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.860
 the baking tray and can be on his 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.680
 But sparkle is still never heart 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.450
 to recognize why we do that 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.049
 first and then set to first 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.479
 side and take care of the dough for it 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.400
 old principle again the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.990
 mix dry ingredients together 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.090
 before we add it to the liquid 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:31.759
 Add and for this I have here 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:35.700
 flour and the cocoa for here and 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.750
 baking powder and the former I everything 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.750
 ever so busy with each other 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.360
 so the laundry is now for the first time 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.670
 page and now we take care of that 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.759
 other ingredients and for that I live as 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.950
 Next, add the butter and beat the 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.020
 nice and creamy until the sun is whitish 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.040
 color gets and then I leave slowly 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.040
 the sugar to it are 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.170
 bradleys it is one that could be now 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.880
 beat again about a minute ago 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.410
 before we change the food color 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.880
 Add and of course we need 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.880
 also the vanilla extract 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.490
 next we come to 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.160
 Food coloring I love gfp ruby 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.750
 Price because if you are a rather dark 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.820
 shows has to color then you need 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.890
 a particularly strong color and goes 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.510
 colors are just a lot stronger in 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.130
 the coloring as now liquid colors 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.980
 and so I would also 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.120
 recommend for the vip price you can 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.180
 now liquid color also like times 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.040
 but i really would like to try you 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.860
 The colors or silvery colors are recommended 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.770
 to use and for that I take now 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.180
 about a good teaspoon 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.180
 first and look at it again 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.490
 if because everything so nice to each other 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.560
 Connected is this bright red bike 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.220
 then we enter slowly in about three 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.890
 hours 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.480
 the flour to it and until everything just now 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.480
 mixed so we beat that 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.820
 in that we subsequently the muvi price 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.740
 must inject in this heart shape 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.090
 dough of consistency two 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.520
 be bubbly but still relatively 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.710
 firm and that can now be 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.030
 bit with buttermilk out at the moment 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.310
 he is still too tight 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.130
 So I will definitely have to 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.810
 and then I look the way I do 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.020
 slowly to the best consistency would be 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.620
 but that's about 250 milliliters 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.620
 you already need it 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.780
 so the dough is ready and now wants 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.969
 I 'm all here in the building 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.980
 or tend to freezer bags where I just 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:01.829
 still occurred and a wealth 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.109
 I should put it in so often 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:08.889
 and here comes the now purely so I 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:11.590
 him right now in heart shape on 16 can now 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.090
 Let's use our hearts on the tin itself 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.739
 her now the line through the camera 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.449
 not so good but i can still remember it 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.609
 recognize well 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.940
 and that will be for you at home too 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.940
 be so 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.990
 then always gets his finger again 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.820
 so correct a bit and that 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.100
 little hearts are now coming at 180 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.920
 circulated in the preheated oven 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.900
 for about ten minutes so the doll 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.670
 Cooled down and I always have one 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.500
 few picked the especially good 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.620
 fit together and this time like this 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.970
 exemplary and now 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.040
 Of course we still need it 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.870
 make a filling very clear and for that 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.810
 we are a classic American 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.340
 frosting with vanilla flavor and for that 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.950
 Let's start with feed and 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.590
 cream cheese premich and then give 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.430
 vanilla extract and then whole 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.430
 slowly add the icing sugar 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:21.889
 I already have the game here 

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:23.419
 filled my son injection bag and 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.289
 just a normal opening for it 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.909
 used 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.989
 it does not matter how the last one 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.509
 endes looks because we want 

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:31.489
 In any case, only fill so now 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:37.629
 we just do not use our filling 

00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:37.629
 too far out on the middle section and 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.979
 put the other half on top of it 

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:48.409
 and these are the finished wicki price 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.759
 how can you give away as well now ? 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.169
 you definitely write if yours 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.759
 loved it and how 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.979
 it has become with you and see you 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.979
 also the other videos on and see you soon
