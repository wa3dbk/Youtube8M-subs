hello it's Jenny to make robots like ODU
games<00:00:11.330> is<00:00:11.719> a<00:00:11.750> bit<00:00:11.930> of<00:00:12.020> an<00:00:12.110> update<00:00:12.260> on<00:00:12.740> Android

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
games is a bit of an update on Android

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.679 
games is a bit of an update on Android
12<00:00:15.010> so<00:00:16.010> last<00:00:16.219> time<00:00:16.460> I<00:00:16.490> showed<00:00:16.820> you<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:17.240> Android

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
12 so last time I showed you the Android

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.690 
12 so last time I showed you the Android
sort<00:00:18.200> of<00:00:18.380> jumping<00:00:18.830> from<00:00:19.009> one<00:00:19.189> foot<00:00:19.430> to<00:00:19.490> the

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
sort of jumping from one foot to the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.990 
sort of jumping from one foot to the
other<00:00:19.730> using<00:00:20.300> gyros<00:00:20.840> to<00:00:21.170> stay<00:00:21.380> stable<00:00:22.009> so<00:00:22.880> it's

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
other using gyros to stay stable so it's

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.569 
other using gyros to stay stable so it's
got<00:00:23.119> a<00:00:23.150> number<00:00:23.300> of<00:00:23.540> gyros<00:00:24.020> on<00:00:24.200> it<00:00:24.579> I'm

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:25.579 
got a number of gyros on it I'm

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:26.979 
got a number of gyros on it I'm
including<00:00:26.060> this<00:00:26.180> one<00:00:26.329> at<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:26.570> top<00:00:26.779> and

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:26.989 
including this one at the top and

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.080 
including this one at the top and
various<00:00:27.380> other<00:00:27.560> gyros<00:00:28.489> I<00:00:28.520> think<00:00:28.759> there's<00:00:28.910> nine

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
various other gyros I think there's nine

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.019 
various other gyros I think there's nine
gyros<00:00:29.689> on<00:00:29.869> it<00:00:29.989> that<00:00:30.800> seems<00:00:31.040> to<00:00:31.130> work<00:00:31.279> okay<00:00:31.700> and

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
gyros on it that seems to work okay and

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.370 
gyros on it that seems to work okay and
the<00:00:32.119> plan<00:00:32.329> was<00:00:32.509> to<00:00:32.540> try<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:32.809> get<00:00:32.960> some<00:00:33.140> short

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
the plan was to try and get some short

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.870 
the plan was to try and get some short
steps<00:00:33.710> in<00:00:33.920> in<00:00:34.040> between<00:00:34.130> to<00:00:34.460> make<00:00:34.489> it<00:00:34.760> walk

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
steps in in between to make it walk

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.270 
steps in in between to make it walk
along<00:00:35.239> which<00:00:36.050> I've<00:00:36.230> just<00:00:36.530> about<00:00:36.710> achieved

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
along which I've just about achieved

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.709 
along which I've just about achieved
although<00:00:37.670> it<00:00:37.820> doesn't<00:00:38.059> work<00:00:38.180> as<00:00:38.360> well<00:00:38.390> as<00:00:38.600> I'd

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
although it doesn't work as well as I'd

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.470 
although it doesn't work as well as I'd
like<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:38.989> to<00:00:39.340> I've<00:00:40.340> made<00:00:40.490> a<00:00:40.520> few<00:00:40.760> tweaks<00:00:41.060> to<00:00:41.240> it

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
like it to I've made a few tweaks to it

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.560 
like it to I've made a few tweaks to it
including<00:00:41.780> taking<00:00:42.530> out<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.250> damping<00:00:44.210> as<00:00:44.450> I

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
including taking out the damping as I

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.660 
including taking out the damping as I
had<00:00:44.750> on<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:44.990> hip<00:00:45.200> actuator<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.190> replacing

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
had on the hip actuator and replacing

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.240 
had on the hip actuator and replacing
them<00:00:46.760> with<00:00:46.820> solid<00:00:47.240> links<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:48.800> main<00:00:48.950> problem

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
them with solid links the main problem

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.790 
them with solid links the main problem
I've<00:00:49.310> got<00:00:49.340> at<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:49.550> moment<00:00:49.640> is<00:00:50.000> that<00:00:50.060> the<00:00:50.330> hip

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
I've got at the moment is that the hip

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.220 
I've got at the moment is that the hip
servos<00:00:51.800> aren't<00:00:52.100> really<00:00:52.250> strong<00:00:52.520> enough<00:00:52.670> so

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
servos aren't really strong enough so

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.150 
servos aren't really strong enough so
they're<00:00:54.230> not<00:00:54.320> really<00:00:54.530> strong<00:00:54.710> enough<00:00:54.829> to<00:00:55.010> move

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
they're not really strong enough to move

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160 
they're not really strong enough to move
the<00:00:55.340> thighs<00:00:55.940> backwards<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.540> forwards<00:00:56.870> so<00:00:56.990> all

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
the thighs backwards and forwards so all

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.450 
the thighs backwards and forwards so all
was<00:00:57.380> happening<00:00:57.560> was<00:00:57.890> these<00:00:58.040> were<00:00:58.100> getting

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
was happening was these were getting

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.060 
was happening was these were getting
compressed<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.329> links<00:00:59.600> weren't<00:00:59.870> moving

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
compressed and the links weren't moving

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.190 
compressed and the links weren't moving
I've<00:01:01.460> now<00:01:01.610> leaveth<00:01:02.030> them<00:01:02.180> right<00:01:02.420> up<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:03.020> move

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
I've now leaveth them right up to move

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.520 
I've now leaveth them right up to move
the<00:01:03.320> thighs<00:01:03.560> they'd<00:01:04.460> only<00:01:04.579> take<00:01:04.879> small<00:01:05.180> steps

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
the thighs they'd only take small steps

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.770 
the thighs they'd only take small steps
but<00:01:06.530> it<00:01:06.950> does<00:01:07.100> actually<00:01:07.369> move<00:01:07.820> forwards<00:01:08.390> so

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
but it does actually move forwards so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.030 
but it does actually move forwards so
I'll<00:01:08.899> show<00:01:09.079> you<00:01:09.170> what<00:01:09.320> it<00:01:09.439> does<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:09.920> then

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
I'll show you what it does and then

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.499 
I'll show you what it does and then
we'll<00:01:10.189> discuss<00:01:10.399> the<00:01:10.759> way<00:01:10.880> forward<00:01:10.909> for<00:01:11.360> the

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
we'll discuss the way forward for the

00:01:11.509 --> 00:02:06.630 
we'll discuss the way forward for the
modifications<00:01:12.229> I<00:01:12.440> need<00:01:12.620> to<00:01:12.740> make

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.080 

so<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.730> big<00:02:07.880> issues<00:02:08.179> I've<00:02:08.390> got<00:02:08.660> are<00:02:10.090> basically

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
so the big issues I've got are basically

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.990 
so the big issues I've got are basically
around<00:02:11.390> obviously<00:02:12.200> sort<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:13.010> stability<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.700> I

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
around obviously sort of stability so I

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.600 
around obviously sort of stability so I
had<00:02:14.210> these<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.690> idea<00:02:14.720> was<00:02:15.110> they<00:02:15.200> had<00:02:15.410> these

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
had these the idea was they had these

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.850 
had these the idea was they had these
shock<00:02:16.610> absorbers<00:02:16.640> which<00:02:17.300> will<00:02:17.480> compress<00:02:17.930> and

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
shock absorbers which will compress and

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.130 
shock absorbers which will compress and
the<00:02:18.950> aim<00:02:19.040> was<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.340> training<00:02:19.970> but<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:21.020> would

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
the aim was the training but it would

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.470 
the aim was the training but it would
compress<00:02:21.590> onto<00:02:21.980> there<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.490> there's<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.090> servo

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
compress onto there and there's a servo

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.810 
compress onto there and there's a servo
in<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.720> back<00:02:24.070> which<00:02:25.070> is<00:02:25.220> sort<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.430> like<00:02:25.490> an

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
in the back which is sort of like an

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.570 
in the back which is sort of like an
active<00:02:26.180> Achilles<00:02:26.570> tendon<00:02:27.110> we<00:02:28.010> could<00:02:28.160> gyrate

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
active Achilles tendon we could gyrate

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.180 
active Achilles tendon we could gyrate
to<00:02:28.700> keep<00:02:28.850> it<00:02:28.940> upright<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.680> problem<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.010> the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
to keep it upright so the problem is the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.800 
to keep it upright so the problem is the
steps<00:02:31.430> are<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:31.730> small<00:02:32.030> with<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:32.390> doesn't<00:02:32.540> get<00:02:32.780> a

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
steps are so small with it doesn't get a

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.110 
steps are so small with it doesn't get a
chance<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.350> roll<00:02:33.530> road<00:02:33.709> for<00:02:33.950> its<00:02:34.100> foot<00:02:34.400> so

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
chance the roll road for its foot so

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.310 
chance the roll road for its foot so
what's<00:02:35.330> happening<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.810> it's<00:02:36.020> kind<00:02:36.260> of

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
what's happening is it's kind of

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.110 
what's happening is it's kind of
bouncing<00:02:36.950> just<00:02:37.160> on<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.520> end<00:02:37.730> of<00:02:37.970> these

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
bouncing just on the end of these

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.229 
bouncing just on the end of these
Springs<00:02:38.600> so<00:02:39.350> I<00:02:39.380> tried<00:02:39.760> winding<00:02:40.760> them<00:02:40.910> up<00:02:41.030> to

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
Springs so I tried winding them up to

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.120 
Springs so I tried winding them up to
make<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.570> tighter<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.260> winding<00:02:42.770> them<00:02:42.950> down

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
make the tighter and winding them down

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.680 
make the tighter and winding them down
to<00:02:43.310> make<00:02:43.459> them<00:02:43.580> less<00:02:43.760> tight<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.660> just

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
to make them less tight and so it just

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.290 
to make them less tight and so it just
falls<00:02:45.050> over<00:02:45.200> forwards<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.850> result<00:02:47.150> is

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
falls over forwards and the result is

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.290 
falls over forwards and the result is
always<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.570> same<00:02:47.770> so<00:02:48.770> really<00:02:49.190> with<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.489> stride

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
always the same so really with a stride

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.240 
always the same so really with a stride
length<00:02:50.570> only<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:51.140> big<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:51.650> guess<00:02:51.920> that's<00:02:52.130> all

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
length only that big I guess that's all

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.850 
length only that big I guess that's all
what<00:02:52.430> can<00:02:52.520> be<00:02:52.670> expected<00:02:53.470> really<00:02:54.470> I<00:02:54.500> sort<00:02:54.800> of

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
what can be expected really I sort of

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.640 
what can be expected really I sort of
made<00:02:55.070> you<00:02:55.610> know<00:02:55.730> it's<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:56.110> roll<00:02:57.110> along<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.500> its

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
made you know it's a roll along to its

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.490 
made you know it's a roll along to its
tones<00:02:58.450> but<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.480> can't<00:02:59.750> do<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:00.020> because<00:03:00.290> the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
tones but I can't do that because the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.560 
tones but I can't do that because the
thigh<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.040> don't<00:03:01.580> move<00:03:01.730> very<00:03:01.790> far<00:03:02.209> which<00:03:02.420> is

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
thigh is don't move very far which is

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.810 
thigh is don't move very far which is
why<00:03:02.690> it's<00:03:02.870> taking<00:03:03.170> such<00:03:03.380> small<00:03:03.650> steps<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.730> the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
why it's taking such small steps and the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.729 
why it's taking such small steps and the
reason<00:03:05.150> for<00:03:05.270> that<00:03:05.330> is<00:03:05.600> the<00:03:05.780> servos<00:03:06.230> I've<00:03:06.410> used

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
reason for that is the servos I've used

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.350 
reason for that is the servos I've used
even<00:03:07.010> though<00:03:07.130> they're<00:03:07.280> 15<00:03:07.640> kilogram<00:03:08.150> per

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
even though they're 15 kilogram per

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.710 
even though they're 15 kilogram per
centimeter<00:03:08.570> talk<00:03:09.440> servos<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.420> they<00:03:11.420> leave<00:03:11.570> it

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
centimeter talk servos and they leave it

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.310 
centimeter talk servos and they leave it
up<00:03:11.810> quite<00:03:12.110> tight<00:03:13.120> if<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.299> increase<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.900> travel

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
up quite tight if I increase the travel

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.630 
up quite tight if I increase the travel
it<00:03:15.440> means<00:03:15.650> moving<00:03:15.980> this<00:03:16.220> rod<00:03:16.459> out<00:03:16.810> so<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:17.989> the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
it means moving this rod out so that the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.640 
it means moving this rod out so that the
servo<00:03:19.640> makes<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.150> thigh<00:03:20.330> move<00:03:20.630> further<00:03:21.290> for

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
servo makes the thigh move further for

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.259 
servo makes the thigh move further for
the<00:03:21.739> equivalent<00:03:21.980> amount<00:03:22.430> of<00:03:22.519> serve<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:22.940> move

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
the equivalent amount of serve I move

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.970 
the equivalent amount of serve I move
but<00:03:23.900> obviously<00:03:24.110> that<00:03:24.290> increases<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.769> pulse

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
but obviously that increases the pulse

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.070 
but obviously that increases the pulse
on<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.280> servo<00:03:25.730> so<00:03:26.180> you<00:03:26.269> basically<00:03:26.450> lose<00:03:26.870> the

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
on the servo so you basically lose the

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.080 
on the servo so you basically lose the
torque<00:03:27.320> which<00:03:28.130> means<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:28.670> it<00:03:28.760> hasn't<00:03:28.880> got

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
torque which means that it hasn't got

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.880 
torque which means that it hasn't got
enough<00:03:29.269> power<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.690> push<00:03:30.049> back<00:03:30.260> on<00:03:30.530> its<00:03:30.650> back

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
enough power to push back on its back

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.460 
enough power to push back on its back
foot<00:03:31.390> and<00:03:32.390> bring<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.750> other<00:03:32.870> one<00:03:32.959> forward

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
foot and bring the other one forward

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.509 
foot and bring the other one forward
basically<00:03:36.470> because<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.829> lead<00:03:36.980> which<00:03:37.160> is<00:03:37.310> too

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
basically because the lead which is too

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.400 
basically because the lead which is too
large<00:03:37.549> so<00:03:38.329> there's<00:03:38.510> less<00:03:38.600> talk<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.110> it<00:03:39.200> can't

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
large so there's less talk and it can't

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.380 
large so there's less talk and it can't
push<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:39.650> push<00:03:40.070> is<00:03:40.190> hollow<00:03:40.400> load<00:03:40.640> on<00:03:40.940> one<00:03:40.970> foot

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
push it push is hollow load on one foot

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.229 
push it push is hollow load on one foot
back<00:03:42.190> so<00:03:43.190> that's<00:03:43.370> why<00:03:43.549> it's<00:03:43.670> got<00:03:43.760> such<00:03:44.030> small

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
back so that's why it's got such small

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.449 
back so that's why it's got such small
steps<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.930> then<00:03:45.049> it<00:03:45.170> just<00:03:45.350> kind<00:03:45.890> of<00:03:45.920> bounces

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
steps and then it just kind of bounces

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.270 
steps and then it just kind of bounces
on<00:03:46.610> these<00:03:46.820> Springs<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:48.650> result<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.100> what

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
on these Springs and the result is what

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.770 
on these Springs and the result is what
you<00:03:49.400> see<00:03:49.610> so<00:03:49.910> you<00:03:49.970> can<00:03:50.000> just<00:03:50.269> about<00:03:50.540> move

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
you see so you can just about move

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.449 
you see so you can just about move
forward<00:03:51.170> but<00:03:51.320> it's<00:03:51.440> walking<00:03:51.590> with<00:03:51.890> very<00:03:52.130> flat

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
forward but it's walking with very flat

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.470 
forward but it's walking with very flat
feet<00:03:53.230> so<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.350> next<00:03:54.560> plan<00:03:54.829> for<00:03:55.310> Android<00:03:55.790> 12<00:03:56.180> rib

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
feet so the next plan for Android 12 rib

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.759 
feet so the next plan for Android 12 rib
B<00:03:56.810> is<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:58.519> replace<00:03:59.090> this<00:03:59.480> actuator<00:04:00.440> mechanism

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
B is to replace this actuator mechanism

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.240 
B is to replace this actuator mechanism
with<00:04:01.400> something<00:04:01.910> much<00:04:02.090> stronger<00:04:02.890> so<00:04:03.890> my<00:04:04.010> plan

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
with something much stronger so my plan

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.340 
with something much stronger so my plan
is<00:04:04.459> instead<00:04:04.850> of<00:04:04.940> having<00:04:05.030> servos<00:04:05.720> driving<00:04:06.260> the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
is instead of having servos driving the

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.740 
is instead of having servos driving the
thighs<00:04:06.560> I'm<00:04:06.980> going<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.280> build<00:04:07.430> some<00:04:07.640> new

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
thighs I'm going to build some new

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.180 
thighs I'm going to build some new
actuators<00:04:08.799> with<00:04:09.799> something<00:04:10.040> I've<00:04:10.160> been

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
actuators with something I've been

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.220 
actuators with something I've been
thinking<00:04:10.640> about<00:04:10.730> for<00:04:11.209> a<00:04:11.239> while<00:04:11.299> for<00:04:11.720> robotics

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
thinking about for a while for robotics

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.710 
thinking about for a while for robotics
I'm<00:04:12.980> going<00:04:13.190> to<00:04:13.250> build<00:04:13.430> a<00:04:13.549> linear<00:04:13.819> actuator<00:04:14.330> and

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
I'm going to build a linear actuator and

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.360 
I'm going to build a linear actuator and
the<00:04:14.810> reason<00:04:15.080> I'm<00:04:15.170> showing<00:04:15.440> you<00:04:15.500> a<00:04:15.560> 3d<00:04:15.860> printer

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
the reason I'm showing you a 3d printer

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.210 
the reason I'm showing you a 3d printer
is<00:04:16.640> because<00:04:16.970> it<00:04:17.120> has<00:04:17.239> just<00:04:17.270> that<00:04:17.720> so<00:04:18.080> this<00:04:18.859> 3d

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
is because it has just that so this 3d

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.819 
is because it has just that so this 3d
printer<00:04:19.520> has<00:04:19.640> a

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
printer has a

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.439 
printer has a
carriage<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.310> moves<00:04:20.519> backwards<00:04:20.939> and<00:04:21.060> Fords

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
carriage the moves backwards and Fords

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.260 
carriage the moves backwards and Fords
and<00:04:22.379> moves<00:04:22.650> on<00:04:22.830> these<00:04:23.009> steel<00:04:23.310> bars<00:04:23.610> using

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
and moves on these steel bars using

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.409 
and moves on these steel bars using
linear<00:04:24.990> bearings<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.860> all<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:26.849> striving<00:04:27.180> it

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
linear bearings and all the striving it

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.179 
linear bearings and all the striving it
is<00:04:27.539> a<00:04:27.569> belt<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.199> you<00:04:28.259> can<00:04:28.500> probably<00:04:28.710> see<00:04:28.979> this

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:29.189 
is a belt so you can probably see this

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.369 
is a belt so you can probably see this
turning<00:04:29.610> as<00:04:29.729> I'm<00:04:29.879> moving<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.449> so<00:04:31.199> this<00:04:31.289> is

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:31.379 
turning as I'm moving it so this is

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:33.020 
turning as I'm moving it so this is
actually<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.680> stepper<00:04:31.979> motor<00:04:32.280> I'll<00:04:32.639> be<00:04:32.759> using<00:04:32.849> a

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
actually a stepper motor I'll be using a

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.390 
actually a stepper motor I'll be using a
DC<00:04:33.419> motor<00:04:33.629> with<00:04:34.080> some<00:04:34.439> feedback<00:04:35.069> like<00:04:35.340> a

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
DC motor with some feedback like a

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.580 
DC motor with some feedback like a
slider<00:04:36.090> pot<00:04:36.449> or<00:04:36.629> something<00:04:36.990> like<00:04:37.110> that

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
slider pot or something like that

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.439 
slider pot or something like that
and<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:38.430> reason<00:04:38.699> for<00:04:38.729> that<00:04:38.909> is<00:04:39.060> if<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.270> legs

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
and the reason for that is if the legs

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.209 
and the reason for that is if the legs
get<00:04:39.659> jammed<00:04:39.990> and<00:04:40.199> the<00:04:40.259> stepper<00:04:40.560> motor<00:04:40.680> misses

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:41.219 
get jammed and the stepper motor misses

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.279 
get jammed and the stepper motor misses
some<00:04:41.370> steps<00:04:41.669> it<00:04:41.879> won't<00:04:42.060> know<00:04:42.180> where<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.479> is<00:04:42.629> so

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
some steps it won't know where it is so

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.230 
some steps it won't know where it is so
I'd<00:04:43.409> need<00:04:43.560> another<00:04:43.620> feedback<00:04:44.189> encoder<00:04:44.759> anyway

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
I'd need another feedback encoder anyway

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.640 
I'd need another feedback encoder anyway
so<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.509> might<00:04:45.599> as<00:04:45.810> well<00:04:45.900> just<00:04:46.169> make<00:04:46.319> that<00:04:46.590> the

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
so I might as well just make that the

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.059 
so I might as well just make that the
feedback<00:04:47.009> in<00:04:47.460> you<00:04:47.580> cheaper<00:04:48.000> DC<00:04:48.330> motors<00:04:48.919> so<00:04:49.919> the

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
feedback in you cheaper DC motors so the

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.279 
feedback in you cheaper DC motors so the
plan<00:04:50.250> is<00:04:50.280> to<00:04:50.819> build<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.900> very<00:04:52.020> similar

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
plan is to build a very similar

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.050 
plan is to build a very similar
mechanism<00:04:52.889> to<00:04:53.039> push<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.370> thighs<00:04:53.550> backwards

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
mechanism to push the thighs backwards

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.820 
mechanism to push the thighs backwards
and<00:04:54.180> forwards<00:04:54.509> it's<00:04:54.840> plenty<00:04:55.199> of<00:04:55.229> space<00:04:55.500> on<00:04:55.710> the

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
and forwards it's plenty of space on the

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.159 
and forwards it's plenty of space on the
thighs<00:04:56.039> for<00:04:56.340> such<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.520> mechanism<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.389> have<00:04:58.110> a

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
thighs for such a mechanism and have a

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.550 
thighs for such a mechanism and have a
DC<00:04:58.530> motor<00:04:58.680> geared<00:04:59.159> right<00:04:59.400> up<00:05:00.259> to<00:05:01.259> move<00:05:01.440> the

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
DC motor geared right up to move the

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.459 
DC motor geared right up to move the
belt<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.069> then<00:05:03.110> basically<00:05:04.110> it<00:05:04.229> doesn't

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:04.469 
belt and then basically it doesn't

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:05.990 
belt and then basically it doesn't
matter<00:05:04.620> how<00:05:04.740> far<00:05:04.979> I<00:05:05.009> need<00:05:05.159> to<00:05:05.370> move<00:05:05.520> it<00:05:05.759> the

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
matter how far I need to move it the

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.879 
matter how far I need to move it the
gearing<00:05:06.240> ratio<00:05:06.750> is<00:05:06.870> always<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.229> same<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:07.800> the

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
gearing ratio is always the same and the

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.610 
gearing ratio is always the same and the
actuator<00:05:08.159> can<00:05:08.580> carry<00:05:08.849> on<00:05:08.969> as<00:05:09.120> far<00:05:09.300> as<00:05:09.360> you<00:05:09.449> want

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
actuator can carry on as far as you want

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.170 
actuator can carry on as far as you want
rather<00:05:10.620> than<00:05:10.800> having<00:05:11.159> to<00:05:11.460> use<00:05:11.490> higher

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
rather than having to use higher

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.089 
rather than having to use higher
leverage<00:05:12.719> on<00:05:12.870> a<00:05:12.900> servo<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:13.500> get<00:05:13.830> greater

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
leverage on a servo to get greater

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.490 
leverage on a servo to get greater
travel<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:14.849> then<00:05:15.029> therefore<00:05:15.569> having<00:05:16.259> less

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
travel and then therefore having less

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.499 
travel and then therefore having less
talk

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:17.509 
talk

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.899 
talk
so<00:05:18.509> this<00:05:18.689> plenty<00:05:19.229> of<00:05:19.349> space<00:05:19.650> to<00:05:19.680> fit<00:05:20.159> an

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
so this plenty of space to fit an

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:22.730 
so this plenty of space to fit an
actuator<00:05:21.330> with<00:05:21.599> quite<00:05:21.810> a<00:05:21.840> lot<00:05:22.050> of<00:05:22.080> travel<00:05:22.529> in

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
actuator with quite a lot of travel in

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.890 
actuator with quite a lot of travel in
this<00:05:22.949> region<00:05:23.460> basically<00:05:23.789> from<00:05:24.270> here<00:05:24.330> to<00:05:24.629> here

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
this region basically from here to here

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.249 
this region basically from here to here
so<00:05:25.710> we<00:05:25.800> can<00:05:25.949> lose<00:05:26.190> this<00:05:26.580> piece<00:05:27.110> which<00:05:28.110> is

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
so we can lose this piece which is

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.950 
so we can lose this piece which is
currently<00:05:28.849> using<00:05:29.849> this<00:05:30.120> servo<00:05:30.539> to<00:05:30.599> move<00:05:30.870> the

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
currently using this servo to move the

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.749 
currently using this servo to move the
thighs<00:05:31.199> and<00:05:31.590> we<00:05:31.650> can<00:05:31.800> put<00:05:31.919> a<00:05:31.949> linear<00:05:32.279> actuator

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
thighs and we can put a linear actuator

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.570 
thighs and we can put a linear actuator
in<00:05:33.000> there<00:05:33.150> instead<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:34.199> plan<00:05:34.409> is<00:05:34.620> that<00:05:34.650> the

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
in there instead the plan is that the

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.730 
in there instead the plan is that the
actuator<00:05:36.180> will<00:05:36.419> have<00:05:36.539> a<00:05:36.620> microcontroller<00:05:37.620> on

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
actuator will have a microcontroller on

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.379 
actuator will have a microcontroller on
either<00:05:37.919> one<00:05:38.129> can<00:05:38.339> read<00:05:38.580> its<00:05:38.759> position<00:05:39.210> with<00:05:39.360> a

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
either one can read its position with a

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.070 
either one can read its position with a
slight<00:05:39.719> pot<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:40.620> it<00:05:40.860> can<00:05:40.979> also<00:05:41.129> read<00:05:41.839> PWM<00:05:42.839> from

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
slight pot and it can also read PWM from

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.320 
slight pot and it can also read PWM from
the<00:05:43.169> servo<00:05:43.529> controllers<00:05:44.099> are<00:05:44.219> on<00:05:44.339> here<00:05:44.550> so

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
the servo controllers are on here so

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.029 
the servo controllers are on here so
effectively<00:05:45.719> the<00:05:45.930> linear<00:05:46.199> actuator<00:05:46.740> can

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
effectively the linear actuator can

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.430 
effectively the linear actuator can
function<00:05:47.370> as<00:05:47.610> if<00:05:47.729> it's<00:05:47.879> a<00:05:48.000> servo<00:05:48.449> and<00:05:48.990> I<00:05:49.229> can

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
function as if it's a servo and I can

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.589 
function as if it's a servo and I can
still<00:05:49.740> use<00:05:49.979> the<00:05:50.159> same<00:05:50.310> gyros<00:05:50.940> which<00:05:51.240> are<00:05:51.449> run

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
still use the same gyros which are run

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.769 
still use the same gyros which are run
in<00:05:51.750> line<00:05:51.960> with<00:05:52.229> the<00:05:52.319> servo<00:05:52.879> in<00:05:53.879> order<00:05:54.240> to<00:05:54.419> have

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
in line with the servo in order to have

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:57.950 
in line with the servo in order to have
stability<00:05:56.029> so<00:05:57.029> next<00:05:57.210> time<00:05:57.479> I'm<00:05:57.599> going<00:05:57.779> to<00:05:57.839> be

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
stability so next time I'm going to be

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.869 
stability so next time I'm going to be
working<00:05:58.289> through<00:05:58.500> going<00:05:58.830> those<00:05:59.129> actuators

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879 
working through going those actuators

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.670 
working through going those actuators
I'm<00:06:00.180> not<00:06:00.419> going<00:06:00.569> to<00:06:00.659> go<00:06:00.750> on<00:06:00.810> android<00:06:01.229> 13

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
I'm not going to go on android 13

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.769 
I'm not going to go on android 13
because<00:06:01.979> I'm<00:06:02.879> quite<00:06:03.060> happy<00:06:03.210> with<00:06:03.449> the<00:06:03.569> hips

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:03.779 
because I'm quite happy with the hips

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:05.990 
because I'm quite happy with the hips
and<00:06:03.990> so<00:06:04.199> on<00:06:04.319> so<00:06:04.949> I'm<00:06:05.069> going<00:06:05.310> to<00:06:05.370> be<00:06:05.580> building

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
and so on so I'm going to be building

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.719 
and so on so I'm going to be building
Android<00:06:06.360> 12<00:06:06.810> Rigby<00:06:07.379> and<00:06:07.740> all<00:06:08.039> those<00:06:08.219> parts

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
Android 12 Rigby and all those parts

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.879 
Android 12 Rigby and all those parts
will<00:06:08.879> be<00:06:09.000> in<00:06:09.060> a<00:06:09.150> different<00:06:09.449> color<00:06:09.599> plastic<00:06:10.110> so

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
will be in a different color plastic so

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.829

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
there's a red see that would be a
