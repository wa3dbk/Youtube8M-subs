 7 turn office probability generator 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.849
 mysterious device allowing in 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.370
 dozens or even hundreds of times increase 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.400
 probability of any event if 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.690
 probability exists in principle 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.420
 affects reality on quantum 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.010
 and subatomic able to pierce

 continuum in the kitchen 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:41.430
 pick up the probability generator device 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:53.489
 which do not want to hear anything every 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:56.129
 once something important that you did why 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.160
 we stopped and stopped time or 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.770
 that I protected myself from your attack 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.500
 now you stopped the universe and we 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.900
 stuck so forever really nothing 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.240
 did not stop time just slowed down 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.790
 ten thousand times and not in the universe but 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.560
 only within our office to 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.130
 return everything in place someone must 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.509
 press play button 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.570
 Well, try to speed up a bit and

 time planes are all so 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.500
 froze that nothing prevents to read 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.679
