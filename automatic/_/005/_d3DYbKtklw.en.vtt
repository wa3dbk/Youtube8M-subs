 good to the cheapest I did not know 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.460
 exactly what it was so I chose 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.710
 for example these two times a shadow 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.710

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.690

 will not go with what beauty product 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.620
 they have a love-hate relationship 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.960
 I think I would say the illuminator 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.510
 neurologist in winning I have this one here 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.880
 fashionable 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.870
 that they gave less is to make up one 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.850
 offer every day 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.870
 well it seems very dark but it is 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.160
 illuminator 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.160
 and I also have 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:52.149
 I'm here schlink 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.149
 I have love I hate because I wear it 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.649
 and I love how the university looks 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.229
 it remains but having mixed fat skin 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.450
 at two o'clock that way I left 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.850
 my own group I have my own brightness 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.189
 more the ideal that you can so much seemed to me 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.170
 and that I am a light bulb and I would not like 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.950
 have brightness 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.599
 so why gula what your 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.970
 most delicious beauty products 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:21.700
 Well, the most delicious would be this 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.580
 they no longer have names of rimmel london 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.480
 I have a long time ago and it smells 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.480
 super good as 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.570
 like you cherry or so 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.020
 I love how it smells or if not those of 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.230
 kiko the format this the others I do not know 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:45.500
 how will they read because I do not have any but 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.970
 this smell like vanilla a cake 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.880
 vanilla or something 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.410
 I do not understand them 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.560
 Perez to what beauty product 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.420
 you neglect because of laziness I think that 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.490
 what are most careless are the eyelashes 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.520
 I love how they fit inside 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.940
 of what fits I know how to put it well but 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.670
 I'm too lazy because it's not that it's 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.210
 a shadow under a minute evenings 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.810
 on this side but they take longer 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.970
 and that's why I feel lazy 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.709
 when nobody is reaping a joy 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.130
 more clean 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.950
 I could 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.310
 pride and that beauty product that you 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.350
 gives more confidence in yourself good the 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.380
 products that more confidence itself are 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:38.430
 lipsticks and lip powerful ro 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:42.180
 and good to say one I have taken this from 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.400
 rimmel london is 107 of the line 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.790
 we remove the red one and the truth is that I 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.150
 love I love to put on 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.290
 powerful colors of the lips and this is 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.269
 one of them 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.090
 lust which attributes turn out to be more 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.120
 attractive of the opposite sex what more 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.310
 I like the opposite sex are the eyes 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.489
 about all the blue and green games 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.819

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.760
 love the smile of the guys and a 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.709
 attribute so more special is that they know 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.680
 dance I love that a guy knows 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.380

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.359
