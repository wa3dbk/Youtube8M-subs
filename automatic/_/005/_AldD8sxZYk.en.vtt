00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.030 
down the hill it's the first apex of
this<00:01:36.150> 380<00:01:36.600> x<00:01:36.810> corner<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.200> talked<00:01:37.409> about<00:01:37.560> very

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
this 380 x corner we talked about very

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.160 
this 380 x corner we talked about very
very<00:01:38.310> tricky<00:01:38.640> part<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.000> track<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.509> expect

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
very tricky part of the track and expect

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.560 
very tricky part of the track and expect
this<00:01:40.740> will<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.070> one<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.000> bits<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.299> really

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
this will be one of the bits of really

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.310 
this will be one of the bits of really
struggle<00:01:42.899> math<00:01:43.049> tomorrow

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.780 

now<00:01:50.320> we're<00:01:50.500> up<00:01:50.530> at<00:01:50.829> the<00:01:50.979> gosta<00:01:51.460> need<00:01:51.579> war

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
now we're up at the gosta need war

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.270 
now we're up at the gosta need war
chicane<00:01:52.240> which<00:01:52.689> is<00:01:52.960> looking<00:01:53.409> like<00:01:53.740> what<00:01:53.979> being

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
chicane which is looking like what being

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.499 
chicane which is looking like what being
one<00:01:54.369> of<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.520> trickiest<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.149> certainly

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
one of the trickiest and certainly

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.210 
one of the trickiest and certainly
narrowest<00:01:56.200> parts<00:01:56.560> of<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:56.740> circuit<00:01:56.860> this<00:01:57.100> is

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
narrowest parts of the circuit this is

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.889 
narrowest parts of the circuit this is
the<00:01:57.340> old<00:01:57.460> market<00:01:57.880> that<00:01:58.030> is<00:01:58.060> now<00:01:58.240> an<00:01:58.360> exhibition

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
the old market that is now an exhibition

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.440 
the old market that is now an exhibition
center<00:01:59.259> that<00:01:59.560> is<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.920> GOST<00:02:00.250> in<00:02:00.399> ybor<00:02:00.700> but<00:02:01.360> the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
center that is the GOST in ybor but the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.719 
center that is the GOST in ybor but the
chicane<00:02:01.720> Dario<00:02:02.140> is<00:02:02.439> interesting<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:03.429> narrows

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
chicane Dario is interesting it narrows

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.100 
chicane Dario is interesting it narrows
up<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.000> hurry<00:02:04.149> doesn't<00:02:04.509> it<00:02:04.570> on<00:02:04.659> entry<00:02:04.929> there

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
up and hurry doesn't it on entry there

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.219 
up and hurry doesn't it on entry there
but<00:02:05.320> quite<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.549> quick<00:02:06.549> entry<00:02:07.080> breaking<00:02:08.080> for

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
but quite a quick entry breaking for

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.259 
but quite a quick entry breaking for
this<00:02:08.380> left-hand<00:02:09.039> part<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:10.060> the

chicane you're going to be balancing
your<00:02:11.950> entry<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.670> your<00:02:12.790> exit<00:02:13.120> speed<00:02:13.300> but<00:02:13.480> you

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
your entry and your exit speed but you

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.449 
your entry and your exit speed but you
got<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.720> get<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.870> good<00:02:13.989> exit<00:02:14.290> obviously<00:02:14.680> but

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
got to get a good exit obviously but

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.920 
got to get a good exit obviously but
that<00:02:15.610> entry<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.060> wide<00:02:16.239> open<00:02:16.269> its<00:02:16.720> going<00:02:16.810> to

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
that entry is wide open its going to

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.660 
that entry is wide open its going to
track<00:02:17.140> challenge<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.799> run<00:02:18.040> run<00:02:18.280> speed<00:02:18.489> and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
track challenge it to run run speed and

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.910 
track challenge it to run run speed and

before this tight tight part of the of
the<00:02:21.100> chicane<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.640> see<00:02:22.269> a<00:02:22.299> few<00:02:22.630> mistakes<00:02:22.810> you

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
the chicane I see a few mistakes you

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.140 
the chicane I see a few mistakes you
have<00:02:23.170> tomorrow's<00:02:23.560> just<00:02:23.769> looks<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.940> got<00:02:25.060> that

have tomorrow's just looks it's got that

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.580 
have tomorrow's just looks it's got that
feeling<00:02:25.450> about<00:02:25.600> doesn't<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:25.989> yeah<00:02:26.380> absolutely

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
feeling about doesn't it yeah absolutely

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.009 
feeling about doesn't it yeah absolutely
so<00:02:27.280> that's<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.850> way<00:02:28.000> in<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.299> then<00:02:28.450> we<00:02:28.870> head

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
so that's the way in and then we head

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.080 
so that's the way in and then we head
down<00:02:29.230> here<00:02:29.440> towards<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:30.190> Kremlin<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:30.880> some

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
down here towards the Kremlin and some

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.330 
down here towards the Kremlin and some
basil's<00:02:31.390> cathedral<00:02:31.630> as<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.380> do

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.250 

after<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.209> chicane<00:02:38.480> there's<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.810> flat<00:02:39.080> out

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
after the chicane there's a flat out

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.020 
after the chicane there's a flat out
left<00:02:39.530> kink<00:02:39.800> which<00:02:40.160> then<00:02:40.370> brings<00:02:40.580> us<00:02:40.790> down<00:02:40.819> here

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
left kink which then brings us down here

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.839 
left kink which then brings us down here
to<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:42.069> reasonably<00:02:43.069> tricky<00:02:43.280> living<00:02:43.489> corner<00:02:43.730> cuz

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
to a reasonably tricky living corner cuz

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.130 
to a reasonably tricky living corner cuz
you're<00:02:43.940> coming<00:02:44.150> through<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.450> left<00:02:44.629> and<00:02:44.810> then

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
you're coming through the left and then

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.300 
you're coming through the left and then
getting<00:02:45.410> into<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.620> braking<00:02:45.920> for<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.069> heaven

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
getting into the braking for the heaven

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.250 
getting into the braking for the heaven
yeah<00:02:46.760> normally<00:02:47.269> doesn't<00:02:47.450> get<00:02:47.690> pretty<00:02:48.080> simple

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
yeah normally doesn't get pretty simple

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.170 
yeah normally doesn't get pretty simple
flat<00:02:48.709> Oh<00:02:48.739> left-hand<00:02:49.459> kink<00:02:49.700> but<00:02:49.849> then<00:02:49.940> you<00:02:50.030> look

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
flat Oh left-hand kink but then you look

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.520 
flat Oh left-hand kink but then you look
at<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.390> angle<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.959> road<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.440> get

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
at the angle the road to you get

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.050 
at the angle the road to you get
slightly<00:02:51.769> off<00:02:51.980> line<00:02:52.220> it's<00:02:52.730> going<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:52.970> be

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
slightly off line it's going to be

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.850 
slightly off line it's going to be
interesting<00:02:53.269> then<00:02:54.230> we<00:02:54.319> get<00:02:54.440> into<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.650> tight

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
interesting then we get into the tight

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.910 
interesting then we get into the tight
end<00:02:55.129> of<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.549> track<00:02:55.760> breaking<00:02:56.680> hairpin<00:02:57.680> left

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
end of the track breaking hairpin left

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.970 
end of the track breaking hairpin left
very<00:02:58.280> very<00:02:58.580> tight<00:02:59.049> hairpin<00:03:00.049> right<00:03:00.260> down<00:03:00.830> the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
very very tight hairpin right down the

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.410 
very very tight hairpin right down the
hill<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.879> we're<00:03:02.030> back<00:03:02.120> where<00:03:02.299> we<00:03:02.330> started

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
hill and we're back where we started

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.150 
hill and we're back where we started
yeah<00:03:02.930> absolutely<00:03:03.110> jobs<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.709> good'n<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.069> then

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
yeah absolutely jobs a good'n and then

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.289 
yeah absolutely jobs a good'n and then
they<00:03:04.280> head<00:03:04.400> back<00:03:04.549> out<00:03:04.730> onto<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.060> embankment

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
they head back out onto the embankment

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.030 
they head back out onto the embankment
to<00:03:05.870> start<00:03:06.140> another<00:03:06.379> lap<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:06.709> that's<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:06.950> little

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
to start another lap so that's a little
