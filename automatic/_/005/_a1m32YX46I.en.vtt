00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
cheaper gundam anyways well let's get to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:27.000 
cheaper gundam anyways well let's get to
reviewer<00:01:10.390> so<00:01:11.390> here<00:01:11.750> we<00:01:11.900> have<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:13.250> heavy<00:01:13.490> arms

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.420 

so<00:01:28.010> basically<00:01:28.960> there's<00:01:29.960> no<00:01:30.230> need<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.740> evil

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
so basically there's no need to evil

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.790 
so basically there's no need to evil
wonder<00:01:32.030> why<00:01:32.690> it<00:01:32.750> would<00:01:33.050> be<00:01:33.200> called<00:01:33.470> the

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
wonder why it would be called the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.910 
wonder why it would be called the
heavier<00:01:34.370> most<00:01:34.730> random<00:01:35.120> I<00:01:35.300> mean<00:01:35.930> look<00:01:36.710> at

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
heavier most random I mean look at

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.770 
heavier most random I mean look at
artillery<00:01:37.790> on<00:01:38.120> him<00:01:39.280> missiles<00:01:40.280> on<00:01:40.670> there<00:01:41.180> I

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
artillery on him missiles on there I

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.820 
artillery on him missiles on there I
