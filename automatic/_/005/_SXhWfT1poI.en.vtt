00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 there I went out to offices and today you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.930
 will learn to make continued appliance 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.930
 samsung galaxy 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:22.949
 well first I have here my 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.320
 samsung galaxy that 66 actually this is 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.330
 The first video of the channel I'm doing 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.029
 channel before you even get my galaxy 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.890
 the two I bought have some time 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.790
 this galaxy was borrowed with a friend 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.579
 my and I are not going to start with some 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.710
 most basic tutorial videos by 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.870
 galaxy y in other lighter cell phones 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.280
 have a galaxy are two of my mother I 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.110
 I'm going to test some things, too. 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.230
 how was that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.350
 good to start and these I think he 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.050
 It's like he left the factory. I did the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.390
 video of ruch before setting it down is necessary 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.739
 do last night and then do everything 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.739
 again 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.010
 I know how it comes from the factory and I 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.500
 I'll teach you how to make ruch in it good. 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.479
 to start you will need a 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.520
 computer preferably with windows 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.659
 because if you have to make a 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.310
 VM will be complicated and 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.320
 phone and a USB cable 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.689
 preferably by using the connected cable 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.060
 directly on your computer is the cable 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.119
 android standard connects to your computer 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.060
 but preferably by not connecting it to 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.070
 some hobby or something because otherwise 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.950
 can a problem occur in your 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.869
 cell phone or invalidate the men if you 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.579
 do not have any shade of chipboard going 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.460
 give a little work to get back 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:46.649
 and here you put in the deposition mode 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.759
 usb 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.360
 he will ask if you really want 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.110
 get into shock and now let's go to the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.479
 computer 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.729
 here it opens all the files in the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.100
 computer you will create a folder that 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.100
 preferably have some number in the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.630
 dome start to get easier 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.200
 find on mobile 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.759
 I put a e and files kick here 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.610
 and we have all the files I have 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.440
 I have in my corner 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.020
 you will put teaching cards 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.940
 some stores accept this in the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.610
 memory of the same phone but in this case 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:23.230
 you put it in the memory card and I 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.820
 I have here in the files of ruth that already 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.000
 they are here on the cell phone but I'm going to put 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.270
 here a download link in the subscription 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.030
 will have here update roth point you go 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.600
 put it on your cell phone 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.050
 I already have it so I will not put it here 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.430
 file update point brings the last stayed 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.790
 known here on your memory card 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.970
 and now if you have ever been 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.160
 memory card you back you're not 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.170
 now you no longer need to be with 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.450
 he connected to the computer what you 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.450
 Are you going to turn off your cell phone and 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.580
 after this is to turn it off you go 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.770
 need to put it into sleep mode. 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.440
 recovery mode must press the 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.810
 volume plus central button that your air 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.480
 and power button quickly just to power 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.340
 Calling him alone with his mother gives you a little 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.290
 work so here push the button 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.209
 the center button starts 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.640
 hold the home button more and it is not that 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.100
 I see that I can already release the button. 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.470
 power just need to hold the other two 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.959
 and this will call this mode of 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.940
 here and there you only pay 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.220
 preferably first central button 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.590
 and then our volume knob will can 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.140
 accidentally restart another 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.269
 time and ends up giving a little work and 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.090
 soon you control you control with 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:46.450
 the side buttons to move up and down 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:52.920
 here goes down and the central button is raised to 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:56.019
 give an enter let's say so let 's 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.390
 apply the update from the 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.220
 and then you go to that folder that 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.340
 you have created on your memory card here 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.340
 in my case a roth files is here 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.930
 You will hit the center button it goes 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.900
 open this folder 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:18.729
 there you go to the ruth file 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.160

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.050
 simply press the button on the 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.139
 half again to restart the cell phone 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.729
 he will restart will be with mutti only 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.919

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.699
 well but I'm still going to get a camera 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.099
