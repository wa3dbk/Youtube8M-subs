00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
it's been really inspiring being able to

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.690 
it's been really inspiring being able to
work<00:01:20.380> with<00:01:20.440> all<00:01:20.680> these<00:01:20.800> are<00:01:20.980> the<00:01:21.070> q21

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
work with all these are the q21

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:39.110 
work with all these are the q21
who<00:01:21.970> love<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.390> dance<00:01:22.420> just<00:01:22.870> as<00:01:22.990> much<00:01:23.170> as<00:01:23.380> you

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:49.980 

but<00:01:40.120> I'm<00:01:40.270> not<00:01:40.480> high<00:01:40.630> school<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:49.570> not<00:01:49.630> an<00:01:49.840> easy

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
but I'm not high school it's not an easy

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.690 
but I'm not high school it's not an easy
thing<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.320> pick<00:01:50.530> up<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:50.770> style<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.250> bangerra

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
thing to pick up the style of bangerra

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.660 
thing to pick up the style of bangerra
because<00:01:52.000> it's<00:01:52.210> not<00:01:52.360> just<00:01:52.390> steps<00:01:53.400> you<00:01:54.400> have<00:01:54.550> to

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
because it's not just steps you have to

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.400 
because it's not just steps you have to
learn<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.150> emotion<00:01:55.690> that<00:01:55.720> country<00:01:56.080> under<00:01:56.260> and

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
learn the emotion that country under and

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.440 
learn the emotion that country under and
where<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.710> comes<00:01:56.890> from<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.369> earth<00:01:57.610> or<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.180> sky

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
where it comes from the earth or the sky

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.630 
where it comes from the earth or the sky
or<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:58.900> animals<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.890> really<00:02:00.250> have<00:02:00.369> to<00:02:00.460> pick

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
or the animals you really have to pick

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.950 
or the animals you really have to pick
up<00:02:00.820> on<00:02:00.970> that<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.390> has<00:02:01.509> to<00:02:01.630> come<00:02:01.780> from

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
up on that and that has to come from

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.960 
up on that and that has to come from
within<00:02:02.229> you<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.040> not<00:02:03.190> from<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.670> external

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
within you and not from the external

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.310 
within you and not from the external
stuff<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:04.990> so<00:02:05.140> I<00:02:05.350> think<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.979> kids<00:02:07.020> now

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
stuff and so I think the kids now

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.070 
stuff and so I think the kids now
that's<00:02:08.649> slowly<00:02:09.130> developing<00:02:09.759> about<00:02:10.080> that

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
that's slowly developing about that

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.260 
that's slowly developing about that
essence<00:02:11.500> where<00:02:11.709> it<00:02:11.770> comes<00:02:11.980> from<00:02:12.100> how<00:02:12.580> bangerra

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
essence where it comes from how bangerra

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.210 
essence where it comes from how bangerra
makes<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:13.720> look<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.050> easy<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.560> stages<00:02:15.070> because

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
makes it look so easy in stages because

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:41.670 
makes it look so easy in stages because
it<00:02:15.580> does<00:02:15.760> come<00:02:16.000> from

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.970 

it's<00:02:42.100> it's<00:02:42.610> been<00:02:42.940> really<00:02:43.209> good<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:43.980> got

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
it's it's been really good that I got

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.100 
it's it's been really good that I got
