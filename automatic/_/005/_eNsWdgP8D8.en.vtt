00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
you're going to need an HD texture fixer

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.490

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
just looking for really nice design like

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.270 
just looking for really nice design like
say<00:03:52.310> here<00:03:52.549> Cole<00:03:52.850> not<00:03:53.690> knuckle<00:03:54.080> i'm<00:03:54.739> at<00:03:54.920> wool
