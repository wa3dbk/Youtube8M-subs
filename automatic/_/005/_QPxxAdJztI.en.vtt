 what we have goosebumps 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.120
 we stopped in a narrow corridor hearing 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.549
 someone's crying and in the distance and he becomes 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.190
 closer we play for daniel 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.470
 woken up in a deserted castle and almost 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.379
 I do not remember anything of his past 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.109
 going through the dark paths we must 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.269
 restore some of your memory 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:02.030
 fear and horror roam not only outside but 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.609
 and inside the castle awaits us frightening 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.760
 the darkness of travel is the darkest 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:10.370
 corners of the human being that it is not heard 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.889
 sound pure footsteps or is it just playing 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.569
 our mind game with amazing 3d 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.000
 graphics and dynamic sound 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.190
 accompanying gradually absorbs us 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.019
 but control of the game is completely in our 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.150
 hands 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:27.019
 there is no in-game video jump in 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.840
 time all that happens to us will be 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.239
 caused precisely by our actions something 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.260
 comes out of the darkness and she approaches 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.389
 fast approaching need to survive 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.540

 you can only survive by running away 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.829
 using your brains is a 2 horror game in 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.169
 which I played and the plot is served through 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.739
 notes and starts with writing yourself 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.040
 to myself 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:58.220
 hello this is me from the distant past go and 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.019
 kill Alexander it would seem very well 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.540
 a banal move with memory loss 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.639
 well, how much is possible but actually 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.150
 done very cool in a few 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.310
 notes

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.909
 past plunge into its depths exactly 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.250
 as in depth 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.120
 ancient castle where the action takes place 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.250
 the end 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.489
 all this absurd external and internal 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.919
 merges into a single madness and you are no longer 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.889
 You know what to believe, what is right and what 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.229
 there is no sensation of Kick in the game also 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.240
 there are monsters from which you need something 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.490
 whether to hide or run away in moments 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.889
 even scary to look back just to run 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.830
 before the release in general are good scary 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.380
 feeling 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.700
 if still playing alone 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.820
