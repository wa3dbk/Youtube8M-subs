00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.830
 Daniel Kehlmann tells new episodes that are all connected with each other 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.929
 the game with reality and fiction 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.400
 People slip into other identities to become fictitious or disappear 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.369
 a successful crime writer undertakes a reportage journey 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.569
 Central Asia 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.360
 In their imagination, they have striked again 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.280
 the 1 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.739
 the Robert Bosch AG 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.030
 Neumarkt wants 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.030
 important always wondered how far star 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.350
 actually but also open donations call 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.150
 and the sun was burning 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
 instead of having hands and legs the developed countries have 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.760
 she is scoring points from a government organization 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.890
 below 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.560
 and forget about it 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.900
 calms down 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.950
 one would notice that they lacked the others would sound the alarm 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.750
 Machine would wait 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.910
 she went back to the hall 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.270
 and sat down 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.240
 After a minute she got up and stepped back into the street 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.500
 There she stood with beating heart 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.060
 two hours long 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.240
 Again and again she returned to the hotel but nobody on the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.270
 Receptionist play Blair and also call knocking screaming did not help 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.740
 she had walked through all the floors, the banks had knocked all the doors knocked 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.900
 The phone on the reception desk apparently worked, but what did not know 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.170
 what numbers do they make before the cost of whether to connect abroad 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.470
 whatever she tried led back to the same 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.650
 when after three more hours no one had appeared 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.450
 She decided to set out 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.490
 she had to find someone 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.530
 Red 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.149
 but no one understands how it is not necessarily the country 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.970
 the battery of her tormentor costs 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.800
 completely powerless supports really need a reason more park 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.380
 taken up and abducted abroad as a cheap assistant while the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.380
 Colleagues by plane back to the west 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:13.319
 that's because weird now we look from then on 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.809
 There is more and more in this story and a writer 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.639
 and some others this story I do not want to tell you exactly 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.019
 four-legged 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.019
 They are not from me but from them 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:31.869
 since he had responded to what has happened in the stories that is 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:33.609
 Percent are 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.639
 si important thing is 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:39.089
 Of course, more than the location percent that was of course something big to me 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:41.709
 It was fun and here around 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.950
 what you as a reader 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.689
 not necessarily discovered 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.260
 you can also read it without sight for these inner connections are here 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.209
 but not more fun if you go if you like
