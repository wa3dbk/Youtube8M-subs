00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
you know there's no doubt that England

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
you know there's no doubt that England
confident<00:01:48.350> enough

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
confident enough

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.950

this<00:01:49.430> game<00:01:49.640> they've<00:01:50.000> done<00:01:50.180> it<00:01:50.300> once<00:01:50.479> there<00:01:50.840> is

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
M they can't do again I think at the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.940 
M they can't do again I think at the
moment<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.750> All<00:01:53.840> Blacks<00:01:53.960> play<00:01:54.170> as<00:01:54.650> they<00:01:54.830> are

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
moment the All Blacks play as they are

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.830 
moment the All Blacks play as they are
is<00:01:55.130> unlikely<00:01:55.550> and<00:01:55.909> we're<00:01:56.210> seeing<00:01:56.630> weighing

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
is unlikely and we're seeing weighing

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.350 
is unlikely and we're seeing weighing
than<00:01:57.110> they're<00:01:57.260> at<00:01:57.430> but<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.790> know<00:01:58.970> that<00:01:59.180> means

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
than they're at but you know that means

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.910 
than they're at but you know that means
nothing<00:01:59.750> it's<00:01:59.930> about<00:02:00.229> England<00:02:00.619> setting<00:02:00.800> up

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920

nothing it's about England setting up
all<00:02:01.070> day<00:02:01.340> maybe<00:02:02.000> a<00:02:02.150> museum<00:02:02.210> not<00:02:02.900> quite<00:02:03.140> firing

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
all day maybe a museum not quite firing

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.210 
all day maybe a museum not quite firing
and<00:02:05.630> they<00:02:05.810> still<00:02:06.080> win<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:06.500> first<00:02:06.680> your<00:02:06.920> side

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
and they still win that first your side

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.790 
and they still win that first your side
but<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.550> think<00:02:08.080> get<00:02:09.080> up<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.320> get<00:02:09.380> out<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.649> tune

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
but I think get up and get out of tune

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.220 
but I think get up and get out of tune
right<00:02:09.950> away
