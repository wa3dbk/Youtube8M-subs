00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.530
 Whoever wants to get high is in everyone 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.510
 right view 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.220
 especially exciting possibilities 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.020
 to illustrate the via ferrata flims 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.480
 lace and circle lace dar 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.190
 reached in just 45 minutes at the 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.880
 starting point to both comfortable with the 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:28.310
 silvretta under trajectory different 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.860
 possibilities and we were there two 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.370
 different via ferrata design 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:38.570
 in construction directly on the flimm tip 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.399
 the via ferrata is as easy 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.739
 and is also for 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.110
 beginners suitable the second 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.079
 Via ferrata is located there often in the 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.120
 background directly on the highest 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.770
 point of the ski area on the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.079
 circle peak and this via ferrata is 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.820
 a bit more sophisticated but at 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.190
 this via ferrata to the possibility 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.469
 to master two different routes 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.479
 after the second pitch has 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:09.020
 the possibility of a difficult one 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.509
 variant to enter and if you see 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.069
 The tour may be too difficult 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.770
 you also the possibility on the right 

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:20.289
 side to master the easy variant 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.270
 Alone one should do a via ferrata 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.770
 do not cope because it can once 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.810
 is his rock falls can something 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.450
 You can hurt yourself and pass 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.819
 it's really not too bad on its own 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.549
 recommend if you do not have any 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.469
 you should experience the 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.060
 You should avoid via ferratas 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.999
 First of all , you have to get it started 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.130
 should be with an experienced climber 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:46.669
 once to have a via ferrata 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.130
 cope before you alone or too 

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:52.299
 second with no great experience in one 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.299
 climbs in 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.510
 the highlights on this via ferrata 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.420
 Of course, there are the crossing on the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.319
 North side this is partially exposed 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.139
 even slightly overhanging and that is 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.920
 really very powerful feeling 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:41.389
 because you really up to 50 60 meters 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.389
 has air underfoot 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.150
 I bite via ferrata were by professionals 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.550
 created and who of such 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.860
 maintained some alpine dangers 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.660
 but never be underestimated 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:06.710
 the biggest mistakes are mainly 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:10.630
 Overconfidence many climbing 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:15.670
 and then sinks overwhelming overwhelmed 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:19.310
 and concerts laughs become problematic 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.820
 Furthermore you have to pay attention always in the 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.980
 via ferrata the weather conditions because one 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.580
 I am in the best of conditions 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.540
 danger 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.540
 the lightning strike 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.660
 the via ferrata is on the circle top 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.840
 Although relatively short yet wait more 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.790
 as worthwhile prospects of 2,850 meters 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.790
 high peak on his conquerors
