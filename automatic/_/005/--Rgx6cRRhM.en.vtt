00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.099 
advanced warfare secret fourth hidden
game<00:00:19.830> road<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.430> also<00:00:20.609> known<00:00:20.970> as<00:00:21.240> what<00:00:21.720> could

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
game road it's also known as what could

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.380 
game road it's also known as what could
zombies<00:00:22.619> could<00:00:22.920> be<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.490> know<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.670> have<00:00:24.000> raids

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
zombies could be and I know I have raids

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.420 
zombies could be and I know I have raids
because<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.930> thought<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.590> co-op<00:00:25.800> game<00:00:26.160> mode

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
because I thought that co-op game mode

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.540 
because I thought that co-op game mode
was<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:28.320> EXO<00:00:28.740> survival<00:00:28.920> which

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
was going to be the EXO survival which

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.220 
was going to be the EXO survival which
hopefully<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.240> won't<00:00:30.480> be<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
hopefully it won't be but this is the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.600 
hopefully it won't be but this is the
exact<00:00:31.560> same<00:00:31.830> thing<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.219> happened<00:00:32.579> with

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
exact same thing that happened with

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.549 
exact same thing that happened with
ghosts<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.630> hopefully<00:00:33.930> they<00:00:34.079> will<00:00:34.380> be

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
ghosts so hopefully they will be

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.650 
ghosts so hopefully they will be
revealing<00:00:35.070> something<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.760> now<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.360> very

one<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.609> we've<00:02:54.849> seen<00:02:54.879> maybe<00:02:55.419> it's<00:02:55.629> a<00:02:55.870> earlier

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
one that we've seen maybe it's a earlier

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
different from each other I was thinking

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.929

that<00:03:47.049> they<00:03:47.319> would<00:03:47.470> be<00:03:47.650> all<00:03:47.919> in<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.310> similar<00:03:48.699> in

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:48.939 
that they would be all in a similar in

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:50.610 
that they would be all in a similar in
design<00:03:49.329> and<00:03:49.509> aesthetics<00:03:49.989> but<00:03:50.169> that<00:03:50.349> is<00:03:50.470> not

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
design and aesthetics but that is not

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.020 
design and aesthetics but that is not
the<00:03:50.769> case<00:03:50.919> at<00:03:51.099> all<00:03:51.250> they<00:03:51.459> are<00:03:51.579> all<00:03:51.759> pretty

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
the case at all they are all pretty

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.640 
the case at all they are all pretty
diverse<00:03:52.449> both<00:03:52.780> aesthetically<00:03:53.530> and

diverse both aesthetically and

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.099 
diverse both aesthetically and
structurally<00:03:54.220> so<00:03:54.400> hopefully<00:03:55.060> John's<00:03:55.329> advance
