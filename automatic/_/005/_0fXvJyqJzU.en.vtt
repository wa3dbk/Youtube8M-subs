00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.270
 prevents used for relationships would have come from a cell culture 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.520
 from the skin of the mother of 31 years we arrived at the implantation of five 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.519
 feet 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.199
 five of its implementations in the first three weeks 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.529
 there were nine ended spontaneously 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.109
 another five 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.550
 they were successful 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.939
 and they are still successful 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.070
 the possible cloning of human beings has aroused a strong rejection and 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.000
 reviews around the world 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.310
 because of its immoral critical claims j organizes spc but they have not 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.690
 transcended without any scientific data you have to be very skeptical 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.510
 this is a group that does not have a scientific study core cultural a 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.470
 scientific document on the subject 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.360
 has no experience and missiles in the region did not enter anything or a 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.100
 mouse with the compadre I must say that this is frightening and scientifically 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.440
 responsable 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.040
 I think we can not rule it out quickly, I think there is a 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.240
 technology to clone human embryos and it can be simpler than 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.680
 what do you think 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.630
 we are fulfilling but 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.600
 very cautiously and waiting for the final test that is probably going to come out 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.910
 well about eight or ten days for what is done well with people who think about the 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.520
 genetic material of helpless beings 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.800
 completely identical to 5 5 percent identified the donor's 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.800
 it seems that the mother who gave birth to him 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.969
 to all this they have stopped generating controversy but without spaces 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.609
 in his serious doubts about the true origin of the law of cloning from 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.700
 today the investigations begin and of course the discussions 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.840
 and also a series of questions has been generated that have to do with 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.450
 with the regulations that has to do with morality with ethics but about 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.260
 all with faith with aunts 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.080
 those suspicions among the experts is clooney's relationship with a group 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.130
 religious called raelians 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.590
 followers of such a leader is to preach that life on the planet was created by 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.540
 these r3 through genetic engineering according to the long-term goal 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.240
 term is to achieve eternal life by floating adults and transferring the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.190
 brains to the flowers 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.350
 I believe in them announced the appointment of an independent expert who should 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.360
 determine if you carry has a father identical to his mother 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.769
 cloning is carried out by introducing the core of any 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.609
 body cell 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:26.729
 the empty cheekbone and then by electricity a chemical bath is achieved 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.179
 that the cheekbone be divided as if it had outsourced 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.469
 only then is it impregnated in the uterus of the mother 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:39.139
 and here is the processed that gets up dust among the people all the 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.199
 population gave a resounding no to manipulation
