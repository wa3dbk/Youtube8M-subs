7q<00:00:37.610> so<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.329> process<00:00:39.600> itself<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.500> taking

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
7q so the process itself is taking

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
already existing here so again five

format<00:00:46.800> sensors<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.550> very<00:00:47.850> good

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969

now if you're looking to do something as

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.940 
now if you're looking to do something as
I<00:01:30.780> mentioned<00:01:31.079> earlier<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> third<00:01:31.619> party

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
I mentioned earlier in the third party

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.200 
I mentioned earlier in the third party
in<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> face<00:01:32.310> there's<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.759> conversion

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
in the face there's the conversion

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.490 
in the face there's the conversion
design<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.750> have<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> ton<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.259> different

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
design you have a ton of different

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.950 
design you have a ton of different
flexibility<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.220> that

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
flexibility with that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.350 
flexibility with that
a<00:01:36.409> little<00:01:37.250> bit<00:01:37.370> different<00:01:37.700> configuration<00:01:38.210> but

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
a little bit different configuration but

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.750 
a little bit different configuration but
with<00:01:38.479> a<00:01:38.510> built-in<00:01:38.840> display<00:01:39.049> now<00:01:40.040> what<00:01:40.549> is<00:01:40.640> the

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
with a built-in display now what is the
