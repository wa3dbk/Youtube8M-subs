mycorrhizae<00:01:53.670> out<00:01:53.790> there<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.540> a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
mycorrhizae out there this is a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.359 
mycorrhizae out there this is a
beneficial<00:01:55.200> fungus<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.619> get<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.070> soil

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
beneficial fungus you get it in the soil

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.800 
beneficial fungus you get it in the soil
it<00:01:56.670> attaches<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.360> roots<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.040> provides<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.310> sim

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
it attaches to roots and provides a sim

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.749 
it attaches to roots and provides a sim
attock<00:02:00.110> relationships<00:02:00.799> so<00:02:01.040> these<00:02:01.490> things

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
attock relationships so these things

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.359 
attock relationships so these things
send<00:02:02.149> out<00:02:02.270> microscopic<00:02:03.110> roots<00:02:03.369> capturing

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
send out microscopic roots capturing

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.520 
send out microscopic roots capturing
water<00:02:04.939> and<00:02:05.270> nutrients<00:02:05.720> bring<00:02:05.930> it<00:02:06.079> to<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.350> root

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
water and nutrients bring it to the root

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.770 
water and nutrients bring it to the root
and<00:02:06.710> then<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.310> root<00:02:07.490> in<00:02:07.670> turn<00:02:07.880> provides<00:02:08.390> sugar

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
and then the root in turn provides sugar

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.990 
and then the root in turn provides sugar
pretty<00:02:09.500> good<00:02:09.679> little<00:02:09.830> deal<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:10.580> planting
