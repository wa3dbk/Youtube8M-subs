Castle<00:00:14.440> the<00:00:14.650> fastest<00:00:15.219> and<00:00:15.549> it<00:00:16.450> leaves<00:00:16.630> you<00:00:16.840> a

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:16.870 
Castle the fastest and it leaves you a

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.260 
Castle the fastest and it leaves you a
little<00:00:17.140> weak<00:00:17.350> but<00:00:17.740> in<00:00:18.550> the<00:00:18.700> long<00:00:18.880> run<00:00:18.910> it's

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
little weak but in the long run it's

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.080 
little weak but in the long run it's
probably<00:00:19.600> the<00:00:19.720> best<00:00:19.750> strategy<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.580> let's<00:00:21.880> get

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
probably the best strategy so let's get

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.040 
probably the best strategy so let's get
this<00:00:22.300> started<00:00:24.090> now<00:00:25.090> you<00:00:25.150> want<00:00:25.360> to<00:00:25.450> start<00:00:25.870> off
