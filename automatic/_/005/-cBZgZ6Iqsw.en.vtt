PowerBait you've never used it it'll

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.880 
PowerBait you've never used it it'll
help<00:00:28.460> you<00:00:28.609> catch<00:00:28.789> more<00:00:28.970> fish<00:00:29.269> if<00:00:29.930> you<00:00:30.170> can't<00:00:30.560> if

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
help you catch more fish if you can't if

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.170 
help you catch more fish if you can't if
you<00:00:31.039> don't<00:00:31.189> have<00:00:31.279> good<00:00:31.310> sensitivity<00:00:31.789> in<00:00:32.090> your

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
you don't have good sensitivity in your

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.419 
you don't have good sensitivity in your
hand<00:00:32.419> PowerBait<00:00:32.989> basically<00:00:33.859> means<00:00:34.039> when<00:00:34.280> it's

00:00:34.419 --> 00:00:34.429 
hand PowerBait basically means when it's

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:36.309 
hand PowerBait basically means when it's
just<00:00:34.609> get<00:00:34.729> ahold<00:00:34.940> of<00:00:34.999> it<00:00:35.210> they<00:00:35.539> don't<00:00:35.870> let<00:00:36.109> go

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:36.319 
just get ahold of it they don't let go

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:39.219 
just get ahold of it they don't let go
so<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:37.550> fish<00:00:37.729> hold<00:00:37.909> onto<00:00:38.059> it<00:00:38.239> longer<00:00:38.420> gives

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:39.229 
so the fish hold onto it longer gives

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:41.289 
so the fish hold onto it longer gives
you<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.440> ability<00:00:39.499> to<00:00:39.859> say<00:00:40.159> oh<00:00:40.309> there's<00:00:40.760> one<00:00:40.940> I
