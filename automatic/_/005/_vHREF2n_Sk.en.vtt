it's as good as this second off very

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.680 
it's as good as this second off very
easy<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.079> use<00:00:55.289> simple<00:00:55.860> UI<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.579> works<00:00:56.910> as<00:00:57.120> well

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
easy to use simple UI it works as well
