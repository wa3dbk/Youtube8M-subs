but first we want to talk about the new

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.560 
but first we want to talk about the new
D<00:00:19.500> motor<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.920> 6-cylinder<00:00:20.430> D<00:00:20.609> motor<00:00:20.850> tell<00:00:21.390> us<00:00:21.510> a

little bit about this new engine well
this<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.820> actually<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.510> first<00:00:24.660> one<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.990> United

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
this is actually the first one in United

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.250 
this is actually the first one in United
States<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:26.070> it's<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.460> relatively<00:00:26.880> new

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
States so it's it's a relatively new

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.480 
States so it's it's a relatively new
engine<00:00:28.260> they've<00:00:28.680> been<00:00:28.830> testing<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.220> for<00:00:29.369> two

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
engine they've been testing it for two

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.189 
engine they've been testing it for two
years<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.880> helicopters<00:00:30.449> running<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.960> hundred

there's<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> new<00:00:33.800> coaxial<00:00:34.800> helicopter<00:00:34.890> that

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
there's a new coaxial helicopter that

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.459 
there's a new coaxial helicopter that
they've<00:00:35.760> been<00:00:35.940> doing<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.450> lot<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> testing

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
they've been doing a lot of the testing

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.350 
they've been doing a lot of the testing
with<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.829> well<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> dyno<00:00:38.640> making<00:00:39.180> sure

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
with as well as on the dyno making sure

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.569 
with as well as on the dyno making sure
it's<00:00:39.540> great<00:00:40.379> before<00:00:40.829> they<00:00:40.950> introduce<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.460> to

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
it's great before they introduce it to

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.760 
it's great before they introduce it to
the<00:00:41.670> market<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.110> benefits<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.680> this

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the market but the benefits of this

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.220 
the market but the benefits of this
engine<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.309> very<00:00:44.520> low<00:00:45.059> weight<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.870> almost

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
engine is very low weight it's almost

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.990

one-to-one horsepower to weight ratio
which<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:49.260> all<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.500> engineers<00:00:50.010> strive

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
which is what all the engineers strive

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.970 
which is what all the engineers strive
for<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.750> hundred<00:00:52.020> seventy<00:00:52.289> eight<00:00:52.500> pounds

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.620 
that torque with the direct drive Avenue
we<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.680> push<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.009> bigger<00:01:59.189> real<00:01:59.969> aviation

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
we can push the bigger real aviation

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.780 
we can push the bigger real aviation

they're<00:02:57.390> all<00:02:57.480> interchangeable<00:02:57.720> from<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.380> six

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
they're all interchangeable from the six

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.160 
they're all interchangeable from the six
to<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.770> four<00:02:58.980> cylinder<00:02:59.250> so<00:03:00.239> really<00:03:00.630> truly<00:03:00.989> the

to the four cylinder so really truly the
six<00:03:01.890> cylinder<00:03:02.070> is<00:03:02.600> just<00:03:03.600> two<00:03:03.750> more<00:03:03.900> cylinders

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
six cylinder is just two more cylinders

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.350 
six cylinder is just two more cylinders
than<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.620> four<00:03:04.770> so<00:03:05.610> what<00:03:05.790> airplanes<00:03:06.180> are

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
