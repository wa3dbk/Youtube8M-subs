00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.930
 elderberry blossoms can be made from flowers 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.670
 acacia can be made from tea petals 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.629
 roses 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:42.180
 This is a non-alcoholic product. Well, maybe 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.579
 to be that dream that is so much as in kefir 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.780

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:05.250
 This bottle was closed at 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.170
 last year in the month of May when it blossomed 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.200
 acacia 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.689
 I just want to show you first and then 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.840
 I'll tell you at the end of the video a recipe like this 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.200
 the class is done means when you 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.150
 fill it up 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.150
 the gases that accumulate there serve and 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.270
 the bottle is very very tense 5 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:37.380
 centimeters do not need 57 centimeters not 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:41.340
 refill open here you need to open 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.299
 at once completely as if to the maximum 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.619
 pressure quickly came out of here 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.240
 because if you are a little bit 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.600
 open up you will open up very and 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.399
 highly 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.430

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.380

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.310
