Genesis<00:00:09.320> now<00:00:10.320> here<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:10.889> have<00:00:10.920> Pinocchio

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
Genesis now here we have Pinocchio

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.010 
Genesis now here we have Pinocchio
I<00:00:12.000> wanted<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.900> shadowy<00:00:13.440> ape<00:00:13.769> guy<00:00:14.130> sprites

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
I wanted that shadowy ape guy sprites

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.769 
I wanted that shadowy ape guy sprites
zipping<00:00:16.020> at<00:00:16.109> CPU<00:00:16.710> debug<00:00:18.230> and<00:00:19.230> layers<00:00:20.100> and

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
zipping at CPU debug and layers and

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.980 
zipping at CPU debug and layers and
remove<00:00:21.779> layers<00:00:22.590> but<00:00:23.490> as<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.699> can<00:00:23.850> see<00:00:24.090> he's

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
remove layers but as you can see he's

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.800 
remove layers but as you can see he's
black<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.220> background<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.880> black<00:00:27.090> making

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
black and the background is black making

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.859 
black and the background is black making
it<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.199> can't<00:00:28.289> simply<00:00:29.130> captured<00:00:29.490> sprites

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
it so I can't simply captured sprites

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.350 
it so I can't simply captured sprites
however<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.859> version<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.369> James<00:00:32.700> has<00:00:33.120> been

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
however this version of James has been

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.560 
however this version of James has been
modeled<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.680> color<00:00:35.070> key<00:00:35.340> if<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.390> click

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
modeled to have a color key if we click

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.990 
modeled to have a color key if we click
this<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.649> background<00:00:38.129> will<00:00:38.340> change<00:00:38.610> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
this the background will change to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.840 
this the background will change to
bleeding<00:00:39.450> eye<00:00:39.600> pink<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.920> there<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.610> like

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
bleeding eye pink and there just like

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.060 
bleeding eye pink and there just like
before<00:00:42.379> we<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.410> simply<00:00:43.890> use<00:00:44.100> screenshots<00:00:47.450> and

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
before we can simply use screenshots and

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.860 
before we can simply use screenshots and
paste<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.570> sheet<00:00:52.850> now<00:00:53.850> another<00:00:54.420> problem

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
paste it in sheet now another problem

paste it in sheet now another problem
you<00:00:55.079> may<00:00:55.440> come<00:00:55.739> across<00:00:55.770> when<00:00:56.730> using<00:00:57.239> trying<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
you may come across when using trying to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.040 
you may come across when using trying to
get<00:00:58.230> gen<00:00:58.469> sprites<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.210> if<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.420> sprite<00:01:00.750> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
get gen sprites is if a sprite is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.560 
get gen sprites is if a sprite is
obscuring<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.370> want<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.090> wanted

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
obscuring the one you want so I wanted

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.810 
obscuring the one you want so I wanted
the<00:01:03.809> ape<00:01:03.930> dude<00:01:04.229> grabbing<00:01:04.739> sprites<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.430> can't

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the ape dude grabbing sprites I can't

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.560 
the ape dude grabbing sprites I can't
get<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.360> because<00:01:06.720> Pinocchio<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> way

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
get it because Pinocchio is in the way

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.330 
get it because Pinocchio is in the way
however<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:10.020> can't<00:01:10.950> go<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> CPU<00:01:11.869> debug<00:01:13.340> genesis

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
however I can't go to CPU debug genesis

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.070 
however I can't go to CPU debug genesis
and<00:01:14.790> then<00:01:15.030> go<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:16.409> DP<00:01:17.220> sprite<00:01:17.759> i<00:01:18.090> open<00:01:18.960> this

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
and then go to the DP sprite i open this

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.100 
and then go to the DP sprite i open this
up<00:01:19.140> first<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.520> may<00:01:20.790> seem<00:01:20.850> pointless<00:01:21.390> just

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
up first this may seem pointless just

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.149 
up first this may seem pointless just
list<00:01:22.909> as<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.210> see<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:25.290> actually<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
list as you can see it's actually the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.600 
list as you can see it's actually the
sprites<00:01:26.930> now<00:01:27.930> if<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.229> go<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> first<00:01:29.100> sprite

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
sprites now if we go to the first sprite

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.420 
sprites now if we go to the first sprite
of<00:01:29.790> neighbors<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.630> which<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.040> here

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
of neighbors and which this one here

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.490 
of neighbors and which this one here
because<00:01:32.820> Nokia's<00:01:33.630> above<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.990> they<00:01:34.290> should<00:01:34.439> you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
because Nokia's above it they should you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.969 
because Nokia's above it they should you
can<00:01:34.619> see<00:01:35.240> their<00:01:36.240> sprites<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.470> ape<00:01:37.560> guy<00:01:39.979> so

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
can see their sprites of the ape guy so

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.109 
can see their sprites of the ape guy so
we<00:01:41.100> go<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.369> first<00:01:41.579> one<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:43.820> print<00:01:44.820> screen

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
we go to the first one and print screen

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.260 
we go to the first one and print screen
that

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:57.300 

there<00:01:52.860> next<00:01:53.860> one

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.640 

there<00:02:58.310> now<00:02:58.640> we<00:02:58.700> have<00:02:59.030> all<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.720> parts<00:02:59.959> of<00:03:00.349> his

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
there now we have all the parts of his

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.830 
there now we have all the parts of his
sprite<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.970> we<00:03:02.090> zoom<00:03:02.330> in<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:07.420> can't<00:03:08.420> begin<00:03:08.629> to

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
sprite so we zoom in I can't begin to

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:37.059 
sprite so we zoom in I can't begin to
piece<00:03:09.349> them<00:03:09.590> together

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.510 

and<00:03:38.069> there<00:03:38.430> we<00:03:38.580> have<00:03:38.840> sprite<00:03:40.280> without<00:03:41.280> it

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
and there we have sprite without it

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.750 
and there we have sprite without it
being<00:03:41.730> obstructed<00:03:42.270> by<00:03:42.750> Pinocchio<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:46.760> there

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
being obstructed by Pinocchio and there

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.820 
being obstructed by Pinocchio and there
you<00:03:47.850> go<00:03:48.030> basically<00:03:48.720> do<00:03:48.990> that<00:03:49.200> for<00:03:49.530> yup

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
you go basically do that for yup

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.160 
you go basically do that for yup
stricted<00:03:50.310> sprites<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:51.030> then<00:03:51.240> add<00:03:51.510> them<00:03:51.780> to

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
stricted sprites and then add them to

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.470 
stricted sprites and then add them to
sheet
