00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
that when I explain the ability her Q is
called<00:01:34.350> twin<00:01:34.560> bites<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.040> basically<00:01:35.490> after

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
called twin bites so basically after

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.300 
called twin bites so basically after
activating<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:36.840> wookums<00:01:37.320> q<00:01:37.799> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
activating it it's like wookums q you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.670 
activating it it's like wookums q you
hit<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> person<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.990> deals<00:01:40.229> bonus<00:01:40.530> damage

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
hit the person and it deals bonus damage

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.789 
hit the person and it deals bonus damage
it<00:01:41.220> actually<00:01:42.000> hits<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.479> person<00:01:42.990> twice<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.530> at

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
it actually hits the person twice and at

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.620 
it actually hits the person twice and at
level<00:01:44.189> five<00:01:44.369> attendre<00:01:44.729> percent<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.270> your<00:01:45.390> ad

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
level five attendre percent of your ad

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.690 
level five attendre percent of your ad
so<00:01:46.500> pretty<00:01:46.710> much<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.369> strokin

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
so pretty much it's like if you strokin

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.210 
so pretty much it's like if you strokin
enemy<00:01:47.970> twice<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:48.630> remember<00:01:49.320> by<00:01:49.740> cool<00:01:50.009> kong

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
enemy twice but remember by cool kong

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.649 
enemy twice but remember by cool kong
you<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.670> hit<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.850> on

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
you can hit it on

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.289 
you can hit it on
and<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.320> auto<00:01:52.560> attack<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.219> then<00:01:53.490> press<00:01:54.090> Q

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
and you can auto attack and then press Q

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.819 
and you can auto attack and then press Q
again<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.749> refreshes<00:01:55.229> your<00:01:55.319> attack<00:01:55.619> so

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
again and it refreshes your attack so

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.050 
again and it refreshes your attack so
right<00:01:56.009> there<00:01:56.159> that's<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.490> three<00:01:56.759> strikes

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
right there that's like three strikes

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.999 
right there that's like three strikes
that<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.569> did<00:01:57.749> within<00:01:58.319> a<00:01:58.409> second<00:01:58.829> which

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
that you just did within a second which

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.069 
that you just did within a second which
is<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> very<00:01:59.549> good<00:01:59.729> early<00:02:00.179> game<00:02:00.420> that's<00:02:00.929> why<00:02:01.049> I

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
is a very good early game that's why I

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.109 
is a very good early game that's why I
like<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.319> go<00:02:01.439> flat<00:02:01.679> ID<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.130> could<00:02:02.280> deal<00:02:02.549> easily

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
like to go flat ID you could deal easily

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.490 
like to go flat ID you could deal easily
some<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.359> these<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.689> health<00:02:03.960> when<00:02:04.289> you<00:02:04.350> have

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
some of these have health when you have

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.679 
some of these have health when you have
exhaust<00:02:04.890> they'll<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.729> reduced<00:02:06.060> armor<00:02:06.509> so

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
exhaust they'll have reduced armor so

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.089 
exhaust they'll have reduced armor so
you<00:02:06.749> can<00:02:06.869> even<00:02:07.109> do<00:02:07.200> more<00:02:07.409> damage<00:02:07.590> slow<00:02:07.950> them

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
you can even do more damage slow them

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.289 
you can even do more damage slow them
down<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.459> easily<00:02:08.819> get<00:02:09.000> first<00:02:09.239> blood<00:02:10.730> her<00:02:11.730> w<00:02:12.150> is

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
down and easily get first blood her w is

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.240 
down and easily get first blood her w is
kind<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.569> like<00:02:12.690> Darren<00:02:13.049> spin<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.530> win<00:02:13.560> except

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
kind of like Darren spin to win except

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.490 
kind of like Darren spin to win except
you're<00:02:14.430> able<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:15.090> auto<00:02:15.660> attack<00:02:16.049> while<00:02:16.319> you're

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
you're able to auto attack while you're

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.440 
you're able to auto attack while you're
spending<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:17.040> gives<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.459> movement<00:02:17.640> speed<00:02:18.150> and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
spending it gives you movement speed and

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.680 
spending it gives you movement speed and
not<00:02:19.140> only<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.549> it<00:02:20.549> doesn't<00:02:20.879> do<00:02:20.940> as<00:02:21.209> much

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
not only that it doesn't do as much

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.539 
not only that it doesn't do as much
damage<00:02:21.989> as<00:02:22.410> Garen<00:02:22.709> force<00:02:23.040> but<00:02:23.280> that's<00:02:23.430> the

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
damage as Garen force but that's the

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.220 
damage as Garen force but that's the
ability<00:02:23.879> I'll<00:02:23.970> be<00:02:24.090> maxing<00:02:24.450> up<00:02:24.569> first<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.170> then

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
ability I'll be maxing up first and then

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.559 
ability I'll be maxing up first and then
I'll<00:02:25.379> be<00:02:25.470> maxing<00:02:25.799> out<00:02:25.829> my<00:02:25.890> cue<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.459> finally<00:02:27.360> my

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
I'll be maxing out my cue and finally my

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.970 
I'll be maxing out my cue and finally my
e<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:28.250> go<00:02:29.629> Chavannes<00:02:30.629> is<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:31.110> skill-shot<00:02:31.470> nuke

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
e I go Chavannes is a skill-shot nuke

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.690 
e I go Chavannes is a skill-shot nuke
that<00:02:32.250> lowers<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.150> person's<00:02:33.890> armor<00:02:34.890> if<00:02:35.370> it

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
that lowers the person's armor if it

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.520 
that lowers the person's armor if it
gets<00:02:35.819> hit<00:02:36.209> it's<00:02:36.599> a<00:02:36.690> single<00:02:37.019> target<00:02:37.140> newt

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
gets hit it's a single target newt

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.440 
gets hit it's a single target newt
therefore<00:02:38.040> whatever<00:02:38.519> hits<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.150> way<00:02:39.269> it

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
therefore whatever hits in the way it

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.289 
therefore whatever hits in the way it
could<00:02:39.569> be<00:02:39.660> minions<00:02:40.019> or<00:02:40.110> anything<00:02:41.150> yeah<00:02:42.150> it's

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
could be minions or anything yeah it's

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.520 
could be minions or anything yeah it's
going<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.450> hit<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.629> minion<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.109> basically<00:02:43.470> you

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
going to hit the minion so basically you

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.110 
going to hit the minion so basically you
could<00:02:43.590> use<00:02:43.739> this<00:02:43.859> for<00:02:44.040> farming<00:02:44.459> if<00:02:44.609> you<00:02:44.819> have

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
could use this for farming if you have

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.180 
could use this for farming if you have
bad<00:02:45.930> range<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.440> you're<00:02:46.530> getting<00:02:46.650> harassed<00:02:47.040> by

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
bad range and you're getting harassed by

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.580 
bad range and you're getting harassed by
other<00:02:47.340> champions<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.660> Savannah's<00:02:49.109> ultimate

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
other champions so Savannah's ultimate

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.680 
other champions so Savannah's ultimate
is<00:02:49.769> probably<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.430> best<00:02:50.670> part<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.329> Shyvana

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
is probably the best part of Shyvana

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.569 
is probably the best part of Shyvana
it's<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.049> funnest<00:02:52.260> part<00:02:52.620> pretty<00:02:53.160> much<00:02:53.400> after

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
it's the funnest part pretty much after

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.870 
it's the funnest part pretty much after
accumulating<00:02:54.060> 100<00:02:54.750> fury<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:56.280> can<00:02:56.430> accumulate

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
accumulating 100 fury you can accumulate

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.729 
accumulating 100 fury you can accumulate
it<00:02:57.120> passively<00:02:57.510> with<00:02:57.750> your<00:02:57.870> passive<00:02:58.230> or<00:02:58.440> by

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
it passively with your passive or by

00:02:58.739 --> 00:02:59.900 
it passively with your passive or by
Auto<00:02:58.950> attacking<00:02:59.280> more<00:02:59.579> kind<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.819> like

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
Auto attacking more kind of like

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.509 
Auto attacking more kind of like
renekton<00:03:00.389> I<00:03:00.480> Tryndamere<00:03:00.900> right<00:03:01.310> but<00:03:02.310> there's

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
renekton I Tryndamere right but there's

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.490 
renekton I Tryndamere right but there's
no<00:03:02.700> cooldown<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.180> her<00:03:03.599> ultimate<00:03:04.019> but<00:03:04.349> she

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
no cooldown on her ultimate but she

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.289 
no cooldown on her ultimate but she
needs<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.829> have<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.010> hundred<00:03:05.400> fury<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.880> use<00:03:06.120> it

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
needs to have a hundred fury to use it

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.440 
needs to have a hundred fury to use it
so<00:03:06.450> basically<00:03:07.139> when<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.040> use<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.910> pretty

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
so basically when you use it you pretty

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.409 
so basically when you use it you pretty
much<00:03:09.540> flow<00:03:10.440> jump<00:03:11.250> over<00:03:11.459> walls<00:03:11.489> jump<00:03:12.209> over

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
much flow jump over walls jump over

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.330 
much flow jump over walls jump over
anything<00:03:12.720> because<00:03:13.079> it's<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.290> huge<00:03:13.650> ass<00:03:13.889> dash

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
anything because it's a huge ass dash

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
charge in there so let's study this clip

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.580 
charge in there so let's study this clip
right<00:06:48.090> here<00:06:48.150> I<00:06:48.330> almost<00:06:48.690> get<00:06:48.870> a<00:06:48.900> pentakill<00:06:49.380> why

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
right here I almost get a pentakill why

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.320 
right here I almost get a pentakill why
because<00:06:49.919> I<00:06:49.950> do<00:06:50.100> exactly<00:06:50.250> what<00:06:50.640> I<00:06:50.789> said<00:06:51.090> I<00:06:51.120> would

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
because I do exactly what I said I would

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.540 
because I do exactly what I said I would
do<00:06:51.510> right<00:06:51.750> so<00:06:52.200> I<00:06:52.229> get<00:06:52.560> suppressed<00:06:53.070> which<00:06:53.400> is

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
do right so I get suppressed which is

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.490 
do right so I get suppressed which is
not<00:06:53.700> really<00:06:53.729> planned<00:06:54.210> but<00:06:54.660> anyways<00:06:54.960> I<00:06:54.990> started

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
not really planned but anyways I started

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.800 
not really planned but anyways I started
doing<00:06:55.919> my<00:06:56.099> W<00:06:56.400> start<00:06:56.669> auto<00:06:56.849> attacking<00:06:57.240> using<00:06:57.720> my

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
doing my W start auto attacking using my

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.839 
doing my W start auto attacking using my
q<00:06:58.080> cleverly<00:06:58.620> then<00:06:59.130> I<00:06:59.159> go<00:06:59.550> inside<00:06:59.760> with<00:07:00.270> my<00:07:00.510> drag

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:00.849 
q cleverly then I go inside with my drag

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:03.089 
q cleverly then I go inside with my drag
in<00:07:00.909> form<00:07:01.629> instead<00:07:01.959> of<00:07:02.139> using<00:07:02.289> my<00:07:02.469> e<00:07:02.499> right<00:07:02.860> away

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:03.099 
in form instead of using my e right away

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:04.619 
in form instead of using my e right away
so<00:07:03.369> I<00:07:03.399> can<00:07:03.520> use<00:07:03.729> the<00:07:03.879> cone<00:07:04.119> instead<00:07:04.330> of<00:07:04.479> just

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:04.629 
so I can use the cone instead of just

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:06.359 
so I can use the cone instead of just
hitting<00:07:04.839> one<00:07:05.050> target<00:07:05.439> right<00:07:05.619> I<00:07:05.800> do<00:07:06.099> all<00:07:06.339> my

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:06.369
