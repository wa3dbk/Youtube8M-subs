00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
had to clear out a jam when I was trying

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.490 
had to clear out a jam when I was trying
to<00:01:47.380> feed<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:47.710> in<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.860> new<00:01:47.979> filament<00:01:48.550> so<00:01:49.500> let's

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
to feed you in the new filament so let's

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.790 
to feed you in the new filament so let's
see<00:01:50.649> if<00:01:50.740> it's<00:01:50.860> gonna<00:01:51.009> work<00:01:51.310> here<00:01:51.820> I<00:01:52.000> can

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
see if it's gonna work here I can

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.100 
see if it's gonna work here I can
restart<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.920> print<00:01:55.470> feels<00:01:56.470> like<00:01:56.649> it's<00:01:56.800> gone

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.950 

if<00:02:02.110> I<00:02:02.289> hit<00:02:02.560> one<00:02:03.869> calls<00:02:04.869> a<00:02:06.210> restart<00:02:07.210> should<00:02:07.750> go

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
if I hit one calls a restart should go

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.910 
if I hit one calls a restart should go
back<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.229> where<00:02:08.679> it<00:02:08.800> was<00:02:11.670> good<00:02:12.670> over<00:02:12.820> here<00:02:12.850> I

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
back to where it was good over here I

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.440 
back to where it was good over here I
forgot<00:02:14.920> about<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.340> part

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:34.020 

here's<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.540> work

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.300 

hahaha<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.989> must<00:02:36.170> be<00:02:36.290> very<00:02:36.560> careful<00:02:37.129> because

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
hahaha that must be very careful because

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.339 
hahaha that must be very careful because
this<00:02:37.790> blade<00:02:38.719> is<00:02:38.989> very<00:02:39.200> thin<00:02:39.709> at<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.099> edge<00:02:40.280> so

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
this blade is very thin at the edge so

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:47.849 
this blade is very thin at the edge so
don't<00:02:42.349> screw<00:02:42.709> that<00:02:42.950> up<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:45.639> did<00:02:46.639> glue<00:02:46.939> it<00:02:47.090> down

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
don't screw that up I did glue it down

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:53.020 
don't screw that up I did glue it down
pretty<00:02:48.859> good<00:02:49.269> compared<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:50.569> the<00:02:51.790> they<00:02:52.790> are

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
pretty good compared to the they are

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:07.390 
pretty good compared to the they are
lower<00:02:53.889> just<00:02:54.889> screwed<00:02:55.159> up

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:17.330 

all<00:03:08.400> right<00:03:09.290> what<00:03:10.290> in<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.650> world<00:03:15.680> that's<00:03:16.680> funny

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
all right what in the world that's funny

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.720 
all right what in the world that's funny
and<00:03:18.299> actually<00:03:18.659> printed<00:03:19.019> on<00:03:19.140> there<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.730> had

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
and actually printed on there I had

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.860 
and actually printed on there I had
trouble<00:03:21.060> printing<00:03:21.659> another<00:03:21.989> logo<00:03:23.599> that<00:03:24.599> I<00:03:24.720> was

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
trouble printing another logo that I was

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.300 
trouble printing another logo that I was
doing<00:03:25.110> for<00:03:25.230> somebody<00:03:25.530> else<00:03:25.799> there's<00:03:26.010> kind<00:03:26.280> of

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
doing for somebody else there's kind of

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.850 
doing for somebody else there's kind of
a<00:03:26.400> little<00:03:26.489> surprise<00:03:27.140> but<00:03:28.140> this<00:03:28.319> one<00:03:28.530> worked

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
a little surprise but this one worked

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.000 
a little surprise but this one worked
wouldn't<00:03:29.580> know<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:30.260> wasn't<00:03:31.260> able<00:03:31.349> to<00:03:31.739> put<00:03:31.980> a

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
wouldn't know it I wasn't able to put a

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.089 
wouldn't know it I wasn't able to put a
typical<00:03:32.579> age<00:03:32.849> I<00:03:33.239> had<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:34.349> know<00:03:34.470> like<00:03:35.069> a

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
typical age I had to you know like a

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:43.850 
typical age I had to you know like a
chisel<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:36.980> Babel<00:03:37.980> later<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:39.540> know<00:03:39.629> wage<00:03:42.860> I'm

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
chisel a Babel later you know wage I'm

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:54.240 
chisel a Babel later you know wage I'm
gonna<00:03:44.099> good<00:03:44.340> look<00:03:44.549> at<00:03:44.670> that

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.510 

so<00:03:54.790> that's<00:03:54.970> pretty<00:03:55.150> cool-looking<00:03:55.480> really<00:03:56.520> you

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
so that's pretty cool-looking really you

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.460 
so that's pretty cool-looking really you
could<00:03:57.700> do<00:03:57.880> block<00:03:58.180> prototype<00:03:59.700> you<00:04:00.700> know<00:04:00.790> blades

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
could do block prototype you know blades

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.800 
could do block prototype you know blades
you<00:04:02.470> could<00:04:02.650> do<00:04:02.770> your<00:04:02.920> design<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:03.690> print<00:04:04.690> it

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
you could do your design and print it

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.890 
you could do your design and print it
and<00:04:04.900> send<00:04:05.200> it<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.350> some<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.710> knife<00:04:06.040> maker<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.900> just

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
and send it to some a knife maker I just

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.600 
and send it to some a knife maker I just
drew<00:04:08.140> this<00:04:08.350> one<00:04:08.560> just<00:04:09.190> I<00:04:09.490> just<00:04:10.480> you<00:04:11.290> know<00:04:11.610> drew

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
drew this one just I just you know drew

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.120 
drew this one just I just you know drew
in<00:04:12.730> Sketchup<00:04:13.350> no<00:04:14.350> template<00:04:14.830> or<00:04:14.980> anything

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
in Sketchup no template or anything

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.949 
in Sketchup no template or anything
course<00:04:15.520> it's<00:04:15.670> kind<00:04:15.910> of<00:04:15.940> rough<00:04:16.150> back<00:04:16.420> here

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
course it's kind of rough back here

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.610 
course it's kind of rough back here
you<00:04:17.739> know<00:04:17.890> shapes<00:04:18.280> will<00:04:18.489> come<00:04:18.700> weird<00:04:19.470> but<00:04:20.470> it

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
you know shapes will come weird but it

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.990 
you know shapes will come weird but it
works<00:04:21.660> so<00:04:22.660> you<00:04:22.780> must<00:04:22.960> be<00:04:23.020> asking<00:04:23.230> yourself

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
works so you must be asking yourself

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:36.980 
works so you must be asking yourself
will<00:04:25.000> it<00:04:25.120> cut<00:04:25.360> paper<00:04:26.070> let's<00:04:27.070> find<00:04:27.310> out

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:44.870 

fighting<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:38.080> get<00:04:38.200> started<00:04:42.810> let's<00:04:43.810> give<00:04:44.080> it<00:04:44.110> a

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
fighting and get started let's give it a

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.090 
fighting and get started let's give it a
fine<00:04:45.880> chance<00:04:46.240> well<00:04:46.540> let<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.720> look<00:04:47.530> at<00:04:47.710> it<00:04:47.740> start

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
fine chance well let it look at it start

00:04:48.100 --> 00:05:07.290 
fine chance well let it look at it start
it<00:04:48.310> for<00:04:48.550> it<00:04:54.000> well<00:05:02.280> drop<00:05:03.280> too<00:05:03.520> bad<00:05:06.180> hammered<00:05:07.180> it

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
it for it well drop too bad hammered it

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:25.860 
it for it well drop too bad hammered it
won't<00:05:07.480> stay<00:05:07.660> focused

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.090 

things<00:05:26.870> can<00:05:27.080> work<00:05:27.140> better<00:05:27.350> if<00:05:27.620> you<00:05:27.710> just<00:05:27.890> keep

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
things can work better if you just keep

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.290 
things can work better if you just keep
going

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.800 

there<00:05:32.300> we<00:05:32.360> go

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
there we go

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:39.430 
there we go
I<00:05:34.810> guess<00:05:35.810> it's<00:05:36.050> more<00:05:36.260> like<00:05:36.440> a<00:05:36.470> tear<00:05:37.780> then<00:05:38.780> a<00:05:38.810> cut

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
I guess it's more like a tear then a cut

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.200 
I guess it's more like a tear then a cut
that's<00:05:39.860> still<00:05:40.280> kind<00:05:40.460> of<00:05:40.520> cool<00:05:40.730> you<00:05:41.000> know<00:05:41.150> you

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
that's still kind of cool you know you

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:49.780 
that's still kind of cool you know you
could<00:05:41.540> can<00:05:42.470> still<00:05:42.710> see<00:05:48.160> and<00:05:49.160> get<00:05:49.340> the<00:05:49.430> light<00:05:49.610> on

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
could can still see and get the light on

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.420 
could can still see and get the light on
it<00:05:49.910> right<00:05:50.590> you<00:05:51.590> can<00:05:51.710> still<00:05:51.950> see<00:05:52.130> that<00:05:52.310> it

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
it right you can still see that it

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:01.560 
it right you can still see that it
actually<00:05:52.550> has<00:05:52.910> a<00:05:52.940> profile<00:05:58.540> all<00:05:59.540> right<00:05:59.810> well<00:06:00.020> I

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
actually has a profile all right well I

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.659 
actually has a profile all right well I
think<00:06:02.570> I<00:06:02.840> can<00:06:02.900> call<00:06:03.200> that<00:06:03.350> a<00:06:03.410> success<00:06:03.950> even

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
think I can call that a success even

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.760 
think I can call that a success even

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420
