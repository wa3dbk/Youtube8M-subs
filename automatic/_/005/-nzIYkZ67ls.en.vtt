the disclaimer that this is not a rule

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.440 
the disclaimer that this is not a rule
this<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.270> can

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
this is you can do what you like you can

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.700 
wear whatever color you want but it is
my<00:00:41.579> opinion<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.329> matching<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.230> lips<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
my opinion that matching your lips and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.010 
my opinion that matching your lips and
your<00:00:43.829> cheeks<00:00:44.329> looks<00:00:45.329> much<00:00:45.600> better<00:00:45.809> than

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
your cheeks looks much better than

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.250 
your cheeks looks much better than
clashing<00:00:46.710> them<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.579> if<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.000> my<00:00:48.660> thinking

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
clashing them so if you my thinking

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.610 
clashing them so if you my thinking
behind<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.850> look<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.149> say

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
behind this is that if you look at say

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.930 
behind this is that if you look at say
pictures<00:00:52.620> from<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> 80s<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.489> those<00:00:53.670> kind<00:00:53.910> of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
pictures from the 80s all those kind of

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.090 
pictures from the 80s all those kind of
classic<00:00:54.329> Robert<00:00:54.629> Palmer<00:00:54.870> videos<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.949> will

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
classic Robert Palmer videos you will

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.740 
classic Robert Palmer videos you will
see<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> women<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:58.170> red<00:00:58.980> lip<00:00:59.280> and

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
see that the women have a red lip and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.009 
see that the women have a red lip and
then<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:01.109> kind<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.710> orange<00:01:02.270> cheek<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.690> they<00:01:03.809> have

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
then a kind of orange cheek so they have

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.870 
then a kind of orange cheek so they have
this<00:01:04.110> sort<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.470> tan<00:01:04.769> cheek<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.640> bright

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
this sort of tan cheek and then a bright

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.679 
this sort of tan cheek and then a bright
red<00:01:06.090> lip<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.900> need<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.260> job<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.689> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
red lip and to need that job and the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.030 
red lip and to need that job and the
reason<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.140> does<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.380> because<00:01:10.560> they've<00:01:10.890> both

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
reason it does is because they've both

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.100 
reason it does is because they've both
got<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.670> they've<00:01:12.360> each<00:01:12.540> got<00:01:12.570> separate

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
got and they've each got separate

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.499 
got and they've each got separate
undertones<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.670> red<00:01:14.880> has<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.479> of

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
undertones so the red has a kind of

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.109 
undertones so the red has a kind of
pinky<00:01:15.930> undertone<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.610> blusher<00:01:17.850> has<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
pinky undertone and the blusher has a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.090 
pinky undertone and the blusher has a
brownie<00:01:18.450> orange<00:01:18.960> undertone<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.650> they

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
brownie orange undertone and they

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.219 
brownie orange undertone and they
immediately<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.850> think<00:01:21.240> makes<00:01:21.540> makeup<00:01:22.049> look

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
immediately I think makes makeup look

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.950 
immediately I think makes makeup look
very<00:01:22.530> very<00:01:22.590> dated<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.970> other<00:01:24.240> reason<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.689> don't

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
very very dated the other reason I don't

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.289 
very very dated the other reason I don't
like<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.369> much<00:01:26.610> as<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.939> absolutely

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
like it is that as much as I absolutely

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.899 
like it is that as much as I absolutely
love<00:01:27.659> blusher<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.229> see<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.560> as<00:01:28.740> one<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
love blusher and I see it as one of the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.990 
love blusher and I see it as one of the
most<00:01:30.210> important<00:01:30.840> steps<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.470> makeup<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.850> of

most important steps in makeup one of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.210 
most important steps in makeup one of
the<00:01:33.119> jobs<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.570> blusher<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.409> get<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.799> from<00:01:35.070> A

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
know dark brown or black to here is a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.330 
know dark brown or black to here is a
smoother<00:01:55.439> transition<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.130> have

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
smoother transition if you have

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.429 
smoother transition if you have
something<00:01:56.579> basically<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.659> same<00:01:57.869> color<00:01:58.170> on

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
something basically the same color on

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.090 
something basically the same color on
your<00:01:58.649> cheek<00:01:59.420> having<00:02:00.420> said<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:01.380> because

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
your cheek having said that just because

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.950 
your cheek having said that just because
I<00:02:02.280> think<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.729> needs<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.119> be<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> same<00:02:03.570> color

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
I think it needs to be the same color

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.870 
I think it needs to be the same color
doesn't<00:02:04.560> mean<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:05.070> needs<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.430> be<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> same

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
doesn't mean it needs to be the same

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
doesn't mean it needs to be the same
shade<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.780> I'm<00:02:06.869> not<00:02:07.049> saying<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.560> to

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
shade so I'm not saying you have to

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.710 
shade so I'm not saying you have to
exactly<00:02:08.220> color<00:02:08.700> match<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.270> here<00:02:09.690> for

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.059 
the color of skin at its base is a nude
tone<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:41.140> these<00:03:41.290> are<00:03:41.500> all<00:03:41.590> nude<00:03:41.829> tone
