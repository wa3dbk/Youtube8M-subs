00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.040 
milk I know a lot of us are trying to
get<00:00:44.460> away<00:00:44.550> from<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.969> canned<00:00:45.300> coconut<00:00:45.570> milk

even<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.469> coconut<00:00:46.920> milk<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.760> these

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
even the coconut milk that is in these

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.420 
even the coconut milk that is in these
aseptic<00:00:48.390> packages<00:00:49.079> because<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.649> what<00:00:50.129> lines

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
aseptic packages because of what lines

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.110 
aseptic packages because of what lines
these<00:00:50.789> packages<00:00:51.390> tends<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.430> make<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.640> milk<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
these packages tends to make the milk a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.630 
these packages tends to make the milk a
lot<00:00:54.420> less<00:00:54.870> healthy<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.920> maybe<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.309> certainly

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
lot less healthy so maybe it's certainly

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.209 
lot less healthy so maybe it's certainly
making<00:00:56.820> raw<00:00:57.180> fresh<00:00:58.170> coconut<00:00:58.949> milk<00:00:58.980> yourself

making raw fresh coconut milk yourself

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.670 
making raw fresh coconut milk yourself
can't<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.300> beat<00:01:00.449> for<00:01:00.690> taste<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.199> nutrition

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
can't be beat for taste and nutrition

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.889 
can't be beat for taste and nutrition
it's<00:01:01.980> always<00:01:02.399> best<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.660> I'm<00:01:03.750> going

would be in packages that are on the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.830 
would be in packages that are on the
shelf<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> would<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.610> dry<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.420> not

shelf and it would be dry this is not

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.569 
shelf and it would be dry this is not
you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.500> also<00:01:28.650> make<00:01:28.860> coconut<00:01:29.070> milk<00:01:29.430> with

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
you can also make coconut milk with

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.789 
you can also make coconut milk with
desiccated<00:01:30.150> coconut<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:31.049> problem<00:01:31.500> with<00:01:31.619> that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
desiccated coconut the problem with that

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.399 
desiccated coconut the problem with that
is<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.430> use<00:01:32.640> boiling<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.540> boiling

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
is you have to use boiling a boiling

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.190 
is you have to use boiling a boiling
liquid<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.610> basically<00:01:36.000> reconstitute<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
liquid to basically reconstitute the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.770 
liquid to basically reconstitute the
desiccated<00:01:37.650> coconut<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.509> don't<00:01:39.600> really

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
desiccated coconut and I don't really

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.420 
desiccated coconut and I don't really
like<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.049> we're<00:01:40.350> trying<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.890> raw<00:01:41.130> coconut

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
like that we're trying to do raw coconut

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.240 
like that we're trying to do raw coconut
milk<00:01:41.820> here<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.869> for<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.740> really<00:01:43.950> need

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
milk here and for that you really need

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.389 
milk here and for that you really need
frozen<00:01:44.970> fresh<00:01:45.479> coconut<00:01:46.409> meat<00:01:46.530> or<00:01:46.799> coconut

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
frozen fresh coconut meat or coconut

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.420 
frozen fresh coconut meat or coconut
meat<00:01:47.490> directly<00:01:47.880> out<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.329> coconut<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:50.130> is

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
meat directly out of coconut so this is

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.160 
meat directly out of coconut so this is
not<00:01:50.610> desiccated<00:01:51.240> looks<00:01:51.450> desiccated<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.079> if

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
not desiccated looks desiccated but if

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.020 
not desiccated looks desiccated but if
