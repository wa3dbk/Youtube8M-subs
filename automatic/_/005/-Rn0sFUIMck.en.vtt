00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.410
 yes 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.639
 very good all guys and welcome to 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.960
 one more episode of know how and good 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.790
 I do not know I do not know when he's telling us 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.800
 but I think there are nine one thing 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.200
 obviously similar as they are all 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.990
 Monday and I study now a lot a lot a lot 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.019
 time then now at the end 50 chapters 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.730
 So, well, nothing to tell you that my 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.110
 week to use sniper good to 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.300
 end not if a week has been four or 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.440
 five days will come to an end and what 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.730
 I will do from now on not to leave it 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.750
 sideways because obviously noticed that 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.820
 playing the days only with 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.070
 snipers greatly improved what 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.440
 I will do will be dedicate the days between daily 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.440
 when he plays the call of duty to play with 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.910
 weapon in the cost and the nuclear ones of the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.350
 nuclear subscriber that I have to 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.260
 get me out yet I have a lot left 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.260
 I only have with the boy in the white the 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.000
 two and then later also play in the 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.250
 cost and on the weekends criticize them 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.739
 play white to play 2 with the 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.330
 sniper and maybe play modern 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.280
 warfare 3 because today you guys know 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.890
 I wanted to have very warfare 3 I've been 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.350
 still playing games and I came out 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.030
 good games but those that have left 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.979
 some were not russian do and akwid 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.500
 because creating them using the quick die 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.540
 very much and I did not want to have 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.550
 21 21 because I had to cut many 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.530
 pieces and it is also very serious at 3 ' 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.420
 sniper ' I find it much more 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.030
 different because the mobility to be 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.590
 more different the quick is weirder more 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.210
 rare does not mean it's harder to 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.920
 I find it much easier to get out 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.780
 eclipse in addition this terrestrial war and 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.430
 there are people is not like the white unless 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.410
 you see that terrestrial face and there is nobody 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.540
 over if you get the connection goes 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.190
 extremely bad in the uav to 3 da 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.890
 I like to play and many people playing all 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.570
 the modes plus the connection goes to 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.240
 decently adjacent mind well 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.130
 so I think it's much more cool 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.229
 taking out clips would be easier but not 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.490
 I think I 'm going to play a lot more parts 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.680
 with the sniper maybe a couple 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.880
 of games with the ar5 at best with the 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.880
 l 115 with the msr of course I do not know but 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.590
 I do not want to give you much to start 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.880
 give also to x pr because I already have the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.140
 ballista and that of golden ere and being 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.360
 of hard you are seeing now with the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.040
 gold barista already on some little thing and 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.330
 Many of you tell me it is not with what happens with 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.790
 the action and well I will tell you then 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.620
 Obviously adjudge it are things 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.209
 I'm not going to upload all the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.040
 monday clouds service coparán you hear 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.780
 because they have been saying a channel in which 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.580
 pillan is dedicated to catch respawn in one 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.310
 against one and I do not want to raise that 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.630
 upload that to my channel because I think that 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.790
 It's very good but it does not help me improve 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.650
 What I want is to learn to play with 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.630
 is found in public then 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.420
 when we got to the trick part 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.340
 shorts, yes we will do tutorials I do not know 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.220
 how much will be best within a few 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.800
 how many weeks will we start with the very 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.120
 basic trichet is worth to improve Monday 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.440
 next if you put me many the 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.120
 comments that in the next one that is 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.610
 the tutorial detrick shots maybe 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.840
 I encourage you and I bring you a tutorial of triplets 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.660
 here you see me making assholes like 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.770
 4 does not because I want to also do not 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.200
 I'm trying everything I'm trying 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.790
 silent in which camps I'm 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.350
 trying to shoot a c 4 to shoot it 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.570
 although I know that people stop him 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.010
 tight times to the x not and the exploits 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.750
 but I'm trying to shoot the and 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.050
 when I shot then kill an enemy 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.430
 with 41 do not know I'm trying everything 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.900
 I also started to try trick are 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.330
 only three or has not yet left me 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.709
 none as I said yesterday good as I already 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.980
 I said on the floor of the list I tried 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.540
 well 360 wii that some has left you not 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.940
 I know I'm trying things because you have to go 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.200
 testing and clips clips clips in this 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.960
 time that white players of this 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.000
 I have not had a moment 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.320
 and it's easier to get good clips in 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.150
 the targets after he responds is 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.740
 more fixed than in the case you guys in the 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.830
 call of duty with a bigger step is 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.120
 responsible then what happens that the 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.160
 clips are harder to pull out 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.170
 you can take an ace of 4 an oil 5 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.670
 as much but here for example in 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.680
 demolition at high since everything in 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.960
 any demolition map can you 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.350
 take out very very good things that I believe 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.630
 that obviously 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.040
 It's nice to see, not for that, the game is with 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.810
 the sniper is very easy because it is 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.990
 super fake here you are going to see some 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.330
 how many simple clicks so 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.590
 I'm seeing that Carlos is 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.180
 rather easier than you use of 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.970
 franco pérez harder to remove 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.200
 good fitz I believe but the truth that 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.240
 with black'm talking to you two 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.190
 very well very very very well had 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.510
 hope that you always win worse but 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.640
 the truth is that I'm pretty enough 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.530
 happy and in that ere I mean that 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.030
 I find it much easier than going 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.900
 list you already know it gives much less than in 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.070
 marker 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.110
 it's true that I have a little more in 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.640
 aim but if you know wait for that 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.310
 second thing that make you aim for 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.250
 remove it looks a lot the quick goes straight 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.590
 Straight rectum and is lethal 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.480
 then we in principle stay with 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.000
 the one of that ere but of course it is that to be removed 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.440
 fitz with the ballista is very cool to what 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.900
 ready I call him the sniper of 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.640
 toy because the first time I saw it 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.170
 in flat and yellow it looked like a 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.790
 sniper mounted with pieces of lego 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.010
 of bullets with pieces of lego to the best 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.590
 They are a little freaky but it's like that 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.090
 it's pretty funny to be 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.990
 re looks like another with shooter more over 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.790
 man 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.040
 the truth is that it is a part of the team 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.810
 to be being moved with good quix 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.340
 obviously there is no fitz because only 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.160
 equipment and not by equipment is complicated 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.000
 get fitz 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.760
 the domain in demolitions as much as 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.280
 more recommended to get balls 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.810
 low with the sniper and followed and 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.250
 Now, little by little, I'm getting 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.300
 clips as I said start playing 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.830
 the weekend with the sniper 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.950
 because I want to bring the good episodes 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.200
 It does not spit and would take better costal 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.600
 I will do some with you to explain the 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.430
 anced tutorial tripod and slowly 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.840
 now you know I said because you are going to 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.130
 start playing as if you started 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.960
 continue with those that more with which it is 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.700
 with the shorter ones with which it is with 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.070
 long weapons I will try what I already said the 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.720
 double burning rus and when we started 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.420
 try the one that seeks to destroy that of 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.460
 truth that I have enough desire like 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.690
 you have seen then the click month to me 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.270
 guys I hope you liked the 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.030
 mini floor of not looking for 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:52.600
 of today tomorrow and Wednesday videos of 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.470
 coss I guess I said there are favorites and 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.470
 until tomorrow videos guys
