00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.510
 and guys are welcome here more 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.340
 a video that still lacks channel water 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.440
 free games also ready on the site of 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.299
 free games for the point with 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.279
 If you remember, this is the game. 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.770
 that I'm creating and that I was 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.300
 teaching you how to do some 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.460
 these things here from a game of 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.320
 Who is this platform if this is the first 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.699
 Once you are coming here you can 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.800
 Use the classes I did for you. 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.870
 and accompanying 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.239
 and there's a lot I did, there's only one 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.160
 The problem that I noticed is that it has 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.710
 A lot of people ask me some 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.050
 things that have here only that from the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.950
 beginning was never my goal to teach everything 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.350
 for everyone understood why 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.140
 there is a lot of complex things that would take 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.570
 too much to teach and kind of like this 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.670
 classes I do in kind 10 20 minutes 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.399
 not not give to do 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.770
 so I decided not to do it this way 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.879
 But what happens is that there is a lot of 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.150
 people who want to learn some things 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.270
 new and such drug lost some want 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.010
 learn some new things and I 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.740
 could teach only that the problem is the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.170
 next question comes from youtube 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.270
 what happens is usually when 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.939
 questions arrive that I can see the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.759
 question has it been a long time since she 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.340
 Someone asked me and type more 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.299
 or less on that idea and then it ends 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.579
 never be able to answer why because 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.630
 You have already realized how things are. 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.939
 on Youtube 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.350
 kind of like that sometimes I get mail 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:43.409
 say something, will not you? 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:45.090
 how come I is you type you get 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.490
 a message when I go there to see it already 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.920
 It is old and so kind a cool thing 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.970
 so I can help you 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.579
 so what I 'm thinking of doing 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.280
 type create a kind of a mini forum 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.490
 that it is easier for us to get into 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.890
 type able to communicate because there no 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.020
 just have to be doing this more kind 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.840
 so someone who is interested in 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.050
 to be helping others is to know 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.340
 a little more may be giving the opinion 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.230
 in thing 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.710
 instead of being alone 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.230
 for 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.660
 I think it 's cool if you had more 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.620
 people participating then this is what I 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.190
 I'll do it because it's going to get more serious. 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.450
 more interesting as soon as everything 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.610
 world could participate and I could 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.800
 answer the questions you see that I 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.520
 I did not do much more afterwards since 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.740
 last time I started creating this 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.170
 version here has a lot of thing a lot 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.550
 What works is cool is the platforms 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.070
 have the enemies 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.250
 He has the parachute right here. 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.870
 that the bee shoots you then 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.320
 if I stand here because a little 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.620
 She will come and she will throw you at me. 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.980
 will not spend a life either 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.670
 He also has this rocket on his back. 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.040
 What help has these pitfalls here? 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.740
 who fall have these traps here in the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.770
 ground he can push the box 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.750
 animation is not done yet but it 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.150
 legal that part that still needs to be 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.220
 an improvement because if you 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.340
 attention is a little weak too 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.420
 favelado that there is more that he 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.970
 does he carry objects he slides 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.480
 was it break the one down here if 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.000
 you squeeze the times down to it 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.500
 jump on the walls 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.360
 Interestingly, they did not have 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.730
 much most of the elements that 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.470
 I wanted it in the game and it 's ready 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.640
 understand the type so what we say 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:48.210
 of the mechanics of the game we will not put 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.860
 so it's ready and it would have a door 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.660
 here to pass phase or something 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.880
 Type right 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.500
 here also the two furniture if you do not 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.050
 I know if we perceive at first to perceive 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.250
 that the two clouds move faster 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.790
 what other 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.210
 this is an effect of what it calls relax 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:10.470
 which are several objects aligned in a 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:13.440
 the same layer and you can 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.600
 sees them in is different speed is like 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.030
 if you were driving a car and 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.700
 you look out then object that 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.260
 gives closer to you moves faster 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.890
 that which is farthest 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.450
 so it's from there that they took this 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.120
 fact idea of putting 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.580
 the games but this guys I'm staying for 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.770
 here as I said it is difficult is 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.840
 answering all the questions 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.940
 It's a nice thing that I'm going to do. 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.430
 I'm going to draw a license I have from 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.310
 kosovo two I won in a promotion 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.780
 participating company 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.700
 the company is on a promotion now 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.160
 that when they complete a 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.980
 million one million views 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.260
 you go to the page it downloads 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.720
 of the program they will if it goes 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.040
 is automatically participating 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.200
 I think it's going to be really cool for everything. 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.580
 world is participating in going out but I 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.050
 I'm going to stay here I hope you 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.700
 You liked this video, sorry. 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.700
 delay and cost up to
