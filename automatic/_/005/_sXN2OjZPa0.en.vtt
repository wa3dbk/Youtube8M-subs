00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.349
 I really have a lot 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.580
 [Music] 

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:11.880
 no matter 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.549
 Hello everyone today I will talk about my 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.650
 experience being an illustrator so 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.140
 maybe this video is coming soon 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.520
 because I do not have that much in media and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.529
 an illustrator but there are many people and 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.500
 He asked me for advice on how to be 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.619
 illustrator or how is working in the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.710
 means of illustration in chile then 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.509
 Well yes that would be a good idea as 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.110
 make this video first I have to 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.809
 to clarify is that it is a video made under my 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.090
 experience is my experience being 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.739
 illustrator then obviously the 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.719
 experience of other people can be 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.250
 much more different in which I had 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.290
 he first thing they always ask me 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.629
 is that I study to do to be 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.059
 illustrator and that I am in the first 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.620
 question is not like that to put because no 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.129
 it is necessary to study something related 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.379
 with illustration to be illustrator 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.269
 obviously it helps for example to study the 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.729
 Technical career of the obvious illustration 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.530
 and also help for example to study 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.440
 art or graphic design that are careers 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.429
 related to the artistic world 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.500
 humanistic but I have also known 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:14.420
 many people who are in the middle 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.800
 illustrative and they studied things nothing 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.200
 what to do with the illustration or the 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.020
 art for example I've met publicist 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.670
 Illustrators known journalists 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.590
 illustrators I've met people from the 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.710
 literature that are illustrators then 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.270
 there are really exceptions now if you 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.159
 is who got rid of his labors and still 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.869
 they are not in college and I recommend 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.970
 take a career related to the 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.990
 artistic medium careers that help art 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.640
 good graphic design 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.200
 in the career illustration that is a 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.530
 technical career 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.960
 today I'm here I studied design 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.909
 graphic then the important thing is that 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.920
 you have to realize this if you 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.630
 they like to draw and are hesitating about 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.070
 of the illustration career first 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.860
 that they have to ask is if they 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.590
 like this as a hobby or a hobby or 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.140
 to live from this how to work and that 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.090
 they pay you for drawing I know it sounds 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.100
 The idea that they pay you for 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.649
 draw but many times one has to 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.299
 look for things that you do not like as 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.880
 everything in life like any job 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.530
 in methodologies that help find 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.720
 this answer that if we want the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.970
 illustration as a hobby as a profession is 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.430
 For example, start doing jobs 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.819
 little ones ask me a lot in that 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.170
 we work and for those of us who work in 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.480
 general the illustrators we work for 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.400
 communicational media those means 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.980
 communications can be digital or 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.410
 analogous analogs as printed as 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.989
 journals or digital media of 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.120
 communication as for example agencies 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.250
 who are also in the company 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.680
 advertising agency or for example 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.019
 blogs i started working 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.250
 another year is just sad because 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.700
 while all my companions 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.829
 They rested on the road and all that I 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.500
 I started doing little jobs 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.849
 sporadic for individuals or for 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.769
 small businesses that needed 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.739
 construction services to me 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.389
 little boys paid me little or nothing in the 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.730
 first work I did illustration 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:09.090
 but it helped me a lot because the whole idea 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.090
 to have small sporadic jobs 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.579
 is to have and put together a portfolio of 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.379
 illustration and step that was what 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.079
 I was dancing on the previous idea 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.970
 know if this is really going to be a 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.560
 hobby hobby or something to which we 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.689
 we want to dedicate then the first 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.639
 jobs will realize if they like it 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.859
 relate to client if the 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.310
 illustration is something they want to be that 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:34.680
 they want to do as you asked then is 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.000
 interesting and very useful to have the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.650
 first work approaches 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.599
 illustration when one is in the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.250
 university and still being maintained by 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.379
 parents because there is nothing to lose 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.860
 in the background another question that asks me 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.890
 is if one can live from this 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.630
 really if you use a technically 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.030
 I could live on anything 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.530
 and that of anything but if one is 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.880
 thinking that he will win money and he 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.120
 millionaire by the race the illustration 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.400
 better study medicine another of those 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.140
 racing like billionaires one can 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.110
 live from the illustration but it's not a 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.550
 career with which you become rich and what 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.380
 another one that asks me is that if the medium 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.720
 is overpopulated illustrators and the 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.820
 truth is that not the background with cons 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.680
 question he gave me is not overpopulated 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.630
 there are many architects there are many 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.510
 engineers there are many journalists in 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.160
 many designers this in general is 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.170
 overpopulated of all dry people and 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.720
 talented and creative is needed in 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.190
 all means even and even more in the 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.620
 illustration but in general the 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.000
 illustration has taken an average one 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.770
 very great importance within chile 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.440
 how we work the idea is that this 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.230
 client arrives with a commission and we 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.450
 we have to generate a budget according to 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.000
 two bases or three main bases that 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:51.300
 are the ones that I use is always 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.810
 example for when is two of what size 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.460
 is and the other one that I always occupied that not 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.500
 it always applies but is for example 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.450
 So many pages are or how many 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.890
 illustrations are then under that 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.260
 quote me the hand and if that 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.200
 quote is approved sent me a sketch 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.570
 the concept is approved corrects arrive 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.460
 comments I correct the sketch and then it 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.500
 begins to paint and corrects 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.870
 example the color gamut and after 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.210
 the illustration ends and the 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.190
 high resolution final file that's 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.530
 to the daily features how a 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.930
 illustration project also I 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.460
 They ask a lot about how we work 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.129
 the illustrators I particularly 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.930
 They sounded a lot with photoshop 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:35.590
 That's my baby 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:39.310
 I work with this tablet is a web 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.889
 conscious and it's a bacán tablet and I think 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.620
 that tiny kidneys in part of payment and 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.600
 not even new is lanús to two or three 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.460
 people carry a super good investment 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.600
 because good and cache I'm going to do 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.930
 illustrate the rest of my life then 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.180
 I decided to invest in something the only tenth 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.610
 in my head with that tablet that you 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.990
 already know that it is with bamboo if 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.729
 you want to start drying the 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.889
 illustration of truth I recommend this 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.410
 tablet because it's amazing is tiny 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.509
 practice to help everywhere and it's 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.190
 bacán I know it five years of my career 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:13.560
 or four years of my career and still 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.560
 It works and it's cool and I love it 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.690
 but solved almost all his things 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.580
 about the illustration I hope that 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.800
 have a week that you liked 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.050
