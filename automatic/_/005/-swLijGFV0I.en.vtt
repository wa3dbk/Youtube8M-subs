00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
at least to my opinion but oh whoa

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.390 
at least to my opinion but oh whoa
that's<00:05:16.360> a<00:05:16.510> dice<00:05:16.690> I<00:05:16.960> like<00:05:17.110> this<00:05:17.320> now<00:05:17.979> if<00:05:18.039> I<00:05:18.220> want

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
that's a dice I like this now if I want

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.080 
that's a dice I like this now if I want
it<00:05:18.460> this<00:05:18.729> way

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
it this way

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.390 
it this way
just<00:05:19.810> dodges<00:05:20.800> all<00:05:20.979> the<00:05:21.250> attack

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
just dodges all the attack

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.750 
just dodges all the attack
it's<00:05:23.360> a<00:05:23.450> lot<00:05:23.660> harder<00:05:23.930> than<00:05:24.470> Raging<00:05:25.400> Blast<00:05:25.490> 2

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
it's a lot harder than Raging Blast 2

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.180 
it's a lot harder than Raging Blast 2
I'll<00:05:25.880> say<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.300> I<00:05:26.600> find<00:05:27.290> this<00:05:27.470> game<00:05:27.710> a<00:05:27.980> lot

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
I'll say that I find this game a lot

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.190 
I'll say that I find this game a lot
more<00:05:28.340> difficult<00:05:28.790> than<00:05:28.820> Raging<00:05:29.150> Blast<00:05:29.210> 2<00:05:29.510> May

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
more difficult than Raging Blast 2 May

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.960 
more difficult than Raging Blast 2 May
because<00:05:30.320> I'm<00:05:30.830> having<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.130> practices<00:05:31.640> I<00:05:31.760> found
