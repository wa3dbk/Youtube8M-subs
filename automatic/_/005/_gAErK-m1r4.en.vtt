 the clip especially the zombie clip which 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.609

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.109
 invades other games of different players 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.510
 disguised as zombies wearing like a hunter 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.730
 unless of course this is allowed in the settings 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.949
 the invasion is a formidable monster capable 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.690
 much kills the mountains of survivors 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.399
 torn with their claws or just 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.590
 pounding them with spittle 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.780
 he has the ability to mass forces 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.940

 tentacles of people video about and a bunch of different 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.940
 melee weapons nutritionally but also 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.219
 little gunshot what happens in 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.590
 invasion of time but that happens 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.480
 when a hunter invades a player surviving 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.579
 there is an alert about this with a timer 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.250
 three seconds and the hunter himself meanwhile 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.199
 species with other language then goes 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.330
 started the hunt Kohl sleeps on top 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.549
 butt stop all quests 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.659
 appear ascensions introduced having come up well 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.250
 and a little breathing 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.470
 if toys time to face it 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.040
 what are the goals of both parties during 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.320
 invasion 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.420
 hunter this defense drink jumpers and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.520
 of course the destruction of survivors 10 times and 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.530
 it is important that you kill the survivor once 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.330
 10 times whether it is different is common 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.640
 kill count language to win 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.950
 survivor is the destruction of nests jumper 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.960
 which I place the hunter also not 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.560
 give yourself sleep go to yourself in these tenacious 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.140

 sashimi creatures and now nuances 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.220
 first survivors total 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.110
 life namely 10 secondly if 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.060
 survivor kicked elias will come out 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.009
 deduct one life in the third if all 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.659
 survivors will leave the game after the start 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.340
 only them without zombies namely when 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.110
 will come the hunter appearance timer 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.810
 a hunter's victory counts 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.580
 will give tricks a victory in the fourth if 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.150
 the hunter will then count with the victory 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.700
 living 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.680
 Fifth if the hunter or the survivor comes out 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.910
 before the start of the zombie mode thats not 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.700
 part of the phrase 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.050
 sharing game no one will arrive points for 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.450
 it ends with the urban breeze 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.460
 worried about zombies further i will create more 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.050

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.180
