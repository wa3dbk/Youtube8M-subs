one on the bottom that controls the base
and<00:02:09.800> then<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.040> top<00:02:10.220> is<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.850> level<00:02:11.180> control

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
and then the top is the level control

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.210 
and then the top is the level control
for<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.840> let's<00:02:15.110> turn<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:15.500> down<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.740> little

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
for that so let's turn it down a little

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:25.449 
for that so let's turn it down a little
bit<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:23.300> can<00:02:23.480> really<00:02:23.959> thin<00:02:24.230> off<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.530> sound<00:02:24.770> do

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
bit you can really thin off the sound do

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:34.060 
bit you can really thin off the sound do
a<00:02:25.489> lot<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:25.730> tone<00:02:26.090> shaping<00:02:26.540> with<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:26.870> EQ<00:02:33.070> can

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
a lot of tone shaping with that EQ can

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:41.050 
a lot of tone shaping with that EQ can
hear<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.400> post<00:02:34.670> here<00:02:38.950> next<00:02:39.950> let's<00:02:40.730> take<00:02:41.030> a

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
hear that post here next let's take a

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.830 
hear that post here next let's take a
look<00:02:41.300> at<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.600> mid<00:02:41.950> function

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.979 

there's<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.080> level<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:48.420> here's<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.629> Swift

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
there's the level and here's the Swift

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.699 
there's the level and here's the Swift
control<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.530> can<00:02:50.680> hear<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:50.920> working<00:02:55.709> and

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
control you can hear it working and

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.009 
control you can hear it working and
determines<00:02:57.310> what<00:02:57.640> part<00:02:58.269> of<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.599> mid-range

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
determines what part of the mid-range

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.479 
determines what part of the mid-range
frequency<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.099> affected<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.130> can<00:03:03.340> do<00:03:03.459> a

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
frequency is affected so you can do a

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.080 
frequency is affected so you can do a
lot<00:03:03.849> of<00:03:04.090> tone<00:03:04.989> variations<00:03:05.739> with<00:03:05.980> this<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.430> you

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
lot of tone variations with this and you

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
lot of tone variations with this and you
get<00:03:07.239> your<00:03:07.420> different<00:03:07.690> pickup<00:03:07.959> combination

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110
