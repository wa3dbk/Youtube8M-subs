electricity<00:00:40.420> when<00:00:41.420> we<00:00:41.570> invest<00:00:41.960> also<00:00:42.440> we're

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
electricity when we invest also we're

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.850 
electricity when we invest also we're
looking<00:00:43.760> at<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.030> systems<00:00:44.450> we're<00:00:45.379> looking<00:00:45.710> at

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
looking at the systems we're looking at

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.979 
looking at the systems we're looking at
air<00:00:46.190> conditioning<00:00:47.000> which<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:47.420> major<00:00:47.660> source

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
air conditioning which is a major source

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.400 
air conditioning which is a major source
of<00:00:48.260> consumption<00:00:49.190> in<00:00:49.520> results<00:00:50.150> and<00:00:50.330> we<00:00:51.140> have

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
of consumption in results and we have

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.049 
of consumption in results and we have
acquired<00:00:51.680> one<00:00:52.400> of<00:00:52.580> the<00:00:52.670> world's<00:00:53.030> most

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
acquired one of the world's most

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.200 
acquired one of the world's most
efficient<00:00:53.659> system<00:00:54.050> from<00:00:54.320> dike<00:00:54.559> in<00:00:54.830> our<00:00:55.580> air

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
efficient system from dike in our air

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.810 
efficient system from dike in our air
conditioning<00:00:56.900> are<00:00:57.050> really<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:58.460> rolls-royce

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
conditioning are really the rolls-royce

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.180 
conditioning are really the rolls-royce
of<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.390> energy<00:00:59.780> saving<00:01:02.409> the<00:01:03.409> worm<00:01:03.620> farm<00:01:03.979> was

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
of the energy saving the worm farm was

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.340 
of the energy saving the worm farm was
obviously<00:01:04.909> a<00:01:05.030> very<00:01:05.269> interesting<00:01:05.720> concept<00:01:06.229> i

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
obviously a very interesting concept i

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.320 
obviously a very interesting concept i
think<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.710> was<00:01:07.100> brought<00:01:07.400> them<00:01:07.670> from<00:01:07.970> south

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
think it was brought them from south

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.039 
think it was brought them from south
africa<00:01:08.360> at<00:01:09.020> that<00:01:09.650> time<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:10.880> we<00:01:11.479> found<00:01:11.780> we

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
africa at that time and and we found we

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.860 
africa at that time and and we found we
found<00:01:12.080> that<00:01:12.409> very<00:01:12.590> very<00:01:13.010> exciting<00:01:13.640> actually

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
found that very very exciting actually

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.510 
found that very very exciting actually
okay<00:01:14.870> so<00:01:14.930> we've<00:01:15.200> got<00:01:15.409> a<00:01:15.440> worm<00:01:15.830> farm<00:01:16.159> in<00:01:16.370> these

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
okay so we've got a worm farm in these

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.080 
okay so we've got a worm farm in these
bins<00:01:16.909> here<00:01:17.740> we<00:01:18.740> basically<00:01:19.220> recycle<00:01:19.970> our

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
bins here we basically recycle our

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.510 
bins here we basically recycle our
organic<00:01:20.479> waste<00:01:20.900> from<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.350> kitchens<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.010> be

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
organic waste from the kitchens and be

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.550 
organic waste from the kitchens and be
converted<00:01:22.850> into<00:01:23.210> a<00:01:23.360> useful<00:01:23.659> manual<00:01:24.320> for<00:01:24.500> the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
converted into a useful manual for the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.789 
converted into a useful manual for the
gardens<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:26.600> organic<00:01:27.229> waste<00:01:27.469> comes

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
gardens and the organic waste comes

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.830 
gardens and the organic waste comes
inside<00:01:28.189> here<00:01:28.460> on<00:01:28.610> a<00:01:28.640> daily<00:01:28.850> basis<00:01:29.420> there<00:01:29.719> are

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
inside here on a daily basis there are

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.069 
inside here on a daily basis there are
earthworms<00:01:30.350> inside<00:01:30.829> who<00:01:31.399> convert<00:01:31.820> this<00:01:32.270> waste

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
earthworms inside who convert this waste

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.469 
earthworms inside who convert this waste
into<00:01:33.619> manure<00:01:34.039> and<00:01:34.250> that<00:01:34.549> manner<00:01:34.759> is<00:01:35.090> used<00:01:35.329> to

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
into manure and that manner is used to

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.690 
into manure and that manner is used to
fertilize<00:01:35.659> our<00:01:36.140> plants<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.859> is<00:01:37.039> part<00:01:37.369> of<00:01:37.490> our

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
fertilize our plants it is part of our

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.940 
fertilize our plants it is part of our
local<00:01:38.149> Asif<00:01:38.479> II<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:38.719> going<00:01:38.990> green<00:01:39.170> but<00:01:39.770> apart

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
local Asif II of going green but apart

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.940 
local Asif II of going green but apart
from<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:40.250> it<00:01:40.579> is<00:01:40.700> also<00:01:40.909> very<00:01:41.810> cost<00:01:42.320> effective

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
from that it is also very cost effective

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.160 
from that it is also very cost effective
and<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:43.280> makes<00:01:43.490> sense<00:01:43.820> if<00:01:44.329> you<00:01:44.479> look<00:01:44.600> at<00:01:44.719> it<00:01:44.840> at

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
and it makes sense if you look at it at

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.529 
and it makes sense if you look at it at
a<00:01:45.229> hotel<00:01:45.560> operation<00:01:46.280> we<00:01:46.640> have<00:01:46.820> waste<00:01:47.119> in<00:01:47.420> the

a hotel operation we have waste in the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.810 
a hotel operation we have waste in the
kitchen<00:01:47.869> which<00:01:48.140> we<00:01:48.380> are<00:01:48.500> sending<00:01:49.130> out<00:01:49.399> through

kitchen which we are sending out through

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.029 
kitchen which we are sending out through
crux<00:01:50.149> of<00:01:50.299> garbage<00:01:50.719> if<00:01:50.960> we<00:01:51.200> can<00:01:51.320> recycle<00:01:51.679> that

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
crux of garbage if we can recycle that

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.520 
crux of garbage if we can recycle that
into<00:01:52.460> manure<00:01:52.850> we<00:01:53.509> take<00:01:53.719> care<00:01:53.899> of<00:01:53.960> getting<00:01:54.380> rid

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
into manure we take care of getting rid
