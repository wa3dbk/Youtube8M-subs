plate and this is 1 by 1 angle iron and
I<00:00:51.989> made<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> little<00:00:52.379> frame<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.489> see<00:00:53.550> how<00:00:53.789> it

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
I made a little frame you can see how it

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.180 
I made a little frame you can see how it
connects<00:00:54.270> there<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:56.340> fourth<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:57.390> dkw

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
connects there and the fourth in dkw

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.420 
connects there and the fourth in dkw
it's<00:00:59.190> kind<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.489> cool<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.920> called<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
it's kind of cool it is a called a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.509 
it's kind of cool it is a called a
floating<00:01:03.300> floor<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:04.170> means<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.159> body<00:01:05.309> can

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
floating floor which means the body can

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.200 
floating floor which means the body can
be<00:01:05.549> taken<00:01:05.850> off<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.000> frame<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.570> they<00:01:11.210> like

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
be taken off the frame and they like

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.620 
be taken off the frame and they like
this<00:01:12.650> that<00:01:13.650> go<00:01:13.799> between<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.760> frame<00:01:15.000> rails<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
this that go between the frame rails and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.710 
this that go between the frame rails and
the<00:01:16.380> floor<00:01:16.560> pan<00:01:16.740> came<00:01:17.189> from<00:01:17.340> rattling<00:01:17.640> now<00:01:18.450> my

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
the floor pan came from rattling now my

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.210 
the floor pan came from rattling now my
floor<00:01:18.960> plans<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> little<00:01:19.590> thicker<00:01:19.860> these

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
floor plans are a little thicker these

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.649 
floor plans are a little thicker these
are<00:01:20.900> 14<00:01:21.900> gauge<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.100> dkw<00:01:23.790> floor<00:01:24.360> pans

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
are 14 gauge and the dkw floor pans

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.219 
are 14 gauge and the dkw floor pans
stock<00:01:25.650> are<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.909> think<00:01:27.420> about<00:01:27.659> eighteen<00:01:28.049> gauge

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
stock are I think about eighteen gauge

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.140 
stock are I think about eighteen gauge
although<00:01:28.650> they<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.460> strengthening

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
although they do have the strengthening

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.590 
although they do have the strengthening
ribs<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.640> again<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:32.970> made<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> little<00:01:33.329> frame

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
ribs so again I just made a little frame

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.649 
ribs so again I just made a little frame
went<00:01:33.810> around<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:35.090> made<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.180> also<00:01:36.329> just

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
went around and made it also just

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.730 
went around and made it also just
basically<00:01:37.229> delays<00:01:37.560> flat<00:01:37.979> there<00:01:39.380> it's<00:01:40.380> pretty

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
basically delays flat there it's pretty

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.249 
basically delays flat there it's pretty
easy<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.130> do<00:01:41.460> let<00:01:42.420> me<00:01:42.450> show<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.720> how<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.930> went

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
easy to do let me show you how I went

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.580 
easy to do let me show you how I went
about<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:46.250> this<00:01:47.600> also<00:01:48.600> over<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.380> is

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
about that this also over here this is

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.210 
about that this also over here this is
the<00:01:49.710> metal<00:01:49.890> comes<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:51.140> remnants<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.229> 2<00:01:52.740> foot<00:01:53.009> by

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
the metal comes in remnants of 2 foot by

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.950 
the metal comes in remnants of 2 foot by
4<00:01:53.610> foot<00:01:53.640> sheets<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.540> buy<00:01:54.659> about<00:01:54.780> any

4 foot sheets you can buy about any
steel<00:01:55.200> yard<00:01:55.439> there's<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.159> steely-eyed<00:01:56.399> right

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
steel yard there's a steely-eyed right

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.859 
steel yard there's a steely-eyed right
up<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> street<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.149> think<00:01:57.299> they're<00:01:57.540> about<00:01:57.600> 10

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
up the street I think they're about 10

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.289 
up the street I think they're about 10
bucks<00:01:58.079> apiece<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.670> take<00:01:59.820> them<00:01:59.909> over<00:02:00.030> here

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
bucks apiece and you take them over here

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.510 
bucks apiece and you take them over here
to<00:02:00.329> your<00:02:00.869> cutting<00:02:01.229> table<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:01.710> your<00:02:02.310> salt

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
to your cutting table or your salt

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.969 
to your cutting table or your salt
horses<00:02:02.820> as<00:02:03.090> maybe<00:02:03.329> I've<00:02:03.899> outfitted<00:02:04.530> my<00:02:04.649> skill

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
horses as maybe I've outfitted my skill

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.300 
horses as maybe I've outfitted my skill
saw<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.610> metal<00:02:05.909> blade<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:07.710> was<00:02:08.280> a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
saw with a metal blade and that was a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.400 
saw with a metal blade and that was a
brand<00:02:08.580> new<00:02:08.670> blade<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> cut<00:02:09.360> through<00:02:09.629> three

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
brand new blade I cut through three

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.350 
brand new blade I cut through three
pieces<00:02:10.679> all<00:02:11.310> at<00:02:11.610> same<00:02:11.819> time

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
pieces all at same time

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.880 
pieces all at same time
so<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.810> works<00:02:13.959> pretty<00:02:14.140> hard<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:14.560> need<00:02:14.650> one<00:02:14.860> of

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
so it works pretty hard you need one of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.410 
so it works pretty hard you need one of
the<00:02:15.040> least<00:02:15.220> two<00:02:15.580> horsepower<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.180> be<00:02:16.270> able<00:02:16.330> to

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
the least two horsepower to be able to

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.300 
the least two horsepower to be able to
do<00:02:16.540> that

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
do that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.809 
do that
any<00:02:18.310> clamping<00:02:18.760> together<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:20.560> that's<00:02:21.430> how<00:02:21.760> you

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
any clamping together so that's how you

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.760 
any clamping together so that's how you
do<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.060> cutting<00:02:22.330> for<00:02:22.630> that<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:23.500> can<00:02:23.620> also

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
do the cutting for that and you can also

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.420 
do the cutting for that and you can also
cut<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.690> rails<00:02:25.900> or<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.530> angle<00:02:26.980> iron<00:02:27.069> the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
cut the the rails or the angle iron the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.340 
cut the the rails or the angle iron the
same<00:02:27.640> way<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.840> we're<00:02:28.990> making<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.230> little

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
same way so we're making a little

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.710 
same way so we're making a little
progress<00:02:29.530> I'm<00:02:30.489> not<00:02:30.880> sure<00:02:31.060> exactly<00:02:31.360> what

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
progress I'm not sure exactly what

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.110 
progress I'm not sure exactly what
progress<00:02:32.260> report<00:02:32.560> this<00:02:32.709> is<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:33.130> think<00:02:33.970> it's

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
progress report this is I think it's

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.260 
progress report this is I think it's
number<00:02:34.209> three<00:02:34.569> and<00:02:34.950> I'll<00:02:35.950> keep<00:02:36.340> posting<00:02:36.640> just

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
number three and I'll keep posting just

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.170 
number three and I'll keep posting just
to<00:02:37.420> let<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.630> know<00:02:37.660> how<00:02:37.900> it's<00:02:38.050> going<00:02:38.200> on<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:40.000> it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
to let you know how it's going on but it

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.870 
to let you know how it's going on but it
starting<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.420> look<00:02:40.480> pretty<00:02:40.720> good
