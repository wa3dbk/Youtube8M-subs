you don't know what that is all that is

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.340 
you don't know what that is all that is
is<00:02:00.799> okay<00:02:01.799> it's<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.009> little<00:02:02.340> ring<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:03.990> and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
is okay it's a little ring like this and

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.740 
is okay it's a little ring like this and
really<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.640> mean<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.180> does<00:02:06.329> kind<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.659> add

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
really I mean it does kind of add

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.350 
really I mean it does kind of add
support<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.310> more<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:09.209> my

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
support to it but it's more in my

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.770 
support to it but it's more in my
opinion<00:02:09.690> more<00:02:09.810> for<00:02:10.020> looks<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:11.720> have<00:02:12.720> a

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
opinion more for looks on a have a

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.800 
opinion more for looks on a have a
little<00:02:13.020> battery<00:02:13.319> like

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
little battery like

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.140 
little battery like
style<00:02:14.050> ego<00:02:14.800> stop<00:02:15.010> battery<00:02:15.280> like<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:15.430> it's

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
style ego stop battery like this it's

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.820 
style ego stop battery like this it's
gonna<00:02:16.270> go<00:02:16.390> ahead<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.660> screw<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.380> like<00:02:17.620> that

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
gonna go ahead and screw on like that

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.370 
gonna go ahead and screw on like that
and<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.069> kind<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.370> if<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.730> can<00:02:18.910> see<00:02:19.120> that

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
and it kind of if you can see that

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.900 
and it kind of if you can see that
hopefully<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.530> kind<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.770> goes<00:02:20.980> from<00:02:21.550> thin

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
hopefully it kind of goes from thin

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.339 
hopefully it kind of goes from thin
where<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.239> battery<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.599> and<00:02:22.900> makes<00:02:23.080> it'll

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
where the battery is and makes it'll

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.500 
where the battery is and makes it'll
like<00:02:23.620> slowly<00:02:24.069> transitions<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.880> wide<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.390> that

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
like slowly transitions to wide so that

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.059 
like slowly transitions to wide so that
the<00:02:25.630> tank<00:02:25.840> will<00:02:25.989> fit<00:02:26.140> really<00:02:26.349> nicely<00:02:26.620> on<00:02:26.770> top

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
the tank will fit really nicely on top

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.040 
the tank will fit really nicely on top
I<00:02:27.340> got<00:02:27.730> an<00:02:27.819> example<00:02:28.090> I'll<00:02:28.390> show<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.660> guys<00:02:28.810> so

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
I got an example I'll show you guys so

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.229 
I got an example I'll show you guys so
like<00:02:29.200> for<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:29.500> one<00:02:29.680> right<00:02:29.830> here<00:02:30.010> this<00:02:30.069> is<00:02:30.160> a

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
like for this one right here this is a

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.290 
like for this one right here this is a
bivy<00:02:31.239> Nova<00:02:32.069> as<00:02:33.069> you<00:02:33.220> can<00:02:33.340> see<00:02:33.580> oops<00:02:34.090> there<00:02:34.269> we

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
bivy Nova as you can see oops there we

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.839 
bivy Nova as you can see oops there we
go<00:02:34.480> it's<00:02:34.930> it's<00:02:35.260> really<00:02:35.800> really<00:02:36.670> nice<00:02:36.819> and

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
go it's it's really really nice and

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.250 
go it's it's really really nice and
flush<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.510> if<00:02:37.569> you<00:02:37.630> didn't<00:02:37.810> have<00:02:37.930> that<00:02:37.959> ring

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
flush and if you didn't have that ring

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.770 
flush and if you didn't have that ring
on<00:02:38.440> there<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.700> wouldn't<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.390> wouldn't<00:02:40.569> look

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
on there it it wouldn't it wouldn't look

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.540 
on there it it wouldn't it wouldn't look
as<00:02:40.930> great<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.349> also<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.769> guess<00:02:42.040> again<00:02:42.190> they<00:02:42.400> say

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
as great and also I guess again they say

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.820 
as great and also I guess again they say
it<00:02:42.670> supports<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.269> so<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.540> way<00:02:43.690> hopefully<00:02:44.590> it

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
it supports it so that way hopefully it

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.460 
it supports it so that way hopefully it
prevents<00:02:45.099> it<00:02:45.190> from<00:02:45.280> breaking<00:02:45.670> in<00:02:45.760> like<00:02:45.910> that

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
prevents it from breaking in like that

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.289 
prevents it from breaking in like that
but<00:02:47.470> anyways<00:02:47.709> this<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.430> made<00:02:48.610> out<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:48.880> I

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
but anyways this is made out of I

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.229 
but anyways this is made out of I

believe it's Pyrex glass let me see what

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.949 
believe it's Pyrex glass let me see what
we<00:02:52.360> said<00:02:52.600> about<00:02:52.750> this<00:02:54.630> doesn't<00:02:55.630> really<00:02:55.780> say

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
we said about this doesn't really say

made of Pyrex glass I gotta say that

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.400 
made of Pyrex glass I gotta say that
this<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.069> probably<00:03:00.640> one<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.060> two<00:03:01.569> this<00:03:01.660> date<00:03:01.930> if

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
this is probably one of two this date if

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.930 
this is probably one of two this date if
not<00:03:02.769> my<00:03:03.069> favorite<00:03:03.099> tank<00:03:03.849> ever<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:05.680> just<00:03:06.430> okay

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
it's a really good looking tank I think

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.110 
it's a really good looking tank I think

gonna run I did a little bit of
searching<00:05:03.460> online<00:05:03.610> it<00:05:04.000> looks<00:05:04.210> like<00:05:04.360> it's

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
searching online it looks like it's

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.050 
searching online it looks like it's
probably<00:05:04.780> gonna<00:05:05.050> cost<00:05:05.290> around<00:05:05.710> 30<00:05:05.950> bucks<00:05:06.220> but

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
probably gonna cost around 30 bucks but

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.610 
probably gonna cost around 30 bucks but
again<00:05:07.300> you<00:05:07.450> get<00:05:07.660> a<00:05:07.690> couple<00:05:07.900> replacements<00:05:08.500> with

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
again you get a couple replacements with

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.110 
again you get a couple replacements with

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.110 
it so it'll last you a good amount of
time<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:10.660> I<00:05:11.500> mean<00:05:12.220> in<00:05:12.340> my<00:05:12.460> opinion<00:05:12.580> you<00:05:12.970> can

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
time and I mean in my opinion you can

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.790 
time and I mean in my opinion you can
get<00:05:13.330> you<00:05:13.600> can<00:05:13.750> get<00:05:13.930> good<00:05:14.140> tanks<00:05:14.500> for<00:05:14.620> lower

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
get you can get good tanks for lower
