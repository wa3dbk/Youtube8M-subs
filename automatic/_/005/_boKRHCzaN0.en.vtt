00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Hello, welcome to the previous government. 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.339
 What are we going to do today? 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 classic but although classic has 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.450
 many people who still confuse this 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.099
 recipe for other things that are not the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.530
 What are they really not understanding? 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.839
 Nothing, I'll explain why today we 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.760
 Let's make our bechamel sauce or 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.000
 more commonly known as sauce 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.000
 White 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.689
 the guys we're going to do the classic 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.340
 white sauce with béchamel sauce only 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.230
 people often confuse this 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.520
 sauce when you say white sauce has 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.620
 people who think that getting a 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.390
 milk and put in the recipe 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.640
 cream and white is just hot 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.680
 he looks sexy and white sauce does not 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.940
 think that white sauce also has to 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.420
 take those who have to take other 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.890
 things not the traditional white sauce 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.350
 True classic is the béchamel sauce 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.239
 Look how wonderful we have here. 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.789
 a little bit of flour a little 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.719
 butter an onion a look at this 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.420
 ball looks like a pokémon face is humor 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.070
 the mohawk pokémon and here I got a 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.979
 I spit on her that he was the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.330
 flax and this mohawk hair here is a 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.640
 bay leaf 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.520
 you put it into the milk leaves 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.400
 Warm milk looks only she stays there 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.420
 in buoy dinho is a pokémon that buoy 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.080
 in there 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.310
 just to flavor it gives flavor to 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.040
 this milk that I 'm going to leave 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.750
 Warming up here is very simple fast 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.579
 It's practical and I'll light my pan. 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.049
 and béchamel sauce for letting 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.180
 warm up a little bit, I'll start 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.890
 make a course we'll see the car here 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.079
 if you watch our videos you 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.119
 already saw that word appearing here orro 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.590
 is a blend of wheat flour with 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.150
 butter usually in the same 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.880
 amounts a little more flour 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.979
 wheat for you to thicken the broth 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.869
 to thicken preparations thicken any 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.380
 liquid thing you want it to stay 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.450
 the denser the creamier you 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.130
 make a mixture of this we'll start 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.060
 then melting the butter to melt the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.070
 butter 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.600
 you come in with the non-wheat flour 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.729
 I need to learn to do not need to do 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.500
 nothing and now you're going to 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.170
 mix these two elements if you go 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.490
 stir vigorously so that you do not 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.900
 no one had wheat flour 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.510
 remaining unmixed with butter 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.840
 so you'll let her cook 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.660
 for her to start acquiring not only flavor 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.270
 but also acquire ownership of 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.190
 thicken the broth to mozzarella as 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.960
 that I know you cooked the flour you 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.100
 will notice a change in texture 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.350
 of this mixture 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.320
 You'll notice a color a little bit. 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.980
 yellow and you will also notice that 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.790
 The smell of it changed is the smell of 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.560
 raw flour is a very scent 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.900
 characteristic smell of bakery and you 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.790
 go and you will notice that the smell goes 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.420
 change a little bit will move to the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.490
 smell of thing cooked here sticks to 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.770
 almost dropping milk or almost milk 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.950
 falling there ha 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.560
 Dude, I'm very ninja in this kitchen. 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.540
 I suffered so much the fish looking at the cat 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.570
 You do not have this with me, nothing happens. 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.450
 now it is coming to the temperature in the 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.480
 crown as he looks younger in the 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.790
 color and texture that I want then already 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.040
 I'll bring the milk 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.090
 now the intake of milk to not 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.400
 to embark 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.860
 I have a particular technique that is 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:34.070
 the next I like to play a 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:34.070
 and mixing by dissolving and 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:42.060
 all the patience caring and love of the world 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.770
 chef 's 500 chef vignette sticker 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.330
 mozzarella was playing the business do not know the 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.740
 What happened was the right temperature. 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.720
 wrong temperature I do not know what 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.130
 happened I ended up in a platoon in my 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.560
 business I'm going to have to throw away 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.310
 all over again it's not just you to go through 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.930
 a sieve 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.730
 If you're going to make a lasagna if you 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.160
 will make the pasta if you will do 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.380
 a sandwich you will use the sauce 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.270
 white to something they still have 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.280
 some kind of cooking some kind of 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.660
 cooking from a little more 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.280
 liquid that when it enters this 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.070
 next cooking depending on the time 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.440
 What are you going to be, will it fall? 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.020
 But still he tries to reach the 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.030
 end point you want here in the pan 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.920
 think about what you still have to cook 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.920
 a little bit of nutmeg 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.620
 a little pepper 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.780
 You boot if you want, only if you want. 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.490
 seasoning with salt can only be with salt 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:44.220
 You also have no problem with looks. 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:47.520
 only the texture of it here gives them their 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.380
 beauty, I said their delight 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.630
 It's wonderful that you can use that 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.340
 sauce for the various utilities if 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.919
 You will use a pasta if you 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.360
 to use a lasagna 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.100
 leaves a little more liquid than 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.000
 All in all, leaving that tone 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.790
 in this texture right, because I go 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.620
 use it for a great recipe 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.540
