00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
is to ride the unicycle you have to lean

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.689 
is to ride the unicycle you have to lean
forward<00:00:59.059> like<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.559> right<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.489> got<00:01:02.579> to

forward like that right there you're
leaning<00:01:07.049> forward<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.920> look

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
leaning forward do look

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.169 
leaning forward do look
if<00:01:09.329> you<00:01:10.079> just<00:01:10.259> you<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.649> lead<00:01:10.920> forward<00:01:11.310> well

you just fall forward but we have to do
is<00:01:15.179> lean<00:01:15.450> forward<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.200> push<00:01:16.409> backwards

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
is lean forward and then push backwards

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.140 
is lean forward and then push backwards
and<00:01:17.310> it'll<00:01:17.850> push<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.980 

okay<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:24.860> another<00:01:25.670> thing<00:01:25.820> is<00:01:26.180> with<00:01:26.540> the

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
okay so another thing is with the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.970 
okay so another thing is with the
unicycle<00:01:27.470> it<00:01:28.660> has<00:01:29.660> an<00:01:29.930> alternate<00:01:30.800> break

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
unicycle it has an alternate break

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.340 
unicycle it has an alternate break
besides<00:01:31.880> slowing<00:01:32.300> down<00:01:32.510> by<00:01:32.750> like<00:01:33.020> going<00:01:33.290> like

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
besides slowing down by like going like

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.260 
besides slowing down by like going like
that<00:01:33.440> what<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:34.490> can<00:01:34.640> do<00:01:34.760> is<00:01:34.880> like<00:01:35.030> when<00:01:35.150> you're

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
that what you can do is like when you're

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.870 
that what you can do is like when you're
going<00:01:35.450> really<00:01:35.600> fast<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.920> can<00:01:37.100> go<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.520> hit<00:01:37.760> the

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
going really fast you can go and hit the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.320 
going really fast you can go and hit the
down<00:01:38.120> button<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.780> you'll<00:01:38.960> stop<00:01:40.060> now<00:01:41.060> what<00:01:41.240> I'm

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
down button and you'll stop now what I'm

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.970 
down button and you'll stop now what I'm
going<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.510> do<00:01:41.600> now<00:01:41.780> show<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.230> an<00:01:42.380> example<00:01:42.530> and

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
going to do now show you an example and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.200 
going to do now show you an example and
the<00:01:43.310> example<00:01:44.290> on<00:01:45.290> why<00:01:45.560> that's<00:01:45.800> useful<00:01:46.210> the

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
the example on why that's useful the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.320 
the example on why that's useful the
down<00:01:47.390> button<00:01:48.280> I'm<00:01:49.280> going<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:49.520> erase<00:01:49.790> this<00:01:49.820> and

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
I'm just going to make a little drop off

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.920 
I'm just going to make a little drop off
like<00:01:53.240> that

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.510 

now<00:02:00.470> when<00:02:00.620> you<00:02:00.710> have<00:02:00.830> drop-offs<00:02:01.310> like<00:02:02.120> this

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.279 

you<00:02:04.939> have<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.180> control<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:05.960> have<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.170> give

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
you have to control it you have to give

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.380 
you have to control it you have to give
all<00:02:06.439> your<00:02:06.530> breaking<00:02:06.710> like

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.410 

like<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.819> really<00:02:13.090> just<00:02:13.240> have<00:02:13.360> to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
like that and you really just have to

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.390 
like that and you really just have to
get<00:02:13.569> a<00:02:13.630> lot<00:02:13.810> of<00:02:13.840> control<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.069> takes<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.310> lot

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
get a lot of control and it takes a lot

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.290 
get a lot of control and it takes a lot
of<00:02:15.430> practice<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:17.160> mean<00:02:18.160> even<00:02:18.400> me<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.880> I've<00:02:19.180> been

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
of practice I mean even me and I've been

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.699 
of practice I mean even me and I've been
doing<00:02:19.510> this<00:02:19.540> for<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> while<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.959> mean<00:02:20.260> every<00:02:20.410> once

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
doing this for a while I mean every once

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.680 
doing this for a while I mean every once
in<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> while<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.010> still<00:02:21.250> mess<00:02:21.400> up<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.700> stuff<00:02:21.880> but

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
in a while I still mess up and stuff but

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.340 
in a while I still mess up and stuff but
you<00:02:23.350> know<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.850> gets<00:02:25.150> pretty<00:02:25.750> much<00:02:25.990> works<00:02:26.170> out

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
you know it gets pretty much works out

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.210 
you know it gets pretty much works out
like<00:02:26.440> that

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220
