of the sudden and it totally makes sense

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.770 
of the sudden and it totally makes sense
because<00:04:36.160> remember<00:04:36.580> your<00:04:36.910> foots<00:04:37.180> much<00:04:37.390> wider

because remember your foots much wider

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.320 
because remember your foots much wider
when<00:04:38.380> you<00:04:38.530> include<00:04:38.920> your<00:04:39.070> heel<00:04:39.370> than<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.180> was

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
when you include your heel than it was

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.880 
when you include your heel than it was
at<00:04:40.480> your<00:04:40.570> leg<00:04:40.810> or<00:04:40.990> your<00:04:41.110> foot<00:04:41.380> so<00:04:41.590> this<00:04:41.680> all

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
at your leg or your foot so this all

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:42.920 
at your leg or your foot so this all
makes<00:04:42.160> sense

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
makes sense

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.980 
makes sense
but<00:04:43.930> now<00:04:44.710> what<00:04:45.010> you've<00:04:45.160> got<00:04:45.460> is<00:04:45.930> instead<00:04:46.930> of

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
this circle you've got this circle

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.650

flap you're going to work a decrease and

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.250 
flap you're going to work a decrease and
that<00:05:42.130> is<00:05:42.640> what's<00:05:43.090> gonna<00:05:43.240> cause<00:05:43.570> in<00:05:43.930> a<00:05:44.050> year

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
that is what's gonna cause in a year

that is what's gonna cause in a year
you've<00:05:44.500> used<00:05:44.740> to<00:05:44.919> seeing<00:05:45.130> this<00:05:45.250> on<00:05:45.400> any<00:05:45.640> sock

you've used to seeing this on any sock
this<00:05:46.810> little<00:05:47.140> bit<00:05:47.440> of<00:05:47.680> triangulation<00:05:48.669> which

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
this little bit of triangulation which

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.800 
this little bit of triangulation which
is<00:05:49.780> essentially<00:05:50.440> getting<00:05:51.160> rid<00:05:51.610> of<00:05:51.810> stitches

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
is essentially getting rid of stitches

okay so you're basically losing these

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.430 
okay so you're basically losing these
stitches<00:05:56.890> until<00:05:57.460> you're<00:05:57.580> finally<00:05:57.940> back<00:05:58.440> to

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
the original if you think about this is

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.430 
the original if you think about this is
a<00:06:02.230> dart<00:06:03.540> what<00:06:04.540> you're<00:06:04.720> doing<00:06:05.080> is<00:06:05.169> you're<00:06:05.290> kind

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
a dart what you're doing is you're kind

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.460 
a dart what you're doing is you're kind
of<00:06:06.030> working<00:06:07.030> those<00:06:07.240> stitches<00:06:07.540> away<00:06:07.990> until

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
of working those stitches away until

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.170 
of working those stitches away until
you're<00:06:08.590> finally<00:06:08.950> back<00:06:09.190> to<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:09.580> original<00:06:10.060> that

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
instep see how that's working these are

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.560 
instep see how that's working these are
just<00:06:18.040> extra<00:06:18.520> stitches<00:06:18.940> you<00:06:19.060> have<00:06:19.090> to<00:06:19.390> work

if you're one of those people who after
you've<00:06:27.370> done<00:06:27.490> this<00:06:27.669> joint<00:06:27.970> and<00:06:28.150> you<00:06:28.270> start<00:06:28.570> to

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
you've done this joint and you start to

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.420 
you've done this joint and you start to
do<00:06:28.780> the<00:06:28.990> decreasing<00:06:29.560> but<00:06:29.710> you<00:06:29.830> kind<00:06:30.100> of<00:06:30.160> end<00:06:30.340> up

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
do the decreasing but you kind of end up

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.480 
do the decreasing but you kind of end up
with<00:06:30.610> this<00:06:30.720> baggy<00:06:31.720> part<00:06:32.410> above<00:06:33.010> your<00:06:33.160> ankle

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
with this baggy part above your ankle

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.430 
with this baggy part above your ankle
this<00:06:34.210> is<00:06:34.390> something<00:06:34.660> I<00:06:34.750> learned<00:06:34.870> from<00:06:35.020> Tina

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
this is something I learned from Tina

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.580 
this is something I learned from Tina
and<00:06:35.740> I<00:06:35.800> love<00:06:36.160> it<00:06:36.340> she<00:06:37.210> actually<00:06:37.510> works<00:06:38.229> her

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
and I love it she actually works her

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.650 
and I love it she actually works her
decreases<00:06:39.340> every<00:06:39.570> single

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
decreases every single

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.830 
decreases every single
for<00:06:41.320> three<00:06:41.650> rounds<00:06:41.970> at<00:06:42.970> the<00:06:43.150> very<00:06:43.330> beginning

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
for three rounds at the very beginning

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.080 
for three rounds at the very beginning
then<00:06:44.590> she<00:06:44.860> starts<00:06:45.190> doing<00:06:45.460> the<00:06:45.550> decreases

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
then she starts doing the decreases

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.520 
then she starts doing the decreases
every<00:06:46.270> other<00:06:46.660> and<00:06:46.930> that's<00:06:47.020> just<00:06:47.230> a<00:06:47.320> more

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
every other and that's just a more

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.850 
every other and that's just a more
abrupt<00:06:48.090> crunch<00:06:49.090> right<00:06:49.390> there<00:06:49.660> and<00:06:49.900> lets<00:06:50.680> that

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
abrupt crunch right there and lets that

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.470 
abrupt crunch right there and lets that
be<00:06:51.010> a<00:06:51.040> little<00:06:51.280> tighter<00:06:51.520> around<00:06:51.970> your<00:06:52.120> ankle

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
be a little tighter around your ankle

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.200 
be a little tighter around your ankle
okay<00:06:53.260> now<00:06:53.770> I<00:06:53.800> think<00:06:53.980> you<00:06:54.310> understand<00:06:54.970> the

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
okay now I think you understand the

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.750 
okay now I think you understand the
structure<00:06:55.960> of<00:06:55.990> what<00:06:56.770> we're<00:06:56.950> doing<00:06:57.070> it'll<00:06:57.610> make

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:57.760 
structure of what we're doing it'll make

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.690 
structure of what we're doing it'll make
a<00:06:57.790> lot<00:06:57.970> more<00:06:58.150> sense<00:06:58.210> and<00:06:58.780> I<00:06:59.590> can<00:07:00.040> show<00:07:00.400> you<00:07:00.460> how

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:00.700 
a lot more sense and I can show you how

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.000
