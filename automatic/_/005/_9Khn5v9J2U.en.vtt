00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.620
 the opposite sex 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.380
 that is to say 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.360

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.640
 completely this guy has a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.920
 destruction of reality without dreaming 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.450

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.219
 they want 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.610

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.310
 narcissism 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.480
 all the emergency for your team like 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.400
 in my house 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.400
 although the pains all 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.170
 [Music] 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.980
 a handsome man 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.460
 universe and of course it has to do 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.490
 with his physical appearance and he does not reach 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:28.330
 understand when finally a drawing 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:31.250
 for children children and adults 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.959
 we have mental disorder and that is that some 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.920
 maybe he did not hesitate as director 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:41.500
 who is there charlie carlitos for the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:45.469
 most attention 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.840
 with that look with that head I feel that 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:50.829
 is the group leader has always is 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.019
 as fitur is not completely 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.719
 meditabundo in a melancholy and not 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.420
 pursue design even bad luck 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.790
 that seems to rhyme perfectly with that 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.129
 mood that more than avis equal 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.819
 appeased seems to live in an eternal 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.819
 endogenous depression 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.540
 the experts said maybe this child 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.420
 what happened to her specifically that day 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.370
 but it has is going through a 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.349
 constant mental disorder and by which 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.420
 should be treated what the 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.450
 doctor we told him that he suffers' charlie 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.450
 brown ' 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.359
 invasive personality disorder 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.269
 'Charlie Brown' the leader of the Pines 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.010
 has a dark way of looking at life 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.560
 cause of the evasive disorder of the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.519
 personality this condition 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.109
 it produces low self-esteem 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.200
 existentialism and an altered relationship 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.770
 with its surroundings 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.980
 xxi 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.350
 a questioning constancy of the area 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.959
 but it is not exaggerated but if we are 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.480
 talking in an elevated way 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.380
 because this is for very children it will be clear 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.810
 but 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.060
 and review some of his chapters that chan 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.650
 it asks you ask the following 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.650
 put him play and his base or the director 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.000
 i 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.210
 today 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.460
 [Music] 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.460
 not only that attention 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.250
 [Music] 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:34.700
 but but finally surrenders to the 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:37.860
 circumstances because you do not notice it 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.860
 [Music] 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.599
 as then 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.479
 he has achieved a reflection 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:59.550
 deep introspective many to get 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.209
 to erroneous conclusions of course 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.610
 because it is a mental disorder 

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:07.979
 it's nothing, that's why you have these 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.050
 mental disorders and books and attention 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.180

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.159

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.740

 [Music] 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:25.649
 of drugs or alcohol or any artifice 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:28.759
 because he lives constantly in a state 

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:28.759
 of euphoria 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.440
