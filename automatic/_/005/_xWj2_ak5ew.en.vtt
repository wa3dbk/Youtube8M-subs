the<00:01:34.160> clamps<00:01:34.490> on<00:01:34.610> all<00:01:34.700> of<00:01:34.790> you

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
the clamps on all of you

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.720 
the clamps on all of you
I<00:01:35.720> thought<00:01:36.440> you'd<00:01:36.590> only<00:01:36.740> get<00:01:36.830> your<00:01:36.980> fingers<00:01:37.250> on

I thought you'd only get your fingers on
that<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.240> back<00:01:38.870> when<00:01:38.990> it's<00:01:39.140> not<00:01:39.290> over<00:01:39.680> they

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
that so back when it's not over they

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:57.399

we need to rotate the indexing head

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.009 
we need to rotate the indexing head
through<00:02:41.540> 90<00:02:42.170> degrees<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:43.250> then<00:02:43.489> for<00:02:44.019> another
