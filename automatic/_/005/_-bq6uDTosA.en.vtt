look<00:01:12.960> at<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> ingredients<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:14.009> you<00:01:14.820> have

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
look at the ingredients there you have

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.810 
look at the ingredients there you have
egg<00:01:16.039> natural<00:01:17.039> vanilla<00:01:17.190> flavor

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820

bee<00:01:18.179> pollen<00:01:19.340> papain<00:01:20.340> bro<00:01:20.970> million<00:01:21.420> which<00:01:21.660> both

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
bee pollen papain bro million which both

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.749 
bee pollen papain bro million which both
of<00:01:22.050> those<00:01:22.289> I<00:01:22.349> guess<00:01:22.560> help<00:01:23.039> aid<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.399> digestion

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
of those I guess help aid in digestion

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.940 
of those I guess help aid in digestion
and<00:01:24.060> then<00:01:24.149> stevia<00:01:24.599> to<00:01:24.780> help<00:01:24.929> sweeten<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.380> but

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and then stevia to help sweeten it but

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.910 
and then stevia to help sweeten it but
um<00:01:26.690> this<00:01:27.690> protein<00:01:28.200> right<00:01:28.410> here<00:01:28.590> I'll<00:01:28.709> put<00:01:28.890> a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
um this protein right here I'll put a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.490 
um this protein right here I'll put a
link<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.399> description<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:30.149> of<00:01:30.959> this<00:01:31.170> video
