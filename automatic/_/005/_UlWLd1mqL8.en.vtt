00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 and hello everyone gets upset country and 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.330
 we are on gta 5 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.599
 yes for a really small little challenge 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.450
 challenge is to bring down the world chili had 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.849
 by bike but be careful is go down 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.250
 also do a backflip attempt a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.180
 backflip of death that kills one but 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.500
 if we can do a second low this 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.480
 would be great we'll already try a 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.779
 backflip because it's already risky 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.710
 I think we're going to die but hey we're going 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.490
 still try as you 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.470
 can see it on this sign 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.470
 forbidden vehicles that's why we 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.239
 go there by car so you have to go 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.370
 to return to the rendezvous point 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.340
 extreme practitioners a mountain bike bike 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.680
 the twisted stuff and shit smokers so 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.410
 this is another way to 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.579
 to arrive but that's the most fun 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.649
 I could have had tea 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.329
 devices down and then then 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.730
 take a motocross that's all in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.930
 high but honestly I prefer the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.600
 cycling 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.730
 it will be more fun than going with 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.430
 a vehicle that goes super fast and that is 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.840
 very simple so already we will go to 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.010
 meeting point but before that I 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.400
 will show you very quickly the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.570
 map 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.820
 so we are here and we have to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.439
 make the high and the peripherals that 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.790
 is up and we will do the descent 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.920
 which is here 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.150
 so the goal will be to arrive down I 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.740
 do not know what's down I 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.990
 I stopped in the middle so we'll see 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.630
 well together so the meeting point 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.619
 you is pretty much here because we're going 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.490
 still follow the path that is 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.659
 indicated on the map 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.360
 that is, it's a path 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.020
 practicable ah that's from a customer does not arrive 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.560
 Here we reach the expected path for 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.560
 the vehicles 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.520
 ben shit there are no my friends they 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.640
 are not there my friends but where is this 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.320
 they are it's a mess and here I have 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.829
 blocked the car and it's great 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.720
 good friends we will try to find at 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.509
 ba voila he is hurry basically that's him 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.860
 tell me I can take your bike 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:03.270
 thank you so let's go we go it's from 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.960
 the other side already so if I plant myself 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.200
 it's not going to do it 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.550
 here we go so the climb she 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.820
 start here so let's go quietly 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:18.040
 everything and everything and everything I like the air 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.290
 I like to breathe air it's good for 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.400
 lungs 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.810
 yes that's what's also good is 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.850
 that it's eco-friendly says alan bike and 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.910
 yes we do not pollute nature 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.980
 and then we can see the trees see 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.830
 that everything is green that the sun is going 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.490
 soon to lie down here it is written 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.630
 monchy cad 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.490
 because that's where it starts 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.440
 really that's where we feel the real ones 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.480
 warriors who have them in the bump 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.570
 and yes and those wearing a cap 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.550
 upside down because it's too swag 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.010
 franklin and swag yes i admit is not 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.110
 in sportswear but it's the most 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.250
 enduring of my characters because we can 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.870
 increase endurance and oil 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.060
 endurance pretty important bike because 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.370
 I do not pull the trigger 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.650
 pedal no no I press will be as if 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.270
 I was running and when we 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.730
 short too much or when you pedal too much and 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.160
 well we lose health and that's it 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.770
 wrong with the fuck it hurts because we can 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.570
 to die a physical activity too 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.280
 intense and 8 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.650
 cycling is risky it's a job 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.120
 dangerous I do not recommend it if 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.560
 you are small is fragile but there 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.820
 it's good we're still in the green 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.190
 that we could see I could feel it at 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.540
 up so we can go quiet 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.040
 or but be careful though there are some 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.560
 animals on the way animals 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.190
 well hebeisen shows us the buttocks so 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.959
 we stop and we go camping 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.820
 but otherwise we can crush them a jump 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.810
 like humans by the way sometimes 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.880
 there are people wandering around 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.050
 quietly and that block the 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.950
 passage of the kind you will not pass 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.410
 do all you need to do is 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.530
 to roll it on and we piss them off 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.330
 voili voilou so we're almost there 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.180
 is coming soon to peripheral TV 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.680
 I would even say it's a refuge 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.360
 could have made a safe haven been more 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.910
 nice to see people in 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.010
 train to eat raclette or I do not 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.140
 know what else I love 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.150
 walk and I love to hike a 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.800
 montaigne even though she does not have too much in 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.780
 the moselle 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.370
 that's what c 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.069
 it's all good to go to 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.079
 alps for example so here we are 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.810
 almost 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.970
 oh there is a little catch or something 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.669
 a fox or at least a critter 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.480
 hairy with mustaches and who has 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:30.240
 swollen but we fight the steak and 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.950
 here we see the chalet then 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.870
 be careful though because there is 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.910
 suicide places there are places 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.490
 who are finally you see a little 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.780
 gateway its agents a barrier 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.620
 prohibition to borrow it at the same time 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.880
 time there nothing at all I mean 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.680
 what are you borrowing from fingerprints 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.480
 the air kills jump parachute what 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.610
 by the way I had crossed 3 me in 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.560
 parachute and she looks at the horizon 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.410
 then I put myself next to her and there 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.550
 i showed them my way saw my i want 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.660
 to say my cap 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.490
 they saw that the cap was at 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.050
 backwards and then at home they do not run away 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.450
 ran in every direction of the shot 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.220
 I could not see if they jumped so 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.740
 that's it, we're there, we're there 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.390
 the tram that is right behind and there 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.740
 it's written danger because we can 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.090
 to commit suicide here if you're tired of life 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.889
 but there we do not care we go there by bike 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.720
 so let's go down here 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.090
 friends it's gone this challenge is launched 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.080
 so the goal is to get down 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.729
 of this descent of course invites but 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.550
 of course you have to try a back 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.100
 flip and that's colossal 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.810
 and yes especially with my mediocre level 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.539
 we will mature 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.979
 I feel we will mature friends and then 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.620
 it's going to be a franklin we're 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.729
 squashed but we will try anyway 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.229
 so are we going left or right 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.300
 right on the way because there is a 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:42.840
 crossing we'll go left 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.979
 yes we go left but here we go already 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.780
 try to find a bump because 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.640
 or shit where I'm already going to get nothing 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.430
 it's good to receive you it was 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.740
 beautiful 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.270
 I started crying but no it's 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.980
 very well and here we go super fast 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.680
 so here if I can not make a 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.540
 backflip as I met a guy there 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.730
 just before noon there is a fucking 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.010
 bosc and point to the sky we can 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.780
 to do it we can do it we will 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.740
 show us our bike 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.970
 super is the version 2097 and it's 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.300
 left a baccalaureate pro 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.320
 yes to a backflip yes-yes or the second 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.410
 no will not no 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.730
 it will not go as far as you fight there 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.300
 we are dead here it is the end of 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.560
 beans 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.700
 and this challenge and once raymond has everything from 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.680
 even managed to do a bac philo he 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.450
 was beautiful to he was beautiful 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.230
 we will arrive at the bottom of the 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:34.210
 mountain but we are dead because there 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.770
 had a rock so it's an accident 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.170
 of the road it happens sometimes and that's it 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.410
 franklin he died to me while doing 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:44.220
 his favorite sport the bike was a 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:47.590
 passion for him a real passion 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.590
 and so we will stop there do not cry 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.190
 not franklin because well because he 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.020
 just resurrected 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.820
 but it's amazing to the magnificent 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.610
