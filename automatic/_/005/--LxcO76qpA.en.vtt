they<00:01:29.070> would<00:01:29.250> blame<00:01:29.490> her<00:01:29.939> for<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.170> I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
they would blame her for this and I

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.520 
they would blame her for this and I
thought<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.520> was<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.030> incredibly<00:01:33.930> wise<00:01:34.229> with

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.300 
thought that was so incredibly wise with
her<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.460> realize<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.590> they<00:01:37.590> had<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.799> discover

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
her to realize that they had to discover

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.700 
her to realize that they had to discover
things<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:38.729> themselves<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
things for themselves and I think the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.620 
things for themselves and I think the
same<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:40.979> true<00:01:41.220> whether<00:01:41.790> you're<00:01:42.030> talking<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
same is true whether you're talking a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.300 
same is true whether you're talking a
spouse<00:01:42.990> or<00:01:43.579> adult<00:01:44.579> children<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:46.070> they<00:01:47.070> will

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
spouse or adult children that they will

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.270 
spouse or adult children that they will
hold<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.700> responsible<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.770> were<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> one

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
hold you responsible if you were the one

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.840 
hold you responsible if you were the one
who<00:01:50.810> tries<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.840> control<00:01:52.290> their<00:01:52.560> behavior

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
who tries to control their behavior

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.130 
who tries to control their behavior
versus<00:01:53.850> letting<00:01:54.180> them<00:01:54.390> come<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.960> their<00:01:55.110> own

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
versus letting them come to their own

versus letting them come to their own
