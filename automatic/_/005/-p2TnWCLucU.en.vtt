00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
it's really restricted by the paper I

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.290 
it's really restricted by the paper I
can<00:03:24.150> turn<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.510> bit<00:03:25.900> at<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.560> arm<00:03:27.120> but<00:03:28.120> it's

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
can turn a bit at the arm but it's

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.650 
can turn a bit at the arm but it's
hindered<00:03:29.110> by<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.320> hood<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.760> that's<00:03:34.330> pretty

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
hindered by the hood and that's pretty

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.070 
hindered by the hood and that's pretty
much<00:03:34.810> it

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.780
