00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.819
 hello everybody, all right, water, my rivals, once I heard you guys say 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.920
 I realized we're going to talk about josefa clear nozzles is known as jk 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.249
 Yes, a few are very popular. 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.829
 are the nipples we most sell silver with red plate both very much 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.449
 patromônio lowered trumpet 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.300
 but overall - too much for a French horn 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.560
 and our goal here is also explaining to you 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.350
 The difference is that the line falls to me on me. 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.390
 sometimes you see you can count on the difference 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.530
 for example single mouth 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.780
 it's a bad differential 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.120
 So we'll fold it for you guys. 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.390
 but attack 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.520
 is a German company 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.390
 are very famous for their vocal protection so they have two 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.540
 lines are the line k 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.190
 and letter m 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.260
 what are the diferences 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.900
 benavente it is very important to know that the differences between these lines are 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.770
 rowing in the body 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.770
 the shape of the body and the edge 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.920
 the hymen line 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.840
 that the baseline that you are seeing 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.380
 it is a line that has the copom with a little more rounded but at the same 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.160
 what time is it in jakarta 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.360
 p if we are to think the scene in u 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.240
 hehehehe because it provides a cumbuca round line he will provide 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.280
 you are a brighter sound 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.710
 and the team is more clear. 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.800
 while the line k 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.970
 the nozzles line k 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.670
 they already have a glass shaped mushroom shaped harry so in v 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.280
 it's a bit lighter and rounder too 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.960
 and that it will provide proportional with a darker timbre, not that one 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 classic time 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.870
 and also addressed the vocals of the k line are more rounded boots of the well 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.859
 very important to understand also wants to attack works 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:12.889
 with five fingers and standard nozzles 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:17.069
 that you can come there nothing not nothing these columns that are marked 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:19.869
 01 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.069
 2 3 and 4 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.659
 both the k line tells someone I can observe that the tables are identical 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.399
 what changes is just the letter k 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:29.879
 so you have to think like that 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.229
 preserving is a mouthpiece that has 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:33.469
 eighteen and a half 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.469
 millimeters in diameter and earth this very important measure 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.110
 turn off a TV 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.809
 two mouthpiece have 17 half the mouthpiece 3 17 which little 4 16 min 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.909
 then 01 is the mouth the wide mainz of jk 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.479
 and 4 cocal plus three 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:56.179
 It is with regret, yes, it occupied the best vocals of the jk. 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:58.679
 from another intern 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.009
 is another important piece of information I always like to say about 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.189
 body is good 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.469
 jk is one of the companies that have greater flexibility in the body 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.889
 you have been thinking so arf air here in the case of the nozzle the area is very deep 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.119
 upf 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:16.109
 that is very easy 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.149
 the mouthpiece were they were 1 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:19.590
 one two or three 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.110
 My sister is the man. 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.689
 if he goes 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.459
 It's because it's too deep. 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.829
 and jk also provides information and that is the size of the hole 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.859
 the nozzle for example two acar 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.090
 it is rather that they are 17mm and a half inner diameter 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:37.819
 the coconut air that in the body 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.149
 a lot of smoke 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:42.359
 and the wrath that we love will also be among 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.359
 has 4 millimeters and behead 8 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:51.809
 and as you advance letter drink a glass bottom letter c middle-bottom letter t 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:53.480
 medium 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.480
 and it goes into elevation it is very rare black 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.129
 and to finish personal 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.890
 in case you want for example I want a mouth the medium déco with the comedy 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.709
 So we know that the lyrics 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.769
 I want a little 18mm has to be the mouthpiece 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:14.969
 there you will lie down or by the cable line by the line and remembering the 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.099
 differences that were already said at the beginning of the video 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:23.729
 but for example you which is a greater hole of the sertão noocal 2 dk for example 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.169
 only that with a hole of 4 and 6 of the country eito 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:28.670
 finally it was no different 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.949

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.539
 doubt cast
