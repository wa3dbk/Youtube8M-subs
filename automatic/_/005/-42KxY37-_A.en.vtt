00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.240 
all the buildable z' and all the part
locations<00:00:06.450> for<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.109> buildable<00:00:07.410> z'<00:00:07.560> here<00:00:08.099> on

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
locations for the buildable z' here on

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.860 
locations for the buildable z' here on
the<00:00:08.340> map<00:00:08.519> barry<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:09.210> i<00:00:09.240> should<00:00:09.510> mention<00:00:09.660> that

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
the map barry so i should mention that

the map barry so i should mention that
all<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.889> parts<00:00:11.250> are<00:00:11.400> located<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.450> bank

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
all of the parts are located in the bank

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.140 
all of the parts are located in the bank
all<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.349> parts<00:00:13.650> for<00:00:13.860> for<00:00:14.219> buildable<00:00:14.700> z'<00:00:14.849> are

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
all the parts for for buildable z' are

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.180 
all the parts for for buildable z' are
located<00:00:15.719> here<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.080> bank<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.920> first

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
bill that i'm going to be crafting here

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.090 
bill that i'm going to be crafting here
is<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.199> tramplesteam

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
is the tramplesteam

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.250 
is the tramplesteam
and<00:00:20.279> here<00:00:20.820> are<00:00:20.939> all<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.119> parts<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.750> screen

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
and here are all the parts on screen

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.929 
and here are all the parts on screen
they're<00:00:22.410> always<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.189> same<00:00:23.400> place<00:00:23.640> so

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
they're always in the same place so

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:24.830 
they're always in the same place so

there<00:00:25.170> are<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> couple<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.740> parts<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.220> this

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
there are a couple of parts in this

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.980 
there are a couple of parts in this
video<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.820> are<00:00:27.029> shuffled<00:00:27.420> around<00:00:27.480> because<00:00:27.900> i

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
video that are shuffled around because i

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.560 
video that are shuffled around because i
was<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.949> know<00:00:29.039> getting<00:00:29.189> them<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.029> changing

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
was you know getting them and changing

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.030 
was you know getting them and changing
them<00:00:30.689> for<00:00:30.840> their<00:00:30.960> part<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.260> they<00:00:31.470> are<00:00:31.710> kind<00:00:31.949> of

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
them for their part so they are kind of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.979 
them for their part so they are kind of
shuffled<00:00:32.430> around<00:00:32.520> but<00:00:33.300> once<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.840> know<00:00:33.899> what

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
shuffled around but once you know what

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.240 
shuffled around but once you know what
they<00:00:34.050> looked<00:00:34.260> like<00:00:34.380> they're<00:00:34.620> really<00:00:34.890> easy<00:00:35.100> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
they looked like they're really easy to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.770 
they looked like they're really easy to
find<00:00:35.550> especially<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.180> they're<00:00:36.270> all<00:00:36.420> crammed

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
find especially that they're all crammed

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.630 
find especially that they're all crammed
in<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.050> want<00:00:37.230> room<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.100> next<00:00:38.309> buildable

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
in that want room so the next buildable

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.950 
in that want room so the next buildable
we're<00:00:38.879> going<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> be<00:00:39.120> making<00:00:39.360> here<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
we're going to be making here is the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.250 
we're going to be making here is the
subsurface<00:00:40.620> resonator<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.870> new

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
subsurface resonator this is a new

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.860 
subsurface resonator this is a new
billable<00:00:43.739> i'm<00:00:43.950> not<00:00:44.309> exactly<00:00:44.789> sure<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.750> is

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
billable i'm not exactly sure what it is

the<00:00:57.600> parts<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.289> located<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> first<00:00:59.190> and

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the parts are located on the first and

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.099 
the parts are located on the first and
second<00:00:59.940> floor<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> bank<00:01:00.600> not<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:01.050> the

first floor remember both fours are the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.350 
first floor remember both fours are the
parts<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:05.159> am<00:01:05.189> showing<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.760> same<00:01:05.909> crafting

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
parts and I am showing the same crafting

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.670 
parts and I am showing the same crafting
table<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.049> did<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.530> in

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
table here because I did do this in

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.550 
table here because I did do this in
multiple<00:01:08.189> games<00:01:08.369> now<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.150> think<00:01:09.960> next<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.409> we're

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
multiple games now I think next up we're

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.630 
multiple games now I think next up we're
doing<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> tramplesteam

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
doing the tramplesteam

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.550 
doing the tramplesteam
not<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.030> trampolines<00:01:12.450> already<00:01:12.810> turbine<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
not the trampolines already turbine and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.950 
not the trampolines already turbine and
this<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> only<00:01:15.000> buildable<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.780> path

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
this is the only buildable on this path

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.719 
this is the only buildable on this path
that<00:01:16.110> only<00:01:16.320> requires<00:01:16.770> three<00:01:17.130> parts<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
that only requires three parts so the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.789 
that only requires three parts so the
first<00:01:17.939> part<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.299> there<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:19.049> had<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> fin<00:01:19.770> on

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
first part is there that had a fin on

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.370 
first part is there that had a fin on
the<00:01:20.070> shelf<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.330> second<00:01:21.720> part<00:01:21.930> here<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the shelf the second part here is the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.760 
the shelf the second part here is the
manikin<00:01:22.860> over<00:01:23.850> here<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.930> last<00:01:25.320> part

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
manikin over here and then the last part

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.440 
manikin over here and then the last part
is<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.130> show<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.549> one's<00:01:26.790> really<00:01:27.060> hard<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
is on the show this one's really hard to

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.390 
is on the show this one's really hard to
see<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:28.110> upstairs<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.040> fruit<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
see it's upstairs and the fruit in the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.789 
see it's upstairs and the fruit in the
room<00:01:29.579> upstairs<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:31.650> the
