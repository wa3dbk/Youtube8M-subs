this week did find it a bit awkward

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.490 
this week did find it a bit awkward

because I'm not the most relaxed person
it<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.519> didn't<00:01:05.880> feel<00:01:06.030> very<00:01:06.090> comfortable<00:01:06.390> but

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
it just didn't feel very comfortable but

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.500 
it just didn't feel very comfortable but
saying<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.860> did<00:01:08.220> get<00:01:08.580> into<00:01:08.729> character<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
saying that I did get into character and

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.450 
saying that I did get into character and

than<00:01:13.770> anyone<00:01:14.070> else<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.549> think<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> judges<00:01:15.330> were

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729
