okay now the third and the fourth one

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.910 
okay now the third and the fourth one
are<00:02:38.490> what's<00:02:39.360> going<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.660> make<00:02:39.930> your<00:02:40.290> role<00:02:40.560> more

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
are what's going to make your role more

are what's going to make your role more
consistent<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:42.570> going<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.780> make<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.050> to

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
consistent and it's going to make it to

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.650 
consistent and it's going to make it to
where<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.410> goes<00:02:43.560> removed<00:02:44.390> without<00:02:45.390> without

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
where it goes removed without without

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.140 
where it goes removed without without
going<00:02:46.140> up<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.410> down<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.940> that's<00:02:47.940> you're

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
going up and down and that's you're

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.300 
going up and down and that's you're
going<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.330> go<00:02:48.480> right<00:02:48.980> you're<00:02:49.980> going<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.160> start

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
going to go right you're going to start

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.490 
going to go right you're going to start
off<00:02:50.370> with<00:02:50.430> one<00:02:50.880> stroke<00:02:51.270> on<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:52.080> right<00:02:52.260> hand

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
off with one stroke on the right hand

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.050 
off with one stroke on the right hand
and<00:02:52.710> then<00:02:53.070> go<00:02:53.100> into<00:02:53.460> your<00:02:53.640> double<00:02:53.730> stroke<00:02:54.030> roll

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
and then go into your double stroke roll

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.270 
and then go into your double stroke roll
left<00:02:54.570> left<00:02:54.840> right<00:02:54.960> right<00:02:55.080> left<00:02:55.470> left<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:56.160> it's

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
left left right right left left so it's

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.060 
left left right right left left so it's
like<00:02:56.400> this

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.350 

so<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.190> second<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.060> second<00:03:04.480> note<00:03:04.690> of<00:03:06.120> each<00:03:07.120> of

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
so the second the second note of each of

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.380 
so the second the second note of each of
your<00:03:07.480> double<00:03:07.840> strokes<00:03:08.670> your<00:03:09.670> flip-flopping

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
your double strokes your flip-flopping

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.850 
your double strokes your flip-flopping
and<00:03:10.480> making<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.230> downbeat

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
and making that the downbeat

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.320 
and making that the downbeat
so<00:03:11.980> I'm<00:03:12.040> saying<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:12.880> other<00:03:12.970> words<00:03:13.180> you're

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
so I'm saying so in other words you're

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.220 
so I'm saying so in other words you're
what<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.930> want<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.200> do<00:03:14.320> is<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.680> want<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.070> then

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
what you want to do is you want to then

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.850 
what you want to do is you want to then
make<00:03:17.230> each<00:03:17.410> of<00:03:17.680> those<00:03:17.800> strokes<00:03:19.560> louder<00:03:20.560> than

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
make each of those strokes louder than

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.320 
make each of those strokes louder than
the<00:03:20.980> other<00:03:21.130> stroke<00:03:21.490> and<00:03:21.910> what<00:03:22.060> that's<00:03:22.210> going

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
the other stroke and what that's going

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.030 
the other stroke and what that's going
to<00:03:22.390> do<00:03:22.510> is<00:03:22.630> that's<00:03:22.690> going<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:22.990> build<00:03:23.230> up<00:03:23.500> so

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
to do is that's going to build up so

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.290 
to do is that's going to build up so
let's<00:03:24.160> like<00:03:24.310> working<00:03:24.580> out<00:03:24.700> with<00:03:24.940> weights<00:03:25.120> it's

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
let's like working out with weights it's

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.820 
let's like working out with weights it's
going<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.510> build<00:03:25.660> up<00:03:25.840> your<00:03:26.020> second<00:03:26.530> stroke

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
going to build up your second stroke

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:43.530 
going to build up your second stroke
which<00:03:27.430> is<00:03:27.460> going<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.790> even<00:03:28.030> out<00:03:28.090> your<00:03:28.270> roll<00:03:28.480> so

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.420 

so<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:44.989> then<00:03:45.290> move<00:03:45.680> it<00:03:45.800> to<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.069> other<00:03:46.190> hand

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
so and then move it to the other hand

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.839 
so and then move it to the other hand
left<00:03:47.239> right<00:03:48.019> right<00:03:48.049> left<00:03:48.590> left<00:03:49.040> right<00:03:49.489> right

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
left right right left left right right

00:03:49.849 --> 00:04:04.000 
left right right left left right right
so<00:03:50.599> like<00:03:50.720> this

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.960 

okay<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.670> is<00:04:05.940> going<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.630> impress

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
okay that is going to impress

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.590 
okay that is going to impress
practice<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.620> going<00:04:10.620> slow<00:04:11.520> fast<00:04:11.880> practice<00:04:12.510> it
