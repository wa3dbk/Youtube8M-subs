00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.390
 the queue will be stitch yes this hero was 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.609

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.149
 team games good hook all too 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.700
 can change the outcome of a fight 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.649
 if the allies responds and quickly 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.079
 focus is brought by a attracted goal 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.539
 so that the enemy hero after the hook does not 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.909
 managed to and accumulate mates knuckle 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.140
 need good control as well as can 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.450
 be for example tiranda 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.640
 but take some time to 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.250
 fill the hand and give the camp to the point where 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.170
 pulls his target stitch and 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.450
 depending on hook length and distance 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.329
 up to the goal the moment when the tiranda should 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.280
 give the camp will be constantly changing but 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.230
 Numerous games in this pair will help 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.269

 tiranda in this bundle is also good 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.019
 what gives the label the increasing incoming 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.849
 enemy damage and if at least one of 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.890
 Damagers your team supports 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.690
 focus on the target enemy hero 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.720
 go to rest on base without a single 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.280
 reduced chance of survival 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.920
 starts to work from the first minutes 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.530
 games and to compensate for the shortage 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.810
 laning damage you can take 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.840

 will be in front of you 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.840
 and the roots keep the goal without 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.420
 movement not one second like a tiranda 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.639
 and a half or even two with an improvement on 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.480

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.609
 support will be less than when playing with 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.639
 give a tyrant and you need help

 countermeasures when playing against the stitch can 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.030

 also that hook stitch flies through 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.840
 allied gates and neutral buildings 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.320
