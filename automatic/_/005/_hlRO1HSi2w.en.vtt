how many guys are putting to punch hurts
on<00:00:39.519> and<00:00:40.150> the<00:00:41.140> reason<00:00:41.320> I'm<00:00:41.589> doing<00:00:41.800> that<00:00:41.980> is<00:00:42.190> a

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
on and the reason I'm doing that is a

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.069 
on and the reason I'm doing that is a
couple<00:00:42.820> couple<00:00:43.180> different<00:00:43.480> things<00:00:43.510> one<00:00:43.870> it

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
couple couple different things one it

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.560 
couple couple different things one it
adds<00:00:44.230> a<00:00:44.350> lot<00:00:44.469> more<00:00:44.680> bulk<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:45.640> your<00:00:45.670> bait<00:00:45.969> so<00:00:46.510> you

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
adds a lot more bulk to your bait so you

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.180 
adds a lot more bulk to your bait so you
got<00:00:46.690> a<00:00:46.719> lot<00:00:46.840> more<00:00:46.870> size<00:00:47.260> going<00:00:47.710> in<00:00:47.829> there<00:00:48.010> if

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
got a lot more size going in there if

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.040 
got a lot more size going in there if
you're<00:00:48.309> in<00:00:48.460> any<00:00:48.730> muddy<00:00:49.329> water<00:00:49.629> around

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
you're in any muddy water around

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.380 
you're in any muddy water around
anything<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:51.430> know<00:00:51.520> any<00:00:51.670> tinge<00:00:51.910> water<00:00:52.210> or

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
anything you know any tinge water or

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.119 
anything you know any tinge water or
anything<00:00:52.570> like<00:00:52.719> that<00:00:52.870> it<00:00:53.559> helps<00:00:53.829> the<00:00:53.920> fish

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
anything like that it helps the fish

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.680 
anything like that it helps the fish
find<00:00:54.399> it<00:00:54.550> a<00:00:54.610> little<00:00:54.699> bit<00:00:54.879> better<00:00:55.000> but<00:00:55.570> the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
find it a little bit better but the

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.479 
find it a little bit better but the
other<00:00:55.840> reason<00:00:56.109> is<00:00:56.379> to<00:00:56.500> get<00:00:56.649> that<00:00:56.770> contrast<00:00:57.309> in

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
other reason is to get that contrast in

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.580 
other reason is to get that contrast in
color<00:00:57.760> so<00:00:58.030> you<00:00:58.390> get<00:00:58.510> some<00:00:58.629> really<00:00:58.899> cool<00:00:59.260> color

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
color so you get some really cool color

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.049 
color so you get some really cool color
