same time sharing an experience I had
with<00:00:07.350> you<00:00:07.500> guys<00:00:07.680> so<00:00:07.980> so<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:08.340> video<00:00:08.580> up<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.880> want

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
with you guys so so this video up I want

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.580 
with you guys so so this video up I want
to<00:00:09.059> explain<00:00:09.540> why<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.170> haven't<00:00:10.440> been

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
to explain why it is I haven't been

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.110 
to explain why it is I haven't been
coming<00:00:10.710> out<00:00:10.889> with<00:00:11.040> as<00:00:11.219> many<00:00:11.250> videos<00:00:11.849> lately

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
coming out with as many videos lately

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.940 
coming out with as many videos lately
now<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.540> reason<00:00:12.719> for<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.230> simply<00:00:13.559> just

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
now the reason for this is simply just

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.709 
now the reason for this is simply just
because<00:00:14.309> it's<00:00:14.549> extremely<00:00:15.120> difficult<00:00:15.299> to

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
because it's extremely difficult to

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.420 
because it's extremely difficult to
balance<00:00:15.870> painting<00:00:16.650> with<00:00:16.890> shooting<00:00:17.310> and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
balance painting with shooting and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.250 
balance painting with shooting and
editing<00:00:17.550> videos<00:00:18.090> for<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.359> guys<00:00:18.420> because<00:00:18.930> both

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
editing videos for you guys because both

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.330 
editing videos for you guys because both
of<00:00:19.289> these<00:00:19.529> things<00:00:19.710> are<00:00:19.859> extremely

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
of these things are extremely

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.400 
of these things are extremely
time-consuming<00:00:20.609> however<00:00:21.480> painting<00:00:22.050> kind<00:00:22.320> of

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
time-consuming however painting kind of

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.040 
time-consuming however painting kind of
takes<00:00:22.680> priority<00:00:23.189> because<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.390> don't<00:00:24.449> paint

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
takes priority because if I don't paint

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.810 
takes priority because if I don't paint
than<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.439> don't<00:00:25.619> have<00:00:25.830> any<00:00:26.010> footage<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.490> record

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
than I don't have any footage to record

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.130 
than I don't have any footage to record
for<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.060> guys<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.599> for<00:00:27.689> those<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.050> guys

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
for you guys and for those of you guys

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.750 
for you guys and for those of you guys
who<00:00:28.199> enjoy<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> graffiti<00:00:29.070> related<00:00:29.460> videos

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
who enjoy the graffiti related videos

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.189 
who enjoy the graffiti related videos
you<00:00:29.939> may<00:00:30.060> be<00:00:30.119> saying<00:00:30.390> John<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.869> don't<00:00:30.960> even

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
you may be saying John you don't even

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.749 
you may be saying John you don't even
paint<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> graffiti<00:00:31.949> related<00:00:32.250> videos<00:00:32.489> so

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
paint on the graffiti related videos so

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.459 
paint on the graffiti related videos so
why<00:00:33.030> don't<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.210> record<00:00:33.540> those<00:00:33.750> well<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
why don't you record those well the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.650 
why don't you record those well the
reason<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.250> because<00:00:35.280> once<00:00:35.969> again<00:00:36.149> I

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
reason for that is because once again I

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.780 
reason for that is because once again I
need<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.200> paint<00:00:37.469> that's<00:00:37.950> gonna<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.489> career

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
need to paint that's gonna be the career

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.459 
need to paint that's gonna be the career

I<00:02:14.459> did<00:02:14.879> kind<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.330> think<00:02:15.569> that<00:02:15.840> my<00:02:16.140> artwork

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
I did kind of think that my artwork

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.170 
I did kind of think that my artwork
could<00:02:17.040> hold<00:02:17.280> up<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.730> some<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.030> these<00:02:18.120> other

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
could hold up to some of these other

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.820 
could hold up to some of these other
paintings<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.930> some<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.410> galleries

however there were just some paintings
there<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.290> owe<00:02:22.470> me<00:02:23.040> out<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.340> war<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.819> kind

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
there that owe me out the war and kind

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.780 
there that owe me out the war and kind
