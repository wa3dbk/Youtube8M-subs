android 2.1 and the nexus one here has
android<00:00:45.809> 2.2<00:00:46.820> this<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.149> significant

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
android 2.2 this one is significant

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.100 
android 2.2 this one is significant
because<00:00:48.960> android<00:00:49.620> 2.2<00:00:50.039> has<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> new<00:00:50.960> just<00:00:51.960> in

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
because android 2.2 has the new just in

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.130 
because android 2.2 has the new just in
time<00:00:52.320> our<00:00:52.680> jit<00:00:53.190> compiler<00:00:53.690> for<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> dalvik

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
time our jit compiler for the dalvik

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.049 
time our jit compiler for the dalvik
virtual<00:00:55.289> machine<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:56.879> they've

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
virtual machine and this one they've

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.290 
virtual machine and this one they've
advertised<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.750> having<00:00:58.309> two<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.969> five

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
advertised it as having two to five

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.020 
advertised it as having two to five
times<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.649> performance<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:04.280> android<00:01:05.280> 2.1<00:01:05.700> so

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
times the performance of android 2.1 so

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.600 
times the performance of android 2.1 so
this<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.360> should<00:01:06.390> score<00:01:06.990> quite<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> bit<00:01:07.920> higher

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
this one should score quite a bit higher

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.340 
this one should score quite a bit higher
and<00:01:09.000> we'll<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.450> let<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.750> keep<00:01:09.960> running

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and we'll just let this keep running

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.480 
and we'll just let this keep running
through<00:01:10.560> here<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:10.950> see<00:01:11.100> all<00:01:11.189> these<00:01:11.310> going

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
through here you can see all these going

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.760 
through here you can see all these going
in<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.760> background<00:01:12.270> i<00:01:12.560> guess<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> other

are finishing here we'll just take a
look<00:01:39.900> at<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> scores<00:01:40.439> let's<00:01:40.619> look<00:01:40.740> at<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
look at the scores let's look at the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.670 
look at the scores let's look at the

nexus one first let me zoom in here a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.700 
nexus one first let me zoom in here a
little<00:01:43.829> bit<00:01:44.040> as<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.869> see<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:48.049> focus<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
little bit as you can see the focus the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.520 
little bit as you can see the focus the
nexus<00:01:50.130> one<00:01:50.369> i<00:01:51.270> came<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:51.990> first<00:01:52.200> year<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.409> had<00:01:52.500> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
nexus one i came in first year we had a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.899 
nexus one i came in first year we had a
score<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:53.119> 1476<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.049> be<00:01:55.140> expected

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
score of 1476 and this is to be expected

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.459 
score of 1476 and this is to be expected
android<00:01:56.909> 2.2<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.750> does<00:01:57.930> offer<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.259> big

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
android 2.2 it does offer a big

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.719 
android 2.2 it does offer a big
performance<00:01:58.619> boost<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.490> see<00:01:59.640> that

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
performance boost and we can see that

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
implemented their own hummingbird core

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.550 
implemented their own hummingbird core
and<00:02:21.600> that's<00:02:21.810> interesting<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.320> one's

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
and that's interesting that that one's

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.740 
and that's interesting that that one's
faster<00:02:22.770> let's<00:02:23.550> let's<00:02:23.850> take<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.090> look<00:02:24.330> let's<00:02:24.360> see

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
faster let's let's take a look let's see

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.600 
faster let's let's take a look let's see
how<00:02:24.900> some<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.110> these<00:02:25.170> other<00:02:25.380> ones<00:02:25.590> did<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.460> is

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
how some of these other ones did this is

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.000 
how some of these other ones did this is
the<00:02:26.790> sprint<00:02:27.420> HTC<00:02:28.200> EVO<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:29.790> guy<00:02:30.000> scored<00:02:31.010> come

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
the sprint HTC EVO this guy scored come

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.990 
the sprint HTC EVO this guy scored come
on<00:02:32.160> boy<00:02:32.420> this<00:02:33.420> guy<00:02:33.600> scored<00:02:34.490> 526<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.700> hope<00:02:35.880> you

on boy this guy scored 526 I hope you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.510 
on boy this guy scored 526 I hope you
can<00:02:36.150> see<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.530> which<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.710> be<00:02:37.890> expected<00:02:37.980> I

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
can see that which is to be expected I

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.890 
can see that which is to be expected I
mean<00:02:38.670> we<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:38.910> see<00:02:39.060> these<00:02:39.210> four<00:02:39.480> phones<00:02:39.720> here

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
mean we can see these four phones here

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.740 
mean we can see these four phones here

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the one gigahertz snapdragon platform so

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.240 
the one gigahertz snapdragon platform so
we<00:02:47.790> expect<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.240> see<00:02:48.360> these<00:02:48.600> all<00:02:48.840> together<00:02:49.709> and

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
we expect to see these all together and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.640 
we expect to see these all together and
I<00:02:50.550> i'm<00:02:50.910> assuming<00:02:51.270> let's<00:02:51.690> see<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:51.959> droid

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
I i'm assuming let's see this droid

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.199 
I i'm assuming let's see this droid
incredible<00:02:53.220> should<00:02:53.400> be<00:02:53.520> within<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.970> same

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
incredible should be within that same

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.370 
incredible should be within that same
range<00:02:54.860> yeah<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:56.040> one<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.270> 532<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:57.900> pretty

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
range yeah this one is 532 so pretty

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.750 
range yeah this one is 532 so pretty
much<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.709> same<00:02:58.860> thing<00:02:58.920> as<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.640> evo<00:03:00.120> over<00:03:00.330> here

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
much the same thing as the evo over here

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.070 
much the same thing as the evo over here
that's<00:03:02.760> that's<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.239> be<00:03:03.330> expected<00:03:03.360> by<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.900> way

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
that's that's to be expected by the way

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.140 
that's that's to be expected by the way
I<00:03:04.110> did<00:03:04.440> reboot<00:03:04.739> all<00:03:05.430> these<00:03:05.610> phones<00:03:05.790> before<00:03:05.970> we

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
I did reboot all these phones before we

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.130 
I did reboot all these phones before we
start<00:03:06.360> out<00:03:06.450> just<00:03:06.600> trying<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.840> clear<00:03:07.020> the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
start out just trying to clear the

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
memory on if everybody's curious about

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.220 
memory on if everybody's curious about
that<00:03:08.640> going<00:03:09.390> down<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.570> list<00:03:09.690> we<00:03:09.900> do<00:03:09.989> see<00:03:10.140> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
that going down the list we do see the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.680 
that going down the list we do see the
x10<00:03:10.620> this<00:03:10.860> also<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.420> 1<00:03:12.420> gigahertz

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
android 1.6 that might be why that one's

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.600 
android 1.6 that might be why that one's
a<00:03:15.720> little<00:03:15.810> bit<00:03:15.989> slower<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.500> then<00:03:17.070> let's<00:03:17.340> just

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
a little bit slower and then let's just

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.780 
a little bit slower and then let's just
jump<00:03:17.940> on<00:03:18.090> over<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.480> droid<00:03:18.780> here<00:03:19.670> see<00:03:20.670> what

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
jump on over to the droid here see what

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.990 
jump on over to the droid here see what
this<00:03:20.880> guy's<00:03:21.090> scored<00:03:21.420> I'll<00:03:22.230> processing<00:03:23.000> our

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
this guy's scored I'll processing our

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.160 
this guy's scored I'll processing our
droid<00:03:24.330> got<00:03:24.630> three<00:03:25.049> we<00:03:25.799> got<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.100> 350<00:03:26.940> 4<00:03:27.209> which<00:03:28.049> is

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
droid got three we got a 350 4 which is

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.900 
droid got three we got a 350 4 which is
a<00:03:28.200> little<00:03:28.440> bit<00:03:28.620> lower<00:03:28.799> i<00:03:28.890> mean<00:03:29.130> this<00:03:29.280> processor

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
a little bit lower i mean this processor

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.090 
a little bit lower i mean this processor
is<00:03:30.180> clocked<00:03:30.959> slower<00:03:31.440> than<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.709> rest<00:03:31.920> it's

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
is clocked slower than the rest it's

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.680 
is clocked slower than the rest it's

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
only a five hundred 50 megahertz i mean

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.320 
only a five hundred 50 megahertz i mean
they<00:03:33.810> all<00:03:34.019> have<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.470> same<00:03:34.650> arm<00:03:35.180> cortex<00:03:36.180> a8

they all have the same arm cortex a8
base<00:03:36.989> core<00:03:37.410> but<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:38.790> Texas<00:03:39.239> entrance

how these tests are broken down in the
free<00:03:46.260> version<00:03:46.410> they're<00:03:46.680> supposed<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:46.950> have<00:03:47.040> a

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
free version they're supposed to have a

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.949 
free version they're supposed to have a
pro<00:03:47.340> version<00:03:47.700> coming<00:03:47.880> soon<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:48.390> we<00:03:48.510> can't<00:03:48.720> see

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
pro version coming soon so we can't see

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.350 
pro version coming soon so we can't see
what<00:03:49.709> causes<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.250> score<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.670> be<00:03:50.790> lower<00:03:50.970> I'm

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
what causes the score to be lower I'm

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.970 
what causes the score to be lower I'm
just<00:03:51.660> going<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.810> guess<00:03:52.380> it's<00:03:52.560> based<00:03:52.739> on<00:03:52.920> the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
just going to guess it's based on the

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.789 
just going to guess it's based on the
slower<00:03:53.370> clock<00:03:53.690> processor<00:03:54.690> because<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.620> joy

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
slower clock processor because the joy

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.440 
slower clock processor because the joy
does<00:03:56.040> have<00:03:56.250> its<00:03:56.489> supposed<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:56.820> have<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.000> faster

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
does have its supposed to have a faster

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.660 
does have its supposed to have a faster
graphics<00:03:58.320> processor<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.070> does<00:03:59.370> have<00:03:59.549> the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
graphics processor this does have the

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.280 
graphics processor this does have the
dedicated<00:04:00.860> power<00:04:01.860> vrscdx<00:04:02.570> GPU<00:04:03.570> so<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:04.110> gives

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
dedicated power vrscdx GPU so that gives

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.870 
dedicated power vrscdx GPU so that gives
it<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.470> nice<00:04:04.560> boost<00:04:04.860> in<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.100> games<00:04:05.310> but<00:04:05.610> overall

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
it a nice boost in the games but overall

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.240 
it a nice boost in the games but overall
process<00:04:06.390> it's<00:04:07.019> lacking<00:04:07.380> behind<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.860> others<00:04:08.040> I

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
process it's lacking behind the others I

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.550 
process it's lacking behind the others I
guess<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.420> good<00:04:09.570> thing<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.930> say<00:04:10.170> with

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
guess the the good thing to say with

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.520 
guess the the good thing to say with
this<00:04:10.739> test<00:04:11.130> is<00:04:11.480> we<00:04:12.480> can<00:04:12.630> see<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.079> know<00:04:13.200> we<00:04:13.440> get

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
this test is we can see you know we get

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.190 
this test is we can see you know we get
a<00:04:13.590> preview<00:04:13.920> here<00:04:14.190> in<00:04:14.340> this<00:04:14.430> nexus<00:04:14.850> one<00:04:15.200> that

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
a preview here in this nexus one that

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.990 
a preview here in this nexus one that
has<00:04:16.320> android<00:04:16.650> 2.2<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.430> can<00:04:17.549> see<00:04:17.820> the

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
has android 2.2 you can see the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.789 
has android 2.2 you can see the
performance<00:04:18.299> increase<00:04:18.840> just<00:04:19.350> from<00:04:19.650> upgrading

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
performance increase just from upgrading

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.070 
performance increase just from upgrading
the<00:04:20.160> firmware<00:04:20.190> i<00:04:20.609> mean<00:04:20.850> it's<00:04:21.000> almost<00:04:21.150> like<00:04:21.959> i

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
the firmware i mean it's almost like i

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.690 
the firmware i mean it's almost like i
said<00:04:22.260> it's<00:04:22.380> almost<00:04:22.530> triple<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.160> value<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.610> the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
said it's almost triple the value of the

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.250 
said it's almost triple the value of the
others<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.570> these<00:04:24.780> phones<00:04:25.229> here

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
others so these phones here

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.400 
others so these phones here
be<00:04:26.470> upgraded<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.190> android<00:04:27.520> 2.2<00:04:28.030> or<00:04:28.480> froyo<00:04:29.200> as

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
be upgraded to android 2.2 or froyo as

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.320 
be upgraded to android 2.2 or froyo as
they<00:04:29.530> call<00:04:29.710> it<00:04:29.740> soon<00:04:30.100> Motorola<00:04:30.970> has<00:04:31.060> said

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
they call it soon Motorola has said

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.790 
they call it soon Motorola has said
they're<00:04:31.450> working<00:04:31.720> aggressively<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.380> get<00:04:32.680> that

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
they're working aggressively to get that

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.840 
they're working aggressively to get that
update<00:04:32.950> out<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:35.310> droid<00:04:36.310> here<00:04:36.520> does<00:04:36.700> have

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
update out and the droid here does have

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.460 
update out and the droid here does have
a<00:04:36.910> stock<00:04:37.210> version<00:04:37.480> of<00:04:37.690> Android<00:04:38.020> so<00:04:38.170> this<00:04:38.290> one

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
a stock version of Android so this one

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.320 
a stock version of Android so this one
should<00:04:38.500> be<00:04:38.710> upgraded<00:04:39.160> first<00:04:39.430> these<00:04:40.180> two

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
should be upgraded first these two

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.760 
should be upgraded first these two
phones<00:04:40.540> here<00:04:40.780> these<00:04:40.900> two<00:04:40.960> flagship<00:04:41.500> devices

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
phones here these two flagship devices

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.770 
phones here these two flagship devices
from<00:04:42.010> Sprint<00:04:42.400> Verizon<00:04:42.430> they<00:04:42.940> both<00:04:43.090> have<00:04:43.240> HTC's

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
from Sprint Verizon they both have HTC's

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.950 
from Sprint Verizon they both have HTC's
Sense<00:04:44.050> UI<00:04:45.030> which<00:04:46.030> could<00:04:46.270> take<00:04:46.420> a<00:04:46.480> couple<00:04:46.750> more

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
Sense UI which could take a couple more

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.420 
Sense UI which could take a couple more
months<00:04:47.170> to<00:04:47.440> get<00:04:47.530> upgraded<00:04:47.860> but<00:04:48.070> hopefully

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
months to get upgraded but hopefully

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.370 
months to get upgraded but hopefully
these<00:04:48.730> should<00:04:48.940> be<00:04:49.000> done<00:04:49.180> soon<00:04:49.210> but<00:04:50.170> at<00:04:50.290> least

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
these should be done soon but at least

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.590 
these should be done soon but at least
we<00:04:50.590> can<00:04:50.710> see<00:04:50.980> all<00:04:51.340> these<00:04:51.580> devices<00:04:51.880> should<00:04:52.480> be

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
we can see all these devices should be

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.150 
we can see all these devices should be
getting<00:04:52.810> a<00:04:52.870> major<00:04:53.110> performance<00:04:53.470> increase

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
getting a major performance increase

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.280 
getting a major performance increase
soon<00:04:54.970> so<00:04:55.330> we'll<00:04:55.540> be<00:04:55.660> on<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.840> lookout<00:04:56.080> for<00:04:56.140> that

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
soon so we'll be on the lookout for that

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.890 
soon so we'll be on the lookout for that
thank<00:04:56.650> you<00:04:56.740> guys
