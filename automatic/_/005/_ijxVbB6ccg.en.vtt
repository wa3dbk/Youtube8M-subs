00:00:10.617 --> 00:00:13.513
I was motivated to do this by my two-year old daughter

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.908
who always hides her toys under the couch.

00:00:15.908 --> 00:00:19.126
It was quite hard finding out

00:00:19.126 --> 00:00:21.899
or looking at what lies down below.

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.558
The obvious first idea was taking my vacuum cleaning robot

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.211
and modifying it accordingly,

00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:30.339
so it could drive under the couch and get out the toys.

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.018
But sadly it was too tall.

00:00:32.018 --> 00:00:35.261
So we decided to use the Raspberry-Pi platform

00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:38.774
to build our own robot, which is small enough

00:00:38.774 --> 00:00:41.653
and which can drive under the couch,

00:00:41.653 --> 00:00:44.209
look at what is there, and accordingly

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:46.253
move out what toys it finds.

00:00:53.388 --> 00:00:56.247
What you need is an Android mobile phone or tablet,

00:00:56.247 --> 00:00:58.557
preferrably an Android tablet because one sees more

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:00.440
and you see exactly what the robot sees 

00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:02.323
and have a remote control -

00:01:02.324 --> 00:01:04.347
that means you can rotate left, rotate right,

00:01:04.347 --> 00:01:06.805
drive forward and backwards at different speeds

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:08.149
and we even added a lamp,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.493
because it is often dark under the couch

00:01:09.493 --> 00:01:11.298
and otherwise you could not see anything.

00:01:15.418 --> 00:01:17.055
Our idea is actually

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:19.060
taking household robots which already exist

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.384
for example vacuum cleaning robots or lawn mower robots

00:01:21.384 --> 00:01:24.437
and extending them with intelligent functionality,

00:01:24.437 --> 00:01:26.227
for example the vacuum cleaning robot

00:01:26.228 --> 00:01:28.032
should typically be collecting baby toys

00:01:28.032 --> 00:01:32.256
and for example the lawn mower robot should be collecting apples,

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:33.469
because current lawn mower robots

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.682
drive over the apples

00:01:34.683 --> 00:01:38.257
and these (chopped apples) attract wasps - these things are very interesting to us.

00:01:38.257 --> 00:01:40.258
And that is why we wanted to show,

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.259
what can be done with today's technology.

00:01:46.142 --> 00:01:49.324
We have built a website where you have all the plans

00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:51.280
and you can actually build one of these,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.563
we provide the software as Open Source.
