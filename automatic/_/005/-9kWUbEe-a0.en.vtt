00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
that's why my ranks are a little bit

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.110 
that's why my ranks are a little bit
incomplete<00:03:34.140> over<00:03:34.800> here<00:03:35.040> because<00:03:35.700> every<00:03:35.940> once

super glue she'll dry pretty quick means

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.540 
super glue she'll dry pretty quick means
that<00:03:48.450> uh

this<00:03:50.550> won't<00:03:50.820> be<00:03:51.540> as<00:03:51.870> flexible<00:03:52.350> as<00:03:52.830> it<00:03:52.980> was

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
this won't be as flexible as it was

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.070 
this won't be as flexible as it was
before

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
before

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.230 
before
preferably<00:03:55.080> you<00:03:55.470> pin<00:03:55.980> these<00:03:56.130> down<00:03:56.460> right<00:03:57.030> in

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
preferably you pin these down right in

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.330 
preferably you pin these down right in
the<00:03:57.360> first<00:03:57.600> place<00:03:57.800> otherwise<00:03:58.800> you<00:03:59.070> end<00:03:59.100> up

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
the first place otherwise you end up

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.220 
the first place otherwise you end up
with<00:03:59.490> glue<00:03:59.760> residue<00:03:59.940> all<00:04:00.390> over<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:00.870> it

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
with glue residue all over it and it

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.350 
with glue residue all over it and it
shows<00:04:01.920> more<00:04:03.830> and<00:04:04.830> so<00:04:05.370> we<00:04:05.490> have<00:04:05.610> four<00:04:06.030> soldiers

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
shows more and so we have four soldiers

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.650 
shows more and so we have four soldiers

hopefully<00:04:18.200> you<00:04:18.320> guys<00:04:18.500> can<00:04:18.560> see<00:04:19.180> well<00:04:20.180> enough

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
hopefully you guys can see well enough

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.520 
hopefully you guys can see well enough
that<00:04:22.970> one<00:04:23.090> was<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.240> bit<00:04:23.419> too<00:04:23.600> much<00:04:23.750> glue<00:04:24.080> but

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
that one was a bit too much glue but

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.280 
that one was a bit too much glue but
he'll<00:04:24.680> still<00:04:24.800> work<00:04:25.130> so<00:04:25.450> I'll<00:04:26.450> sand<00:04:26.720> down<00:04:26.960> one

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
he'll still work so I'll sand down one

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:42.339 
he'll still work so I'll sand down one
more<00:04:27.500> soldier

which<00:05:03.289> once<00:05:03.529> they're<00:05:03.710> dry<00:05:03.889> I<00:05:03.949> can<00:05:04.430> just<00:05:04.610> move

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
which once they're dry I can just move

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.700 
which once they're dry I can just move

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.909 
them a little bit take a picture is it
cheating<00:05:11.749> oh<00:05:12.110> yeah

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919

cheating oh yeah
it's<00:05:13.279> cheating<00:05:13.759> but<00:05:14.330> if<00:05:14.659> you<00:05:14.779> were<00:05:14.899> trying<00:05:15.050> to

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
it's cheating but if you were trying to

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:16.869 
it's cheating but if you were trying to
move<00:05:15.349> this<00:05:15.589> one<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:16.099> then<00:05:16.249> move<00:05:16.430> this<00:05:16.610> one

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:16.879 
move this one and then move this one

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.850 
move this one and then move this one
rather<00:05:17.449> move<00:05:17.689> this<00:05:17.839> one<00:05:18.050> forward<00:05:18.379> and<00:05:18.529> this

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
rather move this one forward and this

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.290 
rather move this one forward and this
one<00:05:19.009> forward<00:05:19.219> then<00:05:19.759> you're<00:05:19.879> gonna<00:05:20.029> knock<00:05:20.270> that

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
one forward then you're gonna knock that

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.969 
one forward then you're gonna knock that
one<00:05:20.629> over<00:05:20.930> and<00:05:21.229> he's<00:05:21.349> also<00:05:21.499> gonna<00:05:21.770> knock<00:05:21.949> that

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
one over and he's also gonna knock that

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.709 
one over and he's also gonna knock that
one<00:05:22.279> over<00:05:22.580> and<00:05:22.729> this<00:05:23.119> one's<00:05:23.300> gonna<00:05:23.389> fall<00:05:23.689> over

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:23.719 
one over and this one's gonna fall over

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:25.389 
one over and this one's gonna fall over
and<00:05:24.169> then<00:05:24.589> you're<00:05:24.680> gonna<00:05:24.770> try<00:05:24.979> and<00:05:25.009> set<00:05:25.279> them

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:25.399 
and then you're gonna try and set them

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:27.329 
and then you're gonna try and set them
up<00:05:25.550> right<00:05:25.819> and<00:05:25.969> they're<00:05:26.089> just<00:05:26.240> gonna<00:05:26.419> be<00:05:26.599> like

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:27.339 
up right and they're just gonna be like

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:29.829 
up right and they're just gonna be like
constantly<00:05:28.339> going<00:05:28.639> like<00:05:28.819> this<00:05:28.999> in<00:05:29.209> animation

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:29.839 
constantly going like this in animation

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:32.589 
constantly going like this in animation
so<00:05:30.409> this<00:05:30.979> is<00:05:31.159> the<00:05:31.279> better<00:05:31.550> way<00:05:31.759> to<00:05:31.789> do<00:05:32.029> it<00:05:32.180> also

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
so this is the better way to do it also

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.999 
so this is the better way to do it also
just<00:05:33.169> for<00:05:33.349> dioramas<00:05:34.099> or<00:05:34.399> whatever<00:05:34.759> this<00:05:35.719> works

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:36.009 
just for dioramas or whatever this works

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.980 
just for dioramas or whatever this works
works<00:05:37.009> well<00:05:37.339> and<00:05:38.119> keep<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.389> camera<00:05:38.569> there<00:05:38.809> for

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
works well and keep the camera there for

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.320 
works well and keep the camera there for
me<00:05:41.080> the<00:05:42.080> same<00:05:42.319> way<00:05:42.349> our<00:05:42.770> Z<00:05:43.039> onset<00:05:43.639> looks<00:05:43.969> really

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
me the same way our Z onset looks really

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.279 
me the same way our Z onset looks really
good<00:05:44.509> coming<00:05:44.990> at<00:05:45.139> them<00:05:46.419> so<00:05:47.419> it's<00:05:47.809> a<00:05:47.899> great<00:05:48.110> way

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
good coming at them so it's a great way

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.869 
good coming at them so it's a great way
to<00:05:48.319> play<00:05:48.559> with<00:05:48.740> your<00:05:48.830> mini<00:05:49.009> micro<00:05:49.339> army<00:05:49.519> man<00:05:49.669> or

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:49.879 
to play with your mini micro army man or

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.759 
to play with your mini micro army man or
even<00:05:50.209> use<00:05:50.389> them<00:05:50.599> for<00:05:50.959> stop-motion<00:05:51.229> animation

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:51.769 
even use them for stop-motion animation

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:54.100 
even use them for stop-motion animation
I<00:05:52.099> hope<00:05:52.759> that<00:05:53.059> this<00:05:53.180> tutorial<00:05:53.599> has<00:05:53.899> been

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
I hope that this tutorial has been

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.990 
I hope that this tutorial has been
useful<00:05:54.349> to<00:05:54.709> you<00:05:54.830> guys<00:05:55.360> what<00:05:56.360> you<00:05:56.389> guys<00:05:56.599> later
