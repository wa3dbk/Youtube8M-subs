helicopters in a pretty good solution
form<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:15.580> this<00:00:15.849> i<00:00:16.059> know<00:00:16.150> i'm<00:00:16.330> using<00:00:16.570> a<00:00:16.660> nano<00:00:16.900> in

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
form in this i know i'm using a nano in

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.350 
form in this i know i'm using a nano in
this<00:00:17.230> example<00:00:17.590> but<00:00:18.340> it<00:00:18.460> works<00:00:18.610> for<00:00:18.910> a<00:00:18.939> lot<00:00:19.210> of

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
this example but it works for a lot of

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.820 
this example but it works for a lot of
these<00:00:19.450> micro<00:00:19.840> helicopters<00:00:20.380> all<00:00:20.560> the<00:00:20.650> way<00:00:20.740> up

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
these micro helicopters all the way up

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.920 
these micro helicopters all the way up
to<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.009> 130<00:00:21.609> x<00:00:21.820> the<00:00:22.029> blade<00:00:22.269> makes<00:00:22.510> or<00:00:22.810> the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
to the 130 x the blade makes or the

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.890 
to the 130 x the blade makes or the
walkera<00:00:23.350> 4<00:00:23.470> g6<00:00:24.220> and<00:00:24.880> it<00:00:25.180> also<00:00:25.330> works<00:00:25.630> for<00:00:25.750> the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
walkera 4 g6 and it also works for the

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.019 
walkera 4 g6 and it also works for the
helicopter<00:00:26.349> is<00:00:26.410> in<00:00:26.500> between<00:00:26.619> like<00:00:27.010> the<00:00:27.160> v<00:00:27.310> 9<00:00:27.490> 22

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
helicopter is in between like the v 9 22

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.939 
helicopter is in between like the v 9 22
the<00:00:29.820> FBL<00:00:30.820> 100<00:00:31.390> it<00:00:31.840> also<00:00:31.990> works<00:00:32.199> really<00:00:32.349> well<00:00:32.739> in

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
the FBL 100 it also works really well in

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.040 
the FBL 100 it also works really well in
fixed<00:00:33.250> pitch<00:00:33.400> helicopters<00:00:34.030> like<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.330> v<00:00:34.480> 9<00:00:34.660> 11

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
fixed pitch helicopters like the v 9 11

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.010 
fixed pitch helicopters like the v 9 11
of<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.260> MSR<00:00:35.680> x<00:00:35.890> and<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:37.540> prop<00:00:37.690> we're<00:00:37.840> going<00:00:37.960> to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
of the MSR x and the prop we're going to

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.150 
of the MSR x and the prop we're going to
talk<00:00:38.110> about<00:00:38.230> today<00:00:38.440> is<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.739> toilet<00:00:39.040> bowl

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
talk about today is the toilet bowl

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.340 
talk about today is the toilet bowl
effect<00:00:39.460> and<00:00:39.730> that's<00:00:40.510> when<00:00:40.690> your<00:00:40.809> helicopter

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
effect and that's when your helicopter

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.380 
effect and that's when your helicopter
just<00:00:41.530> kind<00:00:41.770> of<00:00:41.829> does<00:00:41.980> big<00:00:42.280> lazy<00:00:42.579> circles<00:00:43.000> when

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
just kind of does big lazy circles when

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.319 
just kind of does big lazy circles when
you're<00:00:43.510> trying<00:00:43.780> to<00:00:43.960> hover<00:00:44.410> it<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:46.030> also

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
you're trying to hover it and also

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.090 
you're trying to hover it and also
usually<00:00:47.110> if<00:00:47.379> you're<00:00:47.500> having<00:00:47.620> toilet<00:00:47.980> bowl

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
usually if you're having toilet bowl

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.200 
usually if you're having toilet bowl
effects<00:00:48.370> you<00:00:48.520> feel<00:00:48.700> like<00:00:48.789> you're<00:00:48.940> kind<00:00:49.059> of

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
effects you feel like you're kind of

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.700 
effects you feel like you're kind of
chasing<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.690> helicopter<00:00:50.289> the<00:00:50.379> whole<00:00:50.530> time

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
chasing the helicopter the whole time

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.040 
chasing the helicopter the whole time
when<00:00:50.890> you're<00:00:51.010> controlling<00:00:51.370> it<00:00:51.899> really<00:00:52.899> good

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
when you're controlling it really good

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.869 
when you're controlling it really good
solution<00:00:53.500> for<00:00:53.530> this<00:00:53.829> is<00:00:54.340> to<00:00:54.520> put<00:00:54.640> an<00:00:54.730> o-ring

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
solution for this is to put an o-ring

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.240 
solution for this is to put an o-ring
kit<00:00:55.090> on<00:00:55.390> it<00:00:55.420> let's<00:00:56.320> take<00:00:56.530> little<00:00:56.829> silicone

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
kit on it let's take little silicone

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.069 
kit on it let's take little silicone
o-rings<00:00:57.699> and<00:00:57.910> put<00:00:58.420> them<00:00:58.539> all<00:00:58.629> the<00:00:58.750> connections

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
o-rings and put them all the connections

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.380 
o-rings and put them all the connections
between<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.710> swash<00:01:00.070> plate<00:01:00.309> and<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:01.180> push

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
between the swash plate and the push

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.810 
between the swash plate and the push
rods<00:01:01.660> and<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.870> blade<00:01:02.079> grips<00:01:02.379> and<00:01:03.190> what<00:01:03.670> this

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
rods and the blade grips and what this

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.999 
rods and the blade grips and what this
does<00:01:03.879> is<00:01:04.539> it<00:01:05.050> really<00:01:05.379> tightens<00:01:05.740> up<00:01:05.800> those

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
does is it really tightens up those

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.760 
does is it really tightens up those
connections<00:01:06.539> the<00:01:07.539> ball<00:01:08.229> links<00:01:08.530> on<00:01:08.649> these

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
connections the ball links on these

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.279 
connections the ball links on these
little<00:01:08.979> helicopters<00:01:09.670> aren't<00:01:10.599> really<00:01:11.050> tight

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
little helicopters aren't really tight

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.100 
little helicopters aren't really tight
you<00:01:12.220> know<00:01:12.280> you've<00:01:12.459> got<00:01:12.640> your<00:01:12.880> your<00:01:13.720> linkage

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
you know you've got your your linkage

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.449 
you know you've got your your linkage
here<00:01:14.140> in<00:01:14.380> your<00:01:14.500> ball<00:01:14.679> and<00:01:14.979> there's<00:01:15.280> usually

00:01:15.449 --> 00:01:15.459 
here in your ball and there's usually

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.699 
here in your ball and there's usually
some<00:01:15.819> slop<00:01:16.119> in<00:01:16.300> there<00:01:16.509> so<00:01:17.259> when<00:01:17.380> you're<00:01:17.500> flying

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:17.709 
some slop in there so when you're flying

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:19.919 
some slop in there so when you're flying
along<00:01:18.160> it'll<00:01:18.910> be<00:01:19.060> kind<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.360> rattling<00:01:19.780> around

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
along it'll be kind of rattling around

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.350 
along it'll be kind of rattling around
and<00:01:20.259> when<00:01:20.349> you<00:01:20.440> make<00:01:20.590> your<00:01:20.619> input<00:01:21.360> your

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
and when you make your input your

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.790 
and when you make your input your
linkage<00:01:22.750> will<00:01:22.929> move<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.319> it<00:01:23.380> takes<00:01:23.590> a<00:01:23.679> while

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
linkage will move and it takes a while

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.529 
linkage will move and it takes a while
to<00:01:23.979> catch<00:01:24.160> that<00:01:24.429> ball<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:24.940> move<00:01:25.060> it<00:01:25.209> with<00:01:25.360> it

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
to catch that ball and move it with it

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.020 
to catch that ball and move it with it
and<00:01:25.750> then<00:01:26.349> when<00:01:26.470> it<00:01:26.560> stops<00:01:26.890> moving<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.550> lot<00:01:28.000> of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
and then when it stops moving a lot of

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.389 
and then when it stops moving a lot of
times<00:01:28.300> that<00:01:28.479> ball<00:01:28.780> will<00:01:29.050> keep<00:01:29.349> moving<00:01:29.770> before

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
times that ball will keep moving before

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.850 
times that ball will keep moving before
it<00:01:30.640> stops<00:01:31.000> against<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.509> linkage<00:01:31.899> and<00:01:32.110> that's

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
it stops against the linkage and that's

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.770 
it stops against the linkage and that's
what<00:01:33.069> causes<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.640> helicopter<00:01:34.239> to<00:01:34.360> just<00:01:34.569> kind

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
what causes the helicopter to just kind

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.139 
what causes the helicopter to just kind
of<00:01:34.840> move<00:01:35.020> around<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:36.520> when<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.789> put<00:01:37.030> an

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
of move around but when you put an

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.839 
of move around but when you put an
o-ring<00:01:37.300> in<00:01:37.660> there<00:01:38.039> to<00:01:39.039> take<00:01:39.220> up<00:01:39.369> that<00:01:39.399> space

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:39.849 
o-ring in there to take up that space

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.479 
o-ring in there to take up that space
behind<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.390> ball<00:01:40.709> it<00:01:41.709> tightens<00:01:42.190> up<00:01:42.280> that

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:42.489 
behind the ball it tightens up that

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:45.029 
behind the ball it tightens up that
linkage<00:01:42.989> so<00:01:43.989> when<00:01:44.200> your<00:01:44.319> linkage<00:01:44.619> moves<00:01:44.770> your

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
linkage so when your linkage moves your

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.219 
linkage so when your linkage moves your
ball<00:01:45.160> moves<00:01:45.459> your<00:01:46.060> helicopter<00:01:46.569> moves<00:01:46.780> when

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
ball moves your helicopter moves when

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.529 
ball moves your helicopter moves when
your<00:01:47.349> linkage<00:01:47.649> stops<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.190> ball<00:01:48.310> stops<00:01:48.729> so<00:01:49.450> you

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
your linkage stops the ball stops so you

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.809 
your linkage stops the ball stops so you
have<00:01:49.660> much<00:01:49.929> more<00:01:49.959> precise<00:01:50.590> control<00:01:51.039> really

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
have much more precise control really

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.260 
have much more precise control really
does<00:01:51.970> make<00:01:52.149> quite<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.420> difference<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.729> so

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
does make quite a difference and so

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.029 
does make quite a difference and so
you'll<00:01:55.569> find<00:01:55.599> everything<00:01:56.319> you<00:01:56.500> need<00:01:56.679> for<00:01:56.830> that

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
you'll find everything you need for that

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.630 
you'll find everything you need for that
in<00:01:57.280> just<00:01:57.520> our<00:01:57.700> basic<00:01:58.179> head<00:01:58.450> kits<00:01:58.750> if<00:01:59.220> you<00:02:00.220> also

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
in just our basic head kits if you also

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.400 
in just our basic head kits if you also
notice<00:02:01.239> that<00:02:01.270> when<00:02:01.539> you're<00:02:01.690> spinning<00:02:01.929> up<00:02:02.229> on

notice that when you're spinning up on
the<00:02:02.500> ground<00:02:02.770> your<00:02:03.310> helicopter<00:02:03.879> tends<00:02:04.149> to<00:02:04.420> lose

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:04.989 
the ground your helicopter tends to lose

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:06.719 
the ground your helicopter tends to lose
traction<00:02:05.379> spin<00:02:05.920> up<00:02:06.039> on<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:06.250> ground<00:02:06.489> a<00:02:06.610> little

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
traction spin up on the ground a little

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.580 
traction spin up on the ground a little
bit<00:02:06.910> before<00:02:07.149> you<00:02:07.330> take<00:02:07.539> off<00:02:07.720> which<00:02:08.140> can<00:02:08.379> throw

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
bit before you take off which can throw

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.229 
bit before you take off which can throw
off<00:02:08.709> your<00:02:08.739> orientation<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.700> make<00:02:09.819> it<00:02:09.970> hard<00:02:10.149> to

get started putting skid nuts on can

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.000 
get started putting skid nuts on can
help<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.330> that's<00:02:13.510> just<00:02:13.780> applying<00:02:14.170> o<00:02:14.470> rings<00:02:14.740> to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
help and that's just applying o rings to

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.860 
help and that's just applying o rings to
the<00:02:15.040> skids<00:02:15.490> to<00:02:16.240> give<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.540> little<00:02:16.690> more

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
the skids to give it a little more

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.040 
the skids to give it a little more
traction<00:02:17.320> on<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.650> surf

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
traction on the surf

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.050 
traction on the surf
and<00:02:18.740> we<00:02:18.860> saw<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.040> heads<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.430> skid<00:02:19.610> kits<00:02:19.880> that

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
and we saw a heads and skid kits that

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.650 
and we saw a heads and skid kits that
cover<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:21.250> now<00:02:22.250> if<00:02:22.610> you're<00:02:22.850> into<00:02:23.420> really

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
cover that now if you're into really

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.200 
cover that now if you're into really
hardcore<00:02:24.050> 3d<00:02:24.710> flying<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.700> might<00:02:25.910> want<00:02:26.120> to

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
hardcore 3d flying you might want to

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.720 
hardcore 3d flying you might want to
think<00:02:26.360> about<00:02:26.570> upgrading<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.860> dampeners<00:02:28.520> in

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
think about upgrading the dampeners in

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.150 
think about upgrading the dampeners in
your<00:02:28.850> head<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.330> that's<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.500> piece<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.830> rubber

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
your head and that's the piece of rubber

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.290 
your head and that's the piece of rubber
that<00:02:31.280> sits<00:02:31.760> on<00:02:32.030> your<00:02:32.270> feathering<00:02:32.750> shaft<00:02:32.780> and

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
that sits on your feathering shaft and

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.000 
that sits on your feathering shaft and
allows<00:02:35.300> for<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.570> little<00:02:35.900> bit<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.350> cushion<00:02:36.590> so

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
allows for a little bit of cushion so

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.710 
allows for a little bit of cushion so
then<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.310> feathering<00:02:37.790> shaft<00:02:37.820> moves<00:02:38.330> is<00:02:38.540> not

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
then that feathering shaft moves is not

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.690 
then that feathering shaft moves is not
absolutely<00:02:39.590> throwing<00:02:39.980> your<00:02:40.130> helicopter

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
absolutely throwing your helicopter

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.420 
absolutely throwing your helicopter
around<00:02:41.020> but<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.170> stiffer<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.560> dampener<00:02:43.040> the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
around but the stiffer the dampener the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.070 
around but the stiffer the dampener the
more<00:02:43.610> response<00:02:43.970> are<00:02:44.120> going<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.390> get<00:02:44.570> I<00:02:44.780> don't

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
more response are going to get I don't

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.580 
more response are going to get I don't
recommend<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:45.860> for<00:02:45.920> beginners<00:02:47.320> it's<00:02:48.320> kind

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
recommend this for beginners it's kind

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.680 
recommend this for beginners it's kind
of<00:02:48.740> like<00:02:48.800> if<00:02:49.130> you're<00:02:49.340> if<00:02:49.760> you're<00:02:49.910> skiing<00:02:50.270> if

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
you get on really really advanced skis

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.770 
you get on really really advanced skis
like<00:02:52.220> racing<00:02:52.700> skis<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.150> start<00:02:53.420> out<00:02:53.600> you're

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
like racing skis to start out you're

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.030 
like racing skis to start out you're
gonna<00:02:53.900> have<00:02:54.050> a<00:02:54.080> problem<00:02:54.230> because<00:02:54.680> every

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
gonna have a problem because every

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.380 
gonna have a problem because every
movement<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.520> make<00:02:55.550> is<00:02:55.880> going<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.120> translate

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
movement you make is going to translate

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.270 
movement you make is going to translate
into<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.720> turn<00:02:56.990> you<00:02:57.770> want<00:02:57.920> something<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.250> little

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
into a turn you want something a little

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.220 
into a turn you want something a little
more<00:02:58.430> forgiving<00:02:58.940> same<00:02:59.390> with<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.660> helicopters

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
more forgiving same with the helicopters

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.920 
more forgiving same with the helicopters
but<00:03:00.560> if<00:03:01.190> you're<00:03:01.340> into<00:03:01.580> 3d<00:03:01.910> flying<00:03:02.210> you<00:03:02.450> really

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
but if you're into 3d flying you really

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.360 
but if you're into 3d flying you really
want<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.200> get<00:03:03.320> that<00:03:03.410> helicopter<00:03:03.650> torquing

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
want to get that helicopter torquing

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.520 
want to get that helicopter torquing
around<00:03:04.670> getting<00:03:05.600> the<00:03:05.720> kit<00:03:05.930> with<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.260> stiffer

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
around getting the kit with the stiffer

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.840 
around getting the kit with the stiffer
dampers<00:03:07.010> in<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.280> can<00:03:07.490> make<00:03:07.580> quite<00:03:07.790> a

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
dampers in it can make quite a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.260 
dampers in it can make quite a
difference<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.600> can<00:03:08.660> really<00:03:09.500> help<00:03:09.710> being

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
difference it can really help being

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:17.470 
difference it can really help being
performance<00:03:11.270> there

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480
