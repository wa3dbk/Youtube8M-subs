00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
figured that coming in whether what no

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.930 
figured that coming in whether what no
matter<00:00:34.829> who<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> quarterback<00:00:35.219> was<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.820> were

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
matter who the quarterback was we were

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.729 
matter who the quarterback was we were
going<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.420> bring<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.960> safeties<00:00:37.320> down<00:00:37.500> low<00:00:37.710> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
going to bring the safeties down low and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.430 
going to bring the safeties down low and
bring<00:00:38.340> some<00:00:38.460> pressure<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.090> play<00:00:39.780> cover<00:00:40.050> zero

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
bring some pressure and play cover zero

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.720 
bring some pressure and play cover zero
and<00:00:40.649> see<00:00:40.800> if<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.070> pitch<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.309> catch<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.610> little

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
and see if we can pitch a catch a little

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.299 
and see if we can pitch a catch a little
bit<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.329> thought<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.140> first<00:00:43.649> touchdown<00:00:43.950> he

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
bit so I thought the first touchdown he

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.090 
bit so I thought the first touchdown he
was<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.879> Nate<00:00:45.620> it'll<00:00:46.620> kind<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.950> gave

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
was the one to Nate it'll kind of gave

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.440 
was the one to Nate it'll kind of gave
him<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> little<00:00:47.430> bit<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.579> confidence<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.210> open

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
him a little bit of confidence and open

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.299 
him a little bit of confidence and open
things<00:00:48.660> up<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.930> little<00:00:49.050> bit<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.500> then<00:00:49.590> in

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
things up a little bit and then in

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.130 
things up a little bit and then in
