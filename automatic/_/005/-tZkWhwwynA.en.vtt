00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.330
 the 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.320
 which 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.249
 Frankfurt dpa-afx 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.169
 Hello and welcome dear viewers my name is Martin Brodeur 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:14.259
 the photographer of today I want to win you one he wants 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.960
 an objective to introduce him that is 300 of Siegmar 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.449
 why that is so objective Pellegrini I want you to the following 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.319
 agreed to show nations 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.319
 Just look what focal length range is covered 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:30.360
 that will show who the 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.270
 covers the most used focal length range ever in the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.460
 Photography off 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.700
 So it's a perfect all-rounder 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.260
 and bow Audi puts folder and capability is particularly important 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.360
 is of course in travel photography 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.990
 all the travel 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.010
 the we are that you can not thilo way to carry the crib around with you 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.670
 You need compactness and little weight 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.670
 Inaccurate this unites this lens perfectly 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.400
 exactly these advantages so the poetry should and the focal length area that 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.680
 Naturally, for example, nature needs landscape photography "Where 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.240
 objectively it too is used on 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.740
 all these features he gets for less than 200 euros and this 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.799
 resulting value for money easy 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.570
 unbeatable 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.100
 Of course there is also an unconfirmed Erkel four to five times 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.190
 six if you wanted more then Sigma does 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.300
 It looks like that in the professional class and is of course more with more 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.660
 Weight and more glass connected so it happened 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.320
 this was also determined in a second version with the ending 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.680
 Speaking of Mathias Apropos 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.460
 that's just to make it very brief 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.200
 a technical extension of the lens gross error driving errors too 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.300
 avoid that so small in the lens is in there in the lens so the 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.860
 visually a little more valuable version though 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.480
 the Nau the same advantages as the Blom Ahlen 70 300 objectively 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.080
 a tip many photographers may think at 70 to 300 millimeters 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.430
 focal length 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.730
 any distant objects would be attracted to it 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.409
 catch up with such cover 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.719
 however, that has objective 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.409
 Macro mode 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.989
 this macro mode I can easily switch on does not measure lays 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.989
 still a very small switch around and then get up to one 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.950
 Image scale from 1 to 2 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.899
 that means I can get very small things really big on the picture 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:28.059
 I often ask Inverto how to do that in portrait photography 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:30.189
 beautiful blur gradients get done 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.400
 Of course, there are also special objective for this, however, such 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.029
 Objective is wonderful and it was just you have this number wants eMeter 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:43.099
 Take advantage of focal length and your Port Red cut pretty tight then he gets 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.159
 also with the drivers or through the buxom millimeter focal length 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.439
 in a difficult course 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.860
 It is important that they open as possible who does not work it does not have to 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.329
 It may also be the 7 1 or 8 at the end of 5 6 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.469
 particularly low pass to all sensor size only and to all common 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.989
 Chamber elections would have 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.999
 that he is from me and that was a nice day 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.229
 CEO 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:07.529
 dpa 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:09.909
 so
