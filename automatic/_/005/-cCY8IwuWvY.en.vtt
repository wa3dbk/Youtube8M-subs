00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.350
 for this christmas decoration I left 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.630
 on a very natural atmosphere 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.150
 with black and white 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.039
 I made an advent calendar so 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.050
 I used pouches when he did 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.080
 it is done with tracing paper 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.950
 and that we can actually go to the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.840
 machine husband we left on vonn already 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.000
 candles with a black and white ribbon 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.440
 to remind all the decor in the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.770
 range years of which 6 guarantees me totally 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.600
 made by hand so it's the same we are 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.030
 party on black and white paper and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.170
 glitter still like you have one 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.539
 little everywhere for the fir tree it's all a 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.160
 some kia are simple we do not have to 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.590
 pass a ball and after wooden 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.680
 natural and blues that are 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.150
 normally in fact all this white 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.020
 is con to bombay 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.600
 with bombs either the white gold of the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.640
 black and we hang them with a 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.270
 sticker that resist well for 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.950
 avoid hecatomb 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.450
 we know that gift packages are 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.470
 always enough breaks feet to do for 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.480
 I know I find you 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.780
 always with little tape and paper 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.480
 everywhere so the super technique 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.240
 simple super easy super fast it's 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.370
 in fact we check everything simple we can 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.780
 buy and of course sooner and 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.220
 passion by it's always good to have 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.320

 chosen and I say gifts with the wto is 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.100
