okay so we got a manual seem to be
inside<00:02:27.310> menu<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:29.200> it's<00:02:29.320> only<00:02:29.500> one<00:02:29.770> language

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
inside menu and it's only one language

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.400 
inside menu and it's only one language
so<00:02:30.430> that's<00:02:30.550> that's<00:02:30.970> fine<00:02:31.540> that's<00:02:31.720> actually

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
so that's that's fine that's actually

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.770 
so that's that's fine that's actually
quite<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.620> thick<00:02:32.950> manual<00:02:33.490> put<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.970> motherboard

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
quite a thick manual put a motherboard

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.870 
quite a thick manual put a motherboard
it's<00:02:35.200> only<00:02:35.380> one<00:02:35.650> language<00:02:35.860> then<00:02:36.460> you've<00:02:36.640> got

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
it's only one language then you've got

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.240 
it's only one language then you've got
the<00:02:37.060> input-output<00:02:37.990> editors<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:41.100> suppose<00:02:42.100> that

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
the input-output editors I suppose that

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.030 
the input-output editors I suppose that
would<00:02:42.430> just<00:02:42.580> be<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:43.000> driver<00:02:43.690> CD<00:02:44.140> ROM<00:02:44.470> it's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
would just be the driver CD ROM it's

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.710 
would just be the driver CD ROM it's
probably<00:02:45.370> it's<00:02:45.430> best<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.790> look<00:02:46.210> online<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.570> see

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
probably it's best to look online to see

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.400 
probably it's best to look online to see
there<00:02:47.050> are<00:02:47.200> only<00:02:47.680> two<00:02:47.980> drivers<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:50.020> then<00:02:50.230> a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
there are only two drivers and then a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.490 
there are only two drivers and then a
guide<00:02:50.770> looking<00:02:51.220> French<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:52.540> like<00:02:53.080> oh<00:02:53.200> there

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
guide looking French and like oh there

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.140 
guide looking French and like oh there
we<00:02:53.620> got<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:53.860> multilingual<00:02:54.310> installation

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
we got the multilingual installation

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.800 
we got the multilingual installation
guide<00:02:55.390> book<00:02:56.100> there's<00:02:57.100> some<00:02:57.430> starter<00:02:58.360> cables

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
guide book there's some starter cables

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.100 
guide book there's some starter cables
that<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.710> actually<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:01.330> looks<00:03:01.570> like<00:03:01.780> four<00:03:02.020> of

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
that is actually and looks like four of

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:51.840 
that is actually and looks like four of
them<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.500> one<00:03:02.890> one<00:03:03.460> has<00:03:03.670> an<00:03:03.880> album<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.690> that's

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.930 

okay<00:03:52.850> so<00:03:52.910> it's<00:03:53.270> not<00:03:53.890> unlike<00:03:54.890> another<00:03:55.250> model

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
okay so it's not unlike another model

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.090 
okay so it's not unlike another model
what<00:03:56.090> I've<00:03:56.270> seen<00:03:56.569> I've<00:03:57.230> never<00:03:57.290> had<00:03:57.860> the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
what I've seen I've never had the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.940 
what I've seen I've never had the
opportunity<00:03:59.000> to<00:03:59.750> install<00:03:59.930> Intel<00:04:00.530> processor

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
opportunity to install Intel processor

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.729 
opportunity to install Intel processor
so<00:04:01.520> that<00:04:01.820> processor<00:04:02.600> area<00:04:02.930> does<00:04:03.110> look<00:04:03.709> a

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
so that processor area does look a

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.520 
so that processor area does look a
little<00:04:04.100> bit<00:04:04.280> unfamiliar<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.239> me<00:04:05.420> I've<00:04:06.320> seen

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
little bit unfamiliar to me I've seen

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.340 
little bit unfamiliar to me I've seen
some<00:04:06.800> YouTube<00:04:07.310> videos<00:04:07.340> on<00:04:08.150> how<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:08.360> install<00:04:08.540> an

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
some YouTube videos on how to install an

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.740 
some YouTube videos on how to install an
Intel<00:04:09.769> processor<00:04:09.950> so<00:04:10.519> that<00:04:10.730> should<00:04:10.940> be<00:04:11.120> fine

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
Intel processor so that should be fine

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.620 
Intel processor so that should be fine
this<00:04:12.080> does<00:04:12.350> support<00:04:12.769> a<00:04:13.010> AMD<00:04:13.940> crossfire<00:04:14.360> so

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
this does support a AMD crossfire so

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.199 
this does support a AMD crossfire so
you've<00:04:14.750> got<00:04:14.900> two<00:04:15.430> PCI<00:04:16.430> Express<00:04:17.410> 3.0<00:04:18.850> and<00:04:19.850> slots

just normal PCI ports there and you've

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.050 
just normal PCI ports there and you've
just<00:04:29.120> got<00:04:29.480> the<00:04:29.570> mini<00:04:29.750> pcie<00:04:30.710> express<00:04:31.060> supports

seems<00:04:50.270> to<00:04:50.419> be<00:04:50.570> a<00:04:50.950> bore<00:04:51.950> USB<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:53.479> Zen<00:04:53.870> I<00:04:54.140> think

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
seems to be a bore USB to Zen I think

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.820 
seems to be a bore USB to Zen I think
not<00:04:55.460> sorry<00:04:55.729> for<00:04:55.880> USB<00:04:56.540> threes<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.200> just<00:04:57.590> two

not sorry for USB threes and just two
USB<00:04:58.460> twos<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.870> a<00:04:59.930> PS<00:05:00.530> I<00:05:00.800> think<00:05:01.490> it's<00:05:01.760> called

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
USB twos and a PS I think it's called

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.320 
USB twos and a PS I think it's called
ps2<00:05:02.660> which<00:05:03.380> is<00:05:03.470> just<00:05:03.680> this<00:05:03.830> one<00:05:04.040> here<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:05.210> if

ps2 which is just this one here and if
you<00:05:05.419> can<00:05:05.570> just<00:05:05.600> about<00:05:06.080> see<00:05:06.140> you<00:05:06.410> there<00:05:06.620> so

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
you can just about see you there so

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.890 
you can just about see you there so
you've<00:05:07.430> got<00:05:07.550> an<00:05:07.640> old-style<00:05:07.940> combination

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
you've got an old-style combination

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.960 
you've got an old-style combination
mouse<00:05:09.140> and<00:05:09.440> keyboard<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:10.460> then<00:05:10.580> you<00:05:10.669> just<00:05:10.850> got

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
mouse and keyboard and then you just got

your audio HDMI DVI and d-sub nothing
else<00:05:17.060> I<00:05:17.210> can<00:05:17.270> see<00:05:17.830> of<00:05:18.830> any<00:05:19.310> other<00:05:20.860> importance

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
else I can see of any other importance

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.140 
else I can see of any other importance
you've<00:05:23.120> got<00:05:23.330> six<00:05:23.810> SR<00:05:24.410> Turkish<00:05:25.310> outer<00:05:25.520> six

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
you've got six SR Turkish outer six

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.540 
you've got six SR Turkish outer six
connections<00:05:26.600> at<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.229> back<00:05:27.470> and<00:05:28.370> that's

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
connections at the back and that's

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.159 
connections at the back and that's
pretty<00:05:28.700> much<00:05:28.910> it<00:05:29.120> it's<00:05:29.330> a<00:05:29.479> pretty<00:05:29.930> neat

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
pretty much it it's a pretty neat

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.860 
pretty much it it's a pretty neat
earlier<00:05:31.060> but<00:05:32.060> of<00:05:32.180> what<00:05:32.360> it<00:05:32.510> cost

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
earlier but of what it cost

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.279 
earlier but of what it cost
81<00:05:33.440> pounds<00:05:33.710> so<00:05:34.010> it's<00:05:34.130> not<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.370> most<00:05:34.400> expensive

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
81 pounds so it's not the most expensive

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.860 
81 pounds so it's not the most expensive
and

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
and
