00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.620
 really really to say that and 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.850
 You can do that with that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.270
 can then transport here 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.590
 things for example, and then 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.000

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.579
 possibility to go for example in 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.070
 The cave is and many raw materials 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.230

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.360
 actually pretty good and helpful 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.650
 if I can anyway and yes then 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.330
 you just click on it again 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.700
 and can you the things when needed 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.500
 then get out again now I show 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.320
 you first how to backpack this 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.170
 at all the moth 1.4 crafted point 7 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.290
 Here we see it with eight leather 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.540
 yes eight leather strong one and 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.829

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.720
 so then you have a backpack and you 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.890
 For example, here is the orange 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.070
 so that you end up better 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.090
 can distinguish or eg blue and 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.049
 Of course you can just do that 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.250
 backpack clean and then just like that 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.579
 Actually, that does not really matter 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.880

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.219

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.230
 namely the mods blocked reminds us 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.480
 It has to be used , so to speak 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.109

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.829
 clean again 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.500
 that takes a bit longer though 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:07.940
 let thunderstorms sound ok and yes 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.710

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.660
 we are almost done that 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.790
