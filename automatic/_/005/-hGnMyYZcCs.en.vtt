 Let's do a little 

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:11.019
 villarreal and one 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.469
 as useful 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.469

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.579
 desktop pc 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.710
 there we do have 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.210
 a device 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.640
 these practices 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.409
 interconnect 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:32.530
 the computer 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.530
 from the model 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.410
 companies 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.240
 allow me 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.240
 the power 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.410
 smith in power 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.740
 use 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.260
 the sony ericsson 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.560
 as a remote control for you 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.780
 on the other hand 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.160
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.430
 in this particular model 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.990
 S.I.G 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.710
 we go to the grain 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.030
 in the entertainment section 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.530
 we see that one of the options 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.970
 is the remote control and I speak tuzo 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.700
 until we select 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.490
 and it tells us if we want efe 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.280
 use it against the promoter a presentation of 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.050
 theoretically powerpoint 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.890
 If we want it, what we want to do is 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.280
 the remote control of edet windows media player or if we want to control 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.550
 remotely the writer 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.890
 let's do a test with the described remote control 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.900
 we explain on the desktop remote 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.110
 and it does not come out 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.110
 percent the combination 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.070
 we allow for access 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.070
 we allow access 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.670
