00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
dirt dust and snow as well so this hard

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.429 
dirt dust and snow as well so this hard
acrylic<00:01:44.520> plastic<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.210> clear<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.990> looks<00:01:46.229> good

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
acrylic plastic is clear it looks good

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.569 
acrylic plastic is clear it looks good
but<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> little<00:01:46.860> bit<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> slippery

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
but it's a little bit on the slippery

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.940 
but it's a little bit on the slippery
side<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.780> does<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> built-in<00:01:49.680> screen

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950

shield<00:01:50.280> which<00:01:50.610> I'll<00:01:51.180> say<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
shield which I'll say is one of the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.749 
shield which I'll say is one of the
better<00:01:52.380> ones<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.829> I've<00:01:52.950> used<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.430> any

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
better ones that I've used for any

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.240 
better ones that I've used for any
waterproof<00:01:54.329> case<00:01:54.570> especially<00:01:55.560> against<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
waterproof case especially against the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.280 
waterproof case especially against the
lifeproof<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.360> performs<00:01:58.079> much

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
lifeproof it just is performs much

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.410 
lifeproof it just is performs much
better<00:01:58.320> than<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> lifeproof<00:01:59.219> ray<00:01:59.670> which<00:02:00.240> has

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
better than the lifeproof ray which has

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.480 
better than the lifeproof ray which has
that<00:02:00.630> screen<00:02:00.930> shield<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.439> fortunate<00:02:02.189> leaves

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
that screen shield that fortunate leaves

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.600 
that screen shield that fortunate leaves
like<00:02:02.670> air<00:02:02.880> inside<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.259> kind<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.040> has<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> gap

like I said underwater and they came out

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.339 
like I said underwater and they came out
beautifully<00:03:20.090> when<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:20.959> comes<00:03:21.139> time<00:03:21.319> to

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
beautifully when it comes time to

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.650 
beautifully when it comes time to
charging<00:03:21.919> it<00:03:22.040> has<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.190> little<00:03:22.489> nap<00:03:22.940> chair<00:03:23.419> that

charging it has a little nap chair that

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.900 
charging it has a little nap chair that
you<00:03:23.780> flip<00:03:24.379> open<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.859> put<00:03:25.010> your<00:03:25.099> charger<00:03:25.310> inside

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
of course this won't work with like

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.860 
of course this won't work with like
bigger<00:03:28.250> aftermarket<00:03:29.060> chargers<00:03:29.449> you're

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
bigger aftermarket chargers you're

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.819 
bigger aftermarket chargers you're
definitely<00:03:30.019> going<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.349> want<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.560> stick<00:03:30.769> with

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
definitely going to want to stick with

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.390 
definitely going to want to stick with
the<00:03:31.690> Apple<00:03:32.690> one<00:03:32.900> that<00:03:33.109> comes<00:03:33.260> included<00:03:33.470> so

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
the Apple one that comes included so

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.729 
the Apple one that comes included so
putting<00:03:34.849> this<00:03:35.000> case<00:03:35.209> on<00:03:35.419> it<00:03:35.599> has<00:03:35.720> two<00:03:36.079> latches

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
putting this case on it has two latches

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.069 
putting this case on it has two latches
here<00:03:36.980> one<00:03:37.549> on<00:03:37.669> either<00:03:37.790> side<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.480> open<00:03:38.989> it

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
here one on either side so you open it

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.250 
here one on either side so you open it
up<00:03:39.199> like<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:39.799> and<00:03:40.040> then<00:03:40.699> like<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.359> and<00:03:42.109> this

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
up like that and then like that and this

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.869 
up like that and then like that and this
is<00:03:42.440> how<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:42.560> open<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:43.069> case<00:03:43.250> up<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.519> get<00:03:43.790> it

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
is how you open the case up to get it

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.000 
is how you open the case up to get it
when<00:03:44.000> it's<00:03:44.120> time<00:03:44.449> to<00:03:44.660> put<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.410> on<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.769> then<00:03:45.829> you

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
when it's time to put it on and then you

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.800 
when it's time to put it on and then you
remove<00:03:46.250> this<00:03:46.459> back<00:03:46.699> now<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.359> trick<00:03:47.629> is<00:03:47.660> to

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
remove this back now the trick is to

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.140 
remove this back now the trick is to
hold<00:03:48.139> it<00:03:48.319> from<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.560> bottom<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.549> top<00:03:49.579> not

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
hold it from the bottom and the top not

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.030 
hold it from the bottom and the top not
from<00:03:50.419> the<00:03:50.569> sides<00:03:50.840> when<00:03:51.410> you<00:03:51.500> go<00:03:51.590> to<00:03:51.650> pull<00:03:51.889> this

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
from the sides when you go to pull this

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.129 
from the sides when you go to pull this
piece<00:03:52.280> off<00:03:52.519> but<00:03:52.819> essentially<00:03:53.419> you<00:03:53.629> just<00:03:53.810> pull

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
piece off but essentially you just pull

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.819 
piece off but essentially you just pull
until<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:54.919> comes<00:03:55.220> apart<00:03:55.370> like<00:03:55.699> so<00:03:56.379> totally<00:03:57.379> dry

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
until it comes apart like so totally dry

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.490 
until it comes apart like so totally dry
and<00:03:57.980> arrogant<00:03:58.310> I've<00:03:58.370> had<00:03:58.549> it<00:03:58.669> in<00:03:58.790> here<00:03:59.000> all<00:03:59.150> day

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
and arrogant I've had it in here all day

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.960 
and arrogant I've had it in here all day
underwater<00:04:00.500> so<00:04:00.829> there's<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.220> back<00:04:01.370> piece<00:04:01.639> and

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
underwater so there's the back piece and

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.240 
underwater so there's the back piece and
then<00:04:02.060> front<00:04:02.959> piece<00:04:03.139> kind<00:04:03.470> of<00:04:03.590> I<00:04:03.739> just<00:04:03.919> pop<00:04:04.099> out

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
then front piece kind of I just pop out

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.920 
then front piece kind of I just pop out
of<00:04:04.310> my<00:04:04.430> phone<00:04:04.699> like<00:04:04.909> that<00:04:04.940> so<00:04:05.599> you<00:04:05.690> can<00:04:05.810> get<00:04:05.900> a
