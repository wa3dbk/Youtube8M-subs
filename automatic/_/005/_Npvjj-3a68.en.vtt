00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
imagine for a really long time and just

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.270

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
ago I've really started to shift my

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.780 
ago I've really started to shift my
attitude<00:02:20.350> about<00:02:20.470> everything<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.130> I'm<00:02:21.220> not<00:02:21.400> as

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
attitude about everything and I'm not as

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.690 
attitude about everything and I'm not as
sad<00:02:22.750> as<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.500> used<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:23.830> be<00:02:23.980> I'm<00:02:24.130> dealing<00:02:24.460> with<00:02:24.490> it

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
sad as I used to be I'm dealing with it

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.470 
sad as I used to be I'm dealing with it
a<00:02:24.760> lot<00:02:24.910> better<00:02:25.000> now

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
a lot better now

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.270 
a lot better now
and<00:02:25.690> I'm<00:02:25.750> not<00:02:25.930> sure<00:02:26.080> if<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.320> sadness<00:02:26.860> ever

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
and I'm not sure if that sadness ever

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.710 
and I'm not sure if that sadness ever
showed<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.700> my<00:02:27.790> videos<00:02:28.090> which<00:02:28.270> I<00:02:28.390> hope<00:02:28.450> it

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
showed to my videos which I hope it

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.850 
showed to my videos which I hope it
didn't<00:02:28.900> because<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.110> was<00:02:29.320> never<00:02:29.530> that's

didn't because that was never that's
obviously<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.400> exact<00:02:30.700> opposite<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.180> what<00:02:31.240> I'd
