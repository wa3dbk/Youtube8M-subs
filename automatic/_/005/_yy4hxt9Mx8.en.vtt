close-ups here we see the UFO it's a
definite<00:00:26.580> saucer<00:00:27.060> shape<00:00:27.330> what<00:00:28.140> I'd<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.410> to

definite saucer shape what I'd like to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.990 
definite saucer shape what I'd like to
point<00:00:28.769> out<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.310> video<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:32.000> color

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
point out in this video is the color

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.959 
point out in this video is the color
changes<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.130> appears<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.790> has

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
changes and see it appears that it has

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.160 
changes and see it appears that it has
lights<00:00:36.590> that<00:00:37.590> move<00:00:37.950> around<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:39.480> goes<00:00:39.780> from

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
lights that move around it and goes from

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
lights that move around it and goes from
silver<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.250> green<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.750> red<00:00:43.050> we've<00:00:43.980> got

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
silver to a green to the red we've got

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.170 
silver to a green to the red we've got
it<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.460> slo-mo<00:00:44.969> right<00:00:45.329> now<00:00:45.680> where<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:47.180> get

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
it in slo-mo right now where you can get

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.959 
it in slo-mo right now where you can get
a<00:00:48.239> pretty<00:00:48.510> good<00:00:48.660> view<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.950> object<00:00:51.739> at

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
a pretty good view of the the object at

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.760 
a pretty good view of the the object at
various<00:00:53.969> times<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.870> will<00:00:55.020> see<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.590> looks

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
various times you will see what looks

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.670 
various times you will see what looks
like<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.250> maybe<00:00:56.489> should<00:00:56.940> enough<00:00:57.500> sparks<00:00:58.500> are

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
like it's maybe should enough sparks are

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.240 
like it's maybe should enough sparks are
maybe<00:00:58.890> possibly<00:00:59.520> plasma<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:01.770> you'll<00:01:02.070> just

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
maybe possibly plasma and you'll just

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.820 
maybe possibly plasma and you'll just
have<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.550> kind<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.789> keep<00:01:02.910> an<00:01:03.059> eye<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.629> at<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
have to kind of keep an eye on it at the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.020 
have to kind of keep an eye on it at the
end<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:06.530> slo-mo<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:08.189> catch<00:01:08.670> one

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
end of the slo-mo here we catch one

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.520 
end of the slo-mo here we catch one
frame<00:01:09.510> where<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:12.049> what<00:01:13.049> whatever<00:01:13.380> it

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
frame where you can see what whatever it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.590 
frame where you can see what whatever it
is<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.920> shooting<00:01:14.250> up<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.909> appears<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
is is shooting up but if it appears to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.020 
is is shooting up but if it appears to
be<00:01:16.490> maybe<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.610> small<00:01:18.210> orb<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
be maybe a small orb and and in the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.550 
be maybe a small orb and and in the
freeze<00:01:21.270> frame<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:21.990> coming<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.409> in

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
freeze frame and that's coming up in

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.830 
freeze frame and that's coming up in
here<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.189> second<00:01:23.670> there<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:26.840> it's

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
here in just a second there it is it's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
here in just a second there it is it's
really<00:01:27.990> hard<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.829> catch<00:01:29.070> one<00:01:29.430> do<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.729> when<00:01:30.000> you

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
really hard to catch one do it when you

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.859 
really hard to catch one do it when you
watch<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.600> video<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:32.610> full<00:01:33.150> motion<00:01:33.420> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
watch the video in and a full motion and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.319 
watch the video in and a full motion and
look<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.650> do<00:01:34.860> have<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.250> full<00:01:35.520> video<00:01:35.820> on

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
look we do have the full video on

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
look we do have the full video on
youtube<00:01:36.900> if<00:01:37.560> you'd<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.100> watch<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.610> full

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
youtube if you'd like to watch the full

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.020 
youtube if you'd like to watch the full
video<00:01:39.060> right<00:01:39.600> there<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.640> off

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
video right there you can see that off

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.719 
video right there you can see that off
the<00:01:42.450> bottom<00:01:42.930> left<00:01:43.500> edge<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.189> appeared<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.640> be

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the bottom left edge it appeared to be

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.090 
the bottom left edge it appeared to be
shooting<00:01:45.360> up<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.479> sparks<00:01:46.020> again<00:01:46.320> there's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
shooting up the sparks again there's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.999 
shooting up the sparks again there's
where<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:47.579> going<00:01:47.850> into<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.119> deep<00:01:48.509> red<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.409> it

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
where it's going into a deep red and it

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.399 
where it's going into a deep red and it
seemed<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.490> do<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.729> deep<00:01:51.149> red<00:01:51.540> when<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.200> would

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
seemed to do the deep red when it would

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.800 
seemed to do the deep red when it would
flip<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.100> did<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.430> many<00:01:53.820> times<00:01:54.180> as<00:01:54.509> it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
flip and it did this many times as it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.639 
flip and it did this many times as it
moved<00:01:55.020> across<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.380> sky<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:57.450> total<00:01:58.229> sighting

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
moved across the sky the total sighting

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.069 
moved across the sky the total sighting
was<00:01:58.799> four<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.280> five<00:01:59.549> minutes<00:02:00.409> so<00:02:02.240> we<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.869> had

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
was four to five minutes so we we had

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.130 
was four to five minutes so we we had
time<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:05.030> get<00:02:06.030> pretty<00:02:06.270> good<00:02:06.479> video<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.990> this

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
time to get pretty good video of this

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.930 
time to get pretty good video of this
object<00:02:07.710> because<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.979> was<00:02:08.099> pretty<00:02:08.310> close<00:02:08.670> it

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
object because it was pretty close it

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.760 
object because it was pretty close it
was<00:02:09.060> very<00:02:09.479> low<00:02:11.000> like<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.030> say

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
was very low like I say

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.710 
was very low like I say
it<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:14.030> did<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:14.630> lot<00:02:14.960> of<00:02:14.990> erratic<00:02:15.500> movements<00:02:16.190> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
it it did a lot of erratic movements the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.130 
it it did a lot of erratic movements the
turning<00:02:17.720> flipping<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:19.270> think<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.390> shows<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:21.020> lot

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
turning flipping I think it shows a lot

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.970 
turning flipping I think it shows a lot
of<00:02:21.620> maneuverability<00:02:23.380> whatever<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:24.590> craft

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
of maneuverability whatever this craft

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.610 
of maneuverability whatever this craft
is<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.640> like<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.000> said<00:02:26.210> it<00:02:26.480> in<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.170> video<00:02:27.470> you

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
is and like I said it in the video you

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.680 
is and like I said it in the video you
you<00:02:28.220> can<00:02:28.400> see<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.910> appears<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.540> be
