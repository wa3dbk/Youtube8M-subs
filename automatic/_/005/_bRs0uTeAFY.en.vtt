ground<00:00:09.379> reaction<00:00:09.620> force<00:00:09.980> is<00:00:10.160> one<00:00:10.339> of<00:00:10.400> the

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
ground reaction force is one of the

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.100 
ground reaction force is one of the
finding<00:00:10.879> characteristics<00:00:11.570> and<00:00:11.719> athletic

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
finding characteristics and athletic

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.129 
finding characteristics and athletic
performance<00:00:12.969> what<00:00:13.969> it<00:00:14.059> implies<00:00:14.450> is<00:00:14.480> that<00:00:14.839> when

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
performance what it implies is that when

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.170 
performance what it implies is that when
I'm<00:00:15.230> standing<00:00:15.679> here<00:00:15.949> and<00:00:16.100> exerting<00:00:16.730> force<00:00:17.030> on

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
I'm standing here and exerting force on

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.210 
I'm standing here and exerting force on
the<00:00:17.300> ground<00:00:17.540> the<00:00:17.960> ground<00:00:17.990> exerts<00:00:18.680> an<00:00:18.860> equal

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
the ground the ground exerts an equal

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.950 
the ground the ground exerts an equal
and<00:00:19.340> opposite<00:00:19.700> force<00:00:19.760> back<00:00:20.240> up<00:00:20.450> into<00:00:20.600> me<00:00:20.780> in

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
and opposite force back up into me in

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.370 
and opposite force back up into me in
this<00:00:21.350> case<00:00:21.620> it's<00:00:21.830> my<00:00:21.950> body<00:00:22.190> weight<00:00:22.870> at<00:00:23.870> Sparta

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
this case it's my body weight at Sparta

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.350 
this case it's my body weight at Sparta
we<00:00:24.500> use<00:00:24.620> the<00:00:24.740> force<00:00:25.010> plate<00:00:25.250> to<00:00:25.940> measure<00:00:26.120> how

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
we use the force plate to measure how

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.430 
we use the force plate to measure how
much<00:00:26.510> force<00:00:26.570> you're<00:00:26.990> putting<00:00:27.170> in<00:00:27.260> the<00:00:27.350> ground

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.440 
much force you're putting in the ground

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.560 
much force you're putting in the ground
in<00:00:27.740> each<00:00:27.860> different<00:00:28.190> direction<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.480> we

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
in each different direction so we

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.870 
in each different direction so we
basically<00:00:29.750> have<00:00:29.930> an<00:00:30.020> athlete<00:00:30.380> stand<00:00:31.250> here<00:00:31.580> on

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
basically have an athlete stand here on

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.330 
basically have an athlete stand here on
this<00:00:32.240> plate<00:00:32.540> doing<00:00:32.990> a<00:00:33.050> vertical<00:00:33.230> jump<00:00:33.740> during

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
this plate doing a vertical jump during

this plate doing a vertical jump during
the<00:00:34.490> lateral<00:00:34.880> jump<00:00:35.180> during<00:00:35.450> a<00:00:35.540> sprint<00:00:35.900> doing

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
the lateral jump during a sprint doing

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260 
the lateral jump during a sprint doing
an<00:00:36.320> agility<00:00:36.590> movement<00:00:37.130> any<00:00:37.790> kind<00:00:38.090> of<00:00:38.120> those

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
an agility movement any kind of those

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.290 
an agility movement any kind of those
movements<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:38.930> what<00:00:38.989> happens<00:00:39.350> is<00:00:40.060> the<00:00:41.060> graph

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
movements and what happens is the graph

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.600 
movements and what happens is the graph
is<00:00:41.570> displayed<00:00:41.989> showing<00:00:42.020> force<00:00:42.710> over<00:00:43.040> time

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.040 

this<00:00:46.610> is<00:00:46.790> a<00:00:46.820> graph<00:00:47.090> of<00:00:47.329> a<00:00:47.420> baseball<00:00:47.630> player

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
this is a graph of a baseball player

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.800 
this is a graph of a baseball player
doing<00:00:48.440> a<00:00:48.530> pitching<00:00:48.890> motion<00:00:49.070> off<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.520> plate

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
doing a pitching motion off the plate

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.900 
doing a pitching motion off the plate
what<00:00:50.810> we<00:00:50.930> can<00:00:51.079> see<00:00:51.320> it<00:00:51.500> on<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:52.100> force<00:00:52.399> is<00:00:52.730> as

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
what we can see it on the force is as

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.240 
what we can see it on the force is as
you<00:00:53.120> start<00:00:53.180> your<00:00:53.960> body<00:00:54.260> weight<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:54.770> actually

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
you start your body weight you actually

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.580 
you start your body weight you actually
get<00:00:55.910> lighter<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.600> reason<00:00:56.870> why<00:00:56.989> that<00:00:57.140> happens

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
get lighter the reason why that happens

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.520 
get lighter the reason why that happens
is<00:00:57.770> as<00:00:58.010> you're<00:00:58.610> loading<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.090> movement<00:00:59.600> and<00:00:59.750> as

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
is as you're loading the movement and as

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.139 
is as you're loading the movement and as
you<00:01:00.739> descend<00:01:01.160> down<00:01:01.460> you<00:01:01.700> actually<00:01:02.030> become

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
you descend down you actually become

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.639 
you descend down you actually become
lighter<00:01:02.600> almost<00:01:02.960> like<00:01:03.110> standing<00:01:03.500> on<00:01:03.590> a

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
lighter almost like standing on a

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.360 
lighter almost like standing on a
bathroom<00:01:04.100> scale<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:04.760> unloading<00:01:05.750> yourself

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
bathroom scale and unloading yourself

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.740 
bathroom scale and unloading yourself
now<00:01:07.370> as<00:01:07.520> you<00:01:07.670> still<00:01:07.940> go<00:01:08.060> down<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:08.540> graph

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
now as you still go down the graph

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.090 
now as you still go down the graph
starts<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.200> go<00:01:09.320> up<00:01:09.350> because<00:01:09.830> then<00:01:09.979> you're

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
starts to go up because then you're

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.500 
starts to go up because then you're
starting<00:01:10.370> to<00:01:10.430> press<00:01:10.700> more<00:01:11.000> into<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.299> ground

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
starting to press more into the ground

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.789 
starting to press more into the ground
you're<00:01:11.690> starting<00:01:11.960> to<00:01:12.020> load<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:12.409> movement

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
you're starting to load that movement

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.860 
you're starting to load that movement
harder<00:01:13.159> all<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.790> way<00:01:13.909> up<00:01:14.030> until<00:01:14.180> it's<00:01:14.510> a<00:01:14.600> peak

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
harder all the way up until it's a peak

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.510 
harder all the way up until it's a peak
and<00:01:15.500> that's<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.830> most<00:01:16.010> force<00:01:16.340> they're

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
and that's the most force they're

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.550 
and that's the most force they're
exerting<00:01:16.790> into<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.210> ground<00:01:17.420> in<00:01:17.630> this<00:01:18.290> case

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
exerting into the ground in this case

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.969 
exerting into the ground in this case
it's<00:01:19.100> right<00:01:19.369> about<00:01:19.610> as<00:01:19.820> you<00:01:19.909> drive<00:01:20.180> out<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:20.979> as

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
it's right about as you drive out and as

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.760 
it's right about as you drive out and as
they<00:01:22.220> drive<00:01:22.520> out<00:01:22.760> this<00:01:23.119> bottoms<00:01:23.600> out<00:01:23.780> this

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
been left behind stimulus to to improve

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.850 
been left behind stimulus to to improve
horizontal<00:02:02.030> force

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.840 

so<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.069> talked<00:02:08.280> about<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.550> different

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
so we just talked about the different

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.240 
so we just talked about the different
planes<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.300> ground<00:02:09.509> reaction<00:02:09.780> force<00:02:10.250> now

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
planes of ground reaction force now

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.100 
planes of ground reaction force now
traditionally<00:02:12.000> vertical<00:02:12.660> force<00:02:12.900> has<00:02:13.080> been

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
traditionally vertical force has been

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.530 
traditionally vertical force has been
the<00:02:13.350> primary<00:02:13.590> stimulus<00:02:13.980> using<00:02:14.640> resistance

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
the primary stimulus using resistance

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.449 
the primary stimulus using resistance
exercises<00:02:16.260> such<00:02:16.440> as<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.770> Olympic<00:02:17.160> lifts

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
exercises such as of the Olympic lifts

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.790 
exercises such as of the Olympic lifts
or<00:02:17.580> squatting<00:02:17.910> now<00:02:18.870> with<00:02:18.990> horizontal<00:02:19.290> force

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
or squatting now with horizontal force

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.110 
or squatting now with horizontal force
which<00:02:20.069> we<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.370> discussed<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.940> very

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
which we just discussed is very

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.449 
which we just discussed is very
important<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:22.350> cable<00:02:22.709> weight<00:02:22.980> stack<00:02:23.280> has

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
important the cable weight stack has

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.070 
important the cable weight stack has
been<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> most<00:02:23.850> important<00:02:24.569> component<00:02:25.050> of

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
been the most important component of

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.949 
been the most important component of
that<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.470> what's<00:02:26.010> usually<00:02:26.340> used<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.300> athletes

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
that and what's usually used is athletes

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.620 
that and what's usually used is athletes
tug<00:02:28.440> on<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.770> cable<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.400> produce<00:02:29.970> horizontal

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
tug on that cable and produce horizontal

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.840 
tug on that cable and produce horizontal
force<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.050> way<00:02:31.290> what<00:02:31.920> ends<00:02:32.130> up<00:02:32.220> happening<00:02:32.280> is

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
force this way what ends up happening is

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.640 
force this way what ends up happening is
the<00:02:33.360> inertia<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.810> those<00:02:33.959> plates<00:02:34.290> make<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
the inertia of those plates make the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.680 
the inertia of those plates make the
movement<00:02:34.950> much<00:02:35.100> easier<00:02:35.489> at<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.670> end<00:02:35.880> so

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
movement much easier at the end so

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.360 
movement much easier at the end so
another<00:02:36.959> option<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> air<00:02:37.770> compression

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
another option is the air compression

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.300 
another option is the air compression
now<00:02:39.030> with<00:02:39.180> air<00:02:39.330> compression<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:41.010> actually

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
now with air compression it can actually

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.650 
now with air compression it can actually
maintain<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.850> resistance<00:02:42.360> all<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.570> way

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
maintain that resistance all the way

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.220 
maintain that resistance all the way
through<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.959> end

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
through the end

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.620 
through the end
unfortunately<00:02:44.010> there's<00:02:44.550> there<00:02:44.970> is<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.150> sealing

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
unfortunately there's there is a sealing

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.570 
unfortunately there's there is a sealing
to<00:02:45.750> them<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.260> resistance<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.250> winds

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
to them to the resistance and the winds

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.060 
to them to the resistance and the winds
up<00:02:47.670> happening<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:49.050> trunk<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.530> isolated

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
up happening is the trunk is isolated

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.710 
up happening is the trunk is isolated
much<00:02:50.190> more<00:02:50.400> than<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.550> lower<00:02:50.760> body<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.600> that

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
much more than the lower body so that

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.750 
much more than the lower body so that
stimulus<00:02:52.230> for<00:02:52.440> ground<00:02:52.680> reaction<00:02:52.980> force<00:02:53.430> isn't

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
stimulus for ground reaction force isn't

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.000 
stimulus for ground reaction force isn't
as<00:02:53.850> great<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:55.200> what<00:02:55.319> we've<00:02:55.500> been<00:02:55.590> using<00:02:55.800> at

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
as great so what we've been using at

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.320

Sparta<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.489> a<00:02:56.519> versa<00:02:56.790> pulley

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
Sparta is a versa pulley

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.750 
Sparta is a versa pulley
now<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.930> versa<00:02:58.200> pulley<00:02:58.590> works<00:02:59.040> off<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.250> totally

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
now the versa pulley works off a totally

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.090 
now the versa pulley works off a totally
new<00:02:59.910> resistance<00:03:00.450> technology<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.920> uses

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
new resistance technology it uses

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.400 
new resistance technology it uses
accommodating<00:03:02.910> resistance<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.080> harder

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
accommodating resistance so the harder

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.470 
accommodating resistance so the harder
an<00:03:04.500> athlete<00:03:04.830> pulls<00:03:05.040> on<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.430> movement<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
an athlete pulls on the movement the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.030 
an athlete pulls on the movement the
harder<00:03:06.840> resists<00:03:07.290> them

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.320 

so<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.130> just<00:03:14.280> talked<00:03:14.520> about<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.880> importance

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
so we just talked about the importance

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.180 
so we just talked about the importance
of<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.930> versa<00:03:16.260> pulley<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.650> horizontal

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
of the versa pulley in horizontal

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.400 
of the versa pulley in horizontal
movements<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:18.330> can<00:03:18.450> see<00:03:18.630> how<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.900> challenges

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
movements you can see how it challenges

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.710 
movements you can see how it challenges
that<00:03:19.530> horizontal<00:03:19.830> ground<00:03:20.280> reaction<00:03:20.670> force<00:03:21.090> to

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
that horizontal ground reaction force to

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.470 
that horizontal ground reaction force to
produce<00:03:21.930> not<00:03:22.140> only<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.380> greater<00:03:23.480> horizontal

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
produce not only a greater horizontal

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.260 
produce not only a greater horizontal
force<00:03:24.690> but<00:03:24.900> also<00:03:24.960> a<00:03:25.140> longer<00:03:25.560> force<00:03:26.490> now<00:03:27.210> the

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
force but also a longer force now the

on<00:04:02.120> this<00:04:02.240> one<00:04:02.420> we<00:04:02.510> like<00:04:02.630> to<00:04:02.660> use<00:04:02.960> the<00:04:03.530> first<00:04:03.800> is

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
on this one we like to use the first is

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.650 
on this one we like to use the first is
really<00:04:04.130> driving<00:04:04.460> off<00:04:04.730> that<00:04:04.970> front<00:04:05.240> leg<00:04:05.480> in

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
really driving off that front leg in

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.870 
really driving off that front leg in
this<00:04:05.780> case<00:04:05.990> the<00:04:06.140> right<00:04:06.350> leg<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:07.400> second<00:04:07.790> is

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
this case the right leg the second is

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.220 
this case the right leg the second is
really<00:04:08.000> trying<00:04:08.300> to<00:04:08.390> be<00:04:08.450> conscious<00:04:08.900> of<00:04:08.960> keeping

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
really trying to be conscious of keeping

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.210 
really trying to be conscious of keeping
your<00:04:09.290> chest<00:04:09.500> up<00:04:09.710> through<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.130> entire

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
your chest up through the entire

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.430 
your chest up through the entire
movement<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.990> third<00:04:12.230> is<00:04:12.410> really

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
movement and the third is really

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.380 
movement and the third is really
throwing<00:04:12.890> that<00:04:13.130> free<00:04:13.460> arm<00:04:13.670> in<00:04:13.850> this<00:04:13.970> case<00:04:14.180> the

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
throwing that free arm in this case the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.360 
throwing that free arm in this case the
right<00:04:14.570> arm<00:04:14.840> across<00:04:15.560> your<00:04:15.680> body<00:04:16.100> to<00:04:16.280> help

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
right arm across your body to help

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.090 
right arm across your body to help
finish<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:16.940> rotation<00:04:17.410> again<00:04:18.410> focusing<00:04:19.010> on

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
finish the rotation again focusing on

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.849 
finish the rotation again focusing on
the<00:04:19.160> drive<00:04:19.690> horizontally<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:21.350> resist

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
the drive horizontally and the resist

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.470 
the drive horizontally and the resist
with<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.610> left<00:04:22.850> leg<00:04:22.940> at<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.270> end

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
with the left leg at the end

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.630 
with the left leg at the end
horizontally<00:04:24.230> as<00:04:24.380> you<00:04:25.100> can<00:04:25.280> see<00:04:25.490> this

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
horizontally as you can see this

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.060 
horizontally as you can see this
movement<00:04:26.060> really<00:04:26.240> requires<00:04:26.750> a<00:04:27.080> lot<00:04:27.110> of<00:04:27.620> large

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
movement really requires a lot of large

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.880 
movement really requires a lot of large
but<00:04:28.760> prolonged<00:04:29.330> ground<00:04:29.780> reaction<00:04:30.050> force<00:04:30.560> in

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
but prolonged ground reaction force in

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:37.220 
but prolonged ground reaction force in
the<00:04:31.100> horizontal<00:04:31.490> direction

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.290
