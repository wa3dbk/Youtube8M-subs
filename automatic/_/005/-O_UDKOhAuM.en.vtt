floor<00:03:36.890> you<00:03:37.890> know<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.070> actually<00:03:38.310> think<00:03:38.700> this

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
floor you know I actually think this

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.090 
floor you know I actually think this
thing<00:03:39.090> might<00:03:39.120> be<00:03:39.480> original<00:03:40.020> because<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.860> only

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
thing might be original because it only

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.840 
thing might be original because it only
got<00:03:41.280> one<00:03:41.610> button<00:03:42.000> on<00:03:42.150> each<00:03:42.300> floor<00:03:43.640> but<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.730> did

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
got one button on each floor but it did

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.810 
got one button on each floor but it did
not<00:03:45.000> know<00:03:45.210> the<00:03:45.390> brand<00:03:46.280> I'm<00:03:47.280> assuming<00:03:47.730> this

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
not know the brand I'm assuming this

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:56.589 
not know the brand I'm assuming this
could<00:03:48.060> be<00:03:48.210> a<00:03:48.240> Staley

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:05.160 

here<00:03:57.079> we<00:03:57.230> approach<00:03:57.469> the<00:03:57.590> second<00:03:57.980> floor

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.780 

yeah<00:04:06.170> I<00:04:06.230> think<00:04:06.380> this<00:04:06.650> is<00:04:06.830> obviously<00:04:07.490> probably

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
yeah I think this is obviously probably

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:21.940 
yeah I think this is obviously probably
Stalley<00:04:18.670> that's<00:04:19.670> it
