00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.430

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.090

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.819
 auction for those prizes the auctions 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:34.690
 they are high 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:37.720
 you have to bid minimum I think ten 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.420
 or fifteen thousand points and each bag of 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.670
 taxi doritos 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.489
 catch in one of the games gives you 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.769
 only three points then you have 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.530
 that add enough points per day 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.579
 give 25 lives if I'm not wrong and these 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.060
 points what they do is that they 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:57.579
 multiply your points by several but 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.359
 as you want and if it is quite complex 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.920
 but good for people who like 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.629
 this play I think it's a good 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.480
 opportunity they will have to dedicate 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.849
 at least 30 to 60 minutes a day 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.280
 because they have to add enough points 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.200
 but it's a good opportunity to 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.659
 earn some of the prizes that they 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.239
 offer I tell them are enough and if 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.579
 if they are parents this promotion is 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.579
 ends on June 30 then they go to 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.520

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.460
 use your points 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.060

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.680
 Useful 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.630
