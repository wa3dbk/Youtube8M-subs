tweeter now that's nice because you get
the<00:01:30.090> mid<00:01:30.270> ranges<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:31.380> these<00:01:31.829> two<00:01:32.270> drivers<00:01:33.270> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the mid ranges in these two drivers and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.060 
the mid ranges in these two drivers and
then<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> tweeter<00:01:34.229> there<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.829> get<00:01:34.950> all

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
then in the tweeter there you get all

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.620 
then in the tweeter there you get all
the<00:01:35.159> high<00:01:35.310> frequencies<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.090> being<00:01:36.420> able<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the high frequencies and being able to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.999 
the high frequencies and being able to
separate<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> sound<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.680> gives<00:01:37.890> you

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
separate the sound like that gives you

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950 
separate the sound like that gives you
much<00:01:38.100> cleaner<00:01:38.490> sound<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.090> even<00:01:39.630> more

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
much cleaner sound and even more

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.719 
much cleaner sound and even more
variance<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.650> hear<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.280> know<00:01:41.310> will

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
variance so you can hear you know will

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.859 
variance so you can hear you know will
you<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:42.000> able<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.150> hear<00:01:42.360> things<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.659> lot<00:01:42.840> better

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
you be able to hear things a lot better

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.660 
you be able to hear things a lot better
you'll<00:01:43.259> if<00:01:43.710> you're<00:01:43.890> watching<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.189> forest<00:01:44.549> scene

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
you'll if you're watching a forest scene

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.859 
you'll if you're watching a forest scene
all<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> sudden<00:01:45.180> you'll<00:01:45.299> notice<00:01:45.570> things<00:01:45.689> you

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
never notice before maybe birds chirping

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.950 
never notice before maybe birds chirping
or<00:01:47.490> something<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.450> that's<00:01:48.540> nice<00:01:48.810> as

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
or something like that so that's nice as

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.330 
or something like that so that's nice as
well<00:01:49.110> they<00:01:49.530> also<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:49.860> you'll<00:01:49.950> notice<00:01:50.130> they're

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
well they also if you'll notice they're

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.609 
well they also if you'll notice they're
nice<00:01:50.490> tall<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.270> elegant<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.380> mainly

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
nice tall and elegant and it's mainly

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.080 
nice tall and elegant and it's mainly
for<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> aesthetic<00:01:53.310> value<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:53.670> also<00:01:53.820> these

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
for the aesthetic value but also these

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.670 
for the aesthetic value but also these
are<00:01:54.149> hollow<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.720> there's<00:01:55.079> an<00:01:55.200> air<00:01:55.320> hole<00:01:55.530> at

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
are hollow and there's an air hole at

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.499 
are hollow and there's an air hole at
the<00:01:55.740> bottom<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.490> helps<00:01:56.850> keep<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.329> sound

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the bottom and that helps keep the sound

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.200 
the bottom and that helps keep the sound
uniform<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.680> also<00:01:58.829> helps<00:01:59.700> keep<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.060> sound

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
uniform and it also helps keep the sound

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.910 
uniform and it also helps keep the sound
tight<00:02:00.780> that's<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.140> sometimes<00:02:01.560> you'll<00:02:01.680> notice

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
tight that's so sometimes you'll notice

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.080 
tight that's so sometimes you'll notice
speakers<00:02:02.219> they<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.490> don't<00:02:02.670> sound<00:02:02.880> right

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
speakers they just don't sound right

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.450 
speakers they just don't sound right
then<00:02:03.299> well<00:02:03.899> these<00:02:04.409> are<00:02:04.770> gonna<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.100> crystal

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
then well these are gonna be crystal

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.889 
then well these are gonna be crystal
clear<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> center<00:02:06.540> channel<00:02:06.659> that's

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
clear now the center channel that's

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.109 
clear now the center channel that's
where<00:02:07.140> all<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.710> voice<00:02:07.920> goes<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.910> has
