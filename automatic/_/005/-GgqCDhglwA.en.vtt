 that the file is called smile point 2 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.289

 sometimes mention the smile point file 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.149
 jpg because jpg is an extension of the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.579
 image according to the critic until there was 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.530

 Force images are particularly x 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.909
 where topics are discussed 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.890
 paranormal in wikipedia there is no 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.229
 reference in any post about 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.450

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.270
 the administrators of page 2 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.039
 they remove without knowing the reason and the history 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.799
 we can see that the image of style of 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.979
 got to kill someone called 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.929

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.209
 it did not seem social as if it were some 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.340
 type of animal the protagonist of the 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:01.819
 story gets from an anonymous with the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.920

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.899

 on youtube there is a supposed animation 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.730

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.250

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.660

 cause the image to create epilepsy 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.700
 normally these attacks can occur 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.069
 when there are intense and changing lights 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.170
