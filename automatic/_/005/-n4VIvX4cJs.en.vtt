00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
problem but even still it's difficult it

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.600

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
tripod grip muscles to do it I developed

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.469 
tripod grip muscles to do it I developed
my<00:02:01.119> crayons<00:02:01.600> so<00:02:01.990> that<00:02:02.670> they<00:02:03.670> had<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.119> be<00:02:04.240> picked

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
my crayons so that they had to be picked

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.570 
my crayons so that they had to be picked
up<00:02:04.690> with<00:02:04.899> a<00:02:04.960> tripod<00:02:05.470> grip<00:02:05.740> there's<00:02:06.039> almost<00:02:06.220> no

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
up with a tripod grip there's almost no

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.270 
up with a tripod grip there's almost no
other<00:02:06.909> way<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.330> use<00:02:07.569> them<00:02:08.019> I've<00:02:08.709> actually<00:02:08.890> seen

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
other way to use them I've actually seen

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.940 
other way to use them I've actually seen
a<00:02:09.340> few<00:02:09.610> children<00:02:09.970> try<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.290> use<00:02:11.620> them<00:02:11.799> like

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
a few children try and use them like

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.220 
a few children try and use them like
this<00:02:12.250> but<00:02:12.700> they<00:02:12.880> quickly<00:02:13.269> will<00:02:13.420> change<00:02:13.810> then

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
this but they quickly will change then

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.880 
this but they quickly will change then
and<00:02:14.530> pick<00:02:15.370> them<00:02:15.519> up<00:02:15.670> like<00:02:15.880> this<00:02:16.650> there<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.860> a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
and pick them up like this there is a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.270 
and pick them up like this there is a
pointy<00:02:18.340> part<00:02:18.610> there<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:19.660> an<00:02:19.780> opportunity<00:02:20.280> to

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
pointy part there is an opportunity to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.449 
pointy part there is an opportunity to
draw<00:02:21.730> lines<00:02:22.030> if<00:02:22.329> you<00:02:22.390> want<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:23.160> but<00:02:24.160> then<00:02:24.340> the

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
draw lines if you want to but then the

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.979 
draw lines if you want to but then the
