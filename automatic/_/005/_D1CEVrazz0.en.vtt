00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
pounds easily we like to cut everything

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.160 
pounds easily we like to cut everything
on<00:01:47.670> our<00:01:47.790> table<00:01:48.180> saw<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.750> if<00:01:48.899> you've<00:01:49.020> got<00:01:49.140> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
on our table saw but if you've got a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.749 
on our table saw but if you've got a
large<00:01:49.409> sheet<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.710> plywood<00:01:49.890> well<00:01:50.340> that's

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
large sheet of plywood well that's

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.880 
large sheet of plywood well that's
almost<00:01:50.909> impossible<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:52.200> what<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.470> need<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.649> do

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
almost impossible so what we need to do

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.310 
almost impossible so what we need to do
is<00:01:53.100> cut<00:01:53.460> large<00:01:53.790> sheet<00:01:54.210> goods<00:01:54.509> down<00:01:54.869> into

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
is cut large sheet goods down into

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.800 
is cut large sheet goods down into
smaller<00:01:56.009> more<00:01:56.460> manageable<00:01:56.520> size<00:01:57.180> pieces

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
smaller more manageable size pieces

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.380 
smaller more manageable size pieces
using<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.590> portable<00:01:59.070> saw<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.670> then<00:02:00.060> we<00:02:00.240> can

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
using a portable saw and then we can

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.969 
using a portable saw and then we can
bring<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.659> over<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> table<00:02:01.320> saw<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.710> make

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
bring it over to the table saw to make

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.399 
bring it over to the table saw to make
our<00:02:02.159> fine<00:02:02.520> cut<00:02:02.909> my<00:02:03.360> favorite<00:02:03.750> method<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.259> to

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
our fine cut my favorite method is to

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.630 
our fine cut my favorite method is to
use<00:02:04.590> my<00:02:04.829> truck

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
use my truck

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.240 
use my truck
and<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:07.719> way<00:02:07.899> I<00:02:08.140> don't<00:02:08.170> even<00:02:08.440> have<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.830> remove

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
and that way I don't even have to remove

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.250 
and that way I don't even have to remove
the<00:02:09.580> plywood<00:02:10.090> all<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.569> way<00:02:10.720> when<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:10.959> get<00:02:11.170> it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260

I'm parked I want to cut off a strip

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.300 
I'm parked I want to cut off a strip
that<00:02:27.970> it's<00:02:28.269> 11<00:02:28.930> inches<00:02:29.349> wide<00:02:29.410> but<00:02:30.099> I'm<00:02:30.190> going

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
that it's 11 inches wide but I'm going

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.100 
that it's 11 inches wide but I'm going
to<00:02:30.400> cut<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:30.700> 12<00:02:31.120> inches<00:02:31.510> because<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.900> always

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
to cut it 12 inches because I always

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.110 
to cut it 12 inches because I always
like<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.440> cut<00:02:32.709> them<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:33.040> little<00:02:33.340> oversized<00:02:33.879> and

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
like to cut them a little oversized and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.449 
like to cut them a little oversized and
then<00:02:34.269> fine-tune<00:02:34.840> them<00:02:35.019> on<00:02:35.200> my<00:02:35.410> table<00:02:35.709> saw<00:02:36.129> one

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
then fine-tune them on my table saw one

then fine-tune them on my table saw one
of<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.610> most<00:02:36.760> common<00:02:37.150> methods<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.629> just<00:02:37.870> to

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
of the most common methods is just to

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.100 
of the most common methods is just to
use<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.620> straightedge<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.849> run<00:02:40.209> your<00:02:40.599> circular

use a straightedge to run your circular
saw<00:02:41.140> along<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:42.220> wouldn't<00:02:42.790> recommend<00:02:43.090> using

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
saw along I wouldn't recommend using

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.470 
saw along I wouldn't recommend using
just<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:44.110> board<00:02:44.980> because<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.819> chances<00:02:46.239> are

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
just a board because the chances are

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.850 
just a board because the chances are
it's<00:02:46.660> not<00:02:46.750> going<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.049> be<00:02:47.140> perfectly<00:02:47.530> straight

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
it's not going to be perfectly straight

it's not going to be perfectly straight

actually<00:03:25.180> came<00:03:25.480> with<00:03:25.750> two<00:03:26.079> C<00:03:26.530> clamps<00:03:27.100> so<00:03:27.280> you

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
actually came with two C clamps so you

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.699 
actually came with two C clamps so you
can<00:03:27.609> just<00:03:27.760> clamp<00:03:28.239> this<00:03:28.630> down<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.620> your

can just clamp this down to your
workpiece<00:03:30.069> for<00:03:30.760> this<00:03:30.940> cut<00:03:31.359> I<00:03:31.630> think<00:03:31.780> what<00:03:32.139> I'm

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
workpiece for this cut I think what I'm

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.309 
workpiece for this cut I think what I'm
gonna<00:03:32.319> do

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.589 

and<00:03:36.319> I'll<00:03:36.530> support<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.249> cutoff<00:03:37.579> on<00:03:37.969> my

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
and I'll support the cutoff on my

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.660 
and I'll support the cutoff on my
workbench<00:03:40.810> I've<00:03:41.810> got<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.019> fine<00:03:42.439> tooth<00:03:42.769> blade<00:03:43.310> in

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
workbench I've got a fine tooth blade in

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.209 
workbench I've got a fine tooth blade in
my<00:03:43.730> saw<00:03:44.299> so<00:03:44.629> it<00:03:44.749> won't<00:03:44.989> chew<00:03:45.379> up<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.709> plywood

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:46.219 
my saw so it won't chew up the plywood

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.030 
my saw so it won't chew up the plywood
so<00:03:46.609> I'm<00:03:46.700> going<00:03:46.819> to<00:03:46.849> do<00:03:46.999> is<00:03:47.150> run<00:03:47.420> this<00:03:48.109> fence

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
so I'm going to do is run this fence

00:03:49.040 --> 00:04:01.839 
so I'm going to do is run this fence
along<00:03:49.760> this<00:03:50.420> fence

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.000 

using<00:04:02.569> a<00:04:02.659> straightedge<00:04:02.989> can<00:04:03.379> work<00:04:03.560> out<00:04:03.769> really

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
using a straightedge can work out really

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.699 
using a straightedge can work out really
well<00:04:04.129> but<00:04:04.849> it<00:04:05.329> can<00:04:05.510> kind<00:04:05.719> of<00:04:05.750> be<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.900> pain<00:04:06.230> to<00:04:06.500> set

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
well but it can kind of be a pain to set

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.050 
well but it can kind of be a pain to set
up<00:04:06.890> and<00:04:07.099> it<00:04:07.189> can<00:04:07.400> be<00:04:07.549> a<00:04:07.760> little<00:04:07.909> bit

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
up and it can be a little bit

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.630 
up and it can be a little bit
time-consuming<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:09.530> alternative<00:04:10.129> method

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
time-consuming the alternative method

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.670 
time-consuming the alternative method
which<00:04:10.819> I<00:04:10.969> like<00:04:11.239> to<00:04:11.390> use<00:04:11.599> are<00:04:11.840> these<00:04:12.140> cutting

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
which I like to use are these cutting

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.160 
which I like to use are these cutting

guides the first one I bought years ago
is<00:04:15.260> called<00:04:15.319> the<00:04:15.620> Accu<00:04:16.130> rip<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.579> you<00:04:16.639> can<00:04:16.789> still

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
is called the Accu rip and you can still

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.469 
is called the Accu rip and you can still
buy<00:04:17.239> these<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:17.750> they<00:04:17.810> work<00:04:17.989> really<00:04:18.019> well<00:04:18.500> an

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
buy these and they work really well an

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.420 
buy these and they work really well an

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
upgrade to that is one that Craig makes

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.090 
upgrade to that is one that Craig makes
and<00:04:22.820> it's<00:04:22.970> called<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.570> RIP<00:04:24.080> cut<00:04:24.500> now<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.889> way

initially you never have to change those

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.370 
initially you never have to change those
again<00:04:49.639> because<00:04:49.880> they're<00:04:50.060> set<00:04:50.270> up<00:04:50.300> exactly<00:04:50.630> for

again because they're set up exactly for
your<00:04:51.650> saw<00:04:52.009> they<00:04:52.460> both<00:04:52.639> have<00:04:52.880> a<00:04:52.910> scale<00:04:53.479> that<00:04:53.750> you

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
your saw they both have a scale that you

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.350 
your saw they both have a scale that you
can<00:04:54.050> adjust<00:04:54.169> this<00:04:54.680> little<00:04:55.009> fence<00:04:55.580> here<00:04:56.060> to<00:04:56.210> the

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
size of cut you want to make so if I

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.520 
size of cut you want to make so if I
wanted<00:04:58.490> to<00:04:58.550> make<00:04:58.699> a<00:04:58.729> 12<00:04:59.120> inch<00:04:59.330> cut<00:04:59.720> I<00:04:59.990> would

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
wanted to make a 12 inch cut I would

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.370 
wanted to make a 12 inch cut I would
just<00:05:00.710> line<00:05:01.009> this<00:05:01.280> up<00:05:01.550> to<00:05:01.849> the<00:05:02.330> 12<00:05:02.690> mark<00:05:03.139> and

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
just line this up to the 12 mark and

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.189 
just line this up to the 12 mark and
then<00:05:03.620> tighten<00:05:04.310> it<00:05:04.430> down<00:05:04.490> on<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.509> Craig<00:05:05.750> system

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
then tighten it down on the Craig system

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.980 
then tighten it down on the Craig system
you<00:05:06.320> just<00:05:06.349> pop<00:05:06.800> this<00:05:07.159> up<00:05:07.460> and<00:05:07.880> then<00:05:08.000> slide<00:05:08.510> your

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
you just pop this up and then slide your

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.939 
you just pop this up and then slide your
scale<00:05:09.380> over<00:05:09.789> to<00:05:10.789> where<00:05:11.270> you<00:05:11.389> want<00:05:11.570> it<00:05:11.740> and<00:05:12.740> it's

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
scale over to where you want it and it's

scale over to where you want it and it's
real<00:05:13.099> simple<00:05:13.130> to<00:05:13.610> cut<00:05:13.820> your<00:05:14.000> wood<00:05:14.240> you're<00:05:14.479> just

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659 
real simple to cut your wood you're just

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:16.779 
real simple to cut your wood you're just
going<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:14.900> hold<00:05:15.110> this<00:05:15.409> fence<00:05:15.800> up<00:05:16.010> against<00:05:16.550> one

going to hold this fence up against one
edge<00:05:17.060> of<00:05:17.419> your<00:05:17.539> board<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:18.139> run<00:05:18.740> it<00:05:18.889> all<00:05:19.039> the

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
edge of your board and run it all the

edge of your board and run it all the
way<00:05:19.490> through<00:05:19.849> and<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.090> accurate<00:05:20.690> it<00:05:20.900> would<00:05:21.020> be

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
way through and the accurate it would be

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.399 
way through and the accurate it would be
the<00:05:21.320> smaller<00:05:21.860> fits<00:05:22.510> that<00:05:23.510> you'd<00:05:23.720> run<00:05:23.990> along

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
the smaller fits that you'd run along

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.589 
the smaller fits that you'd run along
the<00:05:24.740> drawbacks<00:05:25.280> to<00:05:25.490> using<00:05:25.520> these<00:05:25.970> are<00:05:26.300> that

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
the drawbacks to using these are that

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.469 
the drawbacks to using these are that
you<00:05:26.810> can't<00:05:27.169> clamp<00:05:27.500> your<00:05:27.740> workpiece<00:05:28.340> down<00:05:28.789> so

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
you can't clamp your workpiece down so

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.870 
you can't clamp your workpiece down so
that<00:05:29.690> this<00:05:30.050> side<00:05:30.349> is<00:05:30.590> left<00:05:30.800> unsupported<00:05:31.729> and

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
that this side is left unsupported and

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.879 
that this side is left unsupported and
you<00:05:31.970> just<00:05:32.180> have<00:05:32.300> to<00:05:32.360> grab<00:05:32.690> it<00:05:32.930> when<00:05:33.110> you<00:05:33.229> finish

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
you just have to grab it when you finish

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.909 
you just have to grab it when you finish
your<00:05:34.099> cut<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:34.580> also<00:05:35.240> you<00:05:35.300> can't<00:05:35.630> do<00:05:35.930> very<00:05:36.440> wide

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
your cut and also you can't do very wide

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.939 
your cut and also you can't do very wide
cuts<00:05:37.430> with<00:05:37.849> it<00:05:38.120> if<00:05:38.510> you<00:05:38.630> need<00:05:38.810> to<00:05:38.930> cut<00:05:39.229> down<00:05:39.260> the

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
cuts with it if you need to cut down the

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:42.310 
cuts with it if you need to cut down the
middle<00:05:40.190> of<00:05:40.460> a<00:05:40.550> board<00:05:40.789> say<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.150> sheet<00:05:42.020> of<00:05:42.139> plywood

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
middle of a board say a sheet of plywood

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.990 
middle of a board say a sheet of plywood
in<00:05:42.680> half<00:05:42.919> you<00:05:43.159> certainly<00:05:43.460> couldn't<00:05:43.729> do<00:05:43.909> it

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
in half you certainly couldn't do it

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.670 
in half you certainly couldn't do it
with<00:05:44.150> one<00:05:44.330> of<00:05:44.360> these<00:05:44.570> but<00:05:45.020> I<00:05:45.139> am<00:05:45.199> going<00:05:45.440> to<00:05:45.500> cap

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
with one of these but I am going to cap

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.620 
with one of these but I am going to cap
it<00:05:45.889> down<00:05:46.070> over<00:05:46.430> here<00:05:46.729> so<00:05:47.030> that<00:05:47.180> my<00:05:47.330> board

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
it down over here so that my board

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:54.320 
it down over here so that my board
doesn't<00:05:47.960> slide<00:05:48.409> around<00:05:48.590> long<00:05:49.010> cutting

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330 

and<00:05:54.870> you<00:05:55.080> can<00:05:55.229> make<00:05:55.379> these<00:05:55.560> cuts<00:05:55.860> using

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
and you can make these cuts using

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:06.690 
and you can make these cuts using
sawhorses<00:05:57.120> to

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.610 

one<00:06:07.300> method<00:06:07.630> that's<00:06:07.660> popular<00:06:08.230> with<00:06:08.350> a<00:06:08.380> lot<00:06:08.470> of

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
one method that's popular with a lot of

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.000 
one method that's popular with a lot of
guys<00:06:08.890> is<00:06:09.100> to<00:06:09.430> get<00:06:09.730> a<00:06:09.760> sheet<00:06:10.210> of<00:06:10.240> this<00:06:10.600> styrofoam

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
guys is to get a sheet of this styrofoam

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.340 
guys is to get a sheet of this styrofoam
building<00:06:12.010> insulation<00:06:12.480> the<00:06:13.480> courts<00:06:13.780> advantage

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
building insulation the courts advantage

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.350 
building insulation the courts advantage
here<00:06:14.650> is<00:06:14.800> that<00:06:15.010> your<00:06:15.160> workpiece<00:06:15.550> is<00:06:15.760> supported

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
here is that your workpiece is supported

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.420 
here is that your workpiece is supported
on<00:06:16.450> both<00:06:16.720> sides<00:06:17.110> through<00:06:17.440> the<00:06:17.530> entire<00:06:17.830> just

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
on both sides through the entire just

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.160 
on both sides through the entire just
raise<00:06:18.730> your<00:06:18.760> blade<00:06:19.330> up<00:06:19.360> so<00:06:19.720> that<00:06:19.870> it<00:06:19.960> cuts

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
raise your blade up so that it cuts

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.990 
raise your blade up so that it cuts
through<00:06:20.380> the<00:06:20.560> wood<00:06:20.890> but<00:06:21.190> obviously<00:06:21.610> doesn't

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
through the wood but obviously doesn't

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.390 
through the wood but obviously doesn't
cut<00:06:22.210> into<00:06:22.450> your<00:06:22.930> floor<00:06:23.380> but<00:06:23.800> honestly<00:06:24.100> I'm<00:06:24.280> not

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
cut into your floor but honestly I'm not

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.580 
cut into your floor but honestly I'm not
a<00:06:24.460> huge<00:06:24.730> fan<00:06:24.760> of<00:06:25.000> this<00:06:25.300> system<00:06:25.810> for<00:06:26.290> me<00:06:26.410> it's

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
a huge fan of this system for me it's

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.900 
a huge fan of this system for me it's
too<00:06:26.800> difficult<00:06:27.010> to<00:06:27.370> set<00:06:27.730> up

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
too difficult to set up

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.270 
too difficult to set up
a<00:06:28.000> straight<00:06:28.390> edge<00:06:28.630> and<00:06:28.840> to<00:06:29.050> clamp<00:06:29.380> it<00:06:29.560> on<00:06:29.710> with

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
a straight edge and to clamp it on with

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.060 
a straight edge and to clamp it on with
the<00:06:30.580> styrofoam<00:06:30.820> in<00:06:31.330> the<00:06:31.480> way<00:06:31.630> and<00:06:31.900> using<00:06:32.740> an

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
the styrofoam in the way and using an

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:41.820 
the styrofoam in the way and using an
edge<00:06:33.520> guide<00:06:33.940> is<00:06:34.240> also<00:06:34.570> difficult<00:06:40.650> so<00:06:41.650> I<00:06:41.680> think

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
edge guide is also difficult so I think

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.830 
edge guide is also difficult so I think
this<00:06:42.130> system<00:06:42.370> works<00:06:42.790> out<00:06:43.000> best<00:06:43.420> if<00:06:43.690> you're

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
this system works out best if you're

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.290 
this system works out best if you're
just<00:06:44.020> going<00:06:44.230> to<00:06:44.290> draw<00:06:44.800> a<00:06:45.010> line<00:06:45.250> and<00:06:45.550> freehand

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
just going to draw a line and freehand

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.550 
just going to draw a line and freehand
the<00:06:46.510> cut<00:06:46.750> and<00:06:46.930> not<00:06:47.080> have<00:06:47.230> to<00:06:47.320> worry<00:06:47.470> about

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
the cut and not have to worry about

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.830 
the cut and not have to worry about
clamping<00:06:48.370> any<00:06:48.610> straight<00:06:49.210> edge<00:06:49.420> to<00:06:49.450> your

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
clamping any straight edge to your

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.480 
clamping any straight edge to your
workpiece<00:06:50.320> and<00:06:50.710> those<00:06:50.890> are<00:06:51.040> just<00:06:51.130> some<00:06:51.310> of<00:06:51.340> the

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
workpiece and those are just some of the

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.580 
workpiece and those are just some of the
ways<00:06:51.640> you<00:06:51.970> can<00:06:52.210> break<00:06:52.660> down<00:06:52.960> sheet<00:06:53.290> goods

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
ways you can break down sheet goods

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.080 
ways you can break down sheet goods
before<00:06:53.800> you<00:06:54.010> bring<00:06:54.160> it<00:06:54.310> into<00:06:54.460> your<00:06:54.610> shop
