00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:03.520
 that is how victims of the person are called time 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.970
 the wildlife that is hit on the vvd 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.490
 every year in this period hundreds of wild boar deer and 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.580
 terraces to live on the busy provincial roads in gelderland 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:17.099
 Apeldoorn on the clock was set one hour ahead and the animals after the 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.630
 be much more active during the long winter time 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.630
 The forest ranger Hans along to show the sad consequences 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:31.850
 the n203 has been convicted 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.020
 one of the most dangerous roads in the Netherlands on the north-western part 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.200
 of the nerves between elspeet in harderwijk 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.000
 next to the traffic 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.580
 in the middle of the area for wild boar worked and reason 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.300
 harderwijk took the current lead at the grave 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.030
 from both sides says that quite a few wanted to drive very far 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.680
 the big market he talks 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.960
 the reason for this per year 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.560
 those in the north-west veluwe alone five hundred 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.560
 we are very happy with wild boar and thought 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.050
 9 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.550
 watch the trailer here 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.550
 unmistakable website falls is the site of the collision 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.700
 the control 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.450
 I'm me here 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.720
 what has happened 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.490
 wants to become the union 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.640
 It does show searching by owning a good place that is one thing 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.570
 is certain 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.450
 on the road with the forester 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.040
 looking for it hit over especially at this time of year as the 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.229
 morning peak coincides with twilight that there are many collisions 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.400
 that race and at night spent searching for food and focused on the following 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.780
 guilder back in the forest 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.749
 Given the 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.090
 the headlights rear lights and purpose of the glass in the elevator 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.570
 it turns out that you come across frontally for the car so you 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.570
 the chance a large part of you is either dead or earlier 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.370
 according to top oss 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.309
 8 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:17.129
 to inform 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.129
 who have 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.159
 biggest daler 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.799
 hardest quota yourself 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.319
 to prevent the composite from appearing 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.869
 by wubbo by which the abdominal wall damages you think that here 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.339
 but bumped up 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:43.109
 and deported hunting dog tanja 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.939
 from Joris the Swedish comes 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.180
 but who knows ad the swede is nice to be there the German the Germans 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.710
 points out 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.079
 that's a billboard 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.329
 spain is a specialized among 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.010
 ground coarse corresponds to the reason wild boar than to trace m 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:02.079
 you see walk out of track until it comes to this right and then it will be fine 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.739
 continue to follow 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.499
 but that would take days like us 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:10.049
 because one thing can sometimes go very far away, especially when it is full of stress and 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.529
 meets the limit, it can sometimes take a long time 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:16.889
 and can follow from track to roll up to two three days then it stops on one 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:17.989
 sidetrack truss 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.519
 he has been lying down for a while 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.639
 the struggle is not very suitable for human consumption anymore 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.619
 bacteria that are all sorts 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:26.230
 various occupations work 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.459
 the cream 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.249
 drag along on a spot 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:31.529
 another candidate is ahead 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:35.549
 NATO in the days before Verdi that wild boar runs around you 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.059
 again a very nice meal 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:43.089
 square enix never again after eight 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:45.389
 Tanja smells very nice of course 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.939
 on the entire veluwe are driven to death every year until 2004 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:54.579
 if it is no longer there because not all collisions are reported and that is 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.030
 important how animals are not always killed instantly 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.030
 and then the forester must be relieved of his suffering 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.009
 to take over the short term 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.720
 and then a new notification arrives 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.230
 along the busy 2 0 3 is this time and shares are hit 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.349
 the precise marking of the collision is necessary 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.689
 otherwise the dog can never be put on the right track for being hit 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:29.559
 tear 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:32.059
 from the job 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:33.939
 and it is not like that yet 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.939
 not much warmer think he has already done consumption 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.029
 this is one that has been swept away 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:45.139
 there is nothing a solution for all those collisions 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.330
 it is driven too fast and the drivers are not aware of it 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.620
 but it is dangerous 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.970
 at least two people were killed in a wild accident last year 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.310
 after problem is now that they play the role of striker 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.999
 coincides with none by the departure of time 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:02.469
 Spain 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.469
 The perpetrator of a word that gives rise to another important reason is that 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.039
 everything starts to run all groups are starting in the spring 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.020
 this that syntus 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.449
 in the savings mode you could say that hardly move for nothing 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:16.650
 lose energy 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.969
 everyone who is moving again 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.979
 and precisely during the food tours and supports 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.189
 case of stilt houses 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:28.689
 how can that now still be recorded a resident selling 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:30.360
 be used to it 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.090
 he himself says it is never fun 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.339
 while ford too 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.520
 I see the daily giving up there 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.270
 this week it is also hit 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.020
 these guys
