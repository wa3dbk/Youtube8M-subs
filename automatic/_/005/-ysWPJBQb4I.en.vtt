00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
but I honestly didn't think it would be

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.610 
but I honestly didn't think it would be
like<00:02:36.200> this

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
like this

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.670 
like this
when<00:02:36.800> I<00:02:36.830> go<00:02:37.070> over<00:02:37.310> there<00:02:37.460> it<00:02:37.640> is<00:02:37.790> just<00:02:38.150> insane

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680
