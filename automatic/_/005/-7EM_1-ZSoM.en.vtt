there<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:49.200> Joseph<00:00:49.770> iveco<00:00:50.780> he's<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> very

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
there is Joseph iveco he's a very

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.650 
there is Joseph iveco he's a very
well-known<00:00:52.199> fighter<00:00:52.910> he<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.059> bring<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.449> some
