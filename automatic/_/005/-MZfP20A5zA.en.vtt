young kids don't like I gave a talk at a
university<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.590> therefore<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.180> photography

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
university and therefore a photography

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.300 
university and therefore a photography
club<00:03:01.329> graduating<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.349> photography<00:03:02.829> class<00:03:03.040> and

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
club graduating to photography class and

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.080 
club graduating to photography class and
they<00:03:04.180> didn't<00:03:04.480> know<00:03:04.510> who<00:03:04.989> Man<00:03:05.260> Ray<00:03:05.560> was<00:03:05.829> and<00:03:06.280> I'm

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
they didn't know who Man Ray was and I'm

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.119 
they didn't know who Man Ray was and I'm
thinking<00:03:07.379> how<00:03:08.379> could<00:03:08.469> you<00:03:08.590> not<00:03:08.680> know<00:03:08.829> who<00:03:08.949> Man

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
thinking how could you not know who Man

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.119 
thinking how could you not know who Man
Ray<00:03:09.370> was<00:03:09.579> first<00:03:09.939> of<00:03:10.060> all<00:03:10.150> one<00:03:10.569> of<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:10.719> most

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
Ray was first of all one of the most

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.369 
Ray was first of all one of the most
prolific<00:03:12.129> photographers<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.359> our<00:03:13.780> time<00:03:14.079> and

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
in creative solarization and I'm

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.330 
in creative solarization and I'm
thinking<00:03:16.449> it's<00:03:17.319> really<00:03:17.709> important<00:03:18.159> for<00:03:18.189> you
