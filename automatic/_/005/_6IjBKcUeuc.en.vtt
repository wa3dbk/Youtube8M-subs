00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.690
 Today, people watch almost 1/3 of alien 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.099
 movie or anything but it is not so 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.679
 popular is not a thing that everyone 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.320
 uses every day it is extremely useful 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.390
 even more expensive this is changing has 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.619
 a recent campaign than to be without 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.779
 know what comes out of collective thinking 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.019
 people always say nobody heard that 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.060
 they want to create the first television 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.439
 the world and if this proposal 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.869
 being successful they are 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.469
 managing to raise a few thousand 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.270
 dollars and this tv really seems useful 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.309
 it really seems like fun they want 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.800
 recreate that idea of ​​the minor report 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.610
 remembers that movie of the tom cruise that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.280
 it is there pulling the images from the screen 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.860
 everything in 3d like yours had more 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.140
 floating in the air how much technology 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.989
 these images then this 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.440
 device here it is called space ne 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.850
 it is nothing more than an application 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.049
 free round as if it were a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.619
 video game that you connect via hdmi on 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.659
 tv and he has there his wifi receiver 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.280
 then it connects to the internet and 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.799
 depending on what you are watching 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.509
 it pulls information you're seeing 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.250
 now few images of formula 1 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.670
 while watching formula 1 he 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.890
 two took some live information 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.380
 on the internet about content that is 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.280
 watching for example the kiss entered a 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.710
 impasse a nasa documentary he 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.470
 to identify it, we'll see that it has to 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.150
 content on nasa demand for people 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.990
 then it automatically show ever 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.479
 has information 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.430
 plays on the screen you will monitoring 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.579
 perhaps with the remote control you can not 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.590
 know how else you select 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.229
 Do you want to see on screen, browse through media? 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.780
 about that subject and he gives you 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.329
 fully interactive content 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.640
 much of what was said about digital tv 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.320
 that would be interactive but nothing was 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.369
 shown much in this part of 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.860
 interactivity 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.399
 So who knows if it's the evolution 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.789
 be the future of 3d tvs and let it 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.259
 really important of these technology 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.700
 really popular because it's not a 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.030
 very popular technology you do not see 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.870
 so many things like that 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.150
 in 3d being used in everyday life then 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.490
 I think it's cool, I liked the idea of gold. 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.010
 It was expensive, this would be very cool. 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.110
 Imagine as if you simply had 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.450
 watching tv watching you either 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.400
 watch and navigate same time 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.190
 imagine the game over program by 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.080
 You are there watching the matter. 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.610
 suddenly talk like this 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.560
 let me see a trailer while artur 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.200
 here speaks in the corner a pressure in the corner 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.989
 continued talking here, we are all good 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.239
 filling sausage and you there on the side already 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.130
 watching the game clip already has some 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.410
 information when it will be released or 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.600
 until they make available to us 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.150
 even with information on the screen for you 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.140
 the cool idea approved by the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.140
 game over team
