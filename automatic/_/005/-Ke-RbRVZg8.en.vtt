Iker! There he is! He might tells us about the spirit...

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.100
Iker is not alone...he is always alone in the goal, so he likes to be with people, obvious!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.100
What a shooting!

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.800

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
- Similarity? Resemblance?
- Reasonable, yes. I think yes!

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.000
- I rely on make up, otherwise there in no chance.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.500
- I think this is the bend!

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.000
- Yes, this is the curve.
- But there is no clue about the spirit

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Be careful Iker! Be careful Iker!
