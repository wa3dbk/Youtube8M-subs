00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.170
 today I am very productive good 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.279
 lifesaver this video a little 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.000
 improvised a little stupid for 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:23.780
 tell you about the clichés I found 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.520
 in one direction introductions 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:32.550
 we always talk about fp always of 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:35.820
 bimbeminkia of black edition fiction 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.140
 I can matic that the stupid and why 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.809
 I want to have a first look 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.530
 very generic a lot so a cliché that 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.570
 I found is the lack of mastery 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.540
 verbal do not know what the as if 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.460
 I recommend time that is practically parts 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.930
 from the past it passes to the present then 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.079
 return to the past more keep in mind 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.149
 for future ferry journeys in time 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.910
 it's another plus of time travel 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.729
 however, the time of the one takes place 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.950
 direction another pleasure is found 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.240
 these are this sudden invasion 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.159
 of girls aged 13 to 18 who go 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.260
 suddenly all in london for i 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.080
 disparate reasons and now I don't 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.210
 I understand how parents lose their jobs 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.010
 moving parents to London 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.020
 divorce they move and london 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.360
 they finish their school and yes 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.250
 transfer the shadow cuts itself long 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.439
 let's move to London for a phone call 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.600

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.159
 my friend let's move from london i am 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.400
 fall from the bed let's move to the world 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.830
 which is to say all in london 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.120
 suddenly from 8 million 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.440
 people are people not on the c 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.980
 millions of people who amount to 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.290
 london exponentially rises however yes 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:00.360
 lowers the average age because they are all 15 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.020
 years I made a poo the amber arrived 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.540

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.250

 boys to worse pellizzano biani a lo 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.520
 backpack or harry but it's normal that I do n't know 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.440
 that is, that I only know their own 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.920
 names but I can't recognize the face 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.050
 that is, type matches the face a name and me 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.650
 I should match the face and I don't know 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.500
 do not like action waves between 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.060
 factions are pretty hordes of kids 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.630
 to zombies that are trying to see 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.510
 shown in the billions of people who 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.690
 they live on hip hop 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.760

 London self- destructive theory breaks down 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.030

 having sex in the shower 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.030
 you're sick it's not possible virtual 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:22.139
 of people who are really sick 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:26.009
 and that they hurt themselves just because 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:28.319

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:50.060
 very funny 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:54.539
 clichy and fantasy the boys become 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.150
 vampires werewolves zombies sorcerers harry 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.889

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:05.759
 become I can't understand them why 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.479
 but what the hell is your head telling you 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.770
 boom fails this year 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:13.889
 pornographic where you practically ste 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:17.400
 young girls that open all the holes 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:19.440
 I don't know how they do it if they do 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:24.750
 invents for the third eye as well becomes 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.159
 a hole is ugly to say another with 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.710
 hand like hedgehogs from morning to evening 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:30.360

 they write soul maybe they don't even know 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:38.759
 what things in the same sense do they do 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:41.280
 15 years stay in the city I think not 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:41.820

 well maybe but here are the 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.949
