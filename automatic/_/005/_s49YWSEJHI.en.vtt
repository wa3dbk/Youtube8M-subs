today<00:00:26.970> for<00:00:27.570> me<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.840> style<00:00:28.109> works<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.529> lot

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
today for me this style works a lot

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.009 
today for me this style works a lot
better<00:00:28.710> if<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.400> layers<00:00:30.019> particularly

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
better if you have layers particularly

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.020 
better if you have layers particularly
shorter<00:00:31.529> layers<00:00:31.740> towards<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> top<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.820> do

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
shorter layers towards the top like I do

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.600 
shorter layers towards the top like I do
and<00:00:33.420> longer<00:00:34.140> layers<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> bottom<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.160> also

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
and longer layers on the bottom and also

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.610 
and longer layers on the bottom and also
is<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> little<00:00:36.239> bit<00:00:36.360> easier<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.350> on

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
is a little bit easier if you have on

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.369 
is a little bit easier if you have on
your<00:00:38.460> hair<00:00:38.670> curled<00:00:38.969> or<00:00:39.300> wavy<00:00:39.540> straight<00:00:40.200> hair

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
your hair curled or wavy straight hair

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.790 
your hair curled or wavy straight hair
kinda<00:00:40.770> sometimes<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.969> um<00:00:42.320> have<00:00:43.320> some<00:00:43.530> ends

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
kinda sometimes can um have some ends

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.619 
kinda sometimes can um have some ends
sticking<00:00:43.980> out<00:00:44.309> weird<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.270> do<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.510> with

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
sticking out weird you can do it with

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.299 
sticking out weird you can do it with
straight<00:00:45.840> hair<00:00:45.870> certainly<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> find<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.219> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
straight hair certainly but I find it a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.160 
straight hair certainly but I find it a
little<00:00:47.399> bit<00:00:47.610> easier<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.969> do<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.300> while<00:00:48.809> my<00:00:48.960> hair

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
little bit easier to do it while my hair

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.439 
little bit easier to do it while my hair
is<00:00:49.260> curled<00:00:49.620> I'm<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.250> take<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.180> top

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
layers that are going to stay down so I

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.289 
layers that are going to stay down so I
just<00:01:40.270> kind<00:01:40.479> of<00:01:40.539> rolled<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:41.020> into<00:01:41.369> itself<00:01:42.369> as<00:01:42.670> if

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
just kind of rolled it into itself as if

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.910 
just kind of rolled it into itself as if
I<00:01:43.450> were<00:01:44.399> putting<00:01:45.399> in<00:01:45.520> like<00:01:45.849> a<00:01:45.879> hot<00:01:46.209> roller<00:01:46.479> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.380 
I were putting in like a hot roller and
I<00:01:47.920> pinned<00:01:48.219> it<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:48.610> you<00:01:48.700> can<00:01:48.879> see<00:01:49.060> I've<00:01:49.179> just

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.719 
I pinned it so you can see I've just
kind<00:01:49.599> of<00:01:49.629> looped<00:01:49.899> this<00:01:50.170> under<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:50.920> pinned<00:01:51.610> it

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
out just a couple of them to make it

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.550 
out just a couple of them to make it
look<00:03:17.910> like<00:03:18.120> my<00:03:18.510> bob<00:03:18.780> is<00:03:19.020> a<00:03:19.050> little<00:03:19.350> bit<00:03:19.440> more

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
look like my bob is a little bit more

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.410

angled<00:03:20.010> I've<00:03:20.220> got<00:03:20.400> some<00:03:20.580> longer<00:03:20.880> pieces<00:03:21.120> in

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
angled I've got some longer pieces in

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.720 
angled I've got some longer pieces in
the<00:03:21.540> front<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:22.050> certainly<00:03:22.440> could<00:03:23.280> tuck<00:03:23.520> them

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
the front you certainly could tuck them

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:40.010 
the front you certainly could tuck them
under<00:03:25.310> see<00:03:26.310> what<00:03:26.490> that<00:03:26.610> looks<00:03:26.670> like

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.290
