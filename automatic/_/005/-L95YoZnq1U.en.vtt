00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
looks like you're going to be able to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.790 
looks like you're going to be able to
arm<00:01:54.860> some<00:01:55.190> kind<00:01:55.429> of<00:01:55.520> income<00:01:55.789> or<00:01:56.390> maybe<00:01:56.660> a<00:01:57.080> huge

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
arm some kind of income or maybe a huge

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.969 
arm some kind of income or maybe a huge
IED<00:01:58.580> that<00:01:58.910> blows<00:01:59.119> up<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.509> whole<00:01:59.750> carrier<00:02:00.259> now

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
IED that blows up the whole carrier now

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.580 
IED that blows up the whole carrier now
I'm<00:02:01.310> not<00:02:01.700> sure<00:02:01.729> which<00:02:02.330> one<00:02:02.569> is<00:02:02.720> going<00:02:02.929> to<00:02:03.050> be<00:02:03.229> or

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
I'm not sure which one is going to be or

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.800 
I'm not sure which one is going to be or
maybe<00:02:04.039> the<00:02:04.340> income<00:02:04.819> just<00:02:05.240> makes<00:02:05.569> everything

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
maybe the income just makes everything

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.469 
maybe the income just makes everything
shorter<00:02:06.590> now<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:07.340> carrier<00:02:07.819> blows<00:02:08.149> itself

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
shorter now and the carrier blows itself

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.120 
shorter now and the carrier blows itself
up<00:02:08.750> but<00:02:09.289> it<00:02:09.349> looks<00:02:09.500> like<00:02:09.649> you're<00:02:09.800> going<00:02:10.009> to

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
up but it looks like you're going to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.820 
up but it looks like you're going to
have<00:02:10.310> some<00:02:10.789> kind<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.120> time<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:12.080> get<00:02:12.260> out<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.709> the

a<00:02:26.720> route<00:02:27.080> in<00:02:27.349> and<00:02:27.860> there<00:02:28.310> was<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.489> few<00:02:28.879> things

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
a route in and there was a few things

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.210 
a route in and there was a few things
that<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.390> noticed<00:02:29.510> about<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.500> naval<00:02:30.860> strike

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
that I noticed about the naval strike

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.670 
that I noticed about the naval strike
extreme<00:02:31.849> shots<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:32.780> don't<00:02:33.170> think<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.530> lot

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
extreme shots that I don't think a lot

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.589 
extreme shots that I don't think a lot
of<00:02:33.739> people<00:02:33.829> were<00:02:34.220> discussing<00:02:34.879> first<00:02:35.390> off

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
of people were discussing first off

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.110 
of people were discussing first off
there's<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.989> giant<00:02:36.530> latch<00:02:36.769> on<00:02:37.159> the<00:02:37.430> carrier<00:02:37.879> in

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
there's a giant latch on the carrier in

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.089 
there's a giant latch on the carrier in
one<00:02:38.629> of<00:02:38.659> the<00:02:38.810> screenshots<00:02:39.379> and<00:02:39.590> there's<00:02:39.799> also

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
one of the screenshots and there's also

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.000 
one of the screenshots and there's also
the<00:02:40.340> top<00:02:41.209> day<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.200> think<00:02:42.319> there's<00:02:42.650> going<00:02:42.829> to

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
the top day so I think there's going to

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.970 
the top day so I think there's going to
be<00:02:43.040> two<00:02:43.400> ways<00:02:43.640> into<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.840> carrier<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.349> get<00:02:45.829> to

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
be two ways into the carrier to get to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.940 
be two ways into the carrier to get to
those<00:02:46.160> incomes<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.120> blow<00:02:47.599> them<00:02:47.810> up<00:02:47.989> one<00:02:48.620> will

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
those incomes and blow them up one will

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.190 
those incomes and blow them up one will
be<00:02:49.099> boat<00:02:49.400> accessible<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.510> other<00:02:50.720> will<00:02:51.019> be

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
be boat accessible and the other will be

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.280 
be boat accessible and the other will be
only<00:02:51.500> air<00:02:52.099> this<00:02:52.879> is<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.299> most<00:02:53.510> logical<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:54.260> me

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
only air this is the most logical to me

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.550 
only air this is the most logical to me
and<00:02:54.769> i<00:02:55.340> have<00:02:55.579> already<00:02:55.849> kind<00:02:56.450> of<00:02:56.569> debated

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
and i have already kind of debated

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.580 
and i have already kind of debated
whether<00:02:58.390> after<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.720> certain<00:02:59.959> amount<00:03:00.140> of<00:03:00.379> time

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
whether after a certain amount of time

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.800 
whether after a certain amount of time
of<00:03:01.010> capturing<00:03:01.579> those<00:03:01.819> flags<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:02.629> those

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
of capturing those flags and those

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.830 
of capturing those flags and those
missiles<00:03:03.349> fly<00:03:03.709> at<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.190> carrier<00:03:04.640> it<00:03:04.909> opens<00:03:05.629> up

to<00:03:42.980> this<00:03:43.220> stuff<00:03:43.400> they<00:03:43.879> have<00:03:44.150> worked<00:03:44.449> on<00:03:44.599> the

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
to this stuff they have worked on the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.559 
to this stuff they have worked on the
main<00:03:44.959> game

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
main game

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.280 
main game
they<00:03:45.689> have<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.319> guess<00:03:46.709> collaborated<00:03:47.670> with

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
they have I guess collaborated with

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.339 
they have I guess collaborated with
Stockholm<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.709> produce<00:03:49.920> naval<00:03:50.609> strike<00:03:51.349> but

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
Stockholm to produce naval strike but

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.720 
Stockholm to produce naval strike but
like<00:03:52.650> i<00:03:52.769> said<00:03:52.799> i'm<00:03:53.159> not<00:03:53.189> sure<00:03:53.549> where

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
like i said i'm not sure where

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.259 
like i said i'm not sure where
LEvolution<00:03:54.599> stands<00:03:55.290> with<00:03:55.560> dice<00:03:55.829> I<00:03:56.269> really

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
LEvolution stands with dice I really

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.360 
LEvolution stands with dice I really
think<00:03:57.510> lately<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.590> hasn't<00:03:58.829> really<00:03:59.129> been

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
think lately it hasn't really been

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.280 
think lately it hasn't really been
game-changing<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.480> most<00:04:00.689> game-changing

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
game-changing the most game-changing

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.770 
game-changing the most game-changing
thing<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:02.189> I've<00:04:02.340> saw<00:04:02.670> is<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.389> second

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
thing that I've saw is the second

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.990 
thing that I've saw is the second

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
assault LEvolution now for the stock

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.720 
assault LEvolution now for the stock
maps<00:04:06.299> they<00:04:06.569> weren't<00:04:06.930> really<00:04:07.730> game-changing

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
maps they weren't really game-changing

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.490 
maps they weren't really game-changing
they<00:04:08.909> didn't<00:04:09.239> really<00:04:09.480> do<00:04:09.659> anything<00:04:09.959> but

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
they didn't really do anything but

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.429 
they didn't really do anything but
really<00:04:11.280> before<00:04:11.819> i<00:04:11.849> got<00:04:12.090> so<00:04:12.450> detailed<00:04:13.260> and

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
really before i got so detailed and

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.279 
really before i got so detailed and
caught<00:04:13.680> up<00:04:13.829> into<00:04:14.389> carrier<00:04:15.389> saw<00:04:15.719> i<00:04:15.930> want<00:04:16.199> to

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
caught up into carrier saw i want to

caught up into carrier saw i want to
talk<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.680> guys<00:04:16.709> about<00:04:17.489> something<00:04:18.239> that<00:04:18.539> I

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
talk to you guys about something that I

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.349 
talk to you guys about something that I
think<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:19.259> going<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.739> be<00:04:19.769> game<00:04:20.160> breaking<00:04:20.489> now<00:04:21.329> I

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
think is going to be game breaking now I

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.240 
think is going to be game breaking now I
can<00:04:21.780> be<00:04:21.930> wrong<00:04:22.139> I<00:04:22.440> could<00:04:22.680> be<00:04:22.770> totally<00:04:23.009> wrong

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
can be wrong I could be totally wrong

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.689 
can be wrong I could be totally wrong
and<00:04:23.729> everything<00:04:24.360> can<00:04:24.750> go<00:04:24.810> by<00:04:25.530> so<00:04:25.919> well<00:04:26.190> as<00:04:26.400> well

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
and everything can go by so well as well

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.270 
and everything can go by so well as well
but<00:04:27.360> I'm<00:04:27.840> starting<00:04:28.229> to<00:04:28.259> think<00:04:28.349> the<00:04:28.740> dice<00:04:29.009> is

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.129 
care I knew they were going to patch it
eventually<00:04:49.789> but<00:04:50.789> now<00:04:51.030> they're<00:04:51.360> integrating

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
eventually but now they're integrating

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.800 
eventually but now they're integrating
auntie<00:04:52.830> Haley<00:04:53.070> mines<00:04:53.460> and<00:04:53.970> they're<00:04:54.509> going<00:04:54.690> to

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
auntie Haley mines and they're going to

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.550 
auntie Haley mines and they're going to
be<00:04:54.990> able<00:04:55.139> to<00:04:55.440> disable<00:04:56.430> or<00:04:57.000> damage<00:04:57.840> helicopters

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560

if<00:04:58.740> they<00:04:58.860> fly<00:04:59.130> over<00:04:59.159> them<00:04:59.729> now<00:05:00.389> I<00:05:00.419> have<00:05:00.539> seen<00:05:00.930> a

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
if they fly over them now I have seen a

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.339 
if they fly over them now I have seen a
few<00:05:01.400> videos<00:05:02.400> on<00:05:02.909> this<00:05:03.090> gadget<00:05:03.360> in<00:05:03.840> real<00:05:04.080> life

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
few videos on this gadget in real life

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.760 
few videos on this gadget in real life
and<00:05:04.740> it<00:05:05.460> looks<00:05:05.699> potentially<00:05:05.990> devastating<00:05:06.990> it

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
and it looks potentially devastating it

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.370 
and it looks potentially devastating it
looks<00:05:08.220> like<00:05:08.370> you<00:05:08.490> can<00:05:08.669> disable<00:05:08.940> or<00:05:09.720> completely

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
looks like you can disable or completely

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.850 
looks like you can disable or completely
take<00:05:10.740> out<00:05:10.949> a<00:05:10.979> helicopter<00:05:11.880> but<00:05:12.570> I<00:05:12.599> know<00:05:12.780> dice<00:05:13.470> is

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
take out a helicopter but I know dice is

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.740 
take out a helicopter but I know dice is
really<00:05:14.759> smart<00:05:15.060> they're<00:05:15.300> not<00:05:15.449> going<00:05:15.630> to

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
really smart they're not going to

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.420 
really smart they're not going to
integrate<00:05:16.320> it<00:05:16.650> so<00:05:16.800> it<00:05:16.919> can<00:05:16.949> take<00:05:17.250> out<00:05:17.400> a

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
integrate it so it can take out a

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.810 
integrate it so it can take out a
helicopter<00:05:18.060> maybe<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:18.930> can<00:05:19.139> damage<00:05:19.380> or<00:05:19.889> give

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
helicopter maybe it can damage or give

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.939 
helicopter maybe it can damage or give
that<00:05:21.060> we're<00:05:21.300> just<00:05:21.599> abling<00:05:22.110> effect<00:05:22.620> that<00:05:22.830> they

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
that we're just abling effect that they

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.850 
that we're just abling effect that they

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
implement it into battlefield 4 just a

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.670 
implement it into battlefield 4 just a
automatic<00:05:26.430> critical<00:05:27.090> hit<00:05:27.330> but<00:05:28.050> I<00:05:28.199> really

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680

don't want to see these in battlefield I
feel<00:05:31.440> like<00:05:31.590> they<00:05:31.740> really<00:05:32.009> don't<00:05:32.340> have<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.580> place

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
like so many things that can take out

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.100 
like so many things that can take out
air<00:05:48.660> are<00:05:48.930> ready<00:05:49.280> why<00:05:50.280> do<00:05:50.340> we<00:05:50.699> need<00:05:50.940> more<00:05:51.630> things

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
air are ready why do we need more things

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.100 
air are ready why do we need more things
like<00:05:52.410> this<00:05:53.030> there's<00:05:54.030> two<00:05:54.330> ways<00:05:54.570> this<00:05:54.870> thing

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
like this there's two ways this thing

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.290 
like this there's two ways this thing
can<00:05:55.350> work<00:05:55.530> it<00:05:55.830> automatically<00:05:56.490> gives<00:05:56.940> that

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
can work it automatically gives that

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.120 
can work it automatically gives that
critical<00:05:57.900> hit<00:05:58.380> effect<00:05:58.889> with<00:05:59.790> no<00:06:00.180> damage<00:06:00.510> or

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
critical hit effect with no damage or

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.100 
critical hit effect with no damage or
does<00:06:02.130> damage<00:06:02.490> but<00:06:03.060> it<00:06:03.150> doesn't<00:06:03.510> critical<00:06:03.900> hit

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
does damage but it doesn't critical hit

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.950 
does damage but it doesn't critical hit
that's<00:06:04.620> the<00:06:04.770> only<00:06:05.100> way<00:06:05.340> I<00:06:05.449> figure<00:06:06.449> that<00:06:06.780> they

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
that's the only way I figure that they

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.980 
that's the only way I figure that they
can<00:06:07.169> balance<00:06:07.620> it<00:06:08.070> in<00:06:08.790> a<00:06:09.240> lot<00:06:09.540> of<00:06:09.690> people's

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
can balance it in a lot of people's

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.350 
can balance it in a lot of people's
opinion<00:06:10.470> and<00:06:10.650> I<00:06:10.710> see<00:06:10.949> you<00:06:11.070> guys<00:06:11.250> opinion<00:06:11.820> you

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
opinion and I see you guys opinion you

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.020

think<00:06:12.690> that<00:06:12.960> a<00:06:13.139> lot<00:06:13.440> of<00:06:13.500> people<00:06:13.620> run<00:06:14.460> the

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
think that a lot of people run the

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
all good for that but isn't that a

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.600 
all good for that but isn't that a
little<00:06:33.210> bit<00:06:33.419> overpowered<00:06:34.169> and<00:06:34.680> also<00:06:35.130> they're

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
little bit overpowered and also they're

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.060 
little bit overpowered and also they're
bringing<00:06:36.270> in<00:06:36.539> a<00:06:36.840> grenade<00:06:37.380> launcher<00:06:37.860> that

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
shoots three grenades before you have to

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.490 
shoots three grenades before you have to
reload<00:06:41.010> and<00:06:41.669> I<00:06:42.270> think<00:06:42.660> they're<00:06:42.840> applying<00:06:43.199> the

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
reload and I think they're applying the

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.710 
reload and I think they're applying the
same<00:06:43.770> idea<00:06:44.190> they're<00:06:44.820> trying<00:06:45.060> to<00:06:45.120> get<00:06:45.240> people
