00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
like there was just a lot more that we

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.710 
like there was just a lot more that we
could<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.700> doing<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.239> the<00:02:00.330> borderlands

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
could be doing in the borderlands

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.850 
could be doing in the borderlands
universe<00:02:00.929> and<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.399> idea<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:03.060> another

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
standalone experience had come up it

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.889 
standalone experience had come up it
really<00:02:06.720> came<00:02:07.020> from<00:02:07.349> a<00:02:07.830> sort<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.250> mutual

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
really came from a sort of mutual

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.780 
really came from a sort of mutual

momentum to the logical place of what

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.490 
momentum to the logical place of what
can<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:12.000> do<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.330> would<00:02:12.480> be<00:02:12.599> fun<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.290> cool

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
can we do that would be fun and cool

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
funny coincidence we just kind of

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.540 
funny coincidence we just kind of
wrapped<00:03:09.170> up<00:03:09.290> ten<00:03:09.590> years<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.980> development<00:03:10.340> on

working on this game Borderlands the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.470 
working on this game Borderlands the
pre-sequel<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:16.400> way<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:16.700> generally<00:03:17.030> works<00:03:17.060> is

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
pre-sequel the way it generally works is

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.229 
pre-sequel the way it generally works is
I<00:03:17.510> think<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:17.989> lot<00:03:18.110> of<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.260> design<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.760> an<00:03:20.030> arrow

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
I think a lot of the design and an arrow

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.970 
I think a lot of the design and an arrow
stuff<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.660> handled<00:03:20.870> over<00:03:20.989> here<00:03:21.260> we<00:03:21.500> have<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.950> lot

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
stuff is handled over here we have a lot

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.790 
stuff is handled over here we have a lot
of<00:03:22.130> really<00:03:22.760> talented<00:03:22.910> archives<00:03:23.630> /<00:03:23.840> in<00:03:24.080> dollars

who<00:03:24.980> handle<00:03:25.340> all<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.550> direction<00:03:25.820> which<00:03:26.540> we

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
who handle all the direction which we

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.320 
who handle all the direction which we

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
then kind of implement over here so

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.660 
then kind of implement over here so
there's<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:29.930> lot<00:03:30.080> of<00:03:30.140> different<00:03:30.860> like<00:03:31.220> studios

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
there's a lot of different like studios

there's a lot of different like studios
working<00:03:32.480> on<00:03:32.600> this<00:03:32.720> oh<00:03:32.959> man<00:03:33.410> we<00:03:33.590> have<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.709> sort<00:03:33.920> of

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
working on this oh man we have a sort of

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.350 
working on this oh man we have a sort of
juggle<00:03:34.489> between<00:03:34.549> it<00:03:34.760> but<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:34.940> seems<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.209> work

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
juggle between it but it seems to work

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.970 
juggle between it but it seems to work
pretty<00:03:35.480> well<00:03:35.630> we<00:03:36.079> found<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.650> lot<00:03:36.920> of

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
pretty well we found a lot of

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.640 
pretty well we found a lot of
similarities<00:03:37.850> between<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.360> way<00:03:38.690> we<00:03:38.900> work<00:03:39.140> to

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
similarities between the way we work to

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.610 
similarities between the way we work to
the<00:03:39.739> point<00:03:39.980> where<00:03:40.570> l<00:03:41.570> streets<00:03:41.930> just<00:03:42.320> come<00:03:42.470> out

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
the point where l streets just come out

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.720

naturally<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.130> never<00:03:43.370> would<00:03:43.519> have<00:03:43.549> expected

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
naturally I never would have expected

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.420 
naturally I never would have expected
that<00:03:44.680> Australians<00:03:45.680> would<00:03:45.799> get<00:03:45.950> along<00:03:46.070> really

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
that Australians would get along really

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.759 
that Australians would get along really
well<00:03:46.549> with<00:03:46.700> Texans<00:03:47.500> there's<00:03:48.500> just<00:03:48.680> something

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
well with Texans there's just something

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.740 
well with Texans there's just something
between<00:03:49.220> our<00:03:49.579> two<00:03:49.730> series<00:03:50.120> we<00:03:50.299> seem<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:50.630> get

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
between our two series we seem to get

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.470 
between our two series we seem to get
each<00:03:50.870> other<00:03:51.110> pretty<00:03:51.260> well<00:03:52.239> it's<00:03:53.239> very

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
each other pretty well it's very

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.750 
each other pretty well it's very
important<00:03:54.110> that<00:03:54.140> we<00:03:54.500> reach<00:03:54.829> our<00:03:55.040> goals<00:03:55.280> every

important that we reach our goals every

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.220 
important that we reach our goals every

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
week because at this point there's

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.930 
week because at this point there's
nothing<00:03:57.350> that<00:03:57.680> we<00:03:57.769> can<00:03:57.920> say<00:03:58.160> or<00:03:58.400> while<00:03:58.700> we<00:03:58.820> keep

it<00:03:59.060> for<00:03:59.239> later<00:03:59.360> we'll<00:03:59.660> see<00:03:59.780> that<00:03:59.930> later

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
it for later we'll see that later

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.930 
it for later we'll see that later
because<00:04:00.470> I<00:04:00.530> won't<00:04:00.769> be<00:04:00.829> any<00:04:01.100> later<00:04:01.250> if<00:04:01.610> there's
