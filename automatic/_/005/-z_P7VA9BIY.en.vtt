00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.190
 campaign funded with the contribution 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.190
 European Union and Italy 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.520
 improve the quality of olives for 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.960
 get a healthier oil and this 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.320
 the target of the offspring 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.000
 yes starting from 1 April 2012 the 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.560
 offspring was the beneficiary 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.810
 obviously after having presented a 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.430
 project at national level in 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.410
 financing with regard to the 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.379
 improvement of oil quality e 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.420
 table olives are tied 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.670
 strictly to the proceeding then 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.620
 qualitative and productive as well as also 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.989
 with particular training attention 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.920
 oil quality and impact 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.310
 environmental 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.649
 the project activities have unraveled 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.020
 and they will unravel because they will go to 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.720
 then finish March 30th of the 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.610
 next year is precisely for the activity 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.320
 that quality and that is hard 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.790
 that practically with regards to 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.280
 environmental impact 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.850
 in this case we are in today 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.399
 pilot field because one of the activities 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.350
 own regulation centers 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.329
 community is to go to 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.209
 set up pilot fields, for example 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:15.100
 in which to go to fix then a 

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:17.679
 implement all the so-called 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.109
 agricultural practices or in any case the lines 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.779
 guide we say regulated at level a 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:24.670
 community level for obtaining 

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:27.189
 good quality olives then of 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.819
 consequently a good quality oil 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:32.499
 in this case in this pilot field 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.869
 equipped let's say over the phone 

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:37.359
 demonstrative we are carrying out a 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.179
 integrated fertilization project 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:42.099
 because entirely the species of the olive tree 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.990
 it is however a rustic plant therefore in 

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:45.729
 able to live and survive 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.920
 also produce sparta in environments ii 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.079
 however also true that the appearance 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.249
 qualitative the quantitative aspect is 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.959
 the appearance also of alternation 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:54.939
 production is affected 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:58.179
 how important it is to fertilize 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.529
 the olive grove is fundamental is one of the 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.770
 techniques that together with pruning 

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:05.439
 irrigation manages to produce a 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.359
 olive grove so not only agronomists nothing 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.670
 convenient but also sustainable 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:11.670
 indeed 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.930
 in this experimentation and how it is 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.900
 are trying different types of 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.849
 fertilizing the techniques with which one 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.120
 Ministers may manure olive grove 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.830
 have increased in recent years and 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.599
 that in traditional agriculture yes 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.280
 he only knew the administration 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.989
 of soil fertilizers 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.550
 thanks to the introduction of irrigation 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.560
 also in olive growing 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.120
 now we have the possibility of firth 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.700
 irrigate increasing considerably 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.500
 the effectiveness and efficiency of 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.170
 this fertilization is especially low 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.330
 for nitrogen fertilizers which 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.160
 notoriously they are easily washbasins 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.200
 in the ground and therefore are the most subject 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.330
 to losses due to washout and for 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.010
 evaporation and direct with the 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.739
 we can do fertigation instead 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.959
 increase distribution efficiency 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.450
 in this I repeat it is not in aid 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.190
 possible for shooting competitions then also 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.870
 in the olive growers birth we have the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.459
 possibility to do not only 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.739
 fertilizations to the ground but also 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.830
 clear leaves fertilizers 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.600
 there are a lot of foliar fertilizations 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.519
 important in the long dry turin 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.709
 because they allow you to respect those 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.810
 which are the physiological needs of the 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.920
 in fact, always remaining in the 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.470
 nitrogen field 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.299
 imagine that 40 percent of the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.060
 nitrogen requirement than in a year 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.489
 consumes the olive grove is used by the 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.500
 vegetative restart up to the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.590
 flowering at a time of year when 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.209
 normally it does not irrigate and I take with the 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.829
 giving fertilization is possible 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.959
 administers 40 percent of the 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.510
 July needs just in the most phases 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:45.000
 important the rest of the nitrogen goes 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:48.269
 distributed made equally among 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.310
 flowering and fruit set and then up 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.560
 to the maturation of the fruit instead for 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.510
 potassium is things for phosphorus 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.790
 they are calmer with fertilization 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.700
 foliar we can also administer 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.700
 those and micronutrients that can 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.340
 be necessary to make up for deficiencies 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.889
 which it manifests itself in the course of 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.280
 vegetation in olive growing in 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:13.049
 dry as they were said to bind them 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.239
 the leaf approximation is an excellent one 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.180
 help for olive growers in 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.180
 nutrition management 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.970
 this is also made possible by the 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.740
 fact that foliar fertilization comes 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.199
 done jointly with the normals 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.930
 pesticide treatments normally 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.610
 with a fertilizer return or 20 20 20 you can 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.550
 very well use with two treatments 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.530
 both for the moth and for the fly one 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.449
 integrated olive grove management is not 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.949
 made only of fertilization but 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.560
 also monitoring of 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.900
 certain phytopathologies an essential node 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.150
 of an integrated control of an olive grove 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.460
 and precisely the monitoring of the 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.780
 insects and is pathogenic in general the 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.300
 monitoring is followed 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.430
 periodically of the prodi technicians 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.410
 mainly concerns the key insects 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.500
 of the olive grove we follow this 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.099
 with many tropic- type chroma traps 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.720
 then activated with fair hormones 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.990
 we recommend the treatment or only 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.910
 if a certain threshold is exceeded 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.919
 of the presence of the insect also because 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.680
 only in this case it comes economically 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.120
 justified this type of treatment 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.090
 we must take into account that the parasites 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.789
 the olive's key is the fly 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.860
 of the olive we have the bactrocera oleae 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.710
 that moth that a moth e 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.180
 the peacock eye which is a parasite 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.789
 a disease is a typical disease 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.510
 of the olive grove and a scrub 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:38.330
 typical of fu was present on the leaves 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.310
 then the control and of these of 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.659
 these pathogens is very important for 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.729
 having a daddy farming is useful 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:49.430
 monitoring as I said is done in 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.139
 different way for some especially 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.940
 for insects it is run through 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:55.280
 instead of traps for diseases 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.500
 funginee is important to make inspections 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.830
 in the field and verify the presence of the 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.830
 themselves 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:06.030
 campaign funded with the contribution 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.030
 European Union and Italy
