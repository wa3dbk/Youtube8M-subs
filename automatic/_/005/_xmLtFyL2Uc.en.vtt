00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.000
 hello now I'll tell you about 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.880
 one great program that 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.210
 unpacks the processor cores which 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:20.939
 currently parked and not working 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.949
 Well, it usually helps in games 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.550
 any 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:30.480
 powerful programs and things like that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.350
 We go in daddy that downloaded and here 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.820
 have on park KP 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:41.030
 run as administrator and 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.030
 push check status check status 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.030
 we wait 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:25.690
 as you can see, I have as many as four cores 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:30.880
 just parked and we push 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:34.230
 on park half time to park everything went 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.230
 parking process times 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.469
 Now we check again click 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.469
 check status 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:48.110
 we have all the unpacked kernels I do nâ€™t know 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.050
 how much will this speed increase in games 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.630
 or programs but at least I'm on 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.160
 I felt that on my 8-core 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.490
 processor from ppm 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.290
 it helps me a lot after 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:08.260
 this we close the program and 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.260
 reboot the computer all bye
