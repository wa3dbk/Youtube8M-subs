their handle here and then the cable for

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.930 
their handle here and then the cable for
this<00:00:46.980> part<00:00:47.989> goes<00:00:48.989> up<00:00:49.230> into<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.640> little

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
this part goes up into in this little

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.010 
this part goes up into in this little
hole<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.170> take<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.559> handle<00:00:53.550> off<00:00:54.020> to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
hole we have to take this handle off to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.290 
hole we have to take this handle off to
undo<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.399> plastic<00:00:56.699> part<00:00:57.030> basically

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
undo it and this plastic part basically

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.930 
undo it and this plastic part basically
falls<00:00:57.870> off<00:00:58.520> kind<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.579> breaks<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:01.370> that's<00:01:02.370> okay

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
falls off kind of breaks but that's okay

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.770 
falls off kind of breaks but that's okay
because<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.359> old<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.090> once<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.570> this

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
because it's old so once you have this

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.880 
because it's old so once you have this
part<00:01:07.110> off<00:01:08.630> then<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> main

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
part off then you can get to the main

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.660 
part off then you can get to the main
problem<00:01:12.710> well<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.580> take

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
problem well and then you have to take

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.070 
problem well and then you have to take
this<00:01:14.880> off<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.720> little<00:01:16.670> flapper<00:01:17.670> thing<00:01:18.080> and

here's<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.470> latch<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:21.000> that's<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.810> part<00:01:22.020> you

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
here's a latch and that's the part you

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.130 
here's a latch and that's the part you
have<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.259> oil<00:01:22.409> right<00:01:22.920> there<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.750> spring<00:01:24.750> Park

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
have to oil right there that spring Park

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.840 
have to oil right there that spring Park
and<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:26.250> little<00:01:26.990> rivet<00:01:28.280> then<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.400> goes<00:01:29.520> up<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
and a little rivet then it goes up and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.780 
and a little rivet then it goes up and
down<00:01:29.880> freely<00:01:30.860> if<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:32.040> doing<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.369> rusty<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
down freely if you're doing so rusty you

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.620 
down freely if you're doing so rusty you
can't<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.240> open

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
can't get it open
