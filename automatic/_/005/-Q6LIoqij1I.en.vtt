00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:08.160
 We'll learn about geoe called wiki once an hour usually common 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.429
 Project management tools use a system called wiki 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.609
 I'm offering it. RedMine is no exception. 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:20.490
 Members of this project using the wiki in RedMain 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:25.410
 Basically what you should be familiar with 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.320
 You can get a lot of information from 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.079
 Or knowledge to the wiki system 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.719
 It is the role of storing and structuring this knowledge for such a purpose. 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.010
 It's called wiki . 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.200
 So for me to do so, bd Have you heard of Wikipedia in the world 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.610
 Give me the biggest open dictionary 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:53.399
 So it does take enlargement feature that Wikipedia is not Wikipedia 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.510
 With this connection between words and words, this huge knowledge information system 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.420
 Make me 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.379
 Here you open Wikipedia . 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.250
 2 wiki videos on the system we are learning, called RedMain 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.850
 The page is 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.380
 So here we have a lot of definitions about RedMain 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.729
 There are red and blue here, and these are links. 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:19.080
 So if you go into the open source and click on the blue link 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.100
 Let's take a look at the concept of open source as another article 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.470
 I'm out. 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.229
 I have these words again in this document , so I click on the word and click 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.130
 If you go in, you move the word again . 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.000
 If you look at it, here's the red link that says Pandora 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.880
 You know. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.880
 As you can see, click on the link 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:47.490
 Pandora is said to make the console, that is, there is a link that is just that link 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:51.930
 This means that the link does not yet have a document to point to 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:57.440
 You guys here tell me about what he calls Pandora. 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:02.310
 Once you have written and saved, we have automatically 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:06.119
 Links that are not linked to documents that are not linked 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.440
 This link takes you back to the second edition 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.239
 This is the link to the document you just created . 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.440
 It's a common form. 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:20.430
 And Red Mine 's Mickey system we'll learn is just like this 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.269
 Consonants go into RedMine and explain about RedMine's wiki 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.830
 I will 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:27.390
 Now, the screen you are seeing is called its of yg. 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.100
 Homepage of 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.760
 This is a project for building parts that are in them as 2 Wiki 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.430
 You can see. 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:41.010
 If you click here 2 open title so ig for the project wiki 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:46.829
 How the system can be seen 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:52.410
 In my case, it is the title that comes out with the office, 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:53.340
 There are three things in the other box. 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.870
 It itgoyo 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:02.880
 Yogurt is broken down each link is red here is the current 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:08.489
 If you click on a link as you can see because there is no link, the 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:11.870
 You send it to the editor that creates the document. 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.870
 After you've written the content , 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.770
 U 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.340
 And save 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:31.230
 If you do this, then this document has been created. 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.549
 If we go back to the wiki and click on the content in that state, 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.180
 It came out. 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.620
 And as you can see, if you already have a document already made in production 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.269
 In blue 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.560
 The text is displayed, so if you click on 2 minutes 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.610
 Page also raguyo 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:52.980
 Here we look at it again, click the link in that they learned of the plan 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:57.930
 So that's the heat and so on . So now the documents and documents 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:01.980
 It is essential the ability to create any link between inde look out that way 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.730
 Let's start by selecting the page you want to edit. 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.480
 If you press the Edit button there, you will be free to see the screen. 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:13.859
 Here, h1, which is in front of you, 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.079
 opel so ig is the title of this document 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:19.620
 It's metadata. 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:23.910
 Next time we are going through wiki grammar classes 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:27.740
 I'll take a closer look at these things when I look at the syntax on the wiki. 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:31.700
 I do not think I should use these things right now. 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.690
 I'm writing this thing is gonna party to return here twice a bit 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.670
 I promise . 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:42.830
 And to close the dialog twice, and when less that the content between the two 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:46.880
 The text called content is automatically linked, and the corresponding 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:51.800
 If the document exists, the minutes of each other 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:58.340
 If the link does not exist, 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.940
 If the editor you can create a document that corresponds to the link today so 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.120
 I am. 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:07.840
 So let me add one. 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.840
 5 Tube is a word that we use short of open ttl 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:20.290
 This is how we write our staff like this . 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:22.660
 As you can see , the link looks like you see it , but the current document is linked. 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:27.180
 Because it is not there, it is marked in red. 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:29.180
 When I click on it , I get a blank document. 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.180
 U 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.360
 5 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:45.770
 As a singer sourdough Ning 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.570
 Please enter this and our members will be able to click and Save. 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.479
 Like this 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:55.130
 5 The list of people who made the dance is made like this 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:56.360
 Almost all of the people I see pushing the protest key and making the orts are blue 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.350
 It's changed. 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:04.610
 If I click on it, I will move the page I just created . 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:09.139
 So if you want to delete this page, click Delete. 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.780
 If you want to see the history of changes on this page, 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:15.950
 How can I see the changed support 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:21.169
 So here I just saw this one I see now, even if you're in an important change 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:25.550
 For example, if you click the history here on the homepage, 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:29.510
 In other words, this wiki page has a main page 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:36.169
 It keeps track of how it changed. 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:41.539
 So 6 is the most recent version. 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:47.549
 It's ingeo the second before the last saved version, click yogeo differences 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:52.169
 You can look at the check out if there are any differences 

00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:57.029
 So why do we need to edit the 2 wiki system? 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:59.549
 Not everyone can edit at the same time , 

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:04.709
 It's because there's a document going on 

00:06:59.549 --> 00:07:08.080
 So if you edit this document at the same time , the wiki system will crash 

00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:10.779
 It will tell you it happened. 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.899
 So what is the wiki system so far? 

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:18.009
 Why use wiki and when to use it 

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:19.089
 And how about writing a document on wiki 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:25.110
 I gave you an explanation. 

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:25.110
 In this next video, I'll explain the grammar on the wiki.
