 on a web page hill on a new product we have this very must 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.120
 well high tech that is in a sip and that allows us to show

 big goblins what s &amp; p in dotcom schools 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.910
 and what would be the disappointment of this project 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.610
 piatti is something very interesting we have the platform that has been since 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.490
 schools that is a locally dynamic internet portal 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.480
 where we show all the educational offer that hayek in the different cities in 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.280

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.610
 representatives of the world of education 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.310
 but we are still developing what is a group that is a disk 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.700
 the sun city that allows us to show 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
 aetna different the educational offer of the entity 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.320
 in a format already of video in high definition 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.810
 here we go with this or why it is important because it is relevant because 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.690
 many times these institutes these schools have excellent facilities 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.230
 by the way operas that some have soccer fields this impressive 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.600
 heller will have chemistry or computer labs or fascinating with 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.710
 with the Amazon technology 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.670
 but it is not possible to show them on an advertising poster in a photograph 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.740
 with spaces are very small 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.650
 well then Moscow show tone 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.320
 instead, what comes next if you do not see yourself with dotcoms allows us to show 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.110
 all those facilities that these institutes have these schools 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.800
 through a video in high definition and likewise we 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.600
 allows interviewing master directors until teacher's class 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.890
 to the same students and parents so that they can express their comments 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.290
 about that institution 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.399
 as you see that it is an integral concept what avant-garde that allows us then 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.140
 develop your this type of technology and present it to 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.109
 future students who can enter that school 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.949
 and if any school or institute will be interested in promoting with us 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:22.119
 how can he do it 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.489

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:58.739
 where s will be included by saints a tour that will visit the different 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.979
 schools to the different 100 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:06.569
 the secondary and preparatory primaries carry this information obviously 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.739
 for the students who are going to leave and who are going to look for a new income in another 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:10.459
 school 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.329
 This is very important because the disc is going to be distributed directly to the 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.629
 students in schools 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.889

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.739
 educational to these students by psychologists or specialized people 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.760
 that vahidi somehow goes to them by making known the educational offer

 percent is also going to implement a promotional campaign by 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.009
 cent and that will then consist in distributing 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:38.699
 in what is being octane tase and informative to give t-shirts 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:42.589
 all an advertising campaign many times the young always pay 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:46.519
 It is a bit difficult to call them attention to see a product 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:47.759
 of informative no 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.859
 then in fact or even the same if it will bring 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.719
 we are not leaving even if it is so serious that a video game platform is brought to them 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:55.609
 give away 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.770
 music to music platforms cetera 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.510
 that are of the taste of the students so that the given amount they can see the 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.359
 cycling they fancy seeing it 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.499
 percent in some cases and we only gave it because we were a magazine of 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:09.449
 advertisements 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.519
 we would look like he put many others not 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.400
 but you sneak something very important that is that it has everything a 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.890
 editorial platform that you present informative segments 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.580
 about education interviews with the main actors of this 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.090

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:53.640
 the schools do not 2 that kind of issues that they're from ekin tees public
