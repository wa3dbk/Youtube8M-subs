00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.210
 but 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.210
 good in this tutorial 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.960
 I come to tell you a possible solution 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.030
 for the problem of the 2003 pÃ¨re when 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.730
 played an exhibition game or a 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.930
 directors cup match with us 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.750
 it gives an error and they can not play us 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.920
 well let's open the previous game of 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.280
 error but what 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.360
 everyone gave them that error and they do not know 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.300
 who is here 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.780
 Something they say the bump but I'm going to play 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.470
 for as long as I find a solution that 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.720
 it worked for me 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.270
 I do not know if all will work for them but 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.650
 it can be a contribution 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.650
 as a game 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.750
 that a Labor Party of 300 without means 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.310
 equipment me here 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.660
 move there that happens 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.660
 if there is no solution 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:18.500
 We hope that you reach the gate 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.500
 very well the solution that I 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.080
 and if that's what I did it was 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.310
 I do not have eight and when many things 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.229
 really running and I think I do not know 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.020
 which one is really but 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.380
 some of this can give us errors with 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.740
 the game a major program was filmed in 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.740
 reality 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.710
 I close everything 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.720
 the processes but some that do not go 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.570
 to close from here 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.830
 I think it's not only important 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.270
 there are also some programs that serve 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.110
 to close these processes that are 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.460
 unnecessary of really going to play 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:06.540
 but I do not manually voya 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.950
 here I am in the middle of the grana area 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.950
 carlos the start bar 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.970
 and the secondary one and it will start while 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.740
 details the route they are going to apply all 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.950
 applications processes 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.350
 the knot that I close what I think not 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.780
 they are very important as it is 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:36.050
 question of microsoft office that are 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.310
 downloading update and content 2002 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:43.180
 to play we finish them 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.610
 they like to finish everything and at the end of 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.750
 half are 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.490
 elisa drinks more important 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.490
 but like this 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:00.040
 the antivirus and leave it I leave it 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.900
 all good is forgetting 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.420
 because they have finished the process 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.290
 down 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.290
 we have finished the process 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.010
 the processes have been closed said 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.010
 before the audio 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.760
 antivirus 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.580
 but there are some that are like they are 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.200
 downloading program updates 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.990
 that others can close is not going to give 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.980
 no reason 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:34.000
 good and we close most eyes 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.000
 it decreased quite 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.700
 being alone and with the audio and the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.010
 antivirus 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.860
 well let's see if what works 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.410
 neighbors 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.330
 after closing all processes 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.330
 Let's go to the game 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.670
 come on, the bari 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.670
 ah 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.110
 I am 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:19.880
 they are not the best 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.880
 with these fertile soils 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.410
 why 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.870
 They are very busy 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.870
 this is only common 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.650
 Red 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.650
 mistakes that has distorted I have now 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.650
 average 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.449
 spectacular 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.130
 t 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.800
 never 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.930
 as we see but also as 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.360
 seasonal 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.360
 and then they are not 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.730
 howard trust 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.450
 the whole strategy 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.880
 because a monument 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.450
 missed it does not have the same role no 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.450
 is it fair 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.850
 with the turn of the desk so that 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.850
 serve with him says it's not safe 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:47.820
 of freedom 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:51.920
 I'm pavilion 16 if they knew 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.920
 how do they ask all
