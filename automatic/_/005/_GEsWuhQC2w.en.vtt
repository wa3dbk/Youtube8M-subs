00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.670 
I did a little holiday themed research
to<00:01:02.340> find<00:01:02.550> out<00:01:02.760> whether<00:01:03.270> or<00:01:03.390> not<00:01:03.570> men<00:01:03.960> really

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
to find out whether or not men really

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.149 
to find out whether or not men really
are<00:01:04.710> all<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.400> bad<00:01:05.670> at<00:01:06.560> gift-giving<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.070> what

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the research bears out is that it's not

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.350 
the research bears out is that it's not
necessarily<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.460> men<00:01:11.729> are<00:01:11.970> worse<00:01:12.180> at
