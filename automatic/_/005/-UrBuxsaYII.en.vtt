00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
the acoustic steel string guitar and

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.930 
the acoustic steel string guitar and
i've<00:00:10.200> gone<00:00:10.410> over<00:00:10.580> to<00:00:11.580> tuning<00:00:11.969> techniques<00:00:13.940> for

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
i've gone over to tuning techniques for

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.550 
i've gone over to tuning techniques for
just<00:00:15.630> your<00:00:16.410> standard<00:00:16.949> tuning<00:00:18.109> I'd<00:00:19.109> like<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.439> go

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
just your standard tuning I'd like to go

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.450 
just your standard tuning I'd like to go
over<00:00:19.939> to<00:00:20.939> alternative<00:00:21.600> tunings<00:00:22.310> and<00:00:23.310> they're

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
over to alternative tunings and they're

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.779 
over to alternative tunings and they're
both<00:00:23.580> related<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.269> first<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.720> drop<00:00:24.990> D<00:00:25.789> now

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
both related the first is drop D now

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.269 
both related the first is drop D now
drop<00:00:27.029> D<00:00:27.210> refers<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.779> dropping<00:00:28.109> your<00:00:28.529> low<00:00:29.039> E

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
drop D refers to dropping your low E

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.020 
drop D refers to dropping your low E
string<00:00:29.420> down<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> d<00:00:31.579> after<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.700> do<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
string down to a d after you do this a

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.240 
string down to a d after you do this a
few<00:00:33.120> times<00:00:33.300> you'll<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.899> able<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.079> do<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.559> just

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
few times you'll be able to do it just

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:49.820 
few times you'll be able to do it just
by<00:00:35.460> ear<00:00:37.340> so<00:00:38.340> let's<00:00:38.520> see

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.950 

just<00:00:50.830> took<00:00:50.950> a<00:00:51.130> take<00:00:51.580> a<00:00:51.610> second<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.060> sync<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.930> a

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
just took a take a second to sync the a

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.710 
just took a take a second to sync the a
up<00:00:53.350> with<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:53.950> with<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:54.940> e<00:00:54.970> that's<00:00:55.420> all<00:00:55.600> you

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
up with the with the e that's all you

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.880 
up with the with the e that's all you
really<00:00:55.840> need

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
really need

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.600 
really need
that's<00:00:58.670> not<00:00:58.910> that<00:00:59.090> instructional<00:00:59.780> so

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.649 

I'll<00:01:05.610> show<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.909> how<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.300> it<00:01:06.330> using<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.750> piano

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.690 

if<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.259> don't<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> great<00:01:10.770> ear<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.460> pick

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
if you don't have a great ear just pick

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.139 
if you don't have a great ear just pick
a<00:01:11.729> d<00:01:12.600> out<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.109> piano

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.580 

we<00:01:17.149> played<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.509> few<00:01:17.720> times<00:01:17.780> get<00:01:18.290> it<00:01:18.380> in<00:01:18.500> your

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
we played a few times get it in your

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:27.550 
we played a few times get it in your
head

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.320 

you

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:38.410 

there<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.050> go<00:01:34.760> and<00:01:35.760> ultimately<00:01:35.910> it's<00:01:36.510> if

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
there you go and ultimately it's if

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.490 
there you go and ultimately it's if
ultimately<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.720> want<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.290> tune

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
ultimately you want it to be in tune

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.110 
ultimately you want it to be in tune
with<00:01:40.740> your<00:01:40.860> other<00:01:40.980> strings<00:01:41.370> so<00:01:41.670> if<00:01:41.910> it's

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
with your other strings so if it's

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.420 
with your other strings so if it's
perfectly<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.170> tune<00:01:43.380> with<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:43.770> piano<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.250> not

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
perfectly in tune with the piano but not

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.580 
perfectly in tune with the piano but not
in<00:01:44.550> tune<00:01:44.730> with<00:01:44.970> your<00:01:45.510> strings<00:01:45.840> maybe<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.260> few

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
in tune with your strings maybe a few

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.730 
in tune with your strings maybe a few
the<00:01:47.130> pianos<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.670> tune<00:01:48.080> take<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.230> time<00:01:49.440> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
the pianos out of tune take the time to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.980 
the pianos out of tune take the time to
to<00:01:50.670> tune<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.000> up<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.660> rest<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.930> your

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
to tune it up with the rest of your

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:00.370 
to tune it up with the rest of your
strings<00:01:57.260> this<00:01:58.260> just<00:01:58.470> gives<00:01:58.620> it<00:01:58.830> a<00:01:59.010> you<00:01:59.790> know<00:01:59.910> a
