okay so there we go I like that better
I'm<00:00:05.370> just<00:00:05.640> half<00:00:06.029> of<00:00:06.359> it<00:00:08.059> you<00:00:09.059> know<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.360> always

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599

I'm just half of it you know I always
have<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.050> stand<00:00:10.320> really<00:00:10.800> far<00:00:10.950> back<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.670> look

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.560 
but I think that's looking pretty good
I'm<00:00:14.130> gonna<00:00:14.280> get<00:00:14.400> some<00:00:14.549> circles<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.089> here<00:00:15.360> and

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
I'm gonna get some circles in here and

I'm gonna get some circles in here and
get<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.719> line<00:00:15.990> coming<00:00:16.230> through<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.300> I

00:01:31.339 --> 00:01:31.349 
most my right hand I think I think I'll

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:36.440 
most my right hand I think I think I'll
have<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.770> come<00:01:33.439> through<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:35.009> but<00:01:35.939> not<00:01:36.179> go

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
have it come through here but not go

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.139 
have it come through here but not go
over<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.899> just<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.469> it<00:01:40.849> how<00:01:41.849> does<00:01:42.000> that

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
over that just have it how does that

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.679 
over that just have it how does that
look

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
look

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.679 
look
I<00:01:42.860> think<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.009> looks<00:01:44.189> okay<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:45.299> kind<00:01:45.599> of

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
I think that looks okay it kind of

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.010 
I think that looks okay it kind of
follows<00:01:45.959> this<00:01:46.469> line<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:47.479> maybe<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.899> it

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
follows this line up here maybe have it

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.270 
follows this line up here maybe have it
just<00:01:49.200> start<00:01:49.590> come<00:01:50.250> out<00:01:50.399> right<00:01:50.640> here<00:01:55.280> leave

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
just start come out right here leave

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.570 
just start come out right here leave
this<00:01:56.489> line<00:01:56.819> should<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.420> go<00:01:57.659> out<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.140> up

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.260 

I<00:02:03.670> think<00:02:04.510> I'm<00:02:04.660> just<00:02:04.840> gonna<00:02:06.030> make<00:02:07.030> this

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
I think I'm just gonna make this

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.000 
I think I'm just gonna make this
manganese<00:02:07.750> blue<00:02:08.490> and<00:02:09.869> then<00:02:10.869> carve<00:02:11.470> into<00:02:11.860> it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
manganese blue and then carve into it

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.160 
manganese blue and then carve into it
the<00:02:12.220> circles<00:02:14.940> it's<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.120> final<00:02:16.510> things<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:17.140> I

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
the circles it's the final things that I

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.720 
the circles it's the final things that I
like<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.650> most<00:02:17.680> important<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.460> they<00:02:18.580> just

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
like the most important and they just

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.890 
like the most important and they just
take<00:02:18.940> time<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.360> have<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.600> think<00:02:19.810> about

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
take time and you have to think about

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.640 
take time and you have to think about
them<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:21.400> looks<00:02:21.670> infinitely<00:02:22.300> better

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
them and that looks infinitely better

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.420 
them and that looks infinitely better
infinitely<00:02:23.650> better<00:02:25.410> just<00:02:26.410> absolutely<00:02:27.220> so

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
infinitely better just absolutely so

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.570 
infinitely better just absolutely so
much<00:02:27.550> better<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:28.630> now<00:02:28.870> what<00:02:29.740> I<00:02:29.770> want<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.100> do<00:02:30.280> is

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
much better so now what I want to do is

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.580 
much better so now what I want to do is
with<00:02:30.850> my<00:02:31.030> nail<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.660> have<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.930> use<00:02:32.020> my<00:02:32.170> third

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
with my nail I have to use my third

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.920 
with my nail I have to use my third
finger<00:02:32.980> because<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.610> usually<00:02:34.150> use<00:02:34.450> my<00:02:34.480> thumb

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
finger because I usually use my thumb

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.360 
finger because I usually use my thumb
this<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:35.920> much<00:02:36.280> better<00:02:36.720> I'm<00:02:37.720> carving<00:02:38.290> in<00:02:38.770> some

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
this is much better I'm carving in some

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.170 
this is much better I'm carving in some
circles

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
circles

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.600 
circles
