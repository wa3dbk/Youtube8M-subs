00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 the work, people, all right, my name is 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.250
 carolina is the pedagogy course of pf 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.080
 and the field of step deep mine 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.559
 review about the book educate by 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.470
 Author Search 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.230
 so my review I found it so 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.160
 the author defines his thesis very well 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.710
 and he says so that research is a 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.199
 principle and that the student who is 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.349
 that it is imperative that 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.050
 participates is a student who will learn 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.790
 better than that student who only copies 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.570
 what the teacher writes on the in 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.940
 painting 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.370
 this student who only hears that only copies 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.190
 he will learn less than the student 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.820
 which research that interacts that participates 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.039
 with the teacher 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.190
 then he thinks that research is a 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.100
 way to educate and educate a citizen 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.059
 that the student who participates has 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 greater chances of being a year 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.490
 better to understand the matter better 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.220
 all this then also that the student who 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.320
 research has a differential because 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.590
 He runs after it, he'll understand better. 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.780
 the matter he will he will want 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.520
 interpret judge to criticize the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.799
 according to his opinion with that he goes 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.130
 learn will break the face like him 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.590
 same said on the video and will understand 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.570
 the content, not only did I hear what the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.930
 teacher has to say that many 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.350
 Sometimes it's the teacher's opinion. 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:44.130
 then he says he said he said that the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.369
 research is a framework of training and 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.549
 that the college of graduation they do not 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.060
 I do not think research is important 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.969
 for the student is the research will find 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.759
 more postgraduate courses 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.280
 doctorate where the student begins to 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.659
 searching before is not found 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.909
 very 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.770
 isaaa the union of the teacher and student to 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.979
 search to find to interact 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.330
 with matter is more hour by hour 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:19.860
 The oral spoken only to me but I copy 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.950
 written but this then he thinks that the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.459
 research is below education and there is no 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.110
 Radial class but it does not relieve the 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.709
 teacher does he think the teacher should 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.200
 always be in contact with a student 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.660
 he thinks that research should be a 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.150
 Everyday everyday attitude like the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.090
 student and teacher 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.739
 he thinks the research also forms a 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.769
 critical year student creative and who is not 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.200
 stay the zone that the class that is passed on and 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.930
 copied spoken not build anything he 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.900
 You will not receive any 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.879
 In this class, just copy is just talk then 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.640
 he is there at some points in 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.579
 relation to student research and research 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.190
 teacher has several points in the 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.739
 book that talks about these three points 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.139
 to the student teacher but I highlighted 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.109
 only a few 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:22.190
 then he say yes to the student 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:24.419
 must be is the appreciation of work 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.760
 in Group 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:29.400
 team but it should have a 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.450
 balance between individual work 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.880
 huh 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.489
 the student will be evaluated individually in 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.669
 team and the solidarity of the group as 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.519
 that the group as the group presented with 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:43.410
 the group performed the research task 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.470
 all this must be contact must be 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.389
 assessed by the teacher 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.400
 he also thinks that the teacher should 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.280
 provide teaching materials for 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.530
 students because otherwise they do not have as they 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.069
 then he puts some 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.470
 points that would be television movies dvds 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.989
 is the very use of the computer and that today 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.220
 in day is one of the most used items 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.740
 for research 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.920
 he also says that the student should be 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.590
 stimulated arguing argument 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.690
 of your research and he should know 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.739
 interpret your research material 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.830
 know what he is talking about so that he 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.040
 passive attitude of only the 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.720
 what class do I think I 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.910
 I really agree with the author that I think 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.820
 also that he said that the passive class 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.210
 is tiring that can only get in a 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.470
 an hour and forty minutes listening 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.300
 paying attention listening now 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.520
 paying attention understanding that the day 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.070
 Even talking is very complicated. 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.490
 then he thinks that with these methods the 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:52.930
 student will pass from the passive attitude towards 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:56.230
 the critical attitude of criticizing the 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.750
 What are you talking about? 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.840
 also considers that the assessment should be 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.870
 only in the form of proof because he 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.850
 think the year should know the teacher 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.580
 must know whether or not he has learned 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.190
 but not only in exchanges he must know 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.690
 through discussions discussion 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.860
 student's argument about what he or she 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.080
 is talking 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.020
 the participation of the installed and the everything 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:24.040
 this account will not make the evaluation of the 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.110
 teacher and for the now research 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.520
 about the teacher what are or some 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.970
 Points I Found 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.830
 about research on the teacher then 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.650
 he thinks that the teacher should build 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.810
 a pedagogical project of its own that 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.050
 he built and should be individualized 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:45.370
 which does not have to follow correctly as 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:47.980
 is to the pedagogical project of the school 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.110
 it as soon as the teacher should feel 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.210
 updating so that he has 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.760
 commitment to the student so that he 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.530
 talk things he thinks neither is 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.330
 so necessary student 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.660
 he acts also the teacher should do 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.900
 your teaching materials be it 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:09.320
 theoretical or practical because it is because 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.060
 So think the other you have to 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.000
 fight for there is no such kind of 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.070
 The lesson is to go over what you 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.380
 student listens to the teacher writes the student 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:22.040
 of the copy he thinks you have to vote 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.510
 against this type of class and he also 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.760
 think that the teacher has to be 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:29.240
 always updating always reinforcing 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.430
 your training to find events 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.310
 Postgraduate programs 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.139
 doctorates always seeking the best for 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.810
 your upgrade so it does not get the 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.490
 only in what he has learned does he think 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.520
 the teacher will always have to be always 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.710
 in constant learning because the 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.750
 teacher should never think so I already 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.320
 I know everything, you do not need to know anything else. 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.910
 because otherwise you will not have a 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:57.020
 meaning for education 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:59.210
 right then so I want to finish and 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.919
 I really enjoyed seeing you 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.260
 seen the videos and search on this 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:05.240
 book it some parts that I did not read 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.610
 all and all he still has some 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.750
 parts that do not increase any more 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:13.430
 in speech in universities I 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.950
 I leave here the point he talks about 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:19.160
 research is not widely used in 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:21.260
 universities and talk some more 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.460
 about the focus on universities in the 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.950
 book is not 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.410
 so that's what the singer I used 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.930
 method of making a video to explain 

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:32.270
 a little more about the book that I think 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.700
 which is a different method that people 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.400
 never does and that would be very interesting and 

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:40.580
 different from how he explains himself 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.740
 it's different than just writing in mister 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:46.280
 I read, I think I think it's going to be more 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:49.400
 fun and less tiring will also 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:52.000
 be easier to see me and I think I hear 

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.940
 I hope you have enjoyed it and 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.660
 and even eurides later I like mine 

00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:01.980
 video was the kiss and bye I hope 

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.980
 I liked it and such.
