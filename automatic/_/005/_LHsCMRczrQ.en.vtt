 700 Mexican pesos we are going to lower a 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.720
 little team tells us to md to 46 thousand 300 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.370
 we already discovered what processor brings 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.769
 to go down because the truth repeats us what 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.739
 same again and again this seller and we 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.729
 says here the exact specifications 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.140
 amd processor 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:00.729
 quarter 6,300 that these people usually 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.720
 I do not know why he multiplies them by two 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:07.780
 to get you out that has 7.4 gigabytes and 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.450
 after 8 gb of ram memory 333 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.000
 megahertz a pretty ram memory 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.549
 primitive so to speak a hard disk 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.730
 a terabyte video card sata m 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.070
 of 7,480 technologist 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.510
 direct x open gl a video card 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:29.350
 basic the truth and a change of word sc 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:33.190
 efe m2 with exit from de gea and fm2 port 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.620
 pci express and 4 usb 2.0 cabinet 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.140
 that club's aerocool and power source 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.300
 of 450 watts 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.479
 and well apparently nothing comes 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.290
 says here that I can run bishop 443 gta 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.030
 4 minecraft and call of duty black ops 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.909
 to start this pc is not what it's worth 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.130
 you are paying more for the cabinet by 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.229
 say it that way because the cabinet worked 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.180
 it's pretty nice you're paying more 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.080
 for the cabinet because the ram is not 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.270
 good 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.009
 the process is a basic processor a 4 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.320
 and then the video card also does not 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.360
 let's say it's the great wonder is 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.090
 weigh the weapons approximately with 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.760
 four thousand pesos or three thousand or so 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.769
 three thousand 500 pesos without the cabinet 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.440
 adding a simple cabinet as of 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.870
 500 pesos you save a lot of money and 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.209
 weapons a computer of 4 thousand 200 pesos 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.970
 pretty much what it would cost you this 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.470
 computer is like 4 thousand 200 pesos the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.720
 hour is quite expensive but also 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.030
 we take into account what it charges them in 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.970
 mercadolibre to sellers to each 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.160
 sale in mercadolibre and good this pc yo 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.260
 I do not recommend it, you can get it 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.480
 much cheaper in dry marking you 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.790
 same and good let's go with the 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.010
 next pc gamer good we went with the 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.220
 second pc gamer that sends us 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.079
 jose adds mer and tells us since I'm 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.810
 saving to buy me and pos I want 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.519
 know if it will be a good investment hopefully 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.860
 and please put it clear that I am 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.450
 putting carnal and good tells us cpu 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.840
 gamer fx 8.350 which is a processor 8 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.819
 cores with the port to m3 plus and a 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.870
 hard disk terabyte 8 gigabytes 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.290
 million 9 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.640
 run gta 5 on ultra obviously this 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.680
 computer is going to run what 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.709
 want to start with the card 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.260
 video nvidia 960 and we see that it has a 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.269
 price of 14 thousand mexican pesos we are going to 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.159
 go down a bit to see if it's really 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.950
 what is worth or can you save a 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:33.000
 money as the fx processor tells us 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.810
 8 thousand 320 with 8 corsa 4.0 and hits each 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.360
 one this I doubt it because I think 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.049
 that to do this in my case I have 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.609
 my processor 4.1 which is 8 thousand 320 and 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.400
 I had to do an overclocking for 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:50.190
 to be able to do it apparently from factory 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.720
 it comes as 3.6 so here is a 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.950
 detail that I want to leave nothing more 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.629
 nvidia gtx 960 video card that does not 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.519
 tell us the brand right now let's see if 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.180
 we do not find it and a 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:06.810
 karzai spec 3 cabinet and then we 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:11.129
 says skoda nucleus the cloaking and two 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.720
 gigabytes to 128 bits gddr5 or this is 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.690
 video card will be able to run 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.910
 games in 4k later we find ourselves with 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.890
 an excel 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.300
 source of power at the end even a 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.990
 excellent source of power 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.970
 one thing is x 600 m with 80 plus bronze 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.340
 very important so that you are not giving 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.690
 slumps at the time of gaming after we 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.160
 says kingston ram 1600 card 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.010
 megahertz you know I'm a fan 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.650
 of kingston and then a pretty ram 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.980
 good maybe 1600 megahertz this after 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.290
 update to about 2100 something like that 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.930
 megahertz something so it suits you more 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.450
 truth and a gigabyte mother card 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.420
 it is not gaming that is a bet that is 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.940
 normal for work for workstations 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.400
 etcetera that has four suns of 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.930
 ram memory two ports pci express 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:05.510
 four ports 3.0 six ports sata 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.820
 natives and gigabyte technology and three 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.190
 years of guarantee with this one terabyte of 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.740
 hard drive good in conclusion this pc 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.630
 is very good I want to comment this pc 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.520
 it assures you that you are going to run what 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.530
 you want in this pc you will be able to run 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.630
 the games that you want because nothing else 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.900
 to say more or less is the price 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.509
 for the life card costs like 4000 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.990
 is the processor costs about three thousand 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:33.259
 two thousand pesos the ram costs thousand pesos 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.930
 more or less the source of power a thousand 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.970
 five hundred pesos two thousand and then more or 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.860
 less is the price I think they earn 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.289
 about two thousand thousand pesos but also 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.150
 he told them that also free market 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.280
 them as a commission to all of these 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.100
 sellers for these times and the 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.320
 I recommend maybe it's slightly expensive 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.000
 but it is worth a partnership 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.320
 even more prolific the guava and we 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.320
 we see until the next
