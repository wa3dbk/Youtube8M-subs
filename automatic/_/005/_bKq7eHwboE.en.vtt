00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.590
 recent on the universe 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.269
 movie marvel movie 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.789
 independent of batman and the crossover

 between the men x and the fantastic 4 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.300
 in a recent interview 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.160
 marvel assures that dpa is not 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.630
 totally connected to the universe 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.330
 cinematographic that they have created since 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.039
 ironman to the avengers the era of 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.900
 a troll but he tells us that if 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.420
 It is effectively an autonomous film 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.670
 but within the same universe besides 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.250
 introduces us to one of the technologies 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 most important of the comic book universe 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.600
 of marvel that are bread particles 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.430
 and in turn they introduce us to what is the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.620
 quantum realm or as we would 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.300
 like to call it the micro verse that 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.210
 we know you have a relationship very 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.920
 close with the absence of wasp inside 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.750
 of the movie that is already confirmed 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.730
 by the same fitch gaming that we are going to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.070
 see in a kind of cameo or from 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.109
 flashback but the most interesting thing is that 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.300
 when they were creating this movie they 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.309
 they had a very funny way of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.840
 connect the different universes that 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.570
 we have been watching and they said 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.719
 hey why do not we put andy man who's 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.179
 in front of one of the avengers like this 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.460
 that there is a possibility that within 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:18.780
 anne film man who has 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.729
 mentioned very strongly that there will be 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.829
 many references to the universe of 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.409
 spider-man when least spoken or 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.759
 cited as it has the presence of one 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.350
 of the adventures 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.939
 also in this interview that memphis and 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.380

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.810
 the participation of marvel in the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.850
 2017 independent film 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.950
 spider-man and if there is a possibility of 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.860
 see some of the avengers inside 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.140
 this movie and he answers that marvel is going to 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.179
 produce the movie for sonic and the go 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.250
 to work as if it were your own 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.770

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.119
 between the companies if it allows to see 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.829
 other superheroes of the universe 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.619

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.619
 specifically of black panther in 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.899
 where it says that by the end of this summer 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.429
 they will announce who will be the 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.590
 director of this movie you have to 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.599
 remember that black panther is also going to 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.140
 be his debut in the captain's movie 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.730
 america civil war also confirms that 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.730
 talks and discussions with the 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.190

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.270
 casting the avengers infinity ward has 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.819
 started and one of the roles that 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.430
 marvel is looking for is that of magicians in 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.190
 the comics he is the evil alter ego of 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.780
 adam warlock that creates clones of the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.600

 his plan to recreate a universe of evil 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.350
 remember that the cocoon of adam 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.480

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.910

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.450
 it will be the same as we saw in the movie 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.370
 of the incredible hulk 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.560
 he says is very different he has a style and 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.269
 a modernized personality you have to 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.580
 remember that it has been rumored that the 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.100
 Captain role is going to become a network 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.459
 cold and could be the reason 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.170
 which hold comes out of its clear self-exile 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.269
 if the rumors that ruffalo returns 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.130
 they are true happening to the universe 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.579
