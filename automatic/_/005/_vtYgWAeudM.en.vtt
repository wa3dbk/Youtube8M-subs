00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:08.800 
a couple of years after I'd got out of
my<00:02:07.489> hardcore<00:02:07.879> band<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.330> I<00:02:08.360> was<00:02:08.390> in<00:02:08.569> a<00:02:08.629> couple

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
my hardcore band and I was in a couple

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.140 
my hardcore band and I was in a couple
other<00:02:09.080> bands<00:02:09.349> that<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:09.679> didn't<00:02:09.979> have<00:02:10.910> anything

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
other bands that I didn't have anything

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.080 
other bands that I didn't have anything
to<00:02:11.360> do<00:02:11.480> with<00:02:11.510> music<00:02:11.750> for<00:02:12.170> about<00:02:12.580> two<00:02:13.580> years<00:02:13.819> I

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
to do with music for about two years I

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.420 
to do with music for about two years I
think<00:02:14.120> in

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
think in

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.369 
think in
I<00:02:15.730> was<00:02:16.120> using<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.390> lot<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.540> drugs<00:02:16.900> at<00:02:17.049> the<00:02:17.109> time

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
I was using a lot of drugs at the time

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.899 
I was using a lot of drugs at the time
and<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.620> think<00:02:17.799> that<00:02:17.920> kind<00:02:18.069> of<00:02:18.159> took<00:02:18.340> over<00:02:18.489> I

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
and I think that kind of took over I

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.080 
and I think that kind of took over I
really<00:02:19.480> didn't<00:02:20.340> want<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.459> do<00:02:21.579> anything<00:02:21.790> else

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
really didn't want to do anything else

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.839 
really didn't want to do anything else
but<00:02:22.269> drugs<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:23.049> got<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.099> some<00:02:24.250> trouble<00:02:24.280> and

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
but drugs and I got in some trouble and

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.160 
but drugs and I got in some trouble and
went<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:25.359> jail<00:02:25.629> and<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:27.180> met<00:02:28.180> Brandon<00:02:28.629> Jeff<00:02:28.989> and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
went to jail and I met Brandon Jeff and

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.759 
went to jail and I met Brandon Jeff and
Quinn<00:02:29.849> around<00:02:30.849> the<00:02:31.120> time<00:02:31.329> that<00:02:32.290> all<00:02:32.319> this<00:02:32.620> was

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769
