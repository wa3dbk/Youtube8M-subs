needle<00:01:47.290> in<00:01:47.440> there<00:01:47.710> get<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.729> all<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:48.970> way<00:01:49.090> in

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
needle in there get it all the way in

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.330 
needle in there get it all the way in
there<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.630> then<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:50.530> just<00:01:50.680> pull<00:01:50.920> that<00:01:50.950> stitch

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
there and then you just pull that stitch

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.020 
there and then you just pull that stitch
off<00:01:51.370> of<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.030> needle<00:01:52.300> and<00:01:52.540> it<00:01:53.290> pops<00:01:53.530> out<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.880> now

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
off of the needle and it pops out so now

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.180 
off of the needle and it pops out so now
that<00:01:55.060> stitches<00:01:55.690> over<00:01:55.870> here<00:01:56.290> it's<00:01:56.440> an<00:01:56.590> unmet

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
that stitches over here it's an unmet

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.910 
that stitches over here it's an unmet
and<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:58.360> working<00:01:58.659> yarn<00:01:58.690> is<00:01:59.080> on<00:01:59.229> this<00:01:59.620> stitch

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
and the working yarn is on this stitch

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.700 
and the working yarn is on this stitch
so<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:00.940> can<00:02:01.090> take<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.360> whole<00:02:01.600> row<00:02:01.900> out<00:02:02.140> by<00:02:02.380> doing

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
so I can take the whole row out by doing

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.570 
so I can take the whole row out by doing
that<00:02:03.180> put<00:02:04.180> that<00:02:04.299> in<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.540> hole<00:02:04.720> take<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:05.290> off

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
that put that in the hole take it off

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
that put that in the hole take it off
put<00:02:06.580> this<00:02:06.700> one<00:02:06.880> in<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.030> hole<00:02:07.120> directly

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
put this one in the hole directly

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.550 
put this one in the hole directly
underneath<00:02:08.729> take<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.849> off<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.319> pull<00:02:11.319> it<00:02:11.410> out

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
underneath take it off and pull it out

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.360 
underneath take it off and pull it out
then<00:02:12.100> I

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
then I

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.240 
then I
take<00:02:13.239> my<00:02:13.420> yarn<00:02:13.599> a<00:02:13.720> little<00:02:13.900> more<00:02:14.080> put<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.069> in

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
of a sudden I have one less row is that

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.619 
of a sudden I have one less row is that
visible<00:02:50.379> yeah<00:02:51.099> that<00:02:51.549> makes<00:02:51.670> sense<00:02:51.760> yep<00:02:52.209> sure

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
visible yeah that makes sense yep sure

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.809 
visible yeah that makes sense yep sure
does<00:02:52.780> okay<00:02:53.590> so<00:02:53.829> you<00:02:53.890> can<00:02:54.010> zoom<00:02:54.190> back<00:02:54.340> out<00:02:54.519> and
