00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.810 
them out but yeah this and sometimes if
you<00:02:27.900> start<00:02:28.200> pulling<00:02:28.560> too<00:02:28.710> fast<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.310> going<00:02:29.760> to

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
you start pulling too fast it's going to

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.700 
you start pulling too fast it's going to
get<00:02:29.940> mixed<00:02:30.330> up<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.660> little<00:02:30.900> bit<00:02:31.020> too<00:02:31.200> much<00:02:31.380> so

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
get mixed up a little bit too much so

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.650 
get mixed up a little bit too much so
what<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:31.950> can<00:02:32.100> do<00:02:32.250> then<00:02:32.520> is<00:02:32.820> actually<00:02:33.510> just

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
what you can do then is actually just

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.250 
what you can do then is actually just
click<00:02:34.320> your<00:02:34.370> spool<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.030> just<00:02:36.720> loosen<00:02:37.170> up

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
click your spool in and just loosen up

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.580 
click your spool in and just loosen up
your<00:02:37.380> drag<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.010> then<00:02:38.850> pull<00:02:39.210> it<00:02:39.240> out<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:40.440> just

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
your drag and then pull it out that just

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.020 
your drag and then pull it out that just
keeps<00:02:40.890> more<00:02:41.160> tension<00:02:41.490> on<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:43.200> you'll<00:02:44.030> less

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
keeps more tension on it and you'll less

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.430 
keeps more tension on it and you'll less
likely<00:02:45.510> you'll<00:02:46.140> get<00:02:46.860> all<00:02:47.070> mixed<00:02:47.370> up<00:02:48.350> but<00:02:49.350> yeah

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
likely you'll get all mixed up but yeah

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.780 
likely you'll get all mixed up but yeah
