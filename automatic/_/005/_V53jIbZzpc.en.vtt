moving on to the distorter hair clay and

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.350 
moving on to the distorter hair clay and
it<00:02:08.190> says<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.369> whole<00:02:08.580> strength<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.970> about<00:02:09.060> three

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
it says a whole strength of about three

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.160 
it says a whole strength of about three
out<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.660> five<00:02:10.200> things<00:02:10.879> circles<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.420> would

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
out of five things circles to I would

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.790 
out of five things circles to I would
almost

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
almost

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.140 
almost
would<00:02:13.950> give<00:02:14.070> us<00:02:14.160> one<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.460> four<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:15.090> a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
would give us one like four it's a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.320 
would give us one like four it's a
little<00:02:15.330> bit<00:02:15.420> stronger<00:02:15.660> than<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.940> designer<00:02:17.940> if

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
little bit stronger than the designer if

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.960 
little bit stronger than the designer if
you<00:02:18.570> can<00:02:18.690> see<00:02:18.870> there<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:19.290> more<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:20.010> putty

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
you can see there it's more of a putty

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.090 
you can see there it's more of a putty
it's<00:02:21.630> not<00:02:21.840> quite<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.080> wax<00:02:22.380> it's<00:02:22.650> not<00:02:22.800> as<00:02:22.890> strong

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
it's not quite a wax it's not as strong

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.910 
it's not quite a wax it's not as strong
as<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.310> wax<00:02:23.520> but<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:24.690> more<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.080> putty<00:02:25.530> it's

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
as a wax but it's more like a putty it's

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.980 
as a wax but it's more like a putty it's
so<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:26.910> going<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.060> give<00:02:27.210> you<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.360> matte

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
so this is going to give you a matte

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.310 
so this is going to give you a matte
finish<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:29.550> pretty<00:02:30.030> decent<00:02:30.570> hold<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.170> hole

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
finish and a pretty decent hold the hole

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.870 
finish and a pretty decent hold the hole
on<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.680> going<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:31.950> flexible<00:02:32.130> as<00:02:32.580> well

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
on this is going to be flexible as well

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.680 
on this is going to be flexible as well
so<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.900> not<00:02:34.730> it's<00:02:35.730> really<00:02:36.210> good<00:02:36.360> for<00:02:36.510> just

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
so it's not it's really good for just

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.400 
so it's not it's really good for just
adding<00:02:37.020> texture<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:38.010> your<00:02:38.280> hair<00:02:38.640> already<00:02:39.410> so

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
adding texture to your hair already so

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.720 
adding texture to your hair already so
if<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.680> already<00:02:40.830> have<00:02:41.010> known<00:02:41.190> product<00:02:41.460> in

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
if you already have known product in

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.540 
if you already have known product in
just<00:02:42.390> use<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.570> title<00:02:42.960> texture<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.740> is<00:02:43.980> really

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
just use that title texture it is really

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.030 
just use that title texture it is really
good<00:02:44.790> at<00:02:45.030> thickening<00:02:45.510> your<00:02:45.540> hair<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:46.350> if<00:02:46.890> you

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
good at thickening your hair so if you

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.820 
good at thickening your hair so if you
have<00:02:47.160> thin<00:02:47.400> hair<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:48.090> kind<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:49.020> struggles<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
have thin hair that kind of struggles to

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.290 
have thin hair that kind of struggles to
like<00:02:49.980> stand<00:02:50.400> up<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.440> clump<00:02:52.440> together<00:02:52.650> nicely

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
like stand up and clump together nicely

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.510 
like stand up and clump together nicely
this<00:02:54.300> actually<00:02:54.540> does<00:02:55.020> make<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.710> look<00:02:56.040> thicker

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
this actually does make it look thicker

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.880 
this actually does make it look thicker
if<00:02:57.510> that's<00:02:57.750> something<00:02:57.960> you<00:02:58.200> are<00:02:58.440> worried

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
if that's something you are worried

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.700 
if that's something you are worried
about<00:02:59.450> because<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.540> know<00:03:00.600> some<00:03:00.870> people<00:03:00.900> use

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
about because I know some people use

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.520 
about because I know some people use
like<00:03:01.890> gels<00:03:02.220> or<00:03:02.580> other<00:03:02.940> products<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:04.320> just

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
like gels or other products and it just

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.500 
like gels or other products and it just
makes<00:03:04.800> their<00:03:05.010> hair<00:03:05.250> lure<00:03:05.520> totally<00:03:05.940> separated

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
makes their hair lure totally separated

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.810 
makes their hair lure totally separated
and<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:07.200> looks<00:03:07.410> even<00:03:07.590> worse<00:03:07.740> if<00:03:08.340> they're

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
and it looks even worse if they're

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.730 
and it looks even worse if they're
losing<00:03:09.060> their<00:03:09.210> hair<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:09.870> it's<00:03:10.470> going<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.650> be

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
losing their hair so it's going to be

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.460 
losing their hair so it's going to be
good<00:03:10.800> for<00:03:10.980> short<00:03:11.400> or<00:03:11.640> medium<00:03:12.030> hairstyles<00:03:12.720> uh

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
good for short or medium hairstyles uh

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.340 
good for short or medium hairstyles uh
it<00:03:14.100> does<00:03:14.730> work<00:03:14.970> really<00:03:15.240> sure<00:03:15.810> if<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.170> want<00:03:16.320> to
