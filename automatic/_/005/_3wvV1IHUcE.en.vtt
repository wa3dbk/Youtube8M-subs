 of the best and is that it makes 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.090
 how many days a subscriber asked me 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.070
 that you taught him to prepare the onion 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.199
 caramelized that like all of you 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.150
 you will know is an ingredient that remains 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.580
 great with most of the meats and 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.620
 the fish this recipe is super 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.559
 simple and the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.960
 need the following 500 posts 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.150
 grams of onions in this case I'm going to 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.280
 use red onion but you can 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.270
 use the type of onion that you want 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.040
 two tablespoons of brown sugar two 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.820
 Spoons of Modena Vinegar 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.860
 and olive oil and with all this 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.860
 we can start to make the recipe 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.490
 one 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.950
 first of all we are going to peel and contribute 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.900
 our onion for example I'm going to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.430
 cut in julienne but you can 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.430
 cut it as you like 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.450
 once the onion is cut we will 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.880
 heat an abundant jet of oil 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.049
 olive in a pan 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.930
 good oil is very hot 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.840
 we will throw our onion and everything in 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.030
 perfect we will remove it very well for 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.490
 that is impregnated all with the oil 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.320
 free stirring this onion we are going to 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.060
 cover the pan with the help of a 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.940
 cover we're going to lower the temperature 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.710
 of the fire at low medium temperature and 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.540
 let's let it go supporting 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.130
 for 10 minutes stirring from time to time 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.940
 when to avoid sticking the 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.580
 onion in the background 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.050
 art market will not cover 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.240
 worry because you can tell the 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.550
 onion just the only thing you need a 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.200
 little more time to support her and 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.900
 move more frequently to avoid 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.610
 stick the onion in the background 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.920
 when the onion is well reposado 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.480
 let's add the brown sugar and what 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.070
 we will pick up very well until 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.090
 let's see that it starts to take a texture 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.800
 thick and starts to cost to remove 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.960
 when the mixture starts to take body 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.790
 and it costs a little bit to remove is the 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.640
 moment to add the vinegar 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.450
 Modena for this to help caramelize 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.280
 the sugar and form a salsita 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.590
 once was the vinegar of modena 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.629
 we will remove our onion without stopping 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.510
 until we see that the vinegar acquires 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.069
 a texture a little more thick 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.049
 when we see that the vinegar is 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.230
 respected we will remove our onion from 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.329
 the pan and we will serve it in a bowl and 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.250
 Once the onion is served, look what 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.290
 better pint has already the only thing that 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.200
 we have left is to use it on the plate that 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.239
 we like it and in my case I'm going to use it 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.210
 with some fillets of payment to the plate 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.460
 Those who are sure that it will be great 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.470
 good I hope so you know how 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.450
 Prepare the caramelized onion 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.850

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.370
