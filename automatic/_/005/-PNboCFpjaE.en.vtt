it<00:02:42.400> until<00:02:42.490> you're<00:02:42.850> an<00:02:42.970> adult<00:02:43.270> and<00:02:43.480> they<00:02:44.020> don't

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
it until you're an adult and they don't

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.680 
it until you're an adult and they don't
really<00:02:44.350> know<00:02:44.560> why<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:46.090> there's<00:02:46.270> a<00:02:46.330> lot<00:02:46.630> that

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
really know why so there's a lot that

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.330 
really know why so there's a lot that
they're<00:02:47.080> still<00:02:47.290> trying<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.680> figure<00:02:47.830> out<00:02:47.950> about

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
they're still trying to figure out about

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.840 
they're still trying to figure out about
the<00:02:48.550> illness<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:50.500> it's<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.430> disease<00:02:51.790> that

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
the illness and and it's a disease that

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.630 
the illness and and it's a disease that
most<00:02:52.780> people<00:02:53.200> like<00:02:53.740> I<00:02:53.770> said<00:02:54.100> don't<00:02:54.280> really

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
most people like I said don't really

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.520 
most people like I said don't really
realize<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.090> it's<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.080> as<00:02:56.320> serious

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
realize that it's that it's as serious

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.370 
realize that it's that it's as serious
as<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:57.550> it's<00:02:57.730> kind<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.030> almost<00:02:58.300> it<00:02:58.750> could

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
as it is so it's kind of almost it could

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.030 
as it is so it's kind of almost it could
possibly<00:02:59.620> be<00:03:00.130> in<00:03:00.490> every<00:03:00.940> family<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:02.380> asthma

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
possibly be in every family it asthma

runs in one out of every five families
there<00:03:06.550> is<00:03:06.820> somebody<00:03:07.180> within<00:03:07.720> that<00:03:07.990> family

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
there is somebody within that family

was my next question I was going to ask
how<00:03:22.270> many<00:03:22.330> Tennyson's<00:03:23.170> did<00:03:23.530> we<00:03:23.710> consider<00:03:24.190> that

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
how many Tennyson's did we consider that

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.890 
how many Tennyson's did we consider that

illness that I'm hoping that after a

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.450 
illness that I'm hoping that after a
program<00:03:46.870> like<00:03:46.900> today<00:03:47.440> that<00:03:47.800> more<00:03:48.010> people<00:03:48.190> are

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
program like today that more people are

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.400 
program like today that more people are
going<00:03:48.730> to<00:03:49.860> understand<00:03:50.860> what<00:03:51.160> these<00:03:52.410> people

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
going to understand what these people

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.780 
going to understand what these people
who<00:03:53.590> have<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:54.040> live<00:03:54.190> with<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.430> on<00:03:54.640> a<00:03:54.670> daily

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
who have to live with it on a daily

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.670 
who have to live with it on a daily
basis<00:03:55.450> have<00:03:55.630> to<00:03:55.720> go<00:03:55.840> through<00:03:56.110> what<00:03:56.320> kind<00:03:56.560> of

around<00:04:57.970> your<00:04:58.240> Airways<00:04:58.870> are<00:04:59.349> starting<00:05:00.130> to

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
around your Airways are starting to

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.240 
around your Airways are starting to
tighten<00:05:00.520> up<00:05:00.759> and<00:05:00.820> and<00:05:01.690> constrict<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.620> airways

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
tighten up and and constrict the airways

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.240 
tighten up and and constrict the airways
so<00:05:04.030> you've<00:05:04.810> got<00:05:04.840> this<00:05:05.169> inflammation<00:05:05.650> you're

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
so you've got this inflammation you're

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.760 
so you've got this inflammation you're
starting<00:05:06.699> to<00:05:06.820> swell<00:05:07.240> you've<00:05:07.990> got<00:05:08.229> mucus

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
starting to swell you've got mucus

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.430 
starting to swell you've got mucus
clogging<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.430> airways<00:05:10.000> and<00:05:10.360> then<00:05:10.900> you've<00:05:11.229> got

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
clogging the airways and then you've got

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.320 
clogging the airways and then you've got
your<00:05:11.470> Airways<00:05:12.099> actually<00:05:12.669> getting<00:05:12.849> smaller

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
your Airways actually getting smaller

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.939 
your Airways actually getting smaller
and<00:05:13.599> smaller<00:05:13.660> all<00:05:14.259> at<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.530> same<00:05:14.770> time<00:05:15.070> and<00:05:15.870> if

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
and smaller all at the same time and if

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.560 
and smaller all at the same time and if
at<00:05:17.949> some<00:05:18.280> point<00:05:18.580> eventually<00:05:19.210> they<00:05:19.389> can

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
at some point eventually they can

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.939 
at some point eventually they can
completely<00:05:19.960> close<00:05:20.349> up<00:05:20.910> so<00:05:21.910> is<00:05:22.620> also<00:05:23.620> maybe

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
completely close up so is also maybe

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.020 
completely close up so is also maybe
giving<00:05:24.789> another<00:05:26.130> visual<00:05:27.130> like<00:05:27.430> like<00:05:27.849> you

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
giving another visual like like you

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.360 
giving another visual like like you
