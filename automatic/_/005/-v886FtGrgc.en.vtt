and when you adjust it in it moves it
towards<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.520> now<00:02:17.450> in<00:02:18.260> most<00:02:18.470> instances<00:02:18.950> you

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
towards you now in most instances you

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.790 
towards you now in most instances you
shouldn't<00:02:19.550> need<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.670> tune<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.470> if<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.680> ever

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
shouldn't need a tune it but if you ever

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.620 
shouldn't need a tune it but if you ever
have<00:02:21.980> like<00:02:22.160> aftermarket<00:02:22.850> shifter<00:02:23.270> pieces

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
have like aftermarket shifter pieces

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.790 
have like aftermarket shifter pieces
like<00:02:23.810> mine<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.350> have<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.310> shifter<00:02:25.910> plate<00:02:26.150> and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
like mine I have a shifter plate and

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.380 
like mine I have a shifter plate and
there's<00:02:27.800> actually<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.190> much<00:02:28.910> sure<00:02:29.120> if<00:02:29.180> it's

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
there's actually a much sure if it's

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.750 
there's actually a much sure if it's
supposed<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.660> be<00:02:29.780> bent<00:02:30.050> like<00:02:30.290> this<00:02:30.490> but<00:02:31.490> it

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
supposed to be bent like this but it

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.110 
supposed to be bent like this but it
actually<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.450> ball<00:02:32.660> joint<00:02:32.960> actually<00:02:33.350> sits<00:02:33.710> um

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
actually the ball joint actually sits um

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.740 
actually the ball joint actually sits um
it's<00:02:35.120> it's<00:02:36.220> more<00:02:37.220> towards<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.790> passenger<00:02:38.420> than

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
it's it's more towards a passenger than

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.350 
it's it's more towards a passenger than
it<00:02:38.870> does<00:02:39.080> um<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:40.280> stock<00:02:40.790> ball<00:02:41.420> joint<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:43.360> in

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
it does um the stock ball joint so in

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.480 
it does um the stock ball joint so in
that<00:02:44.600> case<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:45.080> would<00:02:45.200> need<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:45.470> adjust<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:46.040> so

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
that case I would need to adjust it so

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.560 
that case I would need to adjust it so
it's<00:02:46.700> more<00:02:48.310> it's<00:02:49.310> more<00:02:49.400> towards<00:02:49.850> me<00:02:50.060> or

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
it's more it's more towards me or

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.680 
it's more it's more towards me or
wherever<00:02:51.050> or<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.740> stock<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.940> stock<00:02:53.000> setting
