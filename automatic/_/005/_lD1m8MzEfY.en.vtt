previous video you may have seen us prep

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.900 
previous video you may have seen us prep
the<00:00:39.559> ESC<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.010> motor<00:00:40.370> for<00:00:40.820> this<00:00:40.970> process<00:00:42.910> as

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
the ESC and motor for this process as

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.220 
the ESC and motor for this process as
you<00:00:44.059> can<00:00:44.330> see<00:00:44.480> what<00:00:44.629> we've<00:00:44.750> done<00:00:44.930> here<00:00:45.170> is

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
you can see what we've done here is

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.900 
you can see what we've done here is
we've<00:00:45.910> already<00:00:46.910> installed<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:48.489> or<00:00:49.489> attach

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
we've already installed the or attach

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.479 
we've already installed the or attach
the<00:00:50.120> motor<00:00:50.330> to<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.629> ESC<00:00:51.110> power<00:00:51.860> cables<00:00:52.280> there

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
the motor to the ESC power cables there

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.310 
the motor to the ESC power cables there
and<00:00:52.640> then<00:00:52.730> we've<00:00:52.850> installed<00:00:53.269> the<00:00:53.449> deans

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
and then we've installed the deans

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.960 
and then we've installed the deans
connector<00:00:55.540> for<00:00:56.540> the<00:00:56.600> power<00:00:56.800> so<00:00:57.800> next<00:00:58.580> step<00:00:58.760> is

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
connector for the power so next step is

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.710 
connector for the power so next step is
to<00:00:59.409> get<00:01:00.409> all<00:01:00.559> this<00:01:00.710> stuff<00:01:00.949> put<00:01:01.339> into<00:01:01.879> our<00:01:02.239> buggy

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
to get all this stuff put into our buggy

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.860 
to get all this stuff put into our buggy
okay<00:01:05.720> so<00:01:05.780> before<00:01:06.080> we<00:01:06.380> go<00:01:07.510> ahead<00:01:08.510> and<00:01:08.659> install

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
okay so before we go ahead and install

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.700 
okay so before we go ahead and install
it<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:10.300> just<00:01:11.300> want<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.630> point<00:01:11.780> out<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.140> sensor

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
it I just want to point out the sensor

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.630 
it I just want to point out the sensor
cable<00:01:13.460> here<00:01:13.640> that<00:01:13.670> it's<00:01:13.940> not<00:01:14.090> in<00:01:14.210> place<00:01:14.420> yet

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.850 

the<00:01:19.640> ESC<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:20.510> modal<00:01:20.900> combination<00:01:21.110> we<00:01:21.650> have

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
the ESC and modal combination we have

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.370 
the ESC and modal combination we have
here<00:01:22.130> is<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:23.799> censored<00:01:24.799> brushless<00:01:25.159> system<00:01:26.380> so

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
here is a censored brushless system so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.469 
here is a censored brushless system so
the<00:01:27.469> exile<00:01:27.860> vector<00:01:28.310> is<00:01:28.430> a<00:01:28.460> censored<00:01:28.909> motor<00:01:29.180> and

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
the exile vector is a censored motor and

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:37.330 
the exile vector is a censored motor and
the<00:01:31.329> sxx<00:01:32.500> lrp<00:01:33.500> spark<00:01:33.890> blue<00:01:35.079> stock<00:01:36.079> spec<00:01:36.560> esc

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
the sxx lrp spark blue stock spec esc

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.740 
the sxx lrp spark blue stock spec esc
here<00:01:37.869> also<00:01:38.869> supports<00:01:39.469> the<00:01:40.369> censored<00:01:40.850> so<00:01:41.740> the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
here also supports the censored so the

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.359 
here also supports the censored so the
sensor<00:01:44.750> cable<00:01:47.170> just<00:01:48.170> goes<00:01:48.770> right<00:01:49.009> into<00:01:49.159> the

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
sensor cable just goes right into the

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.010 
sensor cable just goes right into the
connector<00:01:49.820> here<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.850> then<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.600> other<00:01:53.750> end

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
connector here and then the other end

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.090 
connector here and then the other end
goes<00:01:54.409> on<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:55.810> bottom<00:01:56.810> of<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.229> motor<00:01:57.799> here

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
goes on the bottom of the motor here

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.899 
goes on the bottom of the motor here
practically<00:01:58.759> right<00:01:59.060> in<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.240> center<00:02:03.520> so<00:02:04.520> just

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
practically right in the center so just

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.669 
practically right in the center so just
like<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:05.329> now<00:02:06.200> we're<00:02:06.530> all<00:02:06.649> wired<00:02:06.920> up

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
like so now we're all wired up

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.009 
like so now we're all wired up
next<00:02:09.489> up<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.759> do<00:02:09.879> here's<00:02:10.149> you<00:02:10.360> can<00:02:10.479> see<00:02:10.720> here's

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
next up to do here's you can see here's

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.259 
next up to do here's you can see here's
the<00:02:11.080> back<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.459> track<00:02:12.959> buggy<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:15.269> the

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
the back of the track buggy and the

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.589 
the back of the track buggy and the
motors<00:02:16.569> gonna<00:02:16.690> go<00:02:16.989> in<00:02:17.140> like<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.040> our<00:02:19.000> ESC

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
motors gonna go in like this and our ESC

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:27.270 
motors gonna go in like this and our ESC
is<00:02:19.629> gonna<00:02:19.959> sit<00:02:20.319> right<00:02:20.560> here<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:26.280> installing

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
is gonna sit right here so installing

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.949 
is gonna sit right here so installing
the<00:02:27.670> motor<00:02:28.090> in<00:02:28.360> here<00:02:28.569> is<00:02:28.659> very

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
the motor in here is very

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.589 
the motor in here is very
straightforward<00:02:29.849> we<00:02:30.849> have<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.150> motor<00:02:31.360> it's

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
straightforward we have the motor it's

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.259 
straightforward we have the motor it's
got<00:02:31.750> its<00:02:31.989> mounting<00:02:32.409> holes<00:02:33.810> there<00:02:36.000> which<00:02:37.000> line

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
got its mounting holes there which line

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.180 
got its mounting holes there which line
up<00:02:37.510> with<00:02:37.720> these<00:02:37.870> two<00:02:38.140> holes<00:02:38.379> here<00:02:38.799> this<00:02:39.010> one

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
up with these two holes here this one

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.259 
up with these two holes here this one
right<00:02:39.310> here<00:02:39.579> and<00:02:39.700> this<00:02:39.790> one<00:02:39.940> right<00:02:39.970> here<00:02:40.239> and

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
right here and this one right here and

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:47.300 
right here and this one right here and
some<00:02:40.870> screws<00:02:41.500> go<00:02:41.739> through<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:46.269> attach<00:02:46.750> so

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
some screws go through and attach so

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.380 
some screws go through and attach so
like<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.430> said<00:02:49.500> motor<00:02:50.500> plate<00:02:50.829> it's<00:02:51.430> got<00:02:51.609> two

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
like I said motor plate it's got two

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.149 
like I said motor plate it's got two
slots<00:02:52.690> for<00:02:53.049> screws<00:02:53.470> I'm<00:02:53.620> just<00:02:53.769> gonna<00:02:53.859> flip

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
slots for screws I'm just gonna flip

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.979 
slots for screws I'm just gonna flip
around<00:02:54.280> here<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:54.849> I<00:02:54.879> can<00:02:55.180> get<00:02:55.329> the<00:02:55.450> screws<00:02:55.750> and

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
around here so I can get the screws and

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.940 
around here so I can get the screws and
it's<00:02:56.109> very<00:02:57.840> difficult<00:02:58.840> let's<00:02:59.409> say<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:02.739> do<00:03:02.920> it

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
it's very difficult let's say to do it

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:24.580 
it's very difficult let's say to do it
with<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.310> not<00:03:03.879> facing<00:03:04.359> me

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:04:23.980 

all<00:03:25.310> right

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.310 

so<00:04:24.990> there<00:04:25.949> you<00:04:26.699> have<00:04:26.729> it<00:04:26.940> just<00:04:27.360> two<00:04:27.720> screws<00:04:27.900> to

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
so there you have it just two screws to

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.189 
so there you have it just two screws to
mount<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.860> motor<00:04:29.580> onto<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.660> motor<00:04:30.870> plate

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
mount the motor onto the motor plate

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.520 
mount the motor onto the motor plate
there<00:04:32.510> what<00:04:33.510> I've<00:04:33.600> done<00:04:33.780> is<00:04:33.960> I've<00:04:34.139> gone<00:04:34.350> ahead

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
there what I've done is I've gone ahead

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.110 
there what I've done is I've gone ahead
and<00:04:34.680> tightened<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.460> whole<00:04:36.360> setup<00:04:36.750> down<00:04:39.290> but

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
and tightened the whole setup down but

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.000 
and tightened the whole setup down but
you'll<00:04:42.120> notice<00:04:42.360> something<00:04:42.720> though<00:04:43.080> is<00:04:43.350> this

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
you'll notice something though is this

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.010 
you'll notice something though is this
setup<00:04:44.250> is<00:04:44.490> actually<00:04:44.820> missing<00:04:45.300> a<00:04:45.450> pinion

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
setup is actually missing a pinion

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.120 
setup is actually missing a pinion
normally<00:04:49.020> what<00:04:49.139> you<00:04:49.260> do<00:04:49.410> is<00:04:49.530> install<00:04:49.889> your

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
normally what you do is install your

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.580 
normally what you do is install your
pinion<00:04:52.370> loosely<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:53.550> then<00:04:54.139> gear<00:04:55.139> mesh<00:04:55.380> it

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
pinion loosely and then gear mesh it

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.879 
pinion loosely and then gear mesh it
with<00:04:55.860> your<00:04:56.510> spur<00:04:57.510> here<00:04:57.750> appropriately<00:04:58.680> and

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
with your spur here appropriately and

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.310 
with your spur here appropriately and
and<00:04:59.789> then<00:05:00.300> tighten<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:00.900> motor<00:05:01.110> down<00:05:01.350> but<00:05:03.320> we

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
and then tighten the motor down but we

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.409 
and then tighten the motor down but we
have<00:05:04.500> other<00:05:04.710> videos<00:05:05.160> that<00:05:05.190> cover<00:05:05.639> that<00:05:05.760> so<00:05:06.120> I'm

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419

pinion the next thing I'm going to do on
this<00:05:19.289> setup<00:05:20.160> though<00:05:20.370> is<00:05:20.580> just<00:05:21.030> install<00:05:21.450> the

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
this setup though is just install the

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
this setup though is just install the
ESC<00:05:24.630> in<00:05:25.110> place<00:05:25.440> and<00:05:26.930> I've<00:05:27.930> already<00:05:28.200> gone<00:05:28.500> ahead

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
ESC in place and I've already gone ahead

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.900 
ESC in place and I've already gone ahead
and<00:05:28.860> cut<00:05:29.729> out<00:05:29.910> a<00:05:30.180> piece<00:05:30.750> of<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:31.669> double<00:05:32.669> stick

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
and cut out a piece of the double stick

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.510 
and cut out a piece of the double stick
tape<00:05:32.940> that<00:05:33.720> comes<00:05:34.020> with<00:05:34.229> the<00:05:34.349> ESC<00:05:34.860> and<00:05:35.070> applied

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
tape that comes with the ESC and applied

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.950 
tape that comes with the ESC and applied
it<00:05:35.669> to<00:05:35.700> the<00:05:35.940> bottom<00:05:36.330> of<00:05:36.590> the<00:05:37.590> ESC<00:05:38.690> just<00:05:39.690> peel

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
it to the bottom of the ESC just peel

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.960 
it to the bottom of the ESC just peel
off<00:05:40.139> the<00:05:40.289> backing<00:05:40.530> make<00:05:41.280> sure<00:05:41.400> your<00:05:41.580> surface

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
off the backing make sure your surface

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.450 
off the backing make sure your surface
is<00:05:42.150> clean<00:05:42.450> there<00:05:42.690> and<00:05:42.900> then<00:05:43.740> it's<00:05:44.099> pretty<00:05:44.310> much

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
is clean there and then it's pretty much

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.300 
just drop it in place apply a little bit
of<00:05:48.720> pressure<00:05:49.160> or<00:05:50.160> a<00:05:50.220> lot<00:05:50.490> of<00:05:50.610> pressure<00:05:50.849> and

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
of pressure or a lot of pressure and

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.100 
of pressure or a lot of pressure and
that's<00:05:53.310> in<00:05:53.610> place<00:05:53.880> the<00:05:54.770> other<00:05:55.770> thing<00:05:56.039> to<00:05:56.160> do<00:05:56.310> is

the<00:05:58.110> power<00:05:58.620> switch<00:05:58.860> here<00:05:59.479> he's<00:06:00.479> always<00:06:00.660> gonna

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
the power switch here he's always gonna

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.050 
the power switch here he's always gonna
is<00:06:01.410> going<00:06:01.919> to<00:06:02.039> need<00:06:02.160> to<00:06:02.280> be<00:06:02.370> mounted<00:06:02.520> as<00:06:02.849> well

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
good last thing to do is run this cable

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.330 
good last thing to do is run this cable
for<00:06:20.190> the<00:06:20.370> receiver<00:06:20.910> under<00:06:21.900> the<00:06:22.260> battery<00:06:22.950> tray

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
for the receiver under the battery tray

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.090 
for the receiver under the battery tray
there's<00:06:24.060> a<00:06:24.180> small<00:06:24.600> channel<00:06:25.140> where<00:06:25.800> you<00:06:25.920> can

of the battery or anything once it's
running<00:06:47.310> to<00:06:47.490> Neath<00:06:47.670> like<00:06:47.850> this<00:06:48.060> what<00:06:48.330> you

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:48.450 
running to Neath like this what you

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.450 
running to Neath like this what you
gonna<00:06:49.110> probably<00:06:49.440> want<00:06:49.740> to<00:06:49.800> do<00:06:49.950> is<00:06:50.100> get<00:06:50.310> some
