down to our last screw and as you can

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.700 
down to our last screw and as you can
see<00:00:18.310> everything's<00:00:18.820> pretty<00:00:19.150> clean<00:00:19.509> all<00:00:20.499> we

and prying out each one of the screws
and<00:00:25.960> after<00:00:26.289> the<00:00:26.409> last<00:00:26.619> dremel<00:00:27.579> around<00:00:27.939> the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
and after the last dremel around the

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.580 
edge of the fin box you could take a

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.210 
edge of the fin box you could take a
wedge<00:00:33.580> a<00:00:34.030> little<00:00:34.090> chisel<00:00:35.050> and<00:00:35.260> go<00:00:35.980> on<00:00:36.130> the

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.770 
wedge a little chisel and go on the
sides<00:00:36.460> but<00:00:36.670> not<00:00:36.730> too<00:00:37.000> much<00:00:37.210> because<00:00:37.420> you<00:00:37.540> don't

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
sides but not too much because you don't

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
get our new fin box in so that it fits

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.460 
get our new fin box in so that it fits
more<00:01:30.700> snug<00:01:31.030> right<00:01:31.420> now<00:01:31.540> it<00:01:31.720> just<00:01:31.780> won't<00:01:32.260> quite

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
more snug right now it just won't quite

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.560 
more snug right now it just won't quite
fit<00:01:32.530> but<00:01:33.040> this<00:01:33.190> will<00:01:33.370> take<00:01:33.549> care<00:01:33.729> of<00:01:33.790> that<00:01:33.970> make

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
fit but this will take care of that make

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.700 
fit but this will take care of that make
sure<00:01:34.600> that<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:35.229> take<00:01:35.470> away<00:01:35.620> equal<00:01:36.190> sides

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
sure that you take away equal sides

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.390 
sure that you take away equal sides
proportionally<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:38.860> that<00:01:38.979> you<00:01:39.100> don't<00:01:39.250> have<00:01:39.310> a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
proportionally so that you don't have a

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.190 
proportionally so that you don't have a
fin<00:01:39.640> that's<00:01:39.790> on<00:01:40.000> one<00:01:40.240> side<00:01:40.479> or<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.780> other<00:01:40.810> and

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
fin that's on one side or the other and

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.100 
fin that's on one side or the other and
again<00:01:42.100> just<00:01:42.610> take<00:01:43.150> your<00:01:43.299> time<00:01:43.450> at<00:01:43.690> this<00:01:43.840> point

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
again just take your time at this point

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.980 
again just take your time at this point
because<00:01:44.320> setting<00:01:45.070> in<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.340> box<00:01:45.549> is<00:01:45.990> incredibly

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
because setting in the box is incredibly

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.880 
because setting in the box is incredibly
important<00:01:48.630> ok<00:01:49.630> one<00:01:49.840> of<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.020> key<00:01:50.380> things<00:01:50.710> here

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
important ok one of the key things here

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.789 
important ok one of the key things here
is<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:52.750> you're<00:01:52.930> not<00:01:53.049> careful<00:01:53.260> with<00:01:53.650> the

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
is that if you're not careful with the

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.160 
is that if you're not careful with the
sand<00:01:54.670> or<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:54.970> wall<00:01:55.360> what<00:01:55.690> will<00:01:55.900> end<00:01:56.020> up

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
sand or the wall what will end up

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.690 
sand or the wall what will end up
happening<00:01:56.229> is<00:01:56.799> you'll<00:01:56.950> go<00:01:57.100> through<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.400> wall

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
happening is you'll go through the wall

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.810 
happening is you'll go through the wall
of<00:01:57.880> epoxy<00:01:58.240> that's<00:01:58.689> already<00:01:58.960> there<00:01:59.260> and<00:01:59.820> as

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
of epoxy that's already there and as

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.160 
of epoxy that's already there and as
soon<00:02:01.030> as<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.210> go<00:02:01.299> through<00:02:01.510> the<00:02:01.570> wall<00:02:01.720> of<00:02:01.840> epoxy

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
soon as you go through the wall of epoxy

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.660 
soon as you go through the wall of epoxy
you're<00:02:02.500> into<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.830> foam<00:02:03.040> of<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.250> board<00:02:03.490> and

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
you're into the foam of the board and

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.310 
you're into the foam of the board and
the<00:02:03.760> drill<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.360> Dremel<00:02:04.720> will<00:02:04.840> actually<00:02:05.170> just

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
the drill the Dremel will actually just

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.440 
the drill the Dremel will actually just
eat<00:02:05.530> right<00:02:05.740> through<00:02:05.770> that<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.549> this<00:02:07.119> is<00:02:07.330> an

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
eat right through that so this is an

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.850 
eat right through that so this is an
area<00:02:07.750> where<00:02:07.930> you<00:02:08.019> have<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.289> take<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.500> lot<00:02:08.740> of

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
area where you have to take a lot of

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.410 
area where you have to take a lot of
caution<00:02:09.069> so<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:09.550> don't<00:02:09.700> get<00:02:09.819> too<00:02:10.000> many<00:02:10.179> big

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
caution so you don't get too many big

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.449 
caution so you don't get too many big
dips<00:02:10.720> into<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.290> styrofoam<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.250> don't

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
dips into the styrofoam so you don't

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:27.540 
dips into the styrofoam so you don't
damage<00:02:12.730> any<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.300> inter

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.070 

okay<00:02:28.550> at<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:28.790> point<00:02:28.910> we've<00:02:29.480> cleaned<00:02:29.750> out<00:02:29.930> the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
okay at this point we've cleaned out the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.750 
okay at this point we've cleaned out the
whole<00:02:30.200> box<00:02:30.500> everything's<00:02:31.070> nice<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.310> clean<00:02:31.610> in

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
whole box everything's nice and clean in

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.730 
whole box everything's nice and clean in
there<00:02:31.940> there's<00:02:32.180> no<00:02:32.270> old<00:02:32.510> resin<00:02:32.990> a<00:02:33.140> little<00:02:33.650> bit

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
there there's no old resin a little bit

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.090 
there there's no old resin a little bit
of<00:02:33.860> black<00:02:34.690> plastic<00:02:35.690> from<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.290> old<00:02:36.590> fin<00:02:36.860> box

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
of black plastic from the old fin box

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.890 
of black plastic from the old fin box
but<00:02:37.370> everything's<00:02:37.730> gone<00:02:37.970> everything<00:02:38.450> sanded

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
but everything's gone everything sanded

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.360 
but everything's gone everything sanded
in<00:02:39.020> there<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.740> now<00:02:39.800> we're<00:02:39.950> going<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.100> build<00:02:40.220> up

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
in there and now we're going to build up

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.940 
in there and now we're going to build up
the<00:02:40.550> walls<00:02:40.760> with<00:02:41.510> tape<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.140> once<00:02:42.560> we<00:02:42.770> do

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
the walls with tape so that once we do

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.220 
the walls with tape so that once we do
get<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.370> epoxy<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.030> there<00:02:44.240> it<00:02:44.720> kind<00:02:44.959> of<00:02:45.020> acts

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
get the epoxy in there it kind of acts

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.320 
get the epoxy in there it kind of acts
like<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.470> little<00:02:45.620> channel<00:02:46.550> just<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.880> prevent

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
like a little channel just to prevent

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.210 
like a little channel just to prevent
the<00:02:47.480> epoxy<00:02:47.990> from<00:02:48.140> spilling<00:02:48.590> over<00:02:48.709> into<00:02:48.920> the

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
the epoxy from spilling over into the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.160 
the epoxy from spilling over into the
other<00:02:49.340> spots<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.910> board<00:02:50.090> at<00:02:50.630> this<00:02:50.840> point

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
other spots of the board at this point

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.870 
other spots of the board at this point
we<00:02:51.290> highly<00:02:51.620> recommend<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:52.370> check<00:02:52.459> to

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
we highly recommend that you check to

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.490 
we highly recommend that you check to
make<00:02:53.000> sure<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.450> haven't<00:02:53.660> drilled<00:02:54.080> through

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
make sure you haven't drilled through

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.560 
make sure you haven't drilled through
your<00:02:54.709> stringer<00:02:55.550> to<00:02:56.000> end<00:02:56.150> up<00:02:56.300> on<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.540> other

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
your stringer to end up on the other

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.880 
your stringer to end up on the other
side<00:02:56.720> of<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.050> board<00:02:57.260> because<00:02:57.380> if<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.709> have

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
side of the board because if you have

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.490 
side of the board because if you have
all<00:02:58.130> your<00:02:58.280> pox<00:02:58.550> is<00:02:58.790> simply<00:02:59.150> go<00:02:59.239> link<00:02:59.540> leak<00:03:00.350> out

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
all your pox is simply go link leak out

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.680 
all your pox is simply go link leak out
through<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:00.950> other<00:03:01.100> side<00:03:01.430> this<00:03:02.360> is<00:03:02.510> not

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
through the other side this is not

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.140 
through the other side this is not
recommended<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.670> we'll<00:03:04.670> show<00:03:04.820> you<00:03:04.850> what<00:03:05.060> the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
recommended and we'll show you what the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.790 
recommended and we'll show you what the
wall<00:03:05.330> looks<00:03:05.570> like<00:03:05.750> once<00:03:05.989> it's<00:03:06.170> built<00:03:06.320> up<00:03:06.590> it

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
wall looks like once it's built up it

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.590 
wall looks like once it's built up it
will<00:03:06.980> set<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.220> fin<00:03:07.489> in<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:07.910> then<00:03:08.450> we're<00:03:08.570> on

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
will set the fin in and then we're on

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.040 
will set the fin in and then we're on
our<00:03:08.810> right<00:03:10.150> okay<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:11.239> now<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.540> board<00:03:11.900> is

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
our right okay so now the board is

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.720 
our right okay so now the board is
actually<00:03:12.260> taped<00:03:12.830> what<00:03:13.100> we've<00:03:13.250> done<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:13.550> we've

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
actually taped what we've done is we've

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.970 
actually taped what we've done is we've
built<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:14.030> little<00:03:14.180> wall<00:03:14.300> with<00:03:14.780> tape<00:03:15.050> as<00:03:15.290> well<00:03:15.830> as

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
built a little wall with tape as well as

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.100 
built a little wall with tape as well as
made<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.220> extended<00:03:17.120> tape<00:03:17.300> players<00:03:17.630> on<00:03:17.930> the

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
made the extended tape players on the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.160 
made the extended tape players on the
board<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:19.550> wall<00:03:19.730> is<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.480> prevent<00:03:20.900> any<00:03:21.110> other

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
board the wall is to prevent any other

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.900 
board the wall is to prevent any other
resin<00:03:21.620> from<00:03:21.739> going<00:03:22.130> anywhere<00:03:22.370> we've<00:03:22.730> also

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
resin from going anywhere we've also

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.850 
resin from going anywhere we've also
made<00:03:23.209> sure<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.780> board<00:03:24.020> is<00:03:24.200> level<00:03:24.650> so

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
made sure that the board is level so

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.100 
made sure that the board is level so
that<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.250> resin<00:03:25.760> doesn't<00:03:26.030> leak<00:03:26.180> out<00:03:26.360> and<00:03:26.540> the

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
that the resin doesn't leak out and the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.600 
that the resin doesn't leak out and the
rest<00:03:27.320> of<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.530> tape<00:03:27.739> three<00:03:28.070> or<00:03:28.160> four<00:03:28.400> layers

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
rest of the tape three or four layers

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.199 
rest of the tape three or four layers
thick<00:03:29.000> is<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:29.780> when<00:03:30.110> we<00:03:30.230> use<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.590> belt<00:03:30.799> sander

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
thick is so when we use the belt sander

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.430 
thick is so when we use the belt sander
it<00:03:32.209> doesn't<00:03:32.540> chew<00:03:32.690> away<00:03:32.810> at<00:03:32.959> your<00:03:33.230> board

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
it doesn't chew away at your board

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.990 
it doesn't chew away at your board
surface<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:34.070> want<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.280> try<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:34.549> keep<00:03:34.640> this<00:03:34.820> as
