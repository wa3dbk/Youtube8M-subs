and<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.240> bolts<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.990> gets<00:01:49.229> sandwiched<00:01:49.619> in

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and it bolts on and gets sandwiched in

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.999 
and it bolts on and gets sandwiched in
between<00:01:49.920> here

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.859 

I<00:01:53.070> took<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.640> louver<00:01:54.060> off<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.659> hood

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
I took the louver off of the hood

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.990 
I took the louver off of the hood
because<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.320> thought<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.880> just<00:01:56.880> looked

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
because I thought it just looked

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.569 
because I thought it just looked
ridiculous<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.990> now<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.310> really

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
ridiculous so now I have this really

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.730 
ridiculous so now I have this really
attractive<00:01:59.759> electrical<00:02:00.750> tape<00:02:00.960> patch<00:02:01.290> which<00:02:01.619> I

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
attractive electrical tape patch which I

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.899 
attractive electrical tape patch which I
think<00:02:01.979> looks<00:02:02.189> much<00:02:02.399> better

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909

that I put on back when I was sitting

that I put on back when I was sitting
quite<00:05:37.169> a<00:05:37.199> bit<00:05:37.380> lower<00:05:37.590> and<00:05:37.979> I<00:05:38.909> really<00:05:39.180> had<00:05:39.330> a

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
quite a bit lower and I really had a

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.999 
quite a bit lower and I really had a
need<00:05:39.599> for<00:05:39.780> a<00:05:39.840> snorkel<00:05:40.349> because<00:05:40.500> several<00:05:40.710> times

I<00:05:41.159> sucked<00:05:41.780> water<00:05:42.780> in<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.169> intake<00:05:43.349> not<00:05:44.280> a<00:05:44.340> lot

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
I sucked water in the intake not a lot

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.270 
I sucked water in the intake not a lot
but<00:05:44.940> enough<00:05:45.150> to<00:05:45.840> make<00:05:45.870> it<00:05:46.020> stumble<00:05:46.530> and<00:05:46.710> I<00:05:47.159> was

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
but enough to make it stumble and I was

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.969 
but enough to make it stumble and I was
concerned<00:05:47.669> I<00:05:47.880> might<00:05:48.060> to<00:05:48.330> end<00:05:49.289> up<00:05:49.440> bending<00:05:49.680> some

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
concerned I might to end up bending some

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.890 
concerned I might to end up bending some
valves<00:05:50.370> or<00:05:50.520> something<00:05:50.909> so<00:05:51.210> I<00:05:51.419> bought<00:05:51.750> the

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
valves or something so I bought the

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.740 
valves or something so I bought the
snorkel<00:05:52.409> is<00:05:52.560> cheap<00:05:52.860> insurance<00:05:53.460> and<00:05:53.750> that's

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
snorkel is cheap insurance and that's

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.390 
snorkel is cheap insurance and that's
back<00:05:55.110> when<00:05:55.349> it<00:05:55.469> was<00:05:55.500> sitting<00:05:55.919> down<00:05:55.949> about

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
back when it was sitting down about

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.879 
back when it was sitting down about
right<00:05:56.460> here<00:05:57.090> and<00:05:57.300> it<00:05:57.690> meant<00:05:57.900> a<00:05:57.960> lot<00:05:57.990> more<00:05:58.380> now

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
right here and it meant a lot more now

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.360 
right here and it meant a lot more now
that<00:05:58.919> it's<00:05:59.250> up<00:05:59.400> here<00:05:59.750> I<00:06:00.750> rarely<00:06:01.500> have<00:06:01.800> any<00:06:01.860> sort

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
that it's up here I rarely have any sort

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.290 
that it's up here I rarely have any sort
of<00:06:02.599> ingestion<00:06:03.599> problem<00:06:04.550> sitting<00:06:05.550> this<00:06:05.789> high<00:06:06.000> I

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
of ingestion problem sitting this high I

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.529 
of ingestion problem sitting this high I
have<00:06:07.199> had<00:06:07.409> this<00:06:07.590> submerged<00:06:08.099> I<00:06:08.430> have<00:06:09.090> had<00:06:09.270> water

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
have had this submerged I have had water

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.159 
have had this submerged I have had water
over<00:06:09.900> the<00:06:10.020> hood<00:06:10.229> door<00:06:10.830> handles<00:06:11.870> right<00:06:12.870> about

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
over the hood door handles right about

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.980 
over the hood door handles right about
at<00:06:13.380> this<00:06:13.620> level<00:06:13.889> the<00:06:14.610> h3<00:06:15.090> becomes<00:06:15.419> buoyant<00:06:15.659> and

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
at this level the h3 becomes buoyant and

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.309 
at this level the h3 becomes buoyant and
begins<00:06:16.380> to<00:06:16.560> float<00:06:16.830> and<00:06:18.050> that's<00:06:19.050> a<00:06:19.139> real

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 
begins to float and that's a real

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.180 
begins to float and that's a real
problem<00:06:19.740> if<00:06:19.860> there's<00:06:20.039> current<00:06:20.219> so<00:06:22.190> something

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
problem if there's current so something

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.589 
problem if there's current so something
you<00:06:23.219> don't<00:06:23.400> really<00:06:23.550> think<00:06:23.639> about<00:06:23.969> that<00:06:24.360> much

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
you don't really think about that much

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:28.820 
you don't really think about that much
but<00:06:26.389> that<00:06:27.389> would<00:06:27.479> be<00:06:27.599> a<00:06:27.630> nasty<00:06:28.020> situation<00:06:28.199> when

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
but that would be a nasty situation when

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.890 
but that would be a nasty situation when
your<00:06:28.949> tires<00:06:29.159> come<00:06:29.400> off<00:06:29.580> the<00:06:29.789> floor<00:06:30.479> of<00:06:30.780> the

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
your tires come off the floor of the

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.649 
your tires come off the floor of the
river<00:06:31.110> and<00:06:31.440> you<00:06:31.819> can<00:06:32.819> no<00:06:32.969> longer<00:06:33.240> propel

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659 
river and you can no longer propel

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.930 
river and you can no longer propel
yourself<00:06:33.810> out<00:06:34.229> of<00:06:34.409> trouble<00:06:34.800> and<00:06:34.949> you<00:06:35.460> start<00:06:35.820> to

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
yourself out of trouble and you start to

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.070 
yourself out of trouble and you start to
drift<00:06:36.240> that's<00:06:37.139> a<00:06:37.440> nightmare<00:06:37.680> scenario
