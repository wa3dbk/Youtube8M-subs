00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
that's the still I don't know why it's

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.549

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
like purple like that he said that the

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.979 
like purple like that he said that the
skin<00:00:38.920> broke<00:00:39.550> just<00:00:40.059> as<00:00:40.239> he<00:00:40.360> was<00:00:40.420> uploading<00:00:40.900> it

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
skin broke just as he was uploading it

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.840

or<00:00:41.110> something<00:00:41.380> with<00:00:41.530> that<00:00:41.650> and<00:00:41.890> then<00:00:42.670> this

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
or something with that and then this

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.700 
or something with that and then this
would<00:00:43.059> be<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.360> flowing<00:00:44.140> one<00:00:44.790> it's<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:47.500> very

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
would be the flowing one it's it's very

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.000 
would be the flowing one it's it's very
cool<00:00:48.180> yeah<00:00:49.180> releases<00:00:49.839> bubbles<00:00:50.199> like<00:00:50.320> that<00:00:50.530> mmm

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
cool yeah releases bubbles like that mmm

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.410 
cool yeah releases bubbles like that mmm
it<00:00:51.339> kills<00:00:51.640> you<00:00:51.850> quicker<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:54.190> if<00:00:55.120> you<00:00:55.210> go<00:00:55.330> in

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
it kills you quicker then if you go in

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.689 
it kills you quicker then if you go in
water<00:00:55.629> just<00:00:56.019> kills<00:00:56.260> it<00:00:56.350> just<00:00:56.589> a<00:00:56.680> klava<00:00:56.920> cosy

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
water just kills it just a klava cosy

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.240 
water just kills it just a klava cosy
quicker<00:00:57.940> than<00:00:58.150> lava<00:00:58.360> it<00:00:58.960> flows<00:00:59.470> quicker<00:00:59.980> than

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
quicker than lava it flows quicker than

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.920 
quicker than lava it flows quicker than
the<00:01:00.309> lava<00:01:00.519> I<00:01:00.760> think<00:01:01.120> it<00:01:01.239> feels<00:01:01.360> quicker<00:01:01.720> than

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
the lava I think it feels quicker than

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.550 
the lava I think it feels quicker than
water<00:01:02.199> -<00:01:02.850> could<00:01:03.850> be<00:01:03.940> wrong<00:01:04.140> when<00:01:05.140> it<00:01:05.230> touches

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
water - could be wrong when it touches

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.750 
water - could be wrong when it touches
water<00:01:06.040> it<00:01:06.570> tends<00:01:07.570> to<00:01:07.690> ice<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.350> wife<00:01:08.530> does<00:01:08.800> when

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
water it tends to ice the wife does when

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
water it tends to ice the wife does when
it<00:01:09.940> touches<00:01:10.270> lava<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.560> turns<00:01:12.010> to<00:01:12.909> sand<00:01:13.330> I'll

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
it touches lava it turns to sand I'll

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:22.650 
it touches lava it turns to sand I'll
show<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:14.409> that<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.360> as<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:22.510> can<00:01:22.600> see

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
show you that so as you can see

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.910 
show you that so as you can see
immediately<00:01:23.110> it<00:01:23.530> just<00:01:23.710> turns<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:24.400> it

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.640 

kills<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:28.850> pretty<00:01:29.180> quickly<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:30.049> as<00:01:30.439> you<00:01:30.530> can

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
kills you pretty quickly and as you can

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.100 
kills you pretty quickly and as you can
see<00:01:30.799> it<00:01:30.860> just<00:01:30.920> creates<00:01:31.369> in

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.370 

so<00:01:36.110> yeah<00:01:36.320> it's<00:01:36.800> not<00:01:37.330> really<00:01:38.330> too<00:01:38.960> much<00:01:39.110> more

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
so yeah it's not really too much more

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.140 
so yeah it's not really too much more
than<00:01:39.560> odd<00:01:39.770> at<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.220> moment

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
than odd at the moment

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.260 
than odd at the moment
there<00:01:42.720> will<00:01:42.900> be<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.410> it<00:01:44.160> basically<00:01:44.400> acts<00:01:44.970> at

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
there will be and it basically acts at

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.790 
there will be and it basically acts at
the<00:01:45.330> exact<00:01:45.690> same<00:01:45.900> as<00:01:47.420> water<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.720> lava<00:01:48.930> they

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
the exact same as water and lava they

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.560 
the exact same as water and lava they
might<00:01:50.070> level<00:01:50.460> change<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.760> properties<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.450> it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
might level change the properties to it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.710 
might level change the properties to it
like<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> way<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:53.490> goes<00:01:53.760> just<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.510> way<00:01:54.630> it

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
like the way like goes just the way it

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.650 
like the way like goes just the way it
acts<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:55.170> stuff<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.440> that<00:01:55.620> but<00:01:56.630> yeah<00:01:57.630> I

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
acts and stuff like that but yeah I

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.050 
acts and stuff like that but yeah I
think<00:01:57.810> that's<00:01:58.230> that's<00:01:59.160> all<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.370> have<00:01:59.760> to<00:01:59.910> show

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
think that's that's all I have to show

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:09.230 
think that's that's all I have to show
you<00:02:00.150> guys<00:02:00.350> see<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.440> later

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.300 

you
