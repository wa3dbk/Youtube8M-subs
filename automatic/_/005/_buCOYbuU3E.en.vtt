so<00:02:17.740> let's<00:02:17.860> find<00:02:18.100> something<00:02:18.310> with<00:02:18.640> three

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
so let's find something with three

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.620 
so let's find something with three
yellow<00:02:19.840> zones<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:22.090> can<00:02:22.210> do<00:02:22.300> something<00:02:22.510> like

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
yellow zones we can do something like

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.540 
yellow zones we can do something like
cover<00:02:23.200> three<00:02:23.470> dropper<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.160> can<00:02:24.280> see<00:02:24.370> we<00:02:24.460> have

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
cover three dropper you can see we have
