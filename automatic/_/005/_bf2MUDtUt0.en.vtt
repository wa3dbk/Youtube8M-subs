used<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.739> put<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.010> on<00:02:28.099> their<00:02:28.250> hair<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.610> turn<00:02:28.790> it

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
used to put it on their hair and turn it

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.570 
used to put it on their hair and turn it
white<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:29.840> just<00:02:30.769> a<00:02:30.860> word<00:02:31.130> of<00:02:31.220> warning

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
white so just a word of warning

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.940 
white so just a word of warning
I<00:02:31.700> am<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.360> just<00:02:32.540> just<00:02:32.959> did<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.230> little<00:02:33.560> test<00:02:33.800> of

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
I am I just just did a little test of

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.009 
I am I just just did a little test of
this<00:02:34.099> in<00:02:34.310> my<00:02:34.459> anger<00:02:34.819> went<00:02:35.000> white<00:02:35.180> because<00:02:35.750> and

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
this in my anger went white because and

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.080 
this in my anger went white because and
it<00:02:36.110> kind<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.380> stings<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.980> little<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:37.819> need

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
it kind of stings a little so you need

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.670 
it kind of stings a little so you need
to<00:02:38.239> wear<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.950> gloves<00:02:39.950> for<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.810> all<00:02:41.810> right<00:02:42.019> so

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
to wear the gloves for this all right so

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.620 
to wear the gloves for this all right so
this<00:02:42.890> is<00:02:43.099> hydrogen<00:02:43.730> peroxide<00:02:43.970> is<00:02:44.390> great

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
this is hydrogen peroxide is great

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.330 
this is hydrogen peroxide is great
because<00:02:44.810> it's<00:02:45.019> completely<00:02:45.530> non-toxic

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
because it's completely non-toxic

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.640 
because it's completely non-toxic
it's<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.790> bleach<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.599> it's<00:02:47.959> going<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.230> soak<00:02:48.470> into

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
it's a bleach so it's going to soak into

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.319 
it's a bleach so it's going to soak into
the<00:02:48.739> wood<00:02:48.860> fibers<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.670> pull<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.180> yellow

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
the wood fibers and pull the yellow

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.140 
the wood fibers and pull the yellow
right<00:02:51.230> out<00:02:51.410> some<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.340> think<00:02:52.430> oh<00:02:52.700> yeah<00:02:52.940> it's

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
right out some I think oh yeah it's

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.880 
right out some I think oh yeah it's
working<00:02:53.269> see<00:02:53.660> look<00:02:53.840> my<00:02:53.959> cloth<00:02:54.230> is<00:02:54.410> going<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.739> bit

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
working see look my cloth is going a bit

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.449 
working see look my cloth is going a bit
yellow<00:02:55.120> yay<00:02:56.500> what<00:02:57.500> about<00:02:57.650> over<00:02:57.769> here<00:02:58.130> on<00:02:58.280> this

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
yellow yay what about over here on this

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.780 
yellow yay what about over here on this
weird<00:02:59.299> sort<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.930> tea<00:03:00.170> stain<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:01.040> this<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.610> my

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
weird sort of tea stain so this is in my

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.610 
weird sort of tea stain so this is in my
opinion<00:03:02.329> just<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.720> little<00:03:02.989> bit<00:03:03.140> better<00:03:03.290> than

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
opinion just a little bit better than

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.860 
opinion just a little bit better than
lemon<00:03:04.340> juice<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:05.360> know<00:03:05.480> if<00:03:05.599> you've<00:03:05.690> got<00:03:05.720> a

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
lemon juice you know if you've got a

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.839 
lemon juice you know if you've got a
really<00:03:06.170> deep<00:03:06.530> stain<00:03:06.920> probably<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.489> best<00:03:07.700> way

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
really deep stain probably the best way

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.789 
really deep stain probably the best way
to<00:03:07.880> do<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.299> is<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.690> put<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.260> really<00:03:09.530> saturate

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
to do this is to put to really saturate

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.880 
to do this is to put to really saturate
the<00:03:10.280> cloth<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.970> make<00:03:11.000> a<00:03:11.720> poultice<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:12.560> just

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
the cloth and make a poultice and just

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.770 
the cloth and make a poultice and just
leave<00:03:13.130> it<00:03:13.310> right<00:03:13.519> on<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.880> stain<00:03:14.209> because<00:03:14.569> then

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
leave it right on the stain because then

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.710 
leave it right on the stain because then
it'll<00:03:14.989> keep<00:03:15.319> drawing<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.459> pigment<00:03:17.150> in<00:03:17.510> the

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
it'll keep drawing the pigment in the

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.990 
it'll keep drawing the pigment in the
stain<00:03:18.049> right<00:03:18.319> out<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.859> it'll<00:03:19.310> soak<00:03:19.639> into<00:03:19.880> the

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
stain right out and it'll soak into the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.890 
stain right out and it'll soak into the
cloth<00:03:20.299> so<00:03:20.750> that's<00:03:20.930> one<00:03:21.139> way<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.350> go<00:03:22.900> because

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
cloth so that's one way to go because

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.360 
cloth so that's one way to go because
again<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.590> whole<00:03:24.620> point<00:03:24.950> of<00:03:25.100> this<00:03:25.190> is<00:03:25.340> that

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
again the whole point of this is that

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.849 
again the whole point of this is that
you're<00:03:25.670> avoiding<00:03:26.000> sanding<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.440> see<00:03:27.650> what<00:03:27.769> I'm

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
you're avoiding sanding you see what I'm

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.979 
you're avoiding sanding you see what I'm
saying<00:03:28.100> all<00:03:28.940> right<00:03:29.000> so<00:03:29.239> I'll<00:03:29.510> just<00:03:29.630> go<00:03:29.750> at<00:03:29.870> this

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
saying all right so I'll just go at this

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.440 
saying all right so I'll just go at this
a<00:03:30.049> little<00:03:30.290> bit<00:03:30.500> longer<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.160> then<00:03:31.850> I'll<00:03:32.209> show

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
a little bit longer and then I'll show

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
a little bit longer and then I'll show
you<00:03:32.480> my<00:03:32.720> results<00:03:32.980> very<00:03:33.980> impressive<00:03:35.170> all<00:03:36.170> right

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
you my results very impressive all right

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.420 
you my results very impressive all right
so<00:03:36.829> my<00:03:37.190> conclusion<00:03:38.060> is<00:03:38.450> that<00:03:38.889> lemon<00:03:39.889> and<00:03:40.100> salt

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
so my conclusion is that lemon and salt

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.520 
so my conclusion is that lemon and salt
doesn't<00:03:40.850> really<00:03:41.209> work<00:03:41.480> that<00:03:41.690> well<00:03:41.870> for<00:03:42.109> for

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
doesn't really work that well for for

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.309 
doesn't really work that well for for
really<00:03:42.859> deep<00:03:43.370> stains<00:03:43.989> peroxides<00:03:44.989> a<00:03:45.139> lot

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
really deep stains peroxides a lot

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.920 
really deep stains peroxides a lot
better<00:03:45.590> it<00:03:45.950> definitely<00:03:46.940> improved<00:03:47.359> the<00:03:47.690> look

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
better it definitely improved the look

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.979 
better it definitely improved the look
of<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:48.350> surface<00:03:49.280> if<00:03:49.579> I<00:03:50.299> really<00:03:50.660> wanted<00:03:50.900> to

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
of the surface if I really wanted to

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.140 
of the surface if I really wanted to
make<00:03:51.200> this<00:03:51.350> beautiful<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:52.459> restore<00:03:52.850> it<00:03:52.970> I

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
make this beautiful and restore it I

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.759 
make this beautiful and restore it I
would<00:03:53.329> definitely<00:03:53.900> have<00:03:54.049> to<00:03:54.079> sand<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.739> down

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
would definitely have to sand it down

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.740 
would definitely have to sand it down
and<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.519> would<00:03:55.670> start<00:03:55.970> probably<00:03:56.239> with<00:03:56.480> about<00:03:56.720> a

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
and I would start probably with about a

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.569 
and I would start probably with about a
hundred<00:03:57.079> and<00:03:57.170> twenty<00:03:57.380> grit<00:03:57.769> sandpaper<00:03:58.130> and

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
hundred and twenty grit sandpaper and

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.339 
hundred and twenty grit sandpaper and
work<00:03:58.700> all<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.060> way<00:03:59.150> up<00:03:59.239> to<00:03:59.359> about<00:03:59.480> 400<00:04:00.200> which

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
work all the way up to about 400 which

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.500 
work all the way up to about 400 which
is<00:04:00.500> really<00:04:00.950> smooth<00:04:01.370> that<00:04:01.700> would<00:04:01.880> be<00:04:01.970> nice<00:04:02.180> but

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
is really smooth that would be nice but

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.599 
is really smooth that would be nice but
I'm<00:04:03.109> you<00:04:03.560> know<00:04:03.650> I'm<00:04:03.769> gonna<00:04:03.920> call<00:04:04.190> this<00:04:04.370> good

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
I'm you know I'm gonna call this good

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.160 
I'm you know I'm gonna call this good
because<00:04:04.880> I<00:04:05.030> think<00:04:05.329> when<00:04:05.569> I<00:04:05.599> apply<00:04:06.109> the

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
because I think when I apply the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.699 
because I think when I apply the
food-safe<00:04:07.069> finish<00:04:07.519> it'll<00:04:07.880> probably<00:04:08.150> make<00:04:08.709> the

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
food-safe finish it'll probably make the

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.710 
food-safe finish it'll probably make the
stains<00:04:10.010> just<00:04:10.310> disappear<00:04:10.880> a<00:04:10.910> little<00:04:11.180> bit<00:04:11.299> so

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
stains just disappear a little bit so

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.659 
stains just disappear a little bit so
what<00:04:11.930> can<00:04:12.079> you<00:04:12.200> use<00:04:12.230> walnut<00:04:13.010> oil<00:04:13.040> is<00:04:13.489> my
