screws that hold this the strain relief
the<00:00:47.850> strain<00:00:48.300> relief<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> part<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> cord

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
the strain relief is a part of the cord

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.979 
the strain relief is a part of the cord
that<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.879> holds<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.330> there<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.720> if<00:00:51.870> you

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
apparatus and so we're going to flip

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.339 
apparatus and so we're going to flip
this<00:01:56.849> over<00:01:57.090> take<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.450> cover<00:01:57.750> off<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.990> get<00:01:58.289> a

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
this over take the cover off to get a

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:04.699 
this over take the cover off to get a
closer<00:01:58.619> look<00:02:03.110> okay<00:02:04.110> we're<00:02:04.289> going<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.500> have<00:02:04.590> to

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
closer look okay we're going to have to

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.639 
closer look okay we're going to have to
move<00:02:04.890> these<00:02:05.069> knobs<00:02:05.599> this<00:02:06.599> this<00:02:07.080> lever<00:02:07.380> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
move these knobs this this lever that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.180 
move these knobs this this lever that
takes<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> toast<00:02:08.759> down<00:02:09.649> pretty<00:02:10.649> tough<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.069> get

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
takes the toast down pretty tough to get

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.589 
takes the toast down pretty tough to get
off<00:02:11.250> sometimes<00:02:11.849> they're<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> little<00:02:12.330> jagged

one two three more on this and we're
just<00:03:18.079> mentally<00:03:18.530> just<00:03:18.739> twist<00:03:19.099> them<00:03:19.250> you<00:03:20.000> want

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
just mentally just twist them you want

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.929 
just mentally just twist them you want
to<00:03:20.269> pay<00:03:20.419> attention<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.049> these<00:03:21.199> slots<00:03:21.739> of<00:03:22.699> the

sheets and those sheets slide through
those<00:03:29.000> slots<00:03:29.449> so<00:03:29.750> you'll<00:03:29.900> need<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.139> know<00:03:30.259> that

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
those slots so you'll need to know that

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.390 
those slots so you'll need to know that
when<00:03:30.650> you're<00:03:30.709> putting<00:03:30.979> it<00:03:31.069> back<00:03:31.189> together<00:03:31.370> so

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
when you're putting it back together so

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.360 
when you're putting it back together so
we'll<00:03:34.400> twist<00:03:34.639> these<00:03:34.909> straight<00:03:35.439> so<00:03:36.439> come<00:03:37.220> out

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
we'll twist these straight so come out

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.949 
we'll twist these straight so come out
of<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.669> will<00:03:38.090> be<00:03:38.180> able<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.389> lift<00:03:38.569> off<00:03:38.720> this

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
of the will be able to lift off this

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:45.189 
of the will be able to lift off this
piece<00:03:42.759> once<00:03:43.759> we<00:03:44.000> have<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.329> metal<00:03:44.569> tabs<00:03:44.840> bent

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
piece once we have the metal tabs bent

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.259 
piece once we have the metal tabs bent
straight<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:45.949> that<00:03:46.129> we<00:03:46.189> can<00:03:46.370> pop<00:03:46.699> the<00:03:46.849> top<00:03:47.030> off

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
straight so that we can pop the top off

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.539 
straight so that we can pop the top off
we<00:03:47.599> should<00:03:47.629> be<00:03:47.989> able<00:03:48.109> to<00:03:48.259> beam<00:03:48.439> it<00:03:48.590> fairly

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
we should be able to beam it fairly

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.410 
we should be able to beam it fairly
easily

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.970 

that<00:03:56.420> allows<00:03:56.659> us<00:03:56.689> access<00:03:57.140> to<00:03:57.409> the<00:03:57.620> inside

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
that allows us access to the inside

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.220 
that allows us access to the inside
these<00:03:58.220> are<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:59.299> sections<00:03:59.930> of<00:04:00.140> the

that<00:04:16.609> that's<00:04:17.030> where<00:04:17.299> there's<00:04:17.509> a<00:04:17.630> big<00:04:17.989> burn

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
that that's where there's a big burn

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.740 
that that's where there's a big burn
spot<00:04:18.680> in<00:04:18.889> it<00:04:19.009> and<00:04:19.729> once<00:04:19.880> we<00:04:20.030> slid<00:04:20.359> those<00:04:20.539> off

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.200 
spot in it and once we slid those off
and<00:04:21.079> again<00:04:21.500> you<00:04:21.680> see<00:04:21.859> the<00:04:22.009> slots<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.789> section

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
and again you see the slots the section

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.200 
and again you see the slots the section
slides<00:04:23.539> in<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.919> pay<00:04:24.919> attention<00:04:25.370> to<00:04:25.490> those<00:04:25.639> and

slide<00:04:29.210> out<00:04:29.479> that<00:04:30.430> middle<00:04:31.430> element<00:04:31.970> if<00:04:32.090> you<00:04:32.210> can

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
slide out that middle element if you can

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.450 
slide out that middle element if you can
I<00:04:32.780> see<00:04:33.139> that<00:04:33.169> we<00:04:33.380> can't<00:04:33.680> because<00:04:34.130> we<00:04:34.280> haven't

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
I see that we can't because we haven't

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.310 
I see that we can't because we haven't
been<00:04:35.199> released<00:04:36.199> our<00:04:37.389> metal<00:04:38.389> tab<00:04:38.630> so<00:04:38.960> we'll<00:04:39.169> do

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
been released our metal tab so we'll do

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.500 
been released our metal tab so we'll do
that<00:04:39.350> right<00:04:39.710> now<00:04:39.860> there<00:04:40.460> are<00:04:40.580> four<00:04:40.820> tabs<00:04:41.030> when

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
that right now there are four tabs when

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.800 
that right now there are four tabs when
here<00:04:41.840> one<00:04:42.260> here<00:04:42.620> one<00:04:42.860> here<00:04:43.850> and<00:04:44.479> then<00:04:44.690> right

metal strip it's the heating element it
costs<00:05:48.440> about<00:05:48.560> $20<00:05:49.280> a<00:05:49.400> roll<00:05:50.680> but<00:05:51.680> as<00:05:52.010> you<00:05:52.280> can

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
costs about $20 a roll but as you can

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.040 
costs about $20 a roll but as you can
see<00:05:52.610> it<00:05:52.699> would<00:05:52.820> be<00:05:52.849> difficult<00:05:53.150> to<00:05:53.479> string<00:05:53.900> it
