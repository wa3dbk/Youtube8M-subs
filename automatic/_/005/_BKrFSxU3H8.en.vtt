breakouts and my breakouts I would

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.300

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
without using a foundation because I

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.040 
without using a foundation because I
really<00:02:23.800> think<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:25.480> main<00:02:25.630> reason<00:02:25.900> I'm

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
really think the main reason I'm

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.840 
really think the main reason I'm
breaking<00:02:26.350> out<00:02:26.440> besides<00:02:26.860> getting<00:02:27.340> my<00:02:27.430> period

breaking out besides getting my period

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.030 
breaking out besides getting my period

if you just get like mine where you're

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.220 
if you just get like mine where you're
easily<00:02:39.210> prone<00:02:40.210> to<00:02:40.420> breaking<00:02:40.750> out<00:02:40.870> what

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
easily prone to breaking out what

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.430 
easily prone to breaking out what
foundations<00:02:41.740> use<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.190> are<00:02:42.280> full<00:02:42.520> coverage

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.129 
active breakouts everything is actually
just<00:04:23.520> coming<00:04:23.910> down<00:04:23.940> what<00:04:24.360> I'm<00:04:24.479> left<00:04:24.660> with<00:04:24.810> now

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
hyperpigmentation and I usually get

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.879 
hyperpigmentation and I usually get
those<00:04:31.919> after<00:04:32.400> I<00:04:32.430> get<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.639> breakout<00:04:33.090> which<00:04:33.300> sucks

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
lightening my hyperpigmentation issues

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.469 
lightening my hyperpigmentation issues
but<00:04:45.240> I<00:04:45.539> do<00:04:46.410> have<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:46.860> say<00:04:47.099> that<00:04:47.520> I<00:04:47.789> think<00:04:48.210> a

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
but I do have to say that I think a

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.390 
but I do have to say that I think a
large<00:04:48.750> part<00:04:48.870> of<00:04:49.199> why<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.410> was<00:04:49.650> breaking<00:04:49.830> out<00:04:50.099> was

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
large part of why I was breaking out was

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.070 
large part of why I was breaking out was
this<00:04:50.580> foundation<00:04:51.240> because<00:04:51.539> as<00:04:51.690> soon<00:04:51.810> as<00:04:51.960> I

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
this foundation because as soon as I

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.420 
this foundation because as soon as I
stopped<00:04:52.440> my<00:04:53.280> face<00:04:53.550> just<00:04:54.210> calm<00:04:55.139> down<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.949> is

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
stopped my face just calm down and is

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.300 
stopped my face just calm down and is
trying<00:04:56.909> to<00:04:57.000> heal<00:04:57.150> itself<00:04:57.479> I<00:04:57.690> guess<00:04:57.990> but<00:04:58.860> I

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
trying to heal itself I guess but I

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.790 
trying to heal itself I guess but I
don't<00:04:59.729> mean<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.090> bash<00:05:00.870> this<00:05:01.169> foundation<00:05:01.650> at

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
don't mean to bash this foundation at

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.170 
don't mean to bash this foundation at
all<00:05:01.979> I<00:05:02.220> actually<00:05:02.400> really<00:05:02.760> like<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.060> way<00:05:03.090> that

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
all I actually really like the way that

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.460 
all I actually really like the way that
it<00:05:03.479> looks<00:05:03.750> and<00:05:04.020> I<00:05:04.860> like<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.400> color<00:05:06.110> but<00:05:07.110> it

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
it looks and I like the color but it

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.830 
it looks and I like the color but it
just<00:05:07.830> didn't<00:05:08.370> work<00:05:08.400> with<00:05:08.849> my<00:05:09.030> skin<00:05:09.419> and<00:05:09.659> I<00:05:09.780> do

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840

just didn't work with my skin and I do
have<00:05:10.199> acne<00:05:10.560> prone<00:05:10.590> skin<00:05:10.970> so<00:05:11.970> I<00:05:12.860> will<00:05:13.860> no<00:05:14.370> longer

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.339 
have acne prone skin so I will no longer
be<00:05:14.789> using<00:05:15.030> this<00:05:15.240> foundation<00:05:15.449> I<00:05:15.900> mean<00:05:16.080> it<00:05:16.229> this

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
be using this foundation I mean it this

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:17.960 
be using this foundation I mean it this
is<00:05:16.530> not<00:05:16.770> like<00:05:16.979> my<00:05:17.190> Holy<00:05:17.610> Grail

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
is not like my Holy Grail

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.219 
is not like my Holy Grail
absolute<00:05:18.360> they<00:05:18.509> have<00:05:18.599> a<00:05:18.659> foundation<00:05:18.810> or

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
absolute they have a foundation or

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.950 
absolute they have a foundation or
anything<00:05:19.550> but<00:05:20.550> I<00:05:20.610> did<00:05:20.849> spend<00:05:21.060> money<00:05:21.270> on<00:05:21.360> it<00:05:21.659> and

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
anything but I did spend money on it and

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.469 
anything but I did spend money on it and
it's<00:05:22.199> not<00:05:22.380> cheap<00:05:22.680> so<00:05:22.710> I<00:05:23.610> really<00:05:24.030> wanted<00:05:24.330> it<00:05:24.449> to

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
it's not cheap so I really wanted it to

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.439 
it's not cheap so I really wanted it to
work<00:05:24.630> but<00:05:25.370> the<00:05:26.370> way<00:05:26.520> that<00:05:26.699> it<00:05:26.820> looks<00:05:27.000> versus

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
work but the way that it looks versus

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.629 
work but the way that it looks versus
what<00:05:27.599> happened<00:05:27.900> to<00:05:27.990> my<00:05:28.080> skin<00:05:28.440> is<00:05:28.710> just<00:05:29.039> there's

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
what happened to my skin is just there's

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.070 
what happened to my skin is just there's
no<00:05:29.900> contest<00:05:30.900> I'm<00:05:31.169> not<00:05:31.500> going<00:05:31.830> to<00:05:32.870> let<00:05:33.870> my<00:05:34.020> skin

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
no contest I'm not going to let my skin

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.080

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.719 
anymore and I do like there's so many
other<00:05:46.199> foundations<00:05:46.740> that<00:05:46.830> I<00:05:46.919> could<00:05:47.190> use<00:05:47.370> that

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
other foundations that I could use that

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.610 
other foundations that I could use that
