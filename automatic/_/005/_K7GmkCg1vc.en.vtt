they practice carefully they move with
great<00:02:49.100> fluidity<00:02:49.660> but<00:02:50.660> in<00:02:50.780> terms<00:02:50.990> of<00:02:51.170> how<00:02:51.290> far

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
great fluidity but in terms of how far

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.450 
great fluidity but in terms of how far
to<00:02:51.770> run<00:02:52.240> the<00:02:53.240> usual<00:02:53.510> maxim<00:02:54.080> is<00:02:54.200> run<00:02:54.440> long<00:02:54.650> run<00:02:55.280> a

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
to run the usual maxim is run long run a

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.660 
to run the usual maxim is run long run a
long<00:02:55.820> way<00:02:56.090> because<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.260> can<00:02:57.470> run<00:02:57.710> faster<00:02:58.520> with

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
long way because you can run faster with

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.120 
long way because you can run faster with
a<00:02:58.730> boat<00:02:59.000> over<00:02:59.300> a<00:02:59.990> short<00:03:00.380> distance<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.920> few

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
a boat over a short distance a few

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.130 
a boat over a short distance a few
hundred<00:03:01.400> meters<00:03:01.790> then<00:03:02.300> you<00:03:02.420> can<00:03:02.600> paddle<00:03:02.900> that

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
hundred meters then you can paddle that

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.590 
hundred meters then you can paddle that
boat<00:03:03.380> so<00:03:04.220> if<00:03:04.370> you've<00:03:04.490> dropped<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.910> bit<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.209> space

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
boat so if you've dropped a bit of space

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.420 
boat so if you've dropped a bit of space
and<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:05.959> are<00:03:06.080> down<00:03:06.500> on<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.860> group<00:03:07.040> ahead<00:03:07.310> of

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
and you are down on the group ahead of

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.550 
and you are down on the group ahead of
you<00:03:07.580> you<00:03:08.000> can<00:03:08.209> maybe<00:03:08.480> make<00:03:08.840> up<00:03:09.110> by<00:03:09.380> running

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
you you can maybe make up by running

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.330 
you you can maybe make up by running
long<00:03:09.920> but<00:03:10.580> that<00:03:10.700> said<00:03:11.030> top<00:03:11.990> paddlers<00:03:12.470> will<00:03:12.830> get

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
long but that said top paddlers will get

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.150 
long but that said top paddlers will get
out<00:03:13.520> fast<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.150> portage<00:03:14.810> fast<00:03:15.110> get<00:03:15.800> back<00:03:15.980> in

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
out fast and portage fast get back in

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.310 
out fast and portage fast get back in
the<00:03:16.340> onto<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.090> river<00:03:17.300> at<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.480> far<00:03:17.750> end<00:03:18.020> and

the onto the river at the far end and

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.050 
the onto the river at the far end and
instead<00:03:19.190> of<00:03:19.370> paddling<00:03:19.670> them<00:03:19.790> by<00:03:19.880> themselves

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
instead of paddling them by themselves

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.000 
instead of paddling them by themselves
for<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.600> next<00:03:20.840> lap<00:03:21.020> or<00:03:21.170> two<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.470> having<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.830> do

for the next lap or two and having to do
all<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.490> work<00:03:22.780> they<00:03:23.780> might<00:03:23.959> just<00:03:23.990> sit<00:03:24.320> there

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
all the work they might just sit there

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.770 
all the work they might just sit there
stop<00:03:24.920> have<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.490> drink<00:03:25.760> get<00:03:26.120> their<00:03:26.300> drink<00:03:26.510> bottle

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
stop have a drink get their drink bottle

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.600 
stop have a drink get their drink bottle
sorted<00:03:27.110> out<00:03:27.260> have<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:27.800> drink<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.310> wait<00:03:28.489> for

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
sorted out have a drink and wait for

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.979 
sorted out have a drink and wait for
everyone<00:03:28.790> else<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.120> get<00:03:29.269> with<00:03:29.420> them<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:29.750> then

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
everyone else to get with them and then

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.080 
everyone else to get with them and then
cruise<00:03:30.290> off<00:03:30.560> with<00:03:30.830> the<00:03:30.920> pliat<00:03:31.160> on<00:03:31.340> again<00:03:31.610> so<00:03:32.000> it

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
cruise off with the pliat on again so it

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.640 
cruise off with the pliat on again so it
depends<00:03:32.420> very<00:03:32.450> much<00:03:32.870> depends<00:03:33.200> on<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.440> stage

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
depends very much depends on the stage

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.410 
depends very much depends on the stage
of<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:33.920> race<00:03:34.070> it<00:03:34.670> depends<00:03:35.000> on<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.180> confidence

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
of the race it depends on the confidence

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.930
