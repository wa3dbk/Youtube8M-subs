signal<00:02:28.760> issue<00:02:28.910> now<00:02:29.840> hopefully<00:02:30.260> they<00:02:31.099> will

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
signal issue now hopefully they will

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.660 
signal issue now hopefully they will
admit<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:31.730> there<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.630> problem<00:02:33.459> albeit<00:02:34.459> at

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
admit that there is a problem albeit at

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.540 
admit that there is a problem albeit at
software<00:02:35.480> level<00:02:35.660> I'm<00:02:36.110> hoping<00:02:36.560> they<00:02:37.280> come

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
software level I'm hoping they come

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.670 
software level I'm hoping they come
clean<00:02:37.849> and<00:02:38.030> say<00:02:38.269> yet<00:02:38.660> they<00:02:38.900> have<00:02:39.110> got<00:02:39.319> a<00:02:39.349> slight

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
clean and say yet they have got a slight

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.789 
clean and say yet they have got a slight
hardware<00:02:40.280> problem<00:02:40.640> as<00:02:40.760> well<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:42.110> think

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
hardware problem as well and I think

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.190 
hardware problem as well and I think
they<00:02:43.129> will<00:02:43.340> not<00:02:43.730> be<00:02:44.060> doing<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.360> recall<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:44.989> think

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
they will not be doing a recall I think

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.500 
they will not be doing a recall I think
I'd<00:02:45.290> be<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> big<00:02:45.739> mistake<00:02:45.950> for<00:02:46.459> them<00:02:46.670> what<00:02:47.269> they

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
I'd be a big mistake for them what they

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.050 
I'd be a big mistake for them what they
are<00:02:47.540> likely<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.200> do<00:02:48.470> is<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.400> offer<00:02:49.610> something

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
are likely to do is to offer something

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.050 
are likely to do is to offer something
like<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.750> free<00:02:51.140> bumper<00:02:51.349> case<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.040> maybe<00:02:52.700> a

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
like a free bumper case and maybe a

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.199 
like a free bumper case and maybe a
hundred<00:02:53.420> dollar<00:02:53.840> or<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.200> hundred<00:02:54.410> pound<00:02:55.209> credit

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
hundred dollar or a hundred pound credit

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.780 
hundred dollar or a hundred pound credit
against<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.900> purchase<00:02:57.319> price<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:57.799> maybe

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
against the purchase price and maybe

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.569 
against the purchase price and maybe
that<00:02:59.060> will<00:02:59.209> compensate<00:02:59.720> people<00:02:59.989> enough<00:03:00.769> for

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
that will compensate people enough for

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.620 
that will compensate people enough for
having<00:03:01.970> zafira<00:03:02.329> case<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.170> their<00:03:03.349> iphone<00:03:03.739> for<00:03:04.069> a

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
having zafira case to their iphone for a

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.449 
having zafira case to their iphone for a
duelist<00:03:05.630> also<00:03:06.049> think<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.349> maybe<00:03:06.650> in<00:03:07.069> about

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
duelist also think that maybe in about

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.059 
duelist also think that maybe in about
month<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.299> two<00:03:08.510> months<00:03:08.540> time<00:03:09.049> we<00:03:09.290> will<00:03:09.560> see<00:03:09.590> an

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
month to two months time we will see an

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.330 
month to two months time we will see an
revision<00:03:10.760> be<00:03:11.030> iphone<00:03:11.870> 4<00:03:12.230> with<00:03:12.769> a<00:03:12.799> slightly
