hello we are going to demonstrate how to
use<00:00:05.009> an<00:00:06.020> enjoy<00:00:07.069> serial<00:00:08.069> cable<00:00:08.750> to<00:00:09.750> set<00:00:10.080> up<00:00:10.349> the

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
use an enjoy serial cable to set up the

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.920 
use an enjoy serial cable to set up the
switch<00:00:13.190> the<00:00:14.190> telephone<00:00:14.610> switch<00:00:17.930> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
switch the telephone switch the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.160 
switch the telephone switch the
left-hand<00:00:19.380> side<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.920> one<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.170> rj45

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
left-hand side that one is the rj45

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.279 
left-hand side that one is the rj45
cable<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:24.269> right-hand<00:00:24.660> side<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.109> one

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
cable and the right-hand side that one

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.419 
cable and the right-hand side that one
will<00:00:25.590> be<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.060> silk<00:00:27.060> enter<00:00:27.630> serial<00:00:28.050> cable<00:00:28.429> now

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
will be the silk enter serial cable now

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.600 
will be the silk enter serial cable now
we<00:00:29.490> are<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.000> connect<00:00:30.390> both<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.929> them<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
we are going to connect both of them and

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.220 
we are going to connect both of them and
then<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:32.880> will<00:00:33.329> call<00:00:33.719> them<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
then now we will call them with the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.940 
then now we will call them with the
switch<00:00:40.100> on<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.160> switch

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
switch on the switch

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.049 
switch on the switch
and<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:46.140> serial<00:00:46.920> cable<00:00:47.340> will<00:00:47.550> connect

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and then the serial cable will connect

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.729 
and then the serial cable will connect
with<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:49.640> angel<00:00:53.059> now<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
with the angel now you can see that the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.760 
with the angel now you can see that the
apk<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.430> put<00:00:57.360> up<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:59.510> choose<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.840> to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
apk is put up and so we can choose it to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.800 
apk is put up and so we can choose it to
go<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> our<00:01:02.989> software<00:01:04.850> now<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:05.909> go<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
go to our software now we go to the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.679 
go to our software now we go to the
software<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:09.000> go<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
software and then we can go to the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.219 
software and then we can go to the
setting<00:01:12.260> because<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:14.299> switch<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.689> Poway

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
setting because the switch the Poway

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.800 
setting because the switch the Poway
will<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.650> 1<00:01:17.070> 1<00:01:17.340> 5<00:01:17.909> 2<00:01:18.170> 0<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:21.000> will<00:01:21.030> now<00:01:21.509> go<00:01:21.780> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
will be 1 1 5 2 0 so we will now go to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.080 
will be 1 1 5 2 0 so we will now go to
set<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:24.020> yes<00:01:25.020> 1<00:01:25.380> 1<00:01:25.650> 5<00:01:26.009> 2<00:01:27.110> 0<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.829> now<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.729> Poway

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
set it yes 1 1 5 2 0 and now the Poway

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.819 
set it yes 1 1 5 2 0 and now the Poway
is<00:01:30.270> set<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.470> now<00:01:31.650> we<00:01:31.710> will<00:01:32.009> keep<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.579> sea<00:01:33.030> out

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
is set and now we will keep the sea out

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:41.749 
is set and now we will keep the sea out
LF<00:01:37.939> this<00:01:38.939> will<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.689> light<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.439> enter<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
LF this will be light the enter in the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.969 
LF this will be light the enter in the
PC<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:43.229> then<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.189> will<00:01:44.430> compare<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:45.060> name

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
PC and then I will compare to one name

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.219 
PC and then I will compare to one name
we<00:01:46.979> will<00:01:47.189> send<00:01:47.909> some<00:01:48.149> command<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> switch

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
we will send some command to the switch

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.600 
we will send some command to the switch
and<00:01:50.149> to<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> setup<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:53.390> after<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:54.540> set

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
and to the setup and after we set

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.539 
and to the setup and after we set
Santa's<00:01:56.610> wires<00:01:57.560> then<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.710> will<00:01:58.829> ask<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
Santa's wires then it will ask for the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.100 
Santa's wires then it will ask for the
password<00:02:00.560> for<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.710> switch<00:02:02.509> and<00:02:03.509> then<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:03.810> can

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
password for this switch and then we can

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.910 
password for this switch and then we can
continue<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:05.009> setup<00:02:06.380> that's<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.619> end<00:02:07.799> of

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
continue this setup that's the end of

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.240 
continue this setup that's the end of
our

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250
