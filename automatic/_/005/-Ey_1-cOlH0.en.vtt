00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
tract builders nowadays seem to be

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.730 
tract builders nowadays seem to be
trying<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.819> come<00:00:06.029> up<00:00:06.150> with<00:00:06.270> obstacles<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:07.410> test

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
trying to come up with obstacles to test

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.530 
trying to come up with obstacles to test
the<00:00:07.950> riders<00:00:08.370> more<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.760> more<00:00:08.940> all<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.269> time

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
the riders more and more all the time

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.780 
the riders more and more all the time
now<00:00:10.110> today<00:00:10.469> we're<00:00:10.830> at<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> supercross<00:00:11.550> track

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
now today we're at a supercross track

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.120 
now today we're at a supercross track
and<00:00:12.389> we're<00:00:12.480> going<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.809> be<00:00:12.929> discussing<00:00:13.410> rhythm

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
and we're going to be discussing rhythm

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.220 
and we're going to be discussing rhythm
sections<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.089> more<00:00:15.269> importantly<00:00:15.780> three

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
sections and more importantly three

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.960 
sections and more importantly three
different<00:00:16.650> ways<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.310> can<00:00:17.460> tackle<00:00:17.730> this

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
different ways that you can tackle this

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.029 
different ways that you can tackle this
part<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.390> supercross<00:00:18.869> track<00:00:19.020> then<00:00:19.800> once<00:00:19.949> you

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
part of a supercross track then once you

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.710 
part of a supercross track then once you
get<00:00:20.160> yourself<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> reasonable<00:00:21.270> level<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.689> a

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
get yourself to a reasonable level on a

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.840 
get yourself to a reasonable level on a
supercross<00:00:22.289> track<00:00:22.500> you'll<00:00:23.070> find<00:00:23.369> pretty<00:00:23.580> much

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
supercross track you'll find pretty much

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.730 
supercross track you'll find pretty much
everyone's<00:00:24.359> doing<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.869> triple<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.439> time

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
everyone's doing the triple this time

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.830 
everyone's doing the triple this time
doing<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> corners<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> same<00:00:27.000> even<00:00:27.630> doing

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
doing the corners the same even doing

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.689 
doing the corners the same even doing
the<00:00:27.930> massive<00:00:28.289> set<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.529> whoops<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.010> same<00:00:29.250> it's

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the massive set of whoops the same it's

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.730 
the massive set of whoops the same it's
actually<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> rhythm<00:00:30.660> section<00:00:30.929> where<00:00:31.650> you

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
actually in the rhythm section where you

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.560 
actually in the rhythm section where you
start<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.160> get<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.340> few<00:00:32.550> variations<00:00:33.000> and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
start to get a few variations and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.180 
start to get a few variations and
there's<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.780> lot<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.079> time<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.649> made<00:00:34.860> up<00:00:35.040> in

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
there's a lot of time to be made up in

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.770 
there's a lot of time to be made up in
this<00:00:35.309> part<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.730> track<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:36.630> we're

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
this part of the track so what we're

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.020 
this part of the track so what we're
going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.320> discussing<00:00:37.920> today<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.760> that

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
going to be discussing today is that

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.940 
going to be discussing today is that
three<00:00:39.329> different<00:00:39.809> ways<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.770> it

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
three different ways that you can do it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.190 
three different ways that you can do it
some<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> little<00:00:41.790> bit<00:00:41.910> faster<00:00:42.390> than<00:00:42.540> others<00:00:42.870> but

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
some a little bit faster than others but

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.799 
some a little bit faster than others but
all<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.559> them<00:00:43.710> extremely<00:00:44.309> technical<00:00:44.760> now<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
all of them extremely technical now a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.990 
all of them extremely technical now a
rhythm<00:00:46.230> section<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.890> mean<00:00:47.070> almost<00:00:47.460> anything

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
rhythm section can mean almost anything

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.360 
rhythm section can mean almost anything
on<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.180> supercross<00:00:48.750> track<00:00:48.989> from<00:00:49.440> six<00:00:49.950> single

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
on a supercross track from six single

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.760 
on a supercross track from six single
jumps<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> double<00:00:51.840> triple<00:00:52.079> whatever

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
jumps to a double triple whatever

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.040 
jumps to a double triple whatever
there's<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.309> many<00:00:53.430> different<00:00:53.910> variation<00:00:54.570> but

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
there's so many different variation but

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.660 
there's so many different variation but
for<00:00:55.260> us<00:00:55.350> today<00:00:55.620> what<00:00:56.100> we're<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.520> be

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
for us today what we're going to be

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.180 
for us today what we're going to be
working<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.690> triple<00:00:58.289> step<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.039> we

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
working on is a triple step up so we

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.939 
working on is a triple step up so we
start<00:00:59.550> with<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:00.059> small<00:01:00.629> jump<00:01:00.989> then<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.739> move<00:01:01.920> to

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
start with a small jump then we move to

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.889 
start with a small jump then we move to
a<00:01:02.190> bigger<00:01:02.550> jump<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.180> then<00:01:03.270> finish<00:01:03.690> off<00:01:03.840> with

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
a bigger jump and then finish off with

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.980 
a bigger jump and then finish off with
another<00:01:04.439> third<00:01:05.040> small<00:01:05.610> jump<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.330> lot<00:01:06.840> of

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
another third small jump a lot of

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.870 
another third small jump a lot of
different<00:01:07.290> ways<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.830> tackle<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
different ways you can tackle this the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.640 
different ways you can tackle this the
three<00:01:09.240> ways<00:01:09.540> we're<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.409> dealing

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
three ways we're going to be dealing

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.520 
three ways we're going to be dealing
with<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.100> first<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> most<00:01:12.210> obvious<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.049> to

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
with it first and the most obvious is to

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.010 
with it first and the most obvious is to
roll<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.799> first<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.820> double<00:01:15.299> out<00:01:15.450> over

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
roll the first one and double out over

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.789 
roll the first one and double out over
the<00:01:16.140> big<00:01:16.350> one

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the big one

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.370 
the big one
the<00:01:17.189> second<00:01:17.700> way<00:01:17.850> reasonably<00:01:18.840> tricky<00:01:19.170> is

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the second way reasonably tricky is

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.890 
the second way reasonably tricky is
what's<00:01:19.619> called<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.070> wheel<00:01:20.340> tap<00:01:20.700> where<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.509> jump

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
what's called a wheel tap where we jump

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.260 
what's called a wheel tap where we jump
off<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.259> first<00:01:22.530> jump<00:01:22.950> back<00:01:23.640> wheel<00:01:23.939> touches

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
off the first jump back wheel touches

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.570 
off the first jump back wheel touches
the<00:01:24.659> second<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.500> pops<00:01:25.740> us<00:01:25.920> over<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.430> down

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
the second one and pops us over and down

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.910 
the second one and pops us over and down
the<00:01:26.850> third<00:01:27.170> reasonably<00:01:28.170> tricky<00:01:28.530> that's<00:01:28.710> for

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the third reasonably tricky that's for

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.609 
the third reasonably tricky that's for
sure<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.670> third<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.420> fastest<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.380> to

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
sure and the third and the fastest is to

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.859 
sure and the third and the fastest is to
leap<00:01:31.829> from<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> first<00:01:32.520> small<00:01:32.909> one<00:01:33.180> all<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
leap from the first small one all the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.440 
leap from the first small one all the
way<00:01:34.020> over<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:35.040> missing<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> second<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.210> and

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
way over just missing the second one and

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.350 
way over just missing the second one and
landing<00:01:37.170> down<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.619> third<00:01:37.829> one<00:01:38.130> fastest<00:01:39.090> but

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
landing down the third one fastest but

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.289 
landing down the third one fastest but
also<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> biggest<00:01:40.140> risk<00:01:40.500> yes<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.610> Ames<00:01:42.000> it

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
also the biggest risk yes it is Ames it

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.450 
also the biggest risk yes it is Ames it
is<00:01:42.479> slightly<00:01:42.780> more<00:01:43.049> advanced<00:01:43.409> riders<00:01:44.009> but

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
is slightly more advanced riders but

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.399 
is slightly more advanced riders but
really<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.970> only<00:01:45.030> need<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:45.840> your<00:01:45.990> basic

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
really you only need to have your basic

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.990 
really you only need to have your basic
jumping<00:01:46.860> under<00:01:47.070> your<00:01:47.189> belt<00:01:47.399> before<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.820> can

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
jumping under your belt before you can

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.120 
jumping under your belt before you can
start<00:01:48.299> giving<00:01:48.509> us<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.899> little<00:01:49.020> bit<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.350> go<00:01:49.530> now

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
start giving us a little bit of a go now

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.429 
start giving us a little bit of a go now
we<00:01:50.280> are<00:01:50.430> lucky<00:01:50.759> enough<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.270> factory<00:01:52.020> CDI

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
we are lucky enough to have factory CDI

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
taking us through one at a time what

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
taking us through one at a time what
it's<00:01:58.649> supposed<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.009> look<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.280> now<00:02:00.060> once

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
it's supposed to look like now once

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.940 
it's supposed to look like now once
again<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.810> don't<00:02:00.990> need<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.380> be<00:02:01.530> as<00:02:01.680> good<00:02:01.829> as

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
again you don't need to be as good as

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.010 
again you don't need to be as good as
Shane<00:02:02.159> Boyd<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.579> do<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.540> do

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
Shane Boyd to do this but you do

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.870 
Shane Boyd to do this but you do
really<00:02:04.229> need<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.680> your<00:02:04.920> basic<00:02:05.460> jumping

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
really need to have your basic jumping

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.399 
really need to have your basic jumping
under<00:02:06.000> your<00:02:06.240> belt<00:02:06.479> just<00:02:06.990> as<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> safety

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
under your belt just as a safety

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.770 
under your belt just as a safety
precaution<00:02:07.729> now<00:02:08.729> obviously<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.390> we<00:02:09.509> had<00:02:09.660> have

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
precaution now obviously if we had have

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.210 
precaution now obviously if we had have
done<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.140> from<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.349> start<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.979> would<00:02:11.129> have

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
done this from the start we would have

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.280 
done this from the start we would have
first<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.670> all<00:02:11.819> walked<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.390> through<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.959> then

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
first of all walked it through and then

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.710 
first of all walked it through and then
second<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.860> all<00:02:14.069> rolled<00:02:14.730> through<00:02:15.209> all<00:02:15.390> three

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
second of all rolled through all three

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
jumps on the bike just to make sure

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.150 
jumps on the bike just to make sure
everything's<00:02:17.700> okay<00:02:18.150> pick<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.110> nice<00:02:19.290> lines<00:02:19.860> on

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
everything's okay pick the nice lines on

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.920 
everything's okay pick the nice lines on
the<00:02:20.280> jump<00:02:20.549> make<00:02:20.730> sure<00:02:20.910> there's<00:02:21.150> no<00:02:21.330> rocks<00:02:21.660> or

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the jump make sure there's no rocks or

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.050 
the jump make sure there's no rocks or
ruts<00:02:22.230> all<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.890> safety<00:02:23.160> factors<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.879> need<00:02:23.940> to

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
ruts all the safety factors that need to

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.869 
ruts all the safety factors that need to
be<00:02:24.150> brought<00:02:24.420> into<00:02:24.599> consideration<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:26.580> first

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
be brought into consideration the first

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.240 
be brought into consideration the first
stage<00:02:27.269> in<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.660> three-step<00:02:28.260> process<00:02:28.560> is

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
stage in the three-step process is

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.490 
stage in the three-step process is
basically<00:02:29.879> what's<00:02:30.209> called<00:02:30.510> single<00:02:31.049> double

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
basically what's called single double

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.020 
basically what's called single double
now<00:02:31.830> what<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.010> means<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.610> we're<00:02:32.760> going<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:32.910> be

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
now what that means is we're going to be

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.059 
now what that means is we're going to be
rolling<00:02:33.540> over<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.900> first<00:02:34.170> one<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.769> then

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
rolling over the first one and then

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.550 
rolling over the first one and then
doubling<00:02:35.700> out<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.750> slowest<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.410> all

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
doubling out it's the slowest of all

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.979 
doubling out it's the slowest of all
three<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.640> safest<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.720> main

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
three and it's the safest but the main

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.420 
three and it's the safest but the main
thing<00:02:40.319> here<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.680> main<00:02:40.980> thing<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.220> need<00:02:41.400> to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
thing here the main thing you need to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.610 
thing here the main thing you need to
make<00:02:41.610> sure<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.180> don't<00:02:42.360> do<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:43.019> approach<00:02:43.560> the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
make sure you don't do is approach the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.640 
make sure you don't do is approach the
first<00:02:44.160> jump<00:02:44.670> too<00:02:45.000> fast<00:02:45.390> you'll<00:02:46.019> land<00:02:46.290> at<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
first jump too fast you'll land at the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.500 
first jump too fast you'll land at the
base<00:02:46.829> of<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.130> second<00:02:47.549> one<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.299> can

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
base of the second one and this can

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.150 
base of the second one and this can
cause<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.900> suspension<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.530> bottom<00:02:49.860> out<00:02:50.010> and

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
cause the suspension to bottom out and

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.920 
cause the suspension to bottom out and
spit<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.459> over<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.760> handlebars<00:02:51.239> now<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
spit you over the handlebars now the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.509 
spit you over the handlebars now the
next<00:02:52.290> thing<00:02:52.410> we<00:02:52.560> need<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.739> do<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.340> need<00:02:53.459> to

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
next thing we need to do you need to

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.400 
next thing we need to do you need to
make<00:02:53.910> sure<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.780> give<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.079> little<00:02:55.260> bit

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
make sure that you give it a little bit

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.650 
make sure that you give it a little bit
of<00:02:55.530> gas<00:02:55.769> up<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.430> over<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.880> second<00:02:57.390> jump

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
of gas up and over the second jump

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.080 
of gas up and over the second jump
remember<00:02:58.380> we're<00:02:58.560> trying<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:59.160> single<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.910> then

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
remember we're trying to single and then

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.869 
remember we're trying to single and then
double<00:03:00.630> out<00:03:00.840> we<00:03:01.440> need<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.890> get<00:03:02.040> enough<00:03:02.370> lift

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
double out we need to get enough lift

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.809 
double out we need to get enough lift
enough<00:03:03.360> flight<00:03:03.840> off<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.769> second<00:03:05.310> jump<00:03:05.579> so

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
enough flight off that second jump so

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.610 
enough flight off that second jump so
that<00:03:06.000> we<00:03:06.090> land<00:03:06.390> down<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.870> backside<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.349> the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
that we land down the backside of the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.530 
that we land down the backside of the
third<00:03:07.890> jump<00:03:08.250> if<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.730> don't<00:03:09.120> give<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.299> any<00:03:09.389> gas

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
third jump if you don't give it any gas

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.270 
third jump if you don't give it any gas
on<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.109> top<00:03:10.319> of<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.500> second<00:03:10.920> jump

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
on the top of the second jump

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.759 
on the top of the second jump
it'll<00:03:11.819> dip<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.209> front<00:03:12.480> end<00:03:12.690> down<00:03:12.780> straight

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
it'll dip the front end down straight

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.770 
it'll dip the front end down straight
into<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:14.220> third<00:03:14.459> jump<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.090> you'll<00:03:15.239> step<00:03:15.510> over

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
into the third jump and you'll step over

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.390 
into the third jump and you'll step over
the<00:03:15.870> handlebars<00:03:16.380> now<00:03:16.829> once<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.190> can

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
the handlebars now once you can

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.789 
the handlebars now once you can
consistently<00:03:18.299> do<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.780> four<00:03:19.109> or<00:03:19.139> five<00:03:19.440> times

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
consistently do this four or five times

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.830 
consistently do this four or five times
in<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.100> row<00:03:20.130> we<00:03:20.489> give<00:03:20.639> time<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:20.940> spot<00:03:21.450> on<00:03:21.600> and

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
in a row we give time and spot on and

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.809 
in a row we give time and spot on and
landing<00:03:22.560> beautiful<00:03:23.069> down<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.340> backside<00:03:23.760> of

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
landing beautiful down the backside of

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.879 
landing beautiful down the backside of
that<00:03:24.000> third<00:03:24.359> jump<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:25.230> know<00:03:25.350> it's<00:03:25.530> time<00:03:25.769> to

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
that third jump you know it's time to

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.680 
that third jump you know it's time to
step<00:03:26.160> step<00:03:26.489> up<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.970> next<00:03:27.209> level<00:03:27.569> which<00:03:27.660> is

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
step step up to the next level which is

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.720 
step step up to the next level which is
definitely<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.260> little<00:03:28.380> bit<00:03:28.590> trickier<00:03:29.010> now<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
definitely a little bit trickier now the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.400 
definitely a little bit trickier now the
second<00:03:30.150> part<00:03:30.329> of<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.510> process<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.170> what<00:03:31.290> we

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
second part of this process is what we

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.289 
second part of this process is what we
call<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.829> wheel<00:03:32.160> tap<00:03:32.519> now<00:03:32.700> it's<00:03:32.849> something<00:03:33.180> that

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
call a wheel tap now it's something that

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.479 
call a wheel tap now it's something that
we<00:03:33.389> do<00:03:33.569> in<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.049> whoop<00:03:34.260> section<00:03:34.489> occasionally

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
we do in the whoop section occasionally

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.610 
we do in the whoop section occasionally
we<00:03:35.880> do<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.150> on<00:03:36.269> rhythm<00:03:36.599> sections<00:03:37.139> and<00:03:37.440> it's

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
we do it on rhythm sections and it's

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.750 
we do it on rhythm sections and it's
what<00:03:37.769> we're<00:03:37.889> going<00:03:38.069> to<00:03:38.130> be<00:03:38.250> doing<00:03:38.430> here<00:03:38.730> today

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
what we're going to be doing here today

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.539 
what we're going to be doing here today
what<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.569> involves<00:03:40.230> is<00:03:40.380> instead<00:03:41.130> of<00:03:41.250> rolling

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
what it involves is instead of rolling

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.000 
what it involves is instead of rolling
over<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.060> first<00:03:42.420> one<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:42.959> jumping<00:03:43.500> too<00:03:43.769> out

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
over the first one and jumping too out

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.550 
over the first one and jumping too out
we<00:03:44.609> actually<00:03:45.060> try<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.329> jump<00:03:45.780> off<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.290> first

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
we actually try to jump off the first

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.400 
we actually try to jump off the first
one<00:03:46.919> and<00:03:47.130> we<00:03:47.190> only<00:03:47.849> allow<00:03:48.120> our<00:03:48.540> back<00:03:48.900> wheel<00:03:49.200> to

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
one and we only allow our back wheel to

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.280 
one and we only allow our back wheel to
hit<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.680> top<00:03:49.889> of<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.280> second<00:03:50.910> jump<00:03:51.290> making

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
hit the top of the second jump making

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.080 
hit the top of the second jump making
sure<00:03:52.470> as<00:03:52.680> our<00:03:52.889> back<00:03:53.099> wheel<00:03:53.310> hits<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.700> second

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
sure as our back wheel hits the second

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.030 
sure as our back wheel hits the second
jump<00:03:54.299> we<00:03:54.780> give<00:03:54.959> it<00:03:55.079> a<00:03:55.109> bit<00:03:55.260> of<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.470> gas<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:56.010> a

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
jump we give it a bit of a gas and a

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.190 
jump we give it a bit of a gas and a
slip<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.400> clutch<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.269> pops<00:03:57.569> us<00:03:57.780> up<00:03:57.989> and

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
slip of the clutch and it pops us up and

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.379 
slip of the clutch and it pops us up and
over<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.739> down<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.400> back<00:03:59.579> side<00:03:59.849> of<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.150> third

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
over and down the back side of the third

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.270 
over and down the back side of the third
one<00:04:00.690> now<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.260> tricky<00:04:01.680> thing<00:04:01.889> here<00:04:02.160> is<00:04:02.250> that

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
one now the tricky thing here is that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.819 
one now the tricky thing here is that
our<00:04:02.459> front<00:04:02.849> wheel<00:04:03.180> doesn't<00:04:03.840> hit<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.380> second

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
our front wheel doesn't hit the second

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.740 
our front wheel doesn't hit the second
jump<00:04:05.069> if<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.519> don't<00:04:05.669> know<00:04:06.060> what<00:04:06.269> you're<00:04:06.450> doing

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
jump if you don't know what you're doing

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.509 
jump if you don't know what you're doing
and<00:04:06.930> you<00:04:07.079> don't<00:04:07.260> lock<00:04:07.560> your<00:04:07.829> front<00:04:08.010> wheel<00:04:08.220> high

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
and you don't lock your front wheel high

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.789 
and you don't lock your front wheel high
enough<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.389> drops<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.109> front<00:04:10.440> wheel<00:04:10.650> down

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
enough it drops the front wheel down

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.280 
enough it drops the front wheel down
really<00:04:11.190> really<00:04:11.310> quick<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.000> once<00:04:12.540> again<00:04:12.750> seems

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
really really quick and once again seems

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.140 
really really quick and once again seems
to<00:04:13.380> be<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.680> way<00:04:13.829> here<00:04:14.100> you<00:04:14.280> can<00:04:14.519> step<00:04:14.759> over<00:04:14.910> the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
to be the way here you can step over the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.199 
to be the way here you can step over the
bars<00:04:15.359> very<00:04:15.630> easily

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
bars very easily

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.569 
bars very easily
now<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.870> benefit<00:04:17.320> of<00:04:17.410> doing<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:17.799> this<00:04:17.949> way<00:04:18.009> is

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
now the benefit of doing it this way is

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.449 
now the benefit of doing it this way is
it's<00:04:18.820> a<00:04:18.970> lot<00:04:19.180> faster<00:04:19.539> than<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.769> original<00:04:21.310> way

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
it's a lot faster than the original way

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.550 
it's a lot faster than the original way
step<00:04:21.910> number<00:04:22.090> one<00:04:22.479> of<00:04:22.690> rolling<00:04:23.199> and<00:04:23.410> then

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
step number one of rolling and then

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.159 
step number one of rolling and then
doubling<00:04:24.070> out<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.460> save<00:04:24.789> a<00:04:24.820> lot<00:04:25.090> of<00:04:25.270> time<00:04:25.539> but

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
doubling out you save a lot of time but

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.620 
doubling out you save a lot of time but
it<00:04:26.320> really<00:04:26.560> is<00:04:26.919> an<00:04:27.190> in-between<00:04:27.910> step<00:04:28.300> to

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
it really is an in-between step to

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.689 
it really is an in-between step to
jumping<00:04:29.110> all<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.410> way<00:04:29.620> over<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.190> top<00:04:30.430> if

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
jumping all the way over the top if

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.850 
jumping all the way over the top if
possible<00:04:31.330> now<00:04:31.720> there<00:04:31.900> will<00:04:32.020> be<00:04:32.080> obstacles<00:04:32.560> on

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
possible now there will be obstacles on

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.189 
possible now there will be obstacles on
a<00:04:32.889> track<00:04:33.190> where<00:04:33.600> occasionally<00:04:34.600> you<00:04:34.750> won't<00:04:35.050> be

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
a track where occasionally you won't be

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.200 
a track where occasionally you won't be
able<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.440> get<00:04:35.620> enough<00:04:35.889> lift<00:04:36.220> off<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:36.880> first

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
able to get enough lift off that first

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.480 
able to get enough lift off that first
one<00:04:37.509> all<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.199> way<00:04:38.350> up<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:38.740> over<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.220> top<00:04:39.430> of

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
one all the way up and over the top of

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.790 
one all the way up and over the top of
the<00:04:39.699> second<00:04:40.150> one<00:04:40.300> and<00:04:40.570> this<00:04:40.990> is<00:04:41.199> a<00:04:41.229> perfect

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
the second one and this is a perfect

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.680 
the second one and this is a perfect
example<00:04:41.919> of<00:04:42.400> where<00:04:42.580> it's<00:04:42.699> good<00:04:42.910> to<00:04:43.060> wheel<00:04:43.330> tap

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690

example of where it's good to wheel tap
let<00:04:44.229> that<00:04:44.410> back<00:04:44.680> we'll<00:04:44.919> hit<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.310> second<00:04:45.759> one

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
let that back we'll hit the second one

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.999 
let that back we'll hit the second one
and<00:04:46.180> bounce<00:04:46.690> you<00:04:46.870> up<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.199> over<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:47.590> down<00:04:47.680> with

tucking and stage three leaping over the
whole<00:06:20.800> lot<00:06:21.099> is<00:06:21.520> your<00:06:21.820> entry<00:06:22.180> speed

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
whole lot is your entry speed

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.260 
whole lot is your entry speed
speed<00:06:23.470> that<00:06:23.620> you<00:06:23.740> need<00:06:23.770> to<00:06:24.550> get<00:06:24.760> all<00:06:24.970> the<00:06:25.150> way

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
speed that you need to get all the way

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.300 
speed that you need to get all the way
over<00:06:25.720> the<00:06:25.840> second<00:06:26.260> one<00:06:26.320> without<00:06:26.710> even<00:06:27.070> wheel

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.120 
over the second one without even wheel
tapping<00:06:27.850> is<00:06:28.210> a<00:06:28.300> lot<00:06:28.750> higher<00:06:29.080> so<00:06:29.770> you<00:06:29.830> need<00:06:30.010> to

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
tapping is a lot higher so you need to

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.220 
tapping is a lot higher so you need to
try<00:06:30.280> to<00:06:30.340> bring<00:06:30.610> that<00:06:30.730> into<00:06:30.940> consideration<00:06:31.230> now

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
try to bring that into consideration now

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.570 
try to bring that into consideration now
when<00:06:32.410> you've<00:06:32.530> got<00:06:32.740> your<00:06:32.860> friend<00:06:33.130> off<00:06:33.310> to<00:06:33.460> the

when you've got your friend off to the

when you've got your friend off to the
side<00:06:33.820> making<00:06:34.120> sure<00:06:34.300> you've<00:06:34.600> got<00:06:34.810> enough

side making sure you've got enough

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.650

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660 
clearance to get over the second one you

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.290 
clearance to get over the second one you
also<00:06:37.930> need<00:06:38.440> to<00:06:38.620> consider<00:06:38.830> are<00:06:39.610> your<00:06:39.820> jumping

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
also need to consider are your jumping

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.720 
also need to consider are your jumping
far<00:06:40.720> enough<00:06:41.020> to<00:06:41.260> get<00:06:41.410> all<00:06:41.740> the<00:06:41.920> way<00:06:42.070> down<00:06:42.430> the

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730 
far enough to get all the way down the

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.760 
far enough to get all the way down the
third<00:06:42.970> jump<00:06:43.390> it's<00:06:43.840> one<00:06:44.110> thing<00:06:44.380> to<00:06:44.560> get<00:06:44.710> over

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
third jump it's one thing to get over

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.980 
third jump it's one thing to get over
the<00:06:45.190> second<00:06:45.610> one<00:06:45.730> that's<00:06:46.000> great<00:06:46.300> but<00:06:46.750> if<00:06:46.870> you

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
the second one that's great but if you

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.710 
the second one that's great but if you
land<00:06:47.290> nose<00:06:47.740> first<00:06:48.010> into<00:06:48.340> the<00:06:48.640> third<00:06:48.880> jump<00:06:49.270> it's

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
land nose first into the third jump it's

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.330 
land nose first into the third jump it's
not<00:06:49.990> going<00:06:50.140> to<00:06:50.200> feel<00:06:50.380> too<00:06:50.590> good<00:06:50.770> either

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
not going to feel too good either

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.860 
not going to feel too good either
so<00:06:51.580> you<00:06:51.640> really<00:06:51.910> do<00:06:52.120> need<00:06:52.270> to<00:06:52.420> make<00:06:52.570> sure<00:06:52.630> that

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
so you really do need to make sure that

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.620 
so you really do need to make sure that
your<00:06:53.140> approach<00:06:53.590> speed<00:06:54.040> is<00:06:54.490> fast<00:06:54.940> enough<00:06:55.300> in<00:06:55.510> a

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.630 
your approach speed is fast enough in a

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.200 
your approach speed is fast enough in a
case<00:06:55.930> like<00:06:56.170> this<00:06:56.230> now<00:06:56.920> the<00:06:56.980> main<00:06:57.370> benefits

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210 
case like this now the main benefits

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.330 
case like this now the main benefits
here<00:06:58.450> is<00:06:58.870> pretty<00:06:59.200> much<00:06:59.440> everything<00:06:59.920> it's

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
here is pretty much everything it's

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.880 
here is pretty much everything it's
smoother<00:07:00.940> it's<00:07:01.420> faster<00:07:02.140> and<00:07:02.290> it's<00:07:02.620> less

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:02.890 
smoother it's faster and it's less

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.860 
smoother it's faster and it's less
energy<00:07:03.370> if<00:07:03.520> you<00:07:03.670> can<00:07:03.850> somehow<00:07:04.120> avoid<00:07:04.630> having

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:04.870 
energy if you can somehow avoid having

to get enough clearance and enough
distance<00:07:37.210> it's<00:07:37.690> a<00:07:37.810> much<00:07:38.020> better<00:07:38.260> way<00:07:38.560> of<00:07:38.620> doing
