00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
gtx 780m driving on driving we started a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.390 
gtx 780m driving on driving we started a
bike<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:26.329> then<00:00:26.419> continue<00:00:26.960> with<00:00:27.260> the<00:00:27.439> car<00:00:27.650> so

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
bike and then continue with the car so

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.790 
bike and then continue with the car so
let's<00:00:28.789> have<00:00:28.910> a<00:00:28.970> look

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.340 

so<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:34.010> game<00:00:34.280> is<00:00:34.310> set<00:00:34.760> to<00:00:34.910> ultra<00:00:35.360> settings

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
so the game is set to ultra settings

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.030 
so the game is set to ultra settings
20-pound<00:00:37.219> anything

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
20-pound anything

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:48.020 
20-pound anything
ultra<00:00:38.880> reset<00:00:42.200> much<00:00:43.200> more<00:00:43.500> look<00:00:45.500> full<00:00:46.500> HD<00:00:47.030> ultra

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
ultra reset much more look full HD ultra

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.120 
ultra reset much more look full HD ultra
textures<00:00:49.490> let<00:00:50.490> me<00:00:50.610> say<00:00:50.790> two<00:00:51.300> times<00:00:52.250> ultra<00:00:53.250> to

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
textures let me say two times ultra to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:03.130 
textures let me say two times ultra to
preset<00:00:56.130> let's<00:00:57.090> try

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.719 

so<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:03.860> drop<00:01:04.190> in<00:01:04.400> frames<00:01:04.790> is<00:01:05.120> around<00:01:05.390> 5<00:01:06.729> 10

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
so the drop in frames is around 5 10

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.310 
so the drop in frames is around 5 10
frames<00:01:08.300> events<00:01:09.200> on<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.470> scene<00:01:09.740> just<00:01:11.320> because

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
frames events on the scene just because

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.410 
frames events on the scene just because
we<00:01:12.470> are<00:01:12.560> recording<00:01:12.860> guys<00:01:13.250> at<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.820> video<00:01:14.240> has

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
we are recording guys at the video has

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.380 
we are recording guys at the video has
five<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:15.140> 10<00:01:15.380> frames<00:01:15.770> lover<00:01:16.250> if<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:17.090> can't

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
five to 10 frames lover if you can't

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.960 
five to 10 frames lover if you can't
every<00:01:17.869> time<00:01:18.050> 5<00:01:18.350> 10<00:01:18.680> frames<00:01:19.040> you<00:01:19.520> see<00:01:19.700> a<00:01:19.729> number

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
every time 5 10 frames you see a number

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.790 
every time 5 10 frames you see a number
that's<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.810> actual<00:01:21.320> result

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.789 

it's<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.460> quality<00:01:25.670> check

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
it's a quality check

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.410 
it's a quality check
me<00:01:28.799> release<00:01:29.130> recorded

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.360 

I<00:01:32.479> think<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.290> game<00:01:33.500> is<00:01:33.530> really<00:01:34.070> reading

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
I think the game is really reading

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.649 
I think the game is really reading
and<00:01:35.730> if<00:01:35.850> Charlie<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.240> pretty<00:01:36.480> easy

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
and if Charlie is pretty easy

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.340 
and if Charlie is pretty easy
when<00:01:39.530> I<00:01:39.619> do<00:01:39.679> sometimes<00:01:40.130> in<00:01:40.429> his<00:01:40.549> face

when I do sometimes in his face

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.810 
when I do sometimes in his face
