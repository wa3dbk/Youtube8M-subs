00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.730
 rio de janeiro that happened in rio de janeiro 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.190
 January because it is not raining because 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.860
 the subtropical high of the Atlantic is 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.560
 very strong working near the river of 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.300
 January leaves the Rio de Janeiro with less 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.240
 humidity than normal for that time 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.939
 of the year so less humidity - clouds 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.890
 the less possibility of rain it causes 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.519
 blocking the passage of cold fronts 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.880
 and to the polar air you have reduce 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.070
 cloudiness and many hours of sunshine and there 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.410
 that strong sun for many hours to 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.530
 temperature becomes too high 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.570
 There's a cloud missing to temper. 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.239
 to bar a little sun is missing 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.410
 to spread the rain a bit 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.320
 air heating is this and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.469
 high pressure is still very strong 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.690
 this Tuesday and will continue 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.789
 intense but from Wednesday 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.519
 starting to lose a little strength 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.740
 so we'll talk here look during 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.439
 Thursday is where this theme is going 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.650
 really start to lose strength then 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.970
 I still have subtropical 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.689
 south atlantic 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.140
 very strong on Tuesday - strong in the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.790
 Wednesday and there - strong still weakening 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.950
 further on Thursday 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.159
 this is a process that we are going to 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.670
 keep a close eye on why the 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.759
 weakening of the subtropical 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.860
 South Atlantic will then allow the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.380
 entry of a cold front into the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.049
 January will allow the entry of a 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.640
 cold front will move over the super 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.220
 coast of SÃ£o Paulo to reach a 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.610
 Rio de Janeiro, that's what it's all about. 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.280
 waiting does have rain at the end of the tunnel 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.159
 to Rio de Janeiro and this rain should 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.200
 actually start during Thursday 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.689
 this Tuesday and on Wednesday the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.860
 chance of rain in the river is still very 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.049
 low now let's look at the projection 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.360
 of these areas of instability in the river is 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.270
 for the next few days because then we 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.820
 We are going to spend several days with 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.860
 so much instability in the river then the hour 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.690
 that break this lock 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.210
 the rain will start to happen with 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.230
 enough frequency and there is a rain that 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.140
 come strong 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.260
 Then you will break the lock on the 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.180
 end of this week it starts to rain and then 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.080
 rio de janeiro will end up coming in 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.570
 alert for storms is but look 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.190
 see how these areas of rain the river 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.170
 January is here 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.510
 and see how it goes for now. 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.840
 has almost nothing but this starts in the areas 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.360
 rain is turning yellow to orange 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.090
 indicated in the red orange 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.810
 the rain is rising, so I'll leave 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.030
 arrow of oil on the river 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.370
 Look, we're just here. 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.950
 Thursday with the cold front coming 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.890
 to Rio de Janeiro and looks only at her 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.880
 truth will be half a stop by 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.810
 The river is there and there's a lot of instability. 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.810
 happening in rio de janeiro
