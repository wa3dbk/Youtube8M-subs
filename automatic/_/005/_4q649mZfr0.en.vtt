although I really enjoyed gaming and I

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.250 
although I really enjoyed gaming and I

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
was really good at it I actually had

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.070 
was really good at it I actually had
never<00:01:10.520> experienced<00:01:11.520> other<00:01:11.880> activities<00:01:12.780> when

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
never experienced other activities when

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.710 
never experienced other activities when
I<00:01:13.110> started<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.860> try<00:01:14.130> new<00:01:14.580> things<00:01:14.610> outside<00:01:15.540> of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
I started to try new things outside of

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.440 
I started to try new things outside of
gaming<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.380> found<00:01:16.890> them<00:01:17.100> boring<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.970> part<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
gaming I found them boring but part of

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.179 
gaming I found them boring but part of
the<00:01:18.540> reason<00:01:18.840> why<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.229> was<00:01:19.380> happening<00:01:19.530> was

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the reason why that was happening was

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.890 
the reason why that was happening was
just<00:01:20.400> because<00:01:20.670> there<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:20.970> something<00:01:21.330> new<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
just because there was something new and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.499 
just because there was something new and
there<00:01:22.380> was<00:01:22.500> something<00:01:22.799> completely<00:01:22.920> different

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
there was something completely different

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.420 
there was something completely different
than<00:01:24.509> gaming<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.590> was<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.740> new<00:01:25.920> experience

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
than gaming and it was a new experience

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.510 
than gaming and it was a new experience
and<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.180> had<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.600> give<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.840> time<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:29.400> you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520

okay so I'm not going to go too far into

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.730 
okay so I'm not going to go too far into
the<00:02:14.270> science<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.020> can<00:02:15.170> check<00:02:15.350> links

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
the science of it you can check links

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.530 
the science of it you can check links
below<00:02:15.950> if<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:16.310> want<00:02:16.550> okay<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.330> first

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
below if you want okay so the first

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.960 
below if you want okay so the first
major<00:02:18.020> change<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.650> happens<00:02:19.010> your<00:02:19.190> brain<00:02:19.430> is

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
major change that happens your brain is

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.240 
major change that happens your brain is
called<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.510> numb<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.990> pleasure<00:02:21.230> response<00:02:21.500> and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
called the numb to pleasure response and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.210 
called the numb to pleasure response and
what<00:02:22.460> this<00:02:22.610> means<00:02:22.850> is<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.170> everyday

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
what this means is that everyday

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.640 
what this means is that everyday
activities<00:02:25.220> no<00:02:25.490> longer<00:02:25.910> satisfied<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:26.930> the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
activities no longer satisfied and the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.860 
activities no longer satisfied and the
second<00:02:28.070> is<00:02:28.160> hyper<00:02:28.430> reactivity<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.390> gaming

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
second is hyper reactivity to gaming

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.040 
second is hyper reactivity to gaming
which<00:02:30.350> means<00:02:30.680> when<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.430> gain<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.510> have<00:02:32.540> so

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
which means when you gain you have so

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.500 
which means when you gain you have so
much<00:02:33.230> more<00:02:33.530> fun<00:02:34.100> when<00:02:34.670> you're<00:02:34.850> playing<00:02:35.150> games

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
boring in comparison when you take those

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.340 
boring in comparison when you take those
two<00:02:40.730> things<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:41.150> combination<00:02:41.360> there<00:02:42.140> are

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
two things in combination there are
