00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.470

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.759
 You know it was my goal to him 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.460
 get out of it with at the start and 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.989
 until it is as long as possible to get through 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.970
 to keep coming in and he succeeded 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.950
 you were in the race from moment on 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.890

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.170

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.780
 and then you go behind the horses honey yes 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.300

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.010
 wild nature one in the horse-drawn sleigh 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.480

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.619
 And then those are just images that you 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.240

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.619

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.590

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.020

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.600

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.220
 windmills around the neck and that 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.350
 people super grateful for it and I hope 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.259
 that I closed it in so nicely 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.700
 do you have goosebumps when you see that well 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.860
 I haven't got the images back new yet 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.540
 see if romario i was so tiring 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.979
 to the fitness I wanted to go hunting 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.570
 where I just really nothing anymore 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.310
 I was really really wanting to empty I was 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.979
 However, I have to give everything to this 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.560
 that seemed like a cleaner yes really it 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.570
 was not about anything else I was I think 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.369
 back souls I can laugh about it but yes 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.250
 it succeeded and that feels great 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.890
 well and I'm glad that would go is the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.000
 fall in your father's arms 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.090
 also a special moment 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.040
 well i have a lot of people on them 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.750
 he always owes in from 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.000
 since childhood with all the sports I have 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.410
 has always performed in that is 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.790
 He has been there to get everywhere 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.230
 and I think that is for 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.960
 He also has a very nice award 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.280
 when they get to work and that is the 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.670
 first with whom I really want it 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.290
 share 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.000
 yes that was also a big thing for me 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.650
 special moment and also that for him 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.090
 did is certainly good 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.220
 I just jump into the swing 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.959
 Kramer you still had contact with that 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.030
 before the race or I had with one 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.660
 We called how the 10km a bit what he 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.130
 would do a golden tip from him and yes 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.020
 that moment I did not yet speak 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.500
 but there are calls in my phone 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.610
 somewhere goes on mouth stop is that will still 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.200
 take a while 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.200
 I'm going to enjoy it I'm not going well against it
