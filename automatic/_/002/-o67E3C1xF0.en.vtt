00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
 Hello everyone today to us for review 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.090
 hit two very interesting devices 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:13.230
 this is by my bank there are 1300 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.780
 milliampere hour and by my bank at 5000 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.330
 milliampere hour this is just new 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.140
 a jar that recently today 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.039
 made the place cans at 5 1010 milliamps 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.310
 hour let's see here it is 1 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.310
 bank 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.250
 let's open look here thin 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.250
 which one 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:54.690
 so here you can see 5000 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:01:00.620
 milliampere hour this device can 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:04.670
 compare in width with the world and v4 pro 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:10.259
 here you can see the same width 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:13.250
 that meizu mx4 pro 9 ideas that jar 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.250
 also 9 and 9 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:31.340
 it is very well seen and finally 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:35.160
 Our second survey today is 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:44.010
 a jar of 10,000 milliamps an hour all 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:47.150
 Iâ€™ll open it with a good second 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:51.990
 they are always very hard to open them 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:54.540
 we get 2 subjects as always goes 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.010
 annotations in Chinese that we can 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.580
 area is reverse and let's compare the two 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.580
 the subjects 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:17.010
 that's what you can see in width but 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:19.790
 width is approximately from a jar 1 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.980
 5 thousand milliampere hour is approximately 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.680
 one second about 10 me glove and in 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.850
 basically everything is fair 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.160
 Well, the design as they say it is very 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.940
 the bank itself is interesting it seems just 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.280
 on the phone 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.209
 that is, I am very comfortable to hold 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.370
 her hand is light but most importantly 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.209
 that she holds a charge that is she herself 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.400
 I have already arrived here with a charge 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.770
 75 percent 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.720
 these jars come here most often 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.430
 charge by 50 percent so what can 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.170
 to tell 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.010
 these banks you can order our 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.660
 the group is all about sion the price of this one 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.950
 devices for 5000 milliampere hour 900 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.640
 rubles this device is 1200 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:18.500
 rubles about each person says 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.500
 here you can see 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.180
