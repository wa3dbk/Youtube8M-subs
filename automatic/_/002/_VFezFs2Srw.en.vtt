00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.340
 hi to all today i was riding 

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:09.889
 the emulator says to our ds I already did 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.079
 a video but there I took another game 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.370
 I have little pokemon game so it's a game 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.709
 who downloaded it we understand a 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.410
 emulator ben that's what they are 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.450
 90s in pokemon download 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.850
 so we'll see this on the galaxy 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.800
 note 2 so I remember that a processor 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.170
 spent ten years in Russia quad war 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.770
 core so it's for me one of the most 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.400
 powerful at the moment so I think 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.250
 so here we go we go it's gone 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.960
 so i'm going to turn on nds android so 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.730
 free application downloadable from 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.700
 the google market google store is 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.200
 find some yes it's a little 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.149
 lost I did not say for example your 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.670
 cam so muscu should so here i'm going 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.880
 load a game I was looking in 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.880
 dresses 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:07.600
 and with the advent I have two games so there j 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.369
 pokemon money and that's pretty much 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.200
 bluffing any case for the time being for 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.190
 the intro of the game by missing sailboats the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.500
 city ​​and touch towards the deadline touches 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.570
 to convey no screen we would say 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.550
 not that it's more speed no you to 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.440
 quetta unfortunately for you and for 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.990
 me it's not all the movie is in 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.990
 anyway we will be close 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:46.090
 it seems really fluid and was 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.090
 to say to fast jabot a time are good 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.040
 so I specify that my phone is not 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.690
 not today 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.210
 I believe that in fact this is not 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.100
 still not in the cable but I think 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.250
 that if we remove it should really 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.470
 really really done so I'm going all 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.710
 immediately the delirium because that's when 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.300
 we go into the game 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.010
 the aca against jerky so genisson and or 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.370
 that you are well aware that's it 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.240
 rame tourism exit otherwise it works 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.480
 very well I can also are in 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.770
 especially no problem I dropped 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.770
 backlight to cover a little better 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.270
 now the 12 stages is playable I 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.860
 do not say that these pages give you 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.860
 bring the long and wood 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.780
 so the jenny his name will be slow and 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.080
 even more if you take off his 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.260
 win at 3 4 5 frames per second of 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.260
 more 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.440
 but there is something well played 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.180
 there is no if we could really 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.459
 do the game for that it's just that 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.250
 it's a bit long but what is it? 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.840
 we would do in your bath we find 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.520
 qobuz says nothing strongly an emulator 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.930
 full speed I do not think it's coming 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.100
 the emulator for those between and especially 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.530
 ben of the processor everything that follows 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.660
 good who can configure donor can 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.700
 to be a little more fluid cool is going badly you 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.260
 believe that it will come long 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.550
 yeah I give myself another two three 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.550
 years before you come back a little faster 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.209
 but its shape and you see it can 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.209
 easily go to play pokemon 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.870
 here is plenty and is perceived on pokemon 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.099
 I hope you like it if you 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.769
 do not have the panels if you have 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.280
 phone you can try to the 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.290
 Download 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.609
 if you do not have good this gives you a 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.819
 overview of what you will have if you 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.819
 buy it 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.470
