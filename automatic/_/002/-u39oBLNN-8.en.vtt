hi my name is Johnny Lee and I'm going

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.220 
hi my name is Johnny Lee and I'm going
to<00:00:05.940> show<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.180> how<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.509> create<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.900> cheap

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
to show you how to create a cheap

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.530 
to show you how to create a cheap
electronic<00:00:07.860> whiteboard<00:00:08.250> system<00:00:08.639> using<00:00:09.420> the

now<00:00:11.220> just<00:00:11.639> like<00:00:11.790> my<00:00:11.940> other<00:00:12.059> video<00:00:12.420> on<00:00:12.450> tracking

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
now just like my other video on tracking

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.750 
now just like my other video on tracking
your<00:00:13.139> fingers<00:00:13.440> using<00:00:13.800> the<00:00:13.889> Wii<00:00:14.010> mote<00:00:14.220> this

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
your fingers using the Wii mote this

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.060 
your fingers using the Wii mote this
project<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.330> also<00:00:15.960> only<00:00:16.170> going<00:00:16.439> to<00:00:16.560> use<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
project is also only going to use the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.710 
project is also only going to use the
infrared<00:00:17.369> camera<00:00:17.789> built<00:00:18.119> into<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.449> front<00:00:18.660> of

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
infrared camera built into the front of

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.540 
infrared camera built into the front of
each<00:00:18.810> controller<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:20.100> camera<00:00:20.310> is

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
each controller and this camera is

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.160 
each controller and this camera is
sensitive<00:00:20.910> only<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.390> sources<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.840> infrared

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
sensitive only to sources of infrared

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.990 
sensitive only to sources of infrared
light<00:00:22.350> which<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.100> why<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.250> contract<00:00:23.730> things

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
light which is why I contract things

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.660 
light which is why I contract things
like<00:00:24.270> the<00:00:24.420> Nintendo<00:00:24.600> sensor<00:00:25.500> bar<00:00:25.710> light<00:00:26.279> bulbs

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
like the Nintendo sensor bar light bulbs

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.300 
like the Nintendo sensor bar light bulbs
or<00:00:26.820> candles<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.900> if<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.170> want<00:00:28.350> to<00:00:28.439> track<00:00:28.650> pens

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
or candles so if we want to track pens

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.130 
or candles so if we want to track pens
on<00:00:29.609> an<00:00:29.699> electronic<00:00:30.060> whiteboard<00:00:30.570> all<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:31.019> have

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
on an electronic whiteboard all we have

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.259 
on an electronic whiteboard all we have
to<00:00:31.260> do<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.500> create<00:00:31.710> pens<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.759> emit<00:00:33.090> infrared

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
to do is create pens that emit infrared

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:36.410 
to do is create pens that emit infrared
light<00:00:33.859> the<00:00:34.859> light<00:00:35.039> pen<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.550> composed<00:00:36.089> of<00:00:36.300> an

want to interact with that image with my
light<00:01:00.749> pens<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.619> to<00:01:01.739> make<00:01:01.889> sure<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
light pens I have to make sure that the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.250 
light pens I have to make sure that the
Wii<00:01:02.639> Remote<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.179> always<00:01:03.420> see<00:01:03.659> the<00:01:03.690> tip<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.199> the

Wii Remote can always see the tip of the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260 
Wii Remote can always see the tip of the
pen<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:05.190> do<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.880> put<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.149> Wii

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
pen to do this I have to put the Wii

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.940 
pen to do this I have to put the Wii
mode<00:01:06.450> off<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> side<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.469> I<00:01:07.500> don't<00:01:07.560> block

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
mode off to the side so I don't block

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.170 
mode off to the side so I don't block
its<00:01:08.130> view<00:01:08.340> when<00:01:08.579> I'm<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.820> front<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.090> the

its view when I'm in front of the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
its view when I'm in front of the
predicted<00:01:09.630> image<00:01:09.869> I've<00:01:10.560> made<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.009> little

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
predicted image I've made this little

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.980 
predicted image I've made this little
stand<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.759> my<00:01:11.880> Wii<00:01:12.060> mode<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.869> use

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
stand for my Wii mode but you can use

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.420 
stand for my Wii mode but you can use
any<00:01:13.200> material<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:13.979> around<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> house

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
any material you have around the house

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.789 
any material you have around the house
to<00:01:14.640> prop<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> right<00:01:15.420> orientation

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
to prop it up in the right orientation

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.620 
to prop it up in the right orientation
now<00:01:16.799> when<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> put<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.490> shelf<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.509> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
now when I put it on the shelf I have to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.179 
now when I put it on the shelf I have to
make<00:01:18.750> sure<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.140> pointed<00:01:19.469> at<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.679> screen<00:01:19.979> so

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
make sure it's pointed at the screen so

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.099 
make sure it's pointed at the screen so
we<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.729> whole<00:01:20.880> area<00:01:20.929> now<00:01:21.929> it's

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
we can see the whole area now it's

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:23.330 
we can see the whole area now it's
important<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.439> remember<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> Wii<00:01:23.130> mote

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
important to remember that the Wii mote

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.599 
important to remember that the Wii mote
has<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> feel<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.329> view<00:01:24.509> about<00:01:24.869> 45<00:01:25.409> degrees<00:01:25.770> so

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:26.609 
has a feel of a view about 45 degrees so

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:28.190 
has a feel of a view about 45 degrees so
make<00:01:26.909> sure<00:01:26.939> you're<00:01:27.240> back<00:01:27.390> far<00:01:27.780> enough<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.049> see

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
make sure you're back far enough to see

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.169 
make sure you're back far enough to see
the<00:01:28.439> whole<00:01:28.560> screen<00:01:28.799> not<00:01:29.549> too<00:01:29.759> far<00:01:29.969> back

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
the whole screen not too far back

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.910 
the whole screen not too far back
because<00:01:30.299> otherwise<00:01:30.630> you'll<00:01:30.960> lose<00:01:31.020> tracking

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
because otherwise you'll lose tracking

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
to the computer over Bluetooth I can do

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.109 
to the computer over Bluetooth I can do
a<00:01:37.350> standard<00:01:37.710> 4-point<00:01:38.249> touch<00:01:38.490> calibration

a standard 4-point touch calibration

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.429 
a standard 4-point touch calibration
like<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.539> most<00:01:39.840> electronic

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
like they do on most electronic

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.499 
like they do on most electronic
whiteboards<00:01:40.920> what<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.729> does<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.149> it<00:01:42.299> Maps

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
whiteboards what this does is it Maps

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.630 
whiteboards what this does is it Maps
the<00:01:42.990> camera<00:01:43.380> coordinates<00:01:43.859> to<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.159> projector

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.880 

one<00:02:02.600> nice<00:02:02.780> thing<00:02:02.810> about<00:02:03.080> using<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.590> Wiimote

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
one nice thing about using the Wiimote

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.950 
one nice thing about using the Wiimote
to<00:02:04.070> do<00:02:04.190> this<00:02:04.400> is<00:02:04.580> any<00:02:05.150> surface<00:02:05.540> I<00:02:05.630> can<00:02:05.810> project

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
to do this is any surface I can project

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.930 
to do this is any surface I can project
onto<00:02:06.290> I<00:02:06.650> can<00:02:06.830> basically<00:02:06.980> turn<00:02:07.460> into<00:02:07.790> an

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
onto I can basically turn into an

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.030 
onto I can basically turn into an
interactive<00:02:08.479> whiteboard<00:02:08.630> now<00:02:09.590> what<00:02:09.740> I<00:02:09.770> have

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
interactive whiteboard now what I have

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.040 
interactive whiteboard now what I have
here<00:02:10.070> is<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.640> predictor<00:02:11.060> mounted<00:02:11.750> onto<00:02:11.900> a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
here is the predictor mounted onto a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.810 
here is the predictor mounted onto a
tripod<00:02:12.470> which<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.100> kind<00:02:13.280> of<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.400> generally

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
tripod which is kind of a generally

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.330 
tripod which is kind of a generally
useful<00:02:14.330> thing<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.750> do<00:02:14.840> anyway<00:02:15.070> and<00:02:16.070> it's<00:02:16.220> now

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
useful thing to do anyway and it's now

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.280 
useful thing to do anyway and it's now
pointing<00:02:16.850> at<00:02:17.030> this<00:02:17.210> table<00:02:17.510> top<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:17.810> the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
pointing at this table top and the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.690 
pointing at this table top and the
Wiimote<00:02:18.620> is<00:02:18.800> actually<00:02:19.100> attached<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.580> the

Wiimote is actually attached to the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.760 
Wiimote is actually attached to the
projector<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.660> we<00:02:20.810> can<00:02:20.960> have<00:02:21.350> this<00:02:21.530> top-down

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
projector so we can have this top-down

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.540 
projector so we can have this top-down
view<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.700> display<00:02:23.320> again<00:02:24.430> after<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.460> do

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
view of this display again after I do

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.630 
view of this display again after I do
the<00:02:25.790> 4-point<00:02:26.270> touch<00:02:26.450> calibration<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.550> can<00:02:28.550> now

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
the 4-point touch calibration I can now

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.390 
the 4-point touch calibration I can now
use<00:02:28.670> my<00:02:29.000> pen<00:02:29.270> just<00:02:29.630> like<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.840> mouse<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.250> can

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
use my pen just like a mouse and I can

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.010 
use my pen just like a mouse and I can
interact<00:02:31.610> with<00:02:31.790> my<00:02:31.910> table<00:02:32.210> like<00:02:32.780> it's<00:02:32.960> a

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
interact with my table like it's a

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.420 
interact with my table like it's a
multi-thousand<00:02:33.680> dollar<00:02:33.710> interactive

whiteboard<00:02:37.570> additionally<00:02:38.570> because<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.170> we

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
whiteboard additionally because that we

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.780 
whiteboard additionally because that we
remote<00:02:39.590> can<00:02:39.770> track<00:02:39.950> up<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.130> four<00:02:40.430> points

simultaneously but we use two pens this
is<00:02:43.430> actually<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.790> multi-touch<00:02:44.390> interactive

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
is actually a multi-touch interactive

00:02:45.050 --> 00:03:01.220 
is actually a multi-touch interactive
system

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.510 

if<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.380> don't<00:03:02.560> happen<00:03:02.710> to<00:03:02.890> have<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.040> projector

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
if you don't happen to have a projector

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.040 
if you don't happen to have a projector
you<00:03:03.550> can<00:03:03.820> still<00:03:04.090> use<00:03:04.240> the<00:03:04.390> same<00:03:04.570> technique

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
you can still use the same technique

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.600 
you can still use the same technique
with<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.320> liquid<00:03:05.680> crystal<00:03:06.010> display

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
with a liquid crystal display

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.670 
with a liquid crystal display
they<00:03:07.000> simply<00:03:07.210> mount<00:03:07.570> that<00:03:07.690> we<00:03:07.840> remote<00:03:08.140> point

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
they simply mount that we remote point

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.200 
they simply mount that we remote point
it<00:03:08.770> at<00:03:08.890> our<00:03:09.040> display<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.610> then<00:03:10.060> do<00:03:10.180> our

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
it at our display and then do our

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.190 
it at our display and then do our
4-point<00:03:10.780> touch<00:03:11.050> calibration<00:03:12.540> now<00:03:13.540> we<00:03:14.020> can

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
4-point touch calibration now we can

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.810 
4-point touch calibration now we can
essentially<00:03:14.530> turn<00:03:14.860> any<00:03:15.130> liquid<00:03:15.520> crystal

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
essentially turn any liquid crystal

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.670 
essentially turn any liquid crystal
display<00:03:16.180> into<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.930> multi-touch<00:03:17.440> tablet

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.050 

so<00:03:26.620> that's<00:03:26.800> how<00:03:26.950> with<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.370> Nintendo<00:03:27.880> Wiimote

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
so that's how with the Nintendo Wiimote

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.930 
so that's how with the Nintendo Wiimote
and<00:03:28.420> some<00:03:28.990> infrared<00:03:29.470> LED<00:03:29.830> light<00:03:30.040> pins<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:30.819> can

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
and some infrared LED light pins you can

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.130 
and some infrared LED light pins you can
create<00:03:31.120> your<00:03:31.270> own<00:03:31.330> really<00:03:31.660> low-cost

truth<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:38.110> tracking<00:03:38.500> resolution<00:03:39.100> you're

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
truth the tracking resolution you're

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.860 
truth the tracking resolution you're
going<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.400> get<00:03:39.550> off<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.910> camera<00:03:40.300> is<00:03:40.480> not<00:03:40.630> going

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
going to get off the camera is not going

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.390 
going to get off the camera is not going
to<00:03:40.930> be<00:03:41.020> as<00:03:41.140> good<00:03:41.290> as<00:03:41.500> one<00:03:41.830> of<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.010> commercial

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
to be as good as one of the commercial

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.400 
to be as good as one of the commercial
products<00:03:42.760> but<00:03:43.360> it's<00:03:43.510> pretty<00:03:43.690> good<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.260> it's

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
products but it's pretty good and it's

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.650 
products but it's pretty good and it's
much<00:03:44.800> much<00:03:45.040> cheaper<00:03:45.459> so<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:46.180> hope<00:03:46.510> you've

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
much much cheaper so I hope you've
