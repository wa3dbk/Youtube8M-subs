00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
sorted or change the cable but it's

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.930 
sorted or change the cable but it's
nearly<00:02:31.450> there<00:02:31.690> now<00:02:31.930> also<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.100> bar<00:02:33.370> end<00:02:33.640> waves

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
there the underside of the bike does

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.530 
there the underside of the bike does
seem<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.790> bit<00:02:51.820> oily<00:02:52.090> if<00:02:52.270> you<00:02:52.390> look<00:02:52.570> underneath

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
any although looks like it might at some

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.259 
any although looks like it might at some
point<00:02:59.560> but<00:03:00.160> anyway<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.580> bike<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.880> generally

it's<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.330> usable<00:03:04.780> condition<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.410> there<00:03:05.739> we<00:03:05.860> go

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
it's a usable condition so there we go

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.000 
it's a usable condition so there we go
good<00:03:06.489> luck<00:03:06.640> with<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.850> bidding
