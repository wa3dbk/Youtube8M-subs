after this is posted and then it is
Kaylee<00:00:48.870> Ultimatrix<00:00:49.640> AB<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.180> standard<00:00:51.660> box<00:00:51.840> not

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
Kaylee Ultimatrix AB so standard box not

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.529 
Kaylee Ultimatrix AB so standard box not
too<00:00:52.320> much<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> say<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.760> way<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.120> updated

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
too much to say but the way was updated

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.110 
too much to say but the way was updated
with<00:00:54.690> these<00:00:54.930> three<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.699> these<00:00:56.879> two<00:00:57.090> are

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
with these three and so these two are

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.639 
with these three and so these two are
together<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.840> ultimate<00:00:58.230> sand<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.469> guy's

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
together but ultimate sand this guy's

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.700 
together but ultimate sand this guy's
all<00:00:58.829> by<00:00:58.949> himself<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.780> let's<00:01:01.050> go<00:01:01.199> ahead<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
all by himself so let's go ahead and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.820 
all by himself so let's go ahead and
crack<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.370> little<00:01:02.760> baby<00:01:02.969> open<00:01:03.710> but<00:01:04.710> not

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
crack this little baby open but not

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.260 
crack this little baby open but not
literally<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.850> then<00:01:06.030> all<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
literally because if we do then all the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.510 
literally because if we do then all the
radiation<00:01:06.689> will<00:01:06.780> come<00:01:06.930> out<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.250> just

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
radiation will come out and that just

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.679 
radiation will come out and that just
wouldn't<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.850> fun<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.360> still<00:01:09.510> got

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
wouldn't be fun because I still got

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:33.109 
wouldn't be fun because I still got
other<00:01:09.840> stuff<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:31.490> find<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.610> lie<00:01:32.729> down<00:01:32.790> there

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
other stuff to do find a lie down there

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.219 
other stuff to do find a lie down there
yeah<00:01:34.520> alright<00:01:35.520> now<00:01:35.670> these<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:36.180> go<00:01:36.329> over<00:01:37.140> on

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229

the<00:01:37.259> floor<00:01:37.439> cuz<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.740> guess<00:01:37.860> she's<00:01:37.950> gonna<00:01:38.040> go<00:01:38.189> in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the floor cuz I guess she's gonna go in

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.130 
the floor cuz I guess she's gonna go in
the<00:01:38.310> trash<00:01:38.490> now<00:01:38.670> I'm<00:01:38.729> done

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
so let's take a look at the figure you

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.090 
so let's take a look at the figure you
know<00:01:42.930> there's<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.320> whole<00:01:43.680> lot<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.950> say

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
know there's not a whole lot to say

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.020 
know there's not a whole lot to say
about<00:01:44.130> his<00:01:44.369> details

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
about his details

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.569 
about his details
he's<00:01:45.420> overall<00:01:45.869> pretty<00:01:46.619> bland<00:01:46.920> design<00:01:47.310> but

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
he's overall pretty bland design but

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.940

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
articulation obviously you know there's

really<00:02:35.989> not<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.260> whole<00:02:36.349> lot<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.590> say<00:02:36.680> about<00:02:36.890> him

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
really not a whole lot to say about him

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.550 
really not a whole lot to say about him
he's<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.310> really<00:02:37.430> bland<00:02:38.000> figure<00:02:38.390> but<00:02:39.260> it's<00:02:39.410> not

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
he's a really bland figure but it's not

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.870 
he's a really bland figure but it's not
really<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.980> fault<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.340> figure<00:02:40.610> as<00:02:40.730> much

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
really the fault of the figure as much

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.460 
really the fault of the figure as much
as<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.180> just<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.540> design<00:02:41.870> for<00:02:42.019> this<00:02:42.140> aliens

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
as it is just to design for this aliens

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.750 
as it is just to design for this aliens
kind<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.709> horrible<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.160> really<00:02:43.370> don't<00:02:43.519> care<00:02:43.700> for

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
kind of horrible I really don't care for

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.330 
kind of horrible I really don't care for
it<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.810> concepts<00:02:45.380> cool<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.799> the<00:02:45.890> powers<00:02:46.190> are

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
it the concepts cool and the powers are

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.120 
it the concepts cool and the powers are
kind<00:02:46.519> of<00:02:46.610> neat<00:02:46.819> but<00:02:47.680> there's<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:48.830> really

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
kind of neat but there's a really

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.789 
kind of neat but there's a really
horrible<00:02:49.549> alien<00:02:50.030> design<00:02:50.299> but<00:02:51.230> he<00:02:51.380> looks<00:02:51.590> good

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
horrible alien design but he looks good

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.699 
horrible alien design but he looks good
for<00:02:51.860> what<00:02:52.190> he's<00:02:52.280> supposed<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.610> be<00:02:52.790> in<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.299> show

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
for what he's supposed to be in the show

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.370 
for what he's supposed to be in the show
he's<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.739> decent<00:02:54.980> representation<00:02:56.200> but<00:02:57.200> just

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
he's a decent representation but just

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
he's a decent representation but just
nothing<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.819> while<00:02:58.819> they're<00:02:59.030> exciting<00:03:00.340> but<00:03:01.340> he

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
nothing to while they're exciting but he

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.890 
nothing to while they're exciting but he
does<00:03:01.579> have<00:03:01.670> some<00:03:01.849> pretty<00:03:02.000> solid<00:03:02.209> articulation

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
does have some pretty solid articulation

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.080 
does have some pretty solid articulation
with<00:03:03.049> all<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.290> knee<00:03:03.650> joints<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.069> whatnot<00:03:04.340> see

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
with all the knee joints and whatnot see

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.050 
with all the knee joints and whatnot see
if<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.209> can<00:03:05.360> understand<00:03:06.640> okay<00:03:07.640> now<00:03:07.819> let's<00:03:07.940> take

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
if I can understand okay now let's take

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.660 
if I can understand okay now let's take
a<00:03:08.120> look<00:03:08.329> here<00:03:08.569> is<00:03:08.690> his<00:03:09.250> Ultimatrix<00:03:10.250> disk<00:03:10.459> let's

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
a look here is his Ultimatrix disk let's

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.000 
a look here is his Ultimatrix disk let's
pop<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:11.000> up<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.390> then<00:03:12.319> it<00:03:12.650> looks<00:03:12.860> actually

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
pop it up and then it looks actually

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.610 
pop it up and then it looks actually
kind<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.430> funny<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:13.730> kind<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.030> like<00:03:14.209> this<00:03:14.620> design

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
kind of funny I kind of like this design

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.340 
kind of funny I kind of like this design
of<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:15.980> Ultimatrix<00:03:16.640> disk<00:03:16.900> just<00:03:17.900> because<00:03:18.230> he

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
of the Ultimatrix disk just because he

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.160 
of the Ultimatrix disk just because he
looks<00:03:18.440> like<00:03:18.590> really<00:03:18.859> cartoony<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.310> funny<00:03:20.170> so

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
looks like really cartoony and funny so

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.590 
looks like really cartoony and funny so
now<00:03:21.639> we<00:03:22.639> got<00:03:22.790> our<00:03:22.819> handy-dandy

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
now we got our handy-dandy

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.650 
now we got our handy-dandy
Ultimatrix<00:03:24.019> here<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:25.489> let's<00:03:25.819> just<00:03:26.120> put<00:03:26.420> it<00:03:26.510> in

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
Ultimatrix here and let's just put it in

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.979 
Ultimatrix here and let's just put it in
and<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.200> believe<00:03:27.850> this<00:03:28.850> does<00:03:29.090> have<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.329> sound<00:03:29.630> I

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
and I believe this does have a sound I

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:40.509 
and I believe this does have a sound I
think<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.650> got<00:03:30.799> about<00:03:30.920> mistake<00:03:31.519> once<00:03:39.370> yeah<00:03:40.370> we

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
think I got about mistake once yeah we

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.420 
think I got about mistake once yeah we
got<00:03:40.670> a<00:03:40.700> sound<00:03:41.260> nice<00:03:42.260> sound<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:42.799> whatnot<00:03:43.100> I

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
got a sound nice sound and whatnot I

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.220 
got a sound nice sound and whatnot I
still<00:03:43.850> don't<00:03:43.970> like<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.269> stimulus<00:03:44.450> matrix<00:03:45.019> but

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
still don't like the stimulus matrix but

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.170 
still don't like the stimulus matrix but
at<00:03:45.680> least<00:03:45.769> he's<00:03:46.040> got<00:03:46.069> a<00:03:46.250> sound<00:03:46.549> unlike

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
at least he's got a sound unlike

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.800 
at least he's got a sound unlike
terraspin<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:49.730> that's<00:03:49.910> about<00:03:50.120> it<00:03:50.269> pretty

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
terraspin so that's about it pretty

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.539 
terraspin so that's about it pretty
short<00:03:51.200> review<00:03:51.560> once<00:03:51.920> again<00:03:52.010> like<00:03:52.220> I<00:03:52.280> said<00:03:52.400> he's

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
short review once again like I said he's

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:53.920 
short review once again like I said he's
on<00:03:52.609> his<00:03:52.730> own<00:03:52.850> was<00:03:53.060> probably<00:03:53.299> clocking<00:03:53.660> at<00:03:53.780> four

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
on his own was probably clocking at four

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.309 
on his own was probably clocking at four
minutes

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
minutes

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.910 
minutes
ish<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:55.519> overall<00:03:56.120> he's<00:03:56.329> an<00:03:56.420> okay<00:03:56.660> figure<00:03:57.049> if

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
ish so overall he's an okay figure if

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.160 
ish so overall he's an okay figure if
you<00:03:58.099> really<00:03:58.430> love<00:03:58.639> NRG<00:03:59.209> and<00:03:59.480> you<00:03:59.660> want<00:03:59.870> another

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
you really love NRG and you want another

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.530 
you really love NRG and you want another
disc<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.799> lien<00:04:01.040> for<00:04:01.069> your<00:04:01.579> Ultimatrix<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.420> make

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
disc a lien for your Ultimatrix to make

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.910
