00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.910
 the murderers are not gods 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.809
 the killers are very normal people 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.789
 they have a job they have some feelings 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.439
 and some of them 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.439
 that also happens to most people have some pathologies 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.720
 on the street with the number 29 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.500
 now removes from joaquin coast was inaugurated as who says the story 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.039
 criminal of modern barcelona 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.939
 a case to the mythical legendary is that of the vampire of the raval we are before a 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.590
 woman wished to enrich martí 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.230
 very mysterious 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.740
 in relation to the upper classes of the city the upper classes for the 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.450
 mornings dressed like like a poor 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.400
 Brazil 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.480
 all pockets and legality but also at night he dressed 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.460
 with his best finery I to the lyceum that surely at that point negotiated with 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.930
 the rich and 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.120
 your business exchanges 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.210
 on this balcony they told a kind of great house of horrors 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.240
 the girl was shaved her mother called her kidnapper 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.500
 there was another girl 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.820
 There is also talk of a piece of paper that bet that he had killed her 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.030
 and in the house they found a huge advantage with a brothel 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.430
 for the bread who surely 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.500
 a secret room with potions the rich 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.670
 hired have also detected 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.600
 for example to find remedies against tuberculosis is that you 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.600
 I can drink in the blood of children as a child 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.570
 the watchtower building a few years ago 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.900
 they killed 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.080
 to a woman 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.330
 they will lose 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.690
 it was because 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.330
 for real estate matters 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.620
 but it had a lot of repercussion in case of getting known 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.210
 according to the zone 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.180
 wealthy bourgeois 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.100
 yes without stinging with it a part of 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.990
 of Catalan society that normally does not 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.670
 we like it to be visible 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.350
 most crimes happen by the way for love or for money 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.890
 I think it's bad luck you're being raised to pose is like 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.030
 this protest 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.610
 the author makes the barcelona 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.560
 that's why there is already the want of a truth to look back affected parties 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.490
 would be unsafe that the session may be uncomfortable despite its 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.320
 crime was perfect but the crime room they found chairs 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.229
 what 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.449
 they made the cops relate that room and what was in it 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:29.449
 with the place of body finding 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.149
 here I am filled with grace in the release of doñana 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.699
 alcaraz life as 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:45.110
 the ages and wings 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.000
 this woman who cheated old age up there you see her at home to 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.539
 approve them in all killed 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.459
 the battle of the entrance of the house 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.270
 I do not know how many times he got to be degrees for they will be assassinated series 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.349
 at this exact point the city of san pablo with cross of grace of 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.879
 the last great crime happened 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.469
 you can talk about 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:17.769
 of crimes that a little omar khan is little there coexist with the time to 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.339
 have in their essence the feeling of the time the feeling of it 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.529
 of santaló's crime in barcelona 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:26.479
 in this function 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.399
 because we are a city like distant cities where many people are killed 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:31.299
 different ways 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.790
 never saved from the time of the gunslinger to the artist and patronal 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.739
 919 1923 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.120
 never before have I been shot like that down the street 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.009
 we are before a commission 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:47.009
 the one that appear the assassins 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:50.329
 indirectly we enter the globalized crime
