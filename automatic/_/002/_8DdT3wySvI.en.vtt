description below I'm just lagging out
there<00:00:24.119> but<00:00:24.689> i<00:00:24.720> thought<00:00:24.869> i'd<00:00:25.019> make<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.170> video<00:00:25.320> of

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
there but i thought i'd make a video of

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.740 
there but i thought i'd make a video of
this<00:00:25.789> to<00:00:26.789> make<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.060> make<00:00:27.180> more<00:00:27.300> sense<00:00:27.359> because

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
this to make it make more sense because

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.140 
this to make it make more sense because
i<00:00:27.930> took<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.769> three<00:00:29.429> times<00:00:29.670> as<00:00:29.849> long<00:00:29.939> as<00:00:30.060> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
i took like three times as long as I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.319 
i took like three times as long as I
should<00:00:30.330> have<00:00:30.679> had<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:31.800> been<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> video<00:00:32.329> would

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
should have had this been a video would

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.729 
should have had this been a video would
have<00:00:33.450> made<00:00:33.540> more<00:00:33.660> sense<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:33.989> basically<00:00:34.350> you're

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
have made more sense so basically you're

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.620 
have made more sense so basically you're
going<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.950> want<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> start<00:00:35.340> out<00:00:35.489> by<00:00:35.730> making<00:00:35.760> an

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
going to want to start out by making an

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.049 
going to want to start out by making an
i<00:00:36.930> or<00:00:37.230> an<00:00:38.160> H<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.540> wanna<00:00:39.660> look<00:00:40.410> at<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:41.059> you

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
i or an H have you wanna look at it you

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.979 
i or an H have you wanna look at it you
then<00:00:43.520> put<00:00:44.520> design<00:00:46.129> stick<00:00:47.129> these<00:00:47.250> two<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:47.989> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
then put design stick these two here and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.639 
then put design stick these two here and
then<00:00:49.200> you're<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.500> build<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.800> twice<00:00:50.550> up

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
then you're going to build this twice up

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.590 
then you're going to build this twice up
come<00:00:52.649> down<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> bottom<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:54.480> then

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
come down to the bottom here and then

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.630 
come down to the bottom here and then
build<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.930> circular<00:00:55.500> shape<00:00:55.739> around<00:00:56.250> which

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
build a circular shape around which

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.099 
build a circular shape around which
reaches<00:00:57.030> over<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> top<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.690> first<00:00:57.840> block

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
reaches over the top of the first block

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.920 
reaches over the top of the first block
here<00:00:59.149> second<00:01:00.149> block<00:01:00.300> whatever<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.719> want<00:01:00.870> to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
here second block whatever you want to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.939 
here second block whatever you want to
look<00:01:01.140> at<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.739> go<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.910> way<00:01:02.969> around

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
look at it as you go all the way around

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.399 
look at it as you go all the way around
link<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> up<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.309> got<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> circle<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.409> then

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
link it up so you got a circle here then

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.539 
link it up so you got a circle here then
you're<00:01:08.010> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> want<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.430> dig<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.360> trench

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
you're going to want to dig a trench

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.730 
you're going to want to dig a trench
seven<00:01:11.549> spaces<00:01:11.790> long<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.600> side<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
seven spaces long on this side and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.460 
seven spaces long on this side and
across<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.540> seven<00:01:15.540> spaces<00:01:15.750> song<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.350> this

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
across here seven spaces song on this

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.969 
across here seven spaces song on this
side<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.060> let's<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:18.180> going<00:01:20.780> one<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.530> don't

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
side so let's get going one so I don't

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.359 
side so let's get going one so I don't
need<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> kind<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.460> do<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:24.650> usually<00:01:25.650> lose<00:01:26.009> track

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
need to kind of do it usually lose track

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.840 
need to kind of do it usually lose track
of<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.610> anyway<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.509> about<00:01:27.900> seven<00:01:28.850> one

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
of it anyway like this about seven one

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.260 
of it anyway like this about seven one
two<00:01:29.880> three<00:01:30.720> four<00:01:31.229> five<00:01:31.290> six<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.119> fine

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
two three four five six so it's fine

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.480 
two three four five six so it's fine
because<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.630> water<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.049> runs<00:01:34.200> out

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
because the water just runs out

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.190 
because the water just runs out
automatically<00:01:35.490> anyway<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.060> show<00:01:36.240> me<00:01:39.200> both

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
automatically anyway so to show me both

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.850 
automatically anyway so to show me both
sides<00:01:40.530> equal<00:01:40.920> rank<00:01:41.040> makes<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.759> look<00:01:41.880> better

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
sides equal rank makes it look better

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.090 
sides equal rank makes it look better
see<00:01:43.860> ya<00:01:44.009> go<00:01:44.700> here<00:01:45.049> ok<00:01:46.049> now<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.530> want<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.009> get

the<00:02:04.500> structure<00:02:05.490> or<00:02:06.259> not<00:02:07.259> mace<00:02:07.799> basically<00:02:08.340> just

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
the structure or not mace basically just

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.830 
the structure or not mace basically just
put<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.729> where<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> put<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.539> nowhere<00:02:09.810> else

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
put it where I put it and nowhere else

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.260 
put it where I put it and nowhere else
because<00:02:10.349> otherwise<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:11.129> doesn't<00:02:11.280> work<00:02:11.489> as<00:02:12.150> you

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
because otherwise it doesn't work as you

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.790 
because otherwise it doesn't work as you
can<00:02:12.360> see<00:02:12.569> it's<00:02:12.870> reached<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.230> end<00:02:13.319> here<00:02:13.470> so

point<00:04:15.330> of<00:04:15.480> this<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.250> automatically<00:04:17.250> cut

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
point of this is to automatically cut

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.420 
point of this is to automatically cut
down<00:04:17.760> your<00:04:18.290> cane<00:04:19.290> without<00:04:19.830> you<00:04:19.980> having<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.280> go

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
down your cane without you having to go

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.690 
down your cane without you having to go
around<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:21.000> swipe<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.840> with<00:04:22.020> your<00:04:22.760> catch<00:04:23.760> it

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
around and swipe it with your catch it

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.040 
around and swipe it with your catch it
so<00:04:24.880> you're<00:04:25.030> going<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.180> call<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:25.390> I'm<00:04:25.840> too

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
so you're going to call a I'm too

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.390 
so you're going to call a I'm too
accustomed<00:04:26.260> to<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.650> runescape<00:04:27.010> word<00:04:27.160> for

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
accustomed to the runescape word for

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.230 
accustomed to the runescape word for
things<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:28.230> change<00:04:29.230> that<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:29.620> know<00:04:30.090> I'll<00:04:31.090> get

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
things to change that I know I'll get

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.940 
things to change that I know I'll get
used<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.450> it<00:04:31.570> anyway<00:04:32.110> so<00:04:32.590> this<00:04:32.770> is<00:04:32.830> basically

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
used to it anyway so this is basically

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.640 
used to it anyway so this is basically
what<00:04:33.490> you're<00:04:33.610> going<00:04:33.670> to<00:04:33.850> do<00:04:34.020> if<00:04:35.020> you<00:04:35.290> make<00:04:35.500> this

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
what you're going to do if you make this

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.230 
what you're going to do if you make this
at<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.890> start<00:04:36.070> of<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.250> day<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.730> leave<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.150> the

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
at the start of the day and leave it the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.090 
at the start of the day and leave it the
day<00:04:37.420> come<00:04:38.080> back<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.230> next<00:04:38.320> morning<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:39.070> should

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
day come back the next morning it should

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.630 
day come back the next morning it should
be<00:04:39.490> up<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.390> three<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:40.890> here's<00:04:41.890> one<00:04:42.070> I've<00:04:42.400> made

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
be up to three and here's one I've made

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.350 
be up to three and here's one I've made
earlier<00:04:43.060> it's<00:04:43.390> too<00:04:43.600> i<00:04:43.630> needed<00:04:44.020> it<00:04:44.170> and<00:04:45.360> when

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
earlier it's too i needed it and when

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.970 
earlier it's too i needed it and when
you<00:04:46.480> when<00:04:46.900> you<00:04:46.930> want<00:04:47.200> to<00:04:47.320> get<00:04:47.590> rid<00:04:47.740> of<00:04:47.800> this

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
you when you want to get rid of this

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.590 
you when you want to get rid of this
you're<00:04:48.400> going<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.610> have<00:04:48.730> to<00:04:48.910> stop<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.420> water

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
you're going to have to stop the water

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.210 
you're going to have to stop the water
flow<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.080> this<00:04:50.440> is<00:04:50.560> why<00:04:50.650> it's<00:04:50.710> important<00:04:51.130> that

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
flow and this is why it's important that

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.260 
flow and this is why it's important that
we<00:04:51.280> have<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.490> source<00:04:51.730> right<00:04:51.910> at<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.090> top

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
we have the source right at the top

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.990 
we have the source right at the top
instead<00:04:52.660> of<00:04:52.720> say<00:04:52.930> here<00:04:53.230> or<00:04:53.440> here<00:04:53.680> for<00:04:53.830> example

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
instead of say here or here for example

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.940 
instead of say here or here for example
because<00:04:55.000> we<00:04:55.600> can<00:04:55.750> stop<00:04:55.960> it<00:04:56.110> here<00:04:56.410> and<00:04:57.660> we<00:04:58.660> don't

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
because we can stop it here and we don't

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.990 
because we can stop it here and we don't
remove<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.160> water<00:05:00.310> source<00:05:00.550> it's<00:05:00.760> still<00:05:00.910> up

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
remove the water source it's still up

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.310 
remove the water source it's still up
there<00:05:01.180> so<00:05:01.330> when<00:05:01.480> we<00:05:01.600> get<00:05:01.750> rid<00:05:01.870> of<00:05:01.900> that<00:05:02.110> block

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
there so when we get rid of that block

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.720 
there so when we get rid of that block
the<00:05:02.530> what<00:05:02.680> will<00:05:02.770> come<00:05:02.890> back<00:05:03.100> and<00:05:03.310> we<00:05:03.400> can<00:05:03.430> start

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
the what will come back and we can start

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.220 
the what will come back and we can start
the<00:05:03.820> process<00:05:03.970> again<00:05:04.180> so<00:05:04.870> what<00:05:04.990> I'm<00:05:05.080> going<00:05:05.170> to

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
the process again so what I'm going to

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.670 
the process again so what I'm going to
do<00:05:05.380> here<00:05:05.590> let's<00:05:05.800> click<00:05:05.980> the<00:05:06.100> button<00:05:07.530> go<00:05:08.530> and
