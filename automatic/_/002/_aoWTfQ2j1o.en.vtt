00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
a good feature because I found that I

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.849 
a good feature because I found that I
forgot<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:00.599> was<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.870> my<00:03:00.989> pocket<00:03:01.260> after

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
a little while and that's slightly

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.420 
a little while and that's slightly
frightening<00:03:04.260> when<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.739> consider<00:03:05.099> you<00:03:05.280> could

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
frightening when you consider you could

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.399 
frightening when you consider you could
have<00:03:05.549> a<00:03:05.579> lot<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.849> money<00:03:06.030> in<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.269> but<00:03:06.540> in<00:03:07.319> the

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
have a lot of money in it but in the

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.199 
have a lot of money in it but in the
long<00:03:07.590> run<00:03:07.889> the<00:03:08.069> discomfort<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.150> the

long run the discomfort of the

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.569 
long run the discomfort of the
traditional<00:03:09.959> giant<00:03:10.470> leather<00:03:10.680> wallet<00:03:11.159> I<00:03:11.280> think

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
traditional giant leather wallet I think

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.479 
traditional giant leather wallet I think
