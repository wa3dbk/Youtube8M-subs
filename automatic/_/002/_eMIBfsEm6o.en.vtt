and usually guys the best test that I've
gotten<00:04:17.479> it<00:04:17.750> was<00:04:18.049> about<00:04:18.290> almost<00:04:18.739> 8<00:04:19.370> megabits

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
gotten it was about almost 8 megabits

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.240 
gotten it was about almost 8 megabits
per<00:04:20.239> second<00:04:20.900> in<00:04:21.049> download<00:04:21.709> speed<00:04:22.010> which<00:04:22.220> is

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
per second in download speed which is

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.700 
per second in download speed which is
not<00:04:22.550> bad<00:04:22.760> at<00:04:22.940> all

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:37.000

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
so here we have almost four you got two

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.930 
so here we have almost four you got two
four<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:42.130> then<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.280> upload<00:04:43.610> speed<00:04:43.910> is

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
four and then the upload speed is

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:51.070 
four and then the upload speed is
usually<00:04:44.240> about<00:04:44.600> one<00:04:44.900> megabit<00:04:49.690> so<00:04:50.690> again<00:04:50.900> guys

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
usually about one megabit so again guys

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.070 
usually about one megabit so again guys
