00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.420
 yes 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.360
 the lemon chicken is probably a 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.030
 of the most well-known and desired recipes 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.280
 of Chinese food is very easy to 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.800
 do and it is delicious I am going to tell you 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.640
 how do I do it 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.550
 We're going to need some chicken breasts 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.750
 some lemons chicken broth oil 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:33.220
 sunflower soy sauce an egg cornstarch 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.290
 grated bread salt and sugar once 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.000
 let's have the chicken clean first thing 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.820
 let's do it with the help of some 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.100
 scissors go removing the pieces of fat 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.500
 visible we do this so that the 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.690
 dish turns out to be healthier and feels 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.840
 better we put in a bowl all the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.289
 marinated ingredients one egg two 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.859
 tablespoons of soy sauce and 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:59.679
 half a teaspoon of salt we beat well 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.780
 with a fork we put the breasts of 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.720
 chicken we take a few turns so that 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.759
 completely impregnate we cover and what 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.759
 let's reserve in the fridge until 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.860
 We are going to fry them in a bowl 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.200
 small two teaspoons full of 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.630
 Cornstarch add a little broth 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.270
 chicken and stir well until dissolved 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.000
 completely 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.270
 We cut one of the sliced ​​lemons 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.689
 thin and squeeze the other lemon for 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.929
 get your juice we remove the seeds to 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.479
 the lemon slices and make a cut 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:36.390
 along without actually cutting one of 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.549
 the edges to rotate them like that and that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.740
 are nice to decorate the plate 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.740
 we put in a saucepan to the fire all the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.049
 ingredients to make the sauce a glass 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.209
 of chicken broth two tablespoons of a 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.509
 soft vinegar as it can be apple 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.729
 8 teaspoons of sugar the juice of the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.099
 lemon that we have squeezed half 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.140
 spoonful of soy sauce and let's 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.840
 let it start to boil when 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.399
 start to boil add the cornstarch 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.220
 that we have dissolved in a little bit of 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.890
 chicken broth and stir very well 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.619
 until it thickens this will take about 5 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.049
 or 10 minutes 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.790
 once it is at its point we have to 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.099
 try it because you have to rectify the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.830
 point of salt of acidity and sweetness 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.159
 our taste you can add a little 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.680
 more than lemon juice of soy sauce 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.440
 sugar looking for the point you like to 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.510
 you when you have it ready 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.690
 add the lemon slices and 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.730
 we reserve now let's prepare the 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.040
 chicken for it we're going to reboot what 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.489
 we have two options we can do it with 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.620
 cornstarch or breadcrumbs personally 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.769
 I prefer to do it with bread crumbs because 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.739
 it is more crispy we throw abundant 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.720
 bread crumbs on a plate we take the 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.230
 breasts from the fridge that have been 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.750
 marinated and battered very well by the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.269
 bread crumbs without any gap and 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.030
 finally we will fry them at medium heat 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.459
 in a pan with plenty of oil what 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.500
 typical is to use a neutral oil as 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.170
 sunflower oil but if you prefer 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.109
 you can use olive oil 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.169
 we will leave for 45 minutes on one side 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:17.630
 we will turn around and another 45 minutes 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.579
 the other until they are well browned 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.950
 It is convenient to go around them because 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.530
 then I would suck a lot of oil the best 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.319
 is to make them turn around and back to fire 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.180
 half when they are ready we take them out 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.730
 on a plate that we will have with paper 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.190
 of cooking and I always squeeze them 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.210
 lightly with more kitchen paper to 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.730
 remove excess oil well 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.490
 with a sharp knife we cut 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.030
 the breasts in pieces of about two 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.650
 centimeters thick and with the knife 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.440
 slightly inclined but not reaching 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.360
 cut completely so that the 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.480
 way and we have a nice 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.640
 presentation we carefully place the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.650
 breasts on the source where we go to 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.070
 serve separate with your hands 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.050
 slightly the pieces we put on top 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.020
 the lemon slices for decoration 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.540
 and we water with a little bit of the sauce 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.040
 lemon we serve the rest of the sauce in 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.120
 a separate bowl for anyone who wants 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.600
 take more and ready and we have our 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.300
 delicious homemade lemon chicken sauce 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.340
 it is delicious that the measures that you 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.890
 I give are approximate because it is not 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.650
 same use some lemons that others a 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.080
 vinegar that other some are more acidic 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.850
 others sweeter but as I tell you what 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.640
 it is better that you go testing until 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.350
 find the point then nothing else I hope 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.660
 that you cheer up with this recipe so 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.190
 famous who like everyone and I already 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.190
