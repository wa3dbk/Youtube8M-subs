00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hi everyone, everything good I recently did 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.440
 a blog post telling some 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.540
 inspirations is to put pads 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.450
 on the bed and there like a lot of people 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.509
 liked it today I decided to record a video is 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.119
 the online world of how to cover 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.310
 pad and pillow cover to 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.529
 put on the bed and detail without 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.619
 sewing then let's check the index 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.279
 super easy the covers look beautiful looks 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.740
 This one is super cute and you 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.180
 You do not have to use culture for anything then. 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.250
 check it out then let's go 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.380
 new materials are these and all are 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.149
 listed on the blog that is the link in the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.899
 description of the video first we will go 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.329
 do 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.430
 cushion however despite 102 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.780
 inches wide and 102 centimeters 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.140
 of lenght 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.180
 the fabric is here all ricardinho and 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:01.170
 now I'm going to get a talk that we 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:03.030
 You'll use it and I'll put it in the middle there. 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.580
 now that I put it in the middle I go 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.580
 pick up these tips from the side of the side 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:21.070
 on this side here too 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:24.500
 I'm going to fix the tip and stay like this 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:29.840
 at this point we're going to double 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.159
 here you sunbathe here and there 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.450
 on here 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.470
 the corner and then I'll pull here to the 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:47.899
 medium 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:51.170
 tÃ¡ same thing on the other side and half will 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:55.970
 stay so the two parts then 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:07.130
 here we will get them so the 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:10.780
 two and will give a normal knot that here and 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.780
 now you will give another name 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:25.109
 after a knot 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.569
 you just set the tips and cushion 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.579
 but the fabric and adds the fact its 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.639
 Fashion cover is ready she can wear 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:35.209
 so it seems a little bit but I do not know 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:39.480
 the side like a cushion cover 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:42.180
 normal and easy 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.280
 now we are going to make the pillowcase 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.700
 people will need 140 centimeters of 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.959
 length and 45 centimeters of fabric 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.609
 width 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.739
 the ideal is that it was the ideal that she gave 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.730
 one full turn on the pillow that 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.469
 you'll use 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.780
 so I used mine there to measure I put 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.879
 a little bit like that after yesterday another 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.699
 little bit she just has to do it and 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.069
 also cover the sides of the 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:07.459
 that's all we're going to stick to right now 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.709
 these side parts with the hot glue 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.739
 then I do so are made of fabrics 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.790
 and glue to show you how to do more 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.469
 or less now 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.540
 Good to stick as I said there are people to 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:21.090
 need a stick from a gun 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.889
 pardon of hot glue 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.930
 I recorded the part where I put a 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.269
 More fabric lighting became so cool 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.280
 so I decided to record again and I recorded 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.949
 with this fabric dinho with this fabric 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.900
 he is unlike then the 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:36.090
 It is important that you are really 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.280
 The opposite is the same thing that only goes with 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.780
 the sides but it has to have the opposite 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.699
 and we will talk later to paste 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.739
 You're just going to roll those sides 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.239
 So how I am showing you then you pass. 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.919
 the tail 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.159
 This glue has to press a 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:55.799
 A little then what's good? 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:59.900
 because she glues super fast and 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:02.400
 there and then you come and 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.870
 have been up and press 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.489
 only this 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.519
 so I finished first takeoff 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.750
 I pressed the whole side and the 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.039
 stays like this 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.019
 well now I've put all this already 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:16.919
 is the same pillowcase that had pasted on the 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.409
 sides 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.570
 I just did not stick the front opening that 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:23.820
 the part where I 'm going to put where I 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.590
 I will put the pillow is not for what 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.440
 it's easier, I did not paste it now 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.590
 go say so 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.020
 and then the finish stays like this, I already 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.000
 I put the pillow and in the house 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.770
 we always finish well 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.810
 good so it is and without any use of sewing 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.320
 only with the hot glue even super 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.280
 cool, good to finish there 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.510
 from the part I put the 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.240
 pillow like I said I did not 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.160
 colei i just joined massey a little bit 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.950
 yes , bei, and there you have those 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.380
 pins grampinhos in the second right 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.510
 holds one on each side and for me 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.850
 It was good, I did not have to roll because that 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.290
 side is down it does not show up 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.640
 Do you want to do this? You can do it. 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.890
 if you want to put also glue 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.560
 Hot you can paste 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.930
 then this is the end result not only 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.490
 frevo with the super beautiful is this is 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.560
