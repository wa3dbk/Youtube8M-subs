the tree but having done that about 100

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.300 
the tree but having done that about 100
meters<00:02:23.490> further<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:24.500> they<00:02:25.500> basically<00:02:25.950> there

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.710 
without light we have see what you do
it's<00:04:01.710> pretty<00:04:01.980> dangerous<00:04:02.180> we<00:04:03.180> can<00:04:03.570> them

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
it's pretty dangerous we can them

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.910 
it's pretty dangerous we can them
actually<00:04:03.840> done<00:04:04.140> it<00:04:04.260> without<00:04:04.410> his<00:04:04.710> eyes

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
actually done it without his eyes

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.100 
actually done it without his eyes
believe<00:04:05.580> as<00:04:05.730> we<00:04:05.880> did<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.450> been<00:04:06.660> able<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.960> do

excellent now the car is all fixed
rebuilt<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.790> front<00:04:18.000> winch<00:04:18.180> motor<00:04:18.350> yeah<00:04:19.350> this

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
rebuilt the front winch motor yeah this

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.159 
rebuilt the front winch motor yeah this
morning<00:04:19.920> me<00:04:20.010> do<00:04:20.160> most<00:04:20.400> rounds<00:04:20.910> we<00:04:21.810> stripped

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
morning me do most rounds we stripped

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.900 
morning me do most rounds we stripped
down<00:04:22.410> found<00:04:22.890> that<00:04:23.070> basically<00:04:23.460> one<00:04:23.730> of<00:04:23.850> the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
down found that basically one of the

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.390 
down found that basically one of the
brushes<00:04:24.300> hood<00:04:24.510> frankly<00:04:25.350> try<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.620> world<00:04:25.890> itself

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
brushes hood frankly try to world itself

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.670 
brushes hood frankly try to world itself
to<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:26.820> back<00:04:27.000> of<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.180> motor<00:04:27.419> so<00:04:28.380> we've<00:04:28.650> taken

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
to the back of the motor so we've taken

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.730 
to the back of the motor so we've taken
that<00:04:29.100> out<00:04:29.160> we<00:04:29.910> had<00:04:30.330> a<00:04:30.360> smear<00:04:30.810> brush<00:04:31.140> packs<00:04:31.470> we

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
that out we had a smear brush packs we

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.340 
that out we had a smear brush packs we
put<00:04:31.950> that<00:04:31.980> back<00:04:32.310> in<00:04:32.750> and<00:04:33.750> we've<00:04:33.990> given<00:04:34.169> it<00:04:34.260> a

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
put that back in and we've given it a

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.790 
put that back in and we've given it a
quick<00:04:34.530> test<00:04:34.860> that's<00:04:35.160> easy<00:04:35.370> okay<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:37.290> today<00:04:37.650> is

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
quick test that's easy okay and today is

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.370 
quick test that's easy okay and today is
circuit<00:04:38.280> race<00:04:38.430> time<00:04:38.720> are<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:39.840> going<00:04:39.990> off<00:04:40.260> the

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
circuit race time are you going off the

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.900 
circuit race time are you going off the
circuit<00:04:40.590> right<00:04:40.830> now<00:04:41.220> what<00:04:41.430> we've<00:04:41.550> done<00:04:41.730> is

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
circuit right now what we've done is

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.150 
circuit right now what we've done is
related<00:04:42.480> to<00:04:42.570> dating<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.680> try<00:04:43.890> and<00:04:44.010> collect

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
related to dating to try and collect

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.920 
related to dating to try and collect
some<00:04:44.340> parts<00:04:44.820> bits<00:04:45.090> and<00:04:45.270> other<00:04:45.360> stuff<00:04:45.720> we<00:04:45.900> need

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
some parts bits and other stuff we need

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.740 
some parts bits and other stuff we need
I<00:04:46.410> mean<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:47.120> general<00:04:48.120> overview<00:04:48.600> of<00:04:48.690> the

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
I mean the general overview of the

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.450 
I mean the general overview of the
moment<00:04:49.140> of<00:04:49.200> where<00:04:49.410> we<00:04:49.560> stand<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:50.040> moments

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
moment of where we stand and moments

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.020 
moment of where we stand and moments
basically<00:04:50.850> we've<00:04:51.030> gone<00:04:51.210> Sam<00:04:51.919> a<00:04:52.919> bit<00:04:53.640> down<00:04:53.820> and

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
basically we've gone Sam a bit down and

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.970 
basically we've gone Sam a bit down and
power<00:04:54.240> we<00:04:54.450> seem<00:04:54.660> to<00:04:54.810> persuade<00:04:55.169> some<00:04:55.500> water<00:04:55.710> or

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
power we seem to persuade some water or

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.890 
power we seem to persuade some water or
mud<00:04:56.430> or<00:04:56.669> something<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.390> engines<00:04:57.720> we're

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
mud or something the engines we're

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.830 
mud or something the engines we're
seeing<00:04:58.140> with<00:04:58.230> very<00:04:58.440> down<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:58.830> power<00:04:59.840> we've

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
seeing with very down and power we've

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.630 
seeing with very down and power we've
also<00:05:01.020> seem<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:01.350> have<00:05:01.500> lost<00:05:01.710> fifth<00:05:02.160> year<00:05:02.430> as

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
also seem to have lost fifth year as

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.670 
also seem to have lost fifth year as
well<00:05:02.850> which<00:05:03.330> kind<00:05:03.540> of<00:05:03.630> happens<00:05:03.990> up<00:05:04.230> some<00:05:04.530> of

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
well which kind of happens up some of

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.230 
well which kind of happens up some of
the<00:05:04.770> clients<00:05:05.070> are<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.370> longer<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.850> faster

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
the clients are the longer the faster

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.170 
the clients are the longer the faster
sections<00:05:06.950> and<00:05:07.950> we<00:05:08.130> see<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.400> shredded<00:05:08.880> fan

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
sections and we see the shredded fan

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.239 
sections and we see the shredded fan

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:32.719 
have got so bad that even beta day tasks

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.589 
have got so bad that even beta day tasks
again<00:05:33.169> becoming<00:05:33.529> very<00:05:33.769> difficult<00:05:34.359> we<00:05:35.359> found

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
again becoming very difficult we found

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.209 
again becoming very difficult we found
the<00:05:35.689> ideal<00:05:35.839> test<00:05:36.259> for<00:05:36.409> our<00:05:36.469> new<00:05:36.649> winch<00:05:36.889> when<00:05:37.129> I

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:37.219 
the ideal test for our new winch when I

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:39.369 
the ideal test for our new winch when I
got<00:05:37.429> the<00:05:37.579> support<00:05:38.269> truck<00:05:38.539> discoveries<00:05:39.079> stuck

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:39.379 
got the support truck discoveries stuck

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:42.129 
got the support truck discoveries stuck
