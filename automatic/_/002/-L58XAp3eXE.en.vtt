growing out from the wall you're going
to<00:01:23.430> be<00:01:23.490> training<00:01:23.970> other<00:01:24.119> ones<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.409> know

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
to be training other ones in you know

tying<00:01:25.860> them<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.520> trellis<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.119> things<00:01:27.330> so

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
tying them in to a trellis and things so

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.450 
tying them in to a trellis and things so
you're<00:01:28.140> really<00:01:28.409> you're<00:01:28.770> controlling<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
garden because there again you can cut

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.569 
garden because there again you can cut
it<00:01:39.180> back<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.229> cut<00:01:40.409> out<00:01:40.560> bits<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.340> in

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
