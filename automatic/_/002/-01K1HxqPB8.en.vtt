00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
from that but when you're practicing you

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.890 
from that but when you're practicing you
generally<00:02:20.910> want<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.120> practice<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:21.780> it'll

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
generally want to practice that so it'll

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.150 
generally want to practice that so it'll
look<00:02:21.990> something<00:02:22.170> like<00:02:22.350> this<00:02:27.950> you'll<00:02:28.950> just

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
look something like this you'll just

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.910 
look something like this you'll just
repeat<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.730> over<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.330> over<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.230> if<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.770> was

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
repeat this over and over so if it was

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.130 
repeat this over and over so if it was
just<00:02:32.100> me<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> tiger<00:02:32.550> than<00:02:32.820> I'm<00:02:32.940> gonna<00:02:33.270> do<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.780> if

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
just me a tiger than I'm gonna do it if

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.480 
just me a tiger than I'm gonna do it if
it<00:02:34.350> was<00:02:34.470> multiple<00:02:34.860> people<00:02:35.190> you'd<00:02:35.340> have

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
it was multiple people you'd have

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.160 
it was multiple people you'd have
everybody<00:02:35.880> brought<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.330> hit<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.660> one<00:02:36.959> guy

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
everybody brought to hit the one guy

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.320 
everybody brought to hit the one guy
will<00:02:38.040> take<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.370> guy<00:02:38.580> out<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.180> keep

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
will take that guy out and you keep

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.550 
will take that guy out and you keep
doing<00:02:39.600> like<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.050> I'll<00:02:40.170> go<00:02:40.320> against

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
doing like that so I'll go against

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.990 
doing like that so I'll go against
tightly<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:47.400> that's<00:02:47.610> it

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
tightly and that's it

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.180 
tightly and that's it
again<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.840> point<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.290> exercise<00:02:49.500> is

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
again the the point of this exercise is

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.880 
again the the point of this exercise is
the<00:02:50.430> impact<00:02:50.880> it's<00:02:51.120> coming<00:02:51.720> out<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.930> line<00:02:52.110> as

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
the impact it's coming out the line as

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.280 
the impact it's coming out the line as
pretty<00:02:53.160> as<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.400> can<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:54.510> can<00:02:54.660> practice<00:02:55.110> it

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
pretty as you can you can practice it

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.140 
pretty as you can you can practice it
hard<00:02:55.590> but<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:55.860> doesn't<00:02:56.070> have<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.220> be<00:02:56.400> about

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
hard but it doesn't have to be about

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.120 
hard but it doesn't have to be about
power<00:02:57.480> really<00:02:57.900> which<00:02:58.110> one's<00:02:58.380> good<00:02:58.650> technique

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130
