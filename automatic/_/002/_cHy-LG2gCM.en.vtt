this<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.359> to<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.539> quite<00:01:54.779> a<00:01:54.810> thin<00:01:55.139> braid

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
this is going to be quite a thin braid

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.480 
this is going to be quite a thin braid
like<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:59.119> and<00:02:00.119> then<00:02:00.539> other<00:02:01.109> side<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:02.310> it's

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
like that and then other side and it's

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.429 
like that and then other side and it's
quite<00:02:02.849> acceptable<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.749> take<00:02:03.990> both<00:02:04.289> sides<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
quite acceptable to take both sides and

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.139 
quite acceptable to take both sides and
there

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
there

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.699 
there
and<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.299> just<00:02:09.450> basically<00:02:09.689> do<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.649> you

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
and you just basically do that and you

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.589 
and you just basically do that and you
just<00:02:10.890> get<00:02:11.159> the<00:02:11.310> hang<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.579> it<00:02:11.700> i<00:02:11.760> mean<00:02:11.939> i<00:02:12.180> know

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
just get the hang of it i mean i know

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.420 
just get the hang of it i mean i know
this<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.170> probably<00:02:13.379> are<00:02:13.709> making<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.099> look<00:02:14.250> easy

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
this is probably are making it look easy

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.699 
this is probably are making it look easy
but<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.599> does<00:02:15.780> take<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:16.019> couple<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.500> practices

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
but it does take a couple of practices

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.099 
but it does take a couple of practices
but<00:02:17.250> once<00:02:17.430> you've<00:02:17.609> got<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.909> hang<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.329> it<00:02:18.450> you

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
but once you've got the hang of it you

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.849 
but once you've got the hang of it you
can<00:02:19.260> do<00:02:19.409> it<00:02:19.439> in<00:02:19.650> no<00:02:19.799> time<00:02:19.829> at<00:02:20.250> all<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:22.560> keep

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
can do it in no time at all just keep

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:28.880 
can do it in no time at all just keep
going<00:02:26.359> and<00:02:27.359> you've<00:02:27.480> got<00:02:27.599> no<00:02:27.659> head<00:02:28.049> upside<00:02:28.560> left

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
going and you've got no head upside left

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.740 
going and you've got no head upside left
so<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.790> can<00:02:29.909> I<00:02:29.939> get<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.359> point<00:02:30.540> where

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
so you can I get to the point where

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.869 
so you can I get to the point where
you've<00:02:30.840> got<00:02:31.019> all<00:02:31.200> your<00:02:31.230> hair<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.489> and

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
you've got all your hair like this and

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.569 
you've got all your hair like this and
then<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:34.109> carry<00:02:34.439> on<00:02:34.590> flat<00:02:34.980> in<00:02:35.159> the<00:02:35.280> hair

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
then you just carry on flat in the hair

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.629 
then you just carry on flat in the hair
and<00:02:35.879> if<00:02:36.720> it's<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:37.049> normal<00:02:37.260> plot<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:38.219> is<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.609> a

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
and if it's a normal plot this is like a

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.369 
and if it's a normal plot this is like a
normal<00:02:39.030> braid<00:02:39.269> so<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.569> keep<00:02:39.719> going

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.210 

dum-dum-dum<00:02:45.019> like<00:02:46.019> so<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.769> then<00:02:46.799> end<00:02:47.099> it

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
dum-dum-dum like so and then end it

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.800 
dum-dum-dum like so and then end it
wherever<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.609> want<00:02:47.669> to<00:02:47.970> end<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.329> so<00:02:48.540> probably

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
wherever you want to end it so probably

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.059 
wherever you want to end it so probably
just<00:02:48.870> gonna<00:02:49.049> end<00:02:49.319> it<00:02:50.030> about<00:02:51.030> here<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:52.439> then<00:02:52.950> if

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
just gonna end it about here and then if

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.819 
just gonna end it about here and then if
you<00:02:53.189> want<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:54.780> can<00:02:54.959> take<00:02:55.200> like<00:02:55.379> a<00:02:55.439> clear

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
you want to you can take like a clear

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.250 
you want to you can take like a clear
braid<00:02:56.250> not<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.000> clear<00:02:57.269> braid<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:57.750> clear<00:02:57.959> kind<00:02:58.200> of

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
braid not a clear braid it clear kind of

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.759 
braid not a clear braid it clear kind of
elastic<00:02:58.919> to<00:02:59.400> kind<00:02:59.579> of<00:02:59.639> tie<00:02:59.939> it<00:03:00.000> up<00:03:00.620> we<00:03:01.620> don't

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
elastic to kind of tie it up we don't

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.679 
elastic to kind of tie it up we don't
have<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:02.340> completely<00:03:02.790> up<00:03:02.939> to<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.510> now

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
have to it's completely up to you I now

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.679 
have to it's completely up to you I now
hold<00:03:04.379> this<00:03:04.650> like<00:03:05.519> this<00:03:05.819> for<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.150> time<00:03:06.329> being

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
hold this like this for the time being

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.479 
hold this like this for the time being
and<00:03:06.870> we<00:03:07.049> let<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.439> rest<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.829> my<00:03:08.010> hair<00:03:08.599> free<00:03:10.489> like

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
and we let the rest of my hair free like

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.789 
and we let the rest of my hair free like
so<00:03:12.079> rearrange<00:03:13.079> my<00:03:13.319> hair<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:15.079> I'm<00:03:16.079> going<00:03:16.379> to<00:03:16.409> way

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
that I always do this is I take my hair

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.740 
that I always do this is I take my hair
this<00:03:19.799> plaque<00:03:20.129> here<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.120> tuck<00:03:21.510> it

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
this plaque here and I tuck it

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.960 
this plaque here and I tuck it
underneath<00:03:22.409> my<00:03:22.739> ear<00:03:23.359> and<00:03:24.650> then<00:03:25.650> i<00:03:25.919> just<00:03:26.819> take

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
underneath my ear and then i just take

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.009 
underneath my ear and then i just take
this<00:03:27.030> bit<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.569> kind<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:28.220> pop<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.810> long<00:03:30.810> kind

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
this bit and kind of pop it a long kind

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.309 
this bit and kind of pop it a long kind
of<00:03:31.109> the<00:03:31.229> nape<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.709> my<00:03:31.769> neck<00:03:31.949> and<00:03:32.519> then<00:03:32.599> I<00:03:33.599> get

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
of the nape of my neck and then I get

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.119 
of the nape of my neck and then I get
some<00:03:34.530> curvy<00:03:35.159> grips<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.750> just<00:03:39.349> attach<00:03:40.349> the

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
some curvy grips and I just attach the

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.430 
some curvy grips and I just attach the
braids<00:03:41.430> like<00:03:41.669> that<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.389> mean<00:03:42.870> obviously<00:03:42.989> my

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
braids like that I mean obviously my

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.979 
braids like that I mean obviously my
hair<00:03:43.680> is<00:03:43.799> really<00:03:44.159> long<00:03:44.430> so<00:03:45.090> mostly<00:03:45.599> probably

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
hair is really long so mostly probably

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.390 
hair is really long so mostly probably
have<00:03:46.139> shorter<00:03:46.530> heard<00:03:46.739> me<00:03:47.040> because<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.340> know

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
have shorter heard me because I know

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.379 
have shorter heard me because I know
that<00:03:47.729> my<00:03:48.659> hair<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:49.199> really<00:03:49.859> long<00:03:50.090> so<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.150> could

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
that my hair is really long so you could

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.719 
that my hair is really long so you could
do<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.599> just<00:03:51.780> te<00:03:51.989> or<00:03:52.500> like<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.709> said<00:03:53.069> just<00:03:53.099> if<00:03:53.519> it

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729 
do it just te or like I said just if it

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:55.460 
do it just te or like I said just if it
if<00:03:53.939> you<00:03:54.030> find<00:03:54.239> it<00:03:54.329> easy<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.659> do<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.930> little<00:03:55.109> braid

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
if you find it easy to do a little braid

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.619 
if you find it easy to do a little braid
but<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.430> find<00:03:56.699> if<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.879> just<00:03:57.060> tuck<00:03:57.299> it<00:03:57.329> behind

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
but I find if you just tuck it behind

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.039 
but I find if you just tuck it behind
your<00:03:58.019> ear<00:03:58.729> it<00:03:59.729> makes<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.209> quite<00:04:00.479> well<00:04:00.689> hidden

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
your ear it makes it quite well hidden

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.979 
your ear it makes it quite well hidden
but<00:04:01.319> if<00:04:01.409> you've<00:04:01.560> got<00:04:01.739> like<00:04:01.919> a<00:04:01.949> shorter<00:04:02.459> fringe

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
but if you've got like a shorter fringe

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.860 
but if you've got like a shorter fringe
