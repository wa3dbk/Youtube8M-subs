to<00:01:06.780> support<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> panel<00:01:08.220> once<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.670> install<00:01:08.970> it

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
to support the panel once you install it

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.660 
to support the panel once you install it
social<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.840> how<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.080> works<00:01:10.400> when<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.520> hang

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
social you how that works when we hang

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.670 
social you how that works when we hang
the<00:01:11.790> panel<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> security<00:01:12.930> clip<00:01:13.500> in

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
the panel we have a security clip in

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.920 
the panel we have a security clip in
place<00:01:13.939> that<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.150> an<00:01:15.330> added<00:01:15.570> safety

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
place that is just an added safety

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.810 
place that is just an added safety
feature<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.710> helps<00:01:16.860> hold<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.280> panel<00:01:17.610> once

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
feature that helps hold the panel once

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.510 
feature that helps hold the panel once
its<00:01:18.030> position<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.799> way<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.040> kickstand

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
its position and the way that kickstand

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.640 
its position and the way that kickstand
works<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.000> for<00:01:21.180> me<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> pull<00:01:21.509> out<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> panel<00:01:22.080> so

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
works is for me to pull out the panel so

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.410 
works is for me to pull out the panel so
when<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> comes<00:01:23.100> time<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.369> plug<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.909> cables<00:01:24.330> on

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
when it comes time to plug in cables on

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.480 
when it comes time to plug in cables on
the<00:01:24.509> rear<00:01:24.659> side<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:25.650> holds<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.130> place<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the rear side it holds it in place I

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.859 
the rear side it holds it in place I
don't<00:01:26.670> need<00:01:26.759> an<00:01:26.850> extra<00:01:27.119> person<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.630> do<00:01:27.780> that

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.390 

for<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> larger<00:01:31.439> version<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.280> we

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
for the larger version this is what we

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.300 
for the larger version this is what we
call<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> LED<00:01:33.060> w<00:01:33.390> 120<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.590> all<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.100> same

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
call the LED w 120 so all the same

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.700 
call the LED w 120 so all the same
feature<00:01:35.790> sets<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.960> differences<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.560> add

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
feature sets and the differences we add

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.560 
feature sets and the differences we add
a<00:01:37.740> second<00:01:38.220> wall<00:01:38.369> bracket<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.420> these

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
a second wall bracket and one of these

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.450 
a second wall bracket and one of these
has<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> structural<00:01:40.619> installation<00:01:41.250> so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
has to be a structural installation so

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.819 
has to be a structural installation so
one<00:01:41.700> into<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> would<00:01:42.240> stutter<00:01:42.479> solid<00:01:42.930> wall<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
one into a would stutter solid wall the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.319 
one into a would stutter solid wall the
second<00:01:44.189> one<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.490> certainly<00:01:44.790> still<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.210> in

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
second one can certainly still go in

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.050 
second one can certainly still go in

drywall to optimize panel positioning
the<00:01:48.509> other<00:01:48.630> thing<00:01:48.869> we've<00:01:49.049> done<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.500> we've

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the other thing we've done is we've

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.010 
the other thing we've done is we've
added<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.430> second<00:01:50.850> cake<00:01:51.060> stand<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.840> that's

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
added a second cake stand and that's

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.860 
added a second cake stand and that's
just<00:01:52.140> for

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
just for

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.320 
just for
support<00:01:53.170> for<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.470> heavier<00:01:53.770> panels<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:55.180> when

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
support for the heavier panels so when

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.840 
support for the heavier panels so when
it's<00:01:55.480> on<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.690> wall<00:01:55.870> it's<00:01:56.410> good<00:01:57.190> and<00:01:57.220> stable<00:01:57.580> as

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
it's on the wall it's good and stable as

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.510 
it's on the wall it's good and stable as
you<00:01:57.940> plug<00:01:58.120> in<00:01:58.330> those<00:01:58.480> cables<00:01:59.010> both<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.220> mounts

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
you plug in those cables both the mounts

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.290 
you plug in those cables both the mounts
use<00:02:00.670> an<00:02:00.820> aluminum<00:02:01.270> extruded<00:02:02.400> cowling<00:02:03.400> for<00:02:04.210> the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
use an aluminum extruded cowling for the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.390 
use an aluminum extruded cowling for the
wall<00:02:04.480> brackets<00:02:04.930> and<00:02:05.140> that's<00:02:05.620> to<00:02:05.890> structurally

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
wall brackets and that's to structurally

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.490 
wall brackets and that's to structurally
support<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:06.880> panel<00:02:07.180> as<00:02:07.270> well<00:02:07.450> as<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:07.630> braided
