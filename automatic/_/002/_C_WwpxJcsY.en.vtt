return of serve he can sometimes return
well<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.930> bit<00:00:34.110> streaky<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.800> often

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
well but it's a bit streaky and often

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.310 
well but it's a bit streaky and often
he's<00:00:35.520> giving<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> lot<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.630> free<00:00:36.899> points

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
he's giving you a lot of free points

he's giving you a lot of free points
from<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.620> return<00:00:41.540> see<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> think<00:00:42.690> quite<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.469> few

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
from that return see I think quite a few

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.729 
from that return see I think quite a few
serves<00:00:44.239> to<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> forehand<00:00:45.870> side<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.440> Jamie

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
serves to the forehand side of Jamie

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.150 
serves to the forehand side of Jamie
Murray<00:00:46.950> that's<00:00:47.280> his<00:00:47.489> weaker<00:00:47.850> side<00:00:49.160> even

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
Murray that's his weaker side even

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.549 
Murray that's his weaker side even
off-speed<00:00:50.850> stuff<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.140> inside<00:00:52.469> he

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
off-speed stuff to that for inside he

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.590 
off-speed stuff to that for inside he
seems<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:52.980> pace<00:00:53.520> almost<00:00:54.000> more<00:00:54.239> than<00:00:54.270> an

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
seems to like pace almost more than an

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.709 
seems to like pace almost more than an
off-speed<00:00:55.020> search<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:58.590> therefore<00:00:59.420> Bob<00:01:00.420> Bryan

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
off-speed search and therefore Bob Bryan

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.170 
off-speed search and therefore Bob Bryan
to<00:01:00.989> off-speed<00:01:01.320> serves<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> row<00:01:02.100> 111<00:01:03.000> miles

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
to off-speed serves in a row 111 miles

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.740 
to off-speed serves in a row 111 miles
an<00:01:03.480> hour<00:01:03.629> he<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.140> serve<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.790> over<00:01:05.790> 130<00:01:06.420> when<00:01:06.659> he

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
an hour he can serve up over 130 when he

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.510 
an hour he can serve up over 130 when he
wants<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.229> think<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.770> strategy<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.430> this

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
wants to I think the strategy in this

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.740 
wants to I think the strategy in this
match<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> little<00:01:09.210> different<00:01:09.510> he's<00:01:09.630> not

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
match is a little different he's not

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.980 
match is a little different he's not
going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> go<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.170> straight<00:01:10.560> power<00:01:14.990> remember

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
going to go with straight power remember

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.340 
going to go with straight power remember
no<00:01:16.170> ad<00:01:16.409> scoring<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.330> doubles<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:18.960> well<00:01:19.140> as

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
no ad scoring in the doubles as well as

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.249 
no ad scoring in the doubles as well as
a<00:01:19.820> 10-point<00:01:20.820> match<00:01:21.119> tiebreaker<00:01:21.780> should<00:01:22.140> this

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
a 10-point match tiebreaker should this

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:31.940 
a 10-point match tiebreaker should this
go<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.590> third<00:01:22.799> set

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.830 

so<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.070> Bryant's<00:01:33.549> open<00:01:34.119> up<00:01:34.210> with<00:01:34.390> a<00:01:34.420> hold<00:01:34.689> of

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
so the Bryant's open up with a hold of

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.460 
so the Bryant's open up with a hold of
serve<00:01:36.659> interesting<00:01:37.659> always<00:01:37.869> to<00:01:37.990> see<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:38.200> player

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
serve interesting always to see a player

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.679 
serve interesting always to see a player

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.990 
for the first time in a final first time
even<00:01:41.020> in<00:01:41.110> a<00:01:41.200> semi-final<00:01:41.950> how<00:01:42.100> he<00:01:42.159> reacts<00:01:42.729> to

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
even in a semi-final how he reacts to

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.480 
even in a semi-final how he reacts to
the<00:01:43.119> pressure<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:44.680> know<00:01:44.799> that<00:01:45.009> Blake<00:01:45.220> will
