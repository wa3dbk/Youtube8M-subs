00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.240
 welcome together here 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.090
 me in the channel 83 meters and in this 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.129
 video I want to show you how bmw is 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.020
 it does not matter if this is like the z4 here 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:20.790
 35is or even 335 if a big one 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.530
 has exhaust system do you have the 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.320
 possibility here the rules of 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.050
 to change information flap control and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.270
 I'm a little bit this is this one 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.460
 here we see this bar down here 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.110
 And if I am here in the exhaust marein 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.039
 I hope that the camera that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.870
 can absorb well 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.630
 you see that the exhaust flap here 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.790
 from the right exhaust end pipe is open 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.070
 and of course that's a great sound 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.020
 but of course it will be direct 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.260
 prevented as soon as the engine started 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.489
 the flap will close and the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.540
 Can you stick with these little ones here 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.270
 to change 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.920
 it's here after the z4 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.610
 be installed right here now 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.890
 Here was this detail here 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.070
 and then this cover here 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.600
 in this position and I have 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.180
 solved that now only with so three 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.010
 plastic pegs attached here which triggers 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.479
 the best and most beautiful for the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.830
 plastic take here from the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.979
 Bordwerkzeug a screwdriver 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.280
 Schlitz takes on a bit of disguise 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.680
 or protect with a cloth here 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.970
 and then gently pry down then you can 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.119
 you pull out the parts 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.920
 as I said then here is the solve of 335 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.220
 we have to look there it should be in here 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.880
 sit around the area and this plug 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.939
 stop looking 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.970
 it is exactly this one sitting down there 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.930
 relatively hard to reach now and 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.520
 he has such a clue here 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.640
 if I catch easily now 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.810
 against brackets the clip can see 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.400
 In any case, you have this brace 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.200
 Press and then you can see the plug 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.310
 I'll pull that off and I'll do it that way 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.830
 said done 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.829
 this is the said plug that has stop 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.560
 here said this metal up here 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.159
 cuff and that must be pressed 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.890
 become 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.539
 you see the holder then widen and expand 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.849
 then you can the up and out 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.030
 pull and just let it hang around 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.110
 Of course there is one too 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.100
 remote control a word or a switch 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.050
 easy 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.930
 so with remote control you could do that 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.310
 make whole and yes there are both 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.350
 possibilities given 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.700
 now we have solved that and im 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.160
 Next time we have the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.890
 exhaust sound and accordingly 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.230
 stay tuned now quite so lively 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.480
 is running now we can hear sounds 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.800
 clearly class hand and sat camera 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.800
 here also gas 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.160
 That should be in any case 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.540
 represent differences and if we 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.200
 Now there's new items light up with 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.200
 the small flashlight 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.730
 then we see that shut up now 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.800
 really stays open and we can 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.080
 Now go and try the 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.080
 plug directly here again 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.010
 I am now with a hand on it 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.010
 get 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.690
 Well, I do not have that now because of that 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.010
 I could do it was so again 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.810
 a bit of frickel work as you can see 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.520
 can plug is now attached again 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.989
 and now I start the engine again 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.110
 and then you should also be able to see 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:36.700
 although in the pott verein films that 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.700
 the flap closes 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.450
 and could absolutely remember sound again 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.250
 happened here 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.560
 something completely different is much quieter 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.470
 quieter and if you come in here again 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.000
 to shine 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.160
 we now see that shut up 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.989
 So now has closed 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.049
 it just works that way you can do that 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.760
 and if the video helped you and 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.650
 liked thumbs up 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.480
 I am very happy to subscribe to the main channel 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.480
 83 video and until then
