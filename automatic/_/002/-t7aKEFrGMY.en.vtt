wavelength<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> really<00:01:22.979> good<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
wavelength and a really good of

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.190 
wavelength and a really good of
harassing<00:01:23.670> down<00:01:23.820> early<00:01:24.180> get<00:01:24.390> Brom<00:01:24.600> low<00:01:24.869> and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
harassing down early get Brom low and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.590 
harassing down early get Brom low and
once<00:01:25.830> Brom<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.280> low<00:01:26.490> HP<00:01:26.909> can't<00:01:27.270> really<00:01:27.479> be<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
once Brom is low HP can't really be a

once Brom is low HP can't really be a
playmaker<00:01:27.869> anymore<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:29.430> don't<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.570> any<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
playmaker anymore I don't think any of

bonus armor and magic resist it that's
the<00:01:42.810> kind<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.140> thing<00:01:43.320> riot<00:01:43.619> i<00:01:43.770> think<00:01:43.979> likes<00:01:44.250> to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the kind of thing riot i think likes to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.740 
the kind of thing riot i think likes to
lower<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.420> more<00:01:45.509> kind<00:01:45.689> of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
lower because it's more kind of

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.840 
lower because it's more kind of
invisible<00:01:46.110> power<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.979> put<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.729> know

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
invisible power you put it on you know

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.219 
invisible power you put it on you know
the<00:01:48.299> ad<00:01:48.420> carry<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.960> there's<00:01:49.079> suddenly

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the ad carry and there's suddenly

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.160 
the ad carry and there's suddenly
stronger<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.149> really<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.390> not<00:01:51.630> what<00:01:51.930> makes

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
stronger and really it's not what makes

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.899 
stronger and really it's not what makes
or<00:01:52.350> breaks<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.649> fight<00:01:52.860> typically<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.729> is

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
or breaks a fight typically like this is

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.990 
or breaks a fight typically like this is
if<00:01:54.210> anything<00:01:55.020> i<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.920> stand<00:01:56.250> behind<00:01:56.430> me<00:01:56.729> more

if anything i like stand behind me more

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.109 
if anything i like stand behind me more
for<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.509> sake<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.079> um<00:01:58.430> it<00:01:59.430> reaped<00:01:59.759> it's

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119

something<00:02:06.600> dumb<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.200> time<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.560> save<00:02:07.799> him

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
something dumb it's time to save him

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.460 
something dumb it's time to save him
kind<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.310> thing<00:02:08.629> the<00:02:09.629> fact<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.110> gives

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
kind of thing the fact that it gives

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.559 
kind of thing the fact that it gives
armor<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.489> magic<00:02:11.520> resist<00:02:11.849> has<00:02:12.120> almost<00:02:12.360> been

armor and magic resist has almost been

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.940 
armor and magic resist has almost been
kind<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.959> like<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.379> bonus

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
kind of like a bonus

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.280 
kind of like a bonus
up<00:02:14.160> until<00:02:14.489> this<00:02:14.670> point<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:15.180> me<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.840> don't

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
up until this point for me so I don't

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.750 
up until this point for me so I don't
think<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.590> huge<00:02:16.739> issue<00:02:16.980> if<00:02:17.340> anything<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
think it's a huge issue if anything the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.309 
think it's a huge issue if anything the
winters<00:02:18.060> bite<00:02:18.300> early<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:18.780> that's<00:02:19.140> the

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
winters bite early it's that's the

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.100 
winters bite early it's that's the
bigger<00:02:19.530> issue<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:20.250> as<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.970> can<00:02:21.090> see<00:02:21.360> by<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
bigger issue but as you can see by the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.440 
bigger issue but as you can see by the
time<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.590> leveled<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.010> up<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.220> rank<00:02:23.459> 3<00:02:23.849> usually

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
time you leveled it up to rank 3 usually

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.640 
time you leveled it up to rank 3 usually
when<00:02:24.629> you<00:02:24.750> know<00:02:24.870> you're<00:02:25.019> really<00:02:25.260> getting<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
when you know you're really getting the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.160 
when you know you're really getting the
face<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.069> enemy<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.400> fighting<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.760> lot<00:02:27.170> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
face the enemy and fighting a lot the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.360 
face the enemy and fighting a lot the
damage<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.620> base<00:02:28.890> damage<00:02:29.069> has<00:02:29.310> been

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
damage is the base damage has been

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.220 
damage is the base damage has been
lowered<00:02:29.640> by<00:02:29.819> 10<00:02:30.239> so<00:02:30.720> i<00:02:30.750> mean<00:02:30.930> that's<00:02:31.110> that's

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
lowered by 10 so i mean that's that's

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.949 
lowered by 10 so i mean that's that's
really<00:02:31.500> not<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.950> huge<00:02:32.250> issue<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:33.450> level<00:02:33.750> one

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
really not a huge issue the level one

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.990 
really not a huge issue the level one
engaged<00:02:34.349> obviously<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.830> bit<00:02:35.010> lower<00:02:35.190> 20<00:02:35.610> extra

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
engaged obviously a bit lower 20 extra

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.550 
engaged obviously a bit lower 20 extra
damage<00:02:36.180> at<00:02:36.420> level<00:02:36.630> one<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:37.019> it's<00:02:37.260> pretty

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
damage at level one is it's pretty

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.710 
damage at level one is it's pretty
decent<00:02:37.860> but<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.519> know<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:38.760> nothing<00:02:39.090> nothing

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
decent but you know it's nothing nothing

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.120 
decent but you know it's nothing nothing
