00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.549 
sounding yeah okay
the<00:00:38.790> easiest<00:00:39.180> key<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.629> would<00:00:39.690> say<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.050> do<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.440> in

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the easiest key I would say to do it in

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.600 
the easiest key I would say to do it in
is<00:00:40.890> e<00:00:42.469> so<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.500> starts<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:44.040> an<00:00:44.129> open<00:00:44.250> string

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
is e so I starts with an open string

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.430 
is e so I starts with an open string
open<00:00:47.610> E<00:00:47.700> string<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.950> then<00:00:50.329> F

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440

G sharp a V

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:09.190 
G sharp a V
see<00:01:02.980> D<00:01:06.370> and<00:01:07.370> then<00:01:07.580> here<00:01:07.760> you<00:01:07.880> get<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.960> back

see D and then here you get and back

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:21.520 
see D and then here you get and back
down<00:01:09.410> e<00:01:09.850> d<00:01:10.850> c<00:01:11.740> b<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:14.170> g<00:01:15.460> sharp<00:01:16.460> E<00:01:19.360> okay<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:21.320> it's<00:01:21.440> an

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
down e d c b a g sharp E okay so it's an

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.650 
down e d c b a g sharp E okay so it's an
open<00:01:21.800> string<00:01:22.070> first<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:23.140> new<00:01:24.140> string<00:01:24.410> open<00:01:24.740> open

that's<00:02:05.240> one<00:02:05.570> way<00:02:05.720> of<00:02:05.750> doing<00:02:05.960> it<00:02:06.110> um<00:02:06.409> I

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.630 

personally<00:02:10.429> don't<00:02:10.580> use<00:02:10.970> that<00:02:11.269> way<00:02:11.600> very<00:02:12.470> much

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
personally don't use that way very much

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.070 
personally don't use that way very much
the<00:02:13.640> other<00:02:13.760> way<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.940> doing<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.330> per<00:02:14.720> string

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
the other way of doing it is per string

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.470 
the other way of doing it is per string
that's<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.650> really<00:02:15.890> easy<00:02:16.340> kind<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.850> fun<00:02:17.090> way

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
that's the really easy kind of fun way

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.720 
that's the really easy kind of fun way
of<00:02:17.510> remembering<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.380> if<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.670> then

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
of remembering it if you just and then

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.460 
of remembering it if you just and then
you<00:02:19.910> can<00:02:20.030> transfer<00:02:20.239> it<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.750> course<00:02:20.959> onto<00:02:21.350> the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
you can transfer it of course onto the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.050 
you can transfer it of course onto the
other<00:02:21.620> string<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.010> that's<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.640> really<00:02:22.790> easy<00:02:22.880> way

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
other string so that's a really easy way

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.660 
other string so that's a really easy way
of<00:02:23.269> remembering<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:24.590> scale<00:02:25.100> because<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.400> lot

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
of remembering the scale because a lot

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:34.030 
of remembering the scale because a lot
of<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:27.230> Spanish<00:02:27.680> sounding<00:02:28.340> stuff<00:02:29.739> is<00:02:31.209> in<00:02:32.209> E<00:02:33.040> or

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
of the Spanish sounding stuff is in E or

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.000 
of the Spanish sounding stuff is in E or
it<00:02:34.250> is<00:02:34.370> quite<00:02:34.580> easy<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.820> write<00:02:36.010> Spanish

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
it is quite easy to write Spanish

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.910 
it is quite easy to write Spanish
sounding<00:02:37.519> stuff<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:37.880> E<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:38.690> if<00:02:38.780> we<00:02:38.959> show<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.680> it

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
sounding stuff in E so if we show you it

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.340 
sounding stuff in E so if we show you it
on<00:02:40.100> one<00:02:40.970> string<00:02:41.330> plan<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.019> can<00:02:42.140> easily

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
on one string plan you can easily

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.470 
on one string plan you can easily
transfer<00:02:42.799> that<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.610> other<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:44.269> other

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
transfer that to the other the other

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.479 
transfer that to the other the other
three<00:02:44.720> strings<00:02:45.049> so<00:02:46.040> I'll<00:02:46.100> do<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.280> on<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.430> E

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
three strings so I'll do it on the E

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.180 
three strings so I'll do it on the E
string<00:02:46.580> again

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
string again

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.570 
string again
and<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.510> basically<00:02:49.720> I'll<00:02:50.530> do<00:02:50.740> it<00:02:50.890> with<00:02:51.340> notes

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
and so basically I'll do it with notes

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.860 
and so basically I'll do it with notes
on<00:02:51.730> top<00:02:52.000> okay<00:02:53.850> so<00:02:54.850> they<00:02:54.970> open<00:02:55.270> open<00:02:55.720> E<00:02:55.840> string

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
on top okay so they open open E string

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.210 
on top okay so they open open E string
and<00:02:56.350> then<00:02:56.530> we've<00:02:56.710> got<00:02:56.970> F<00:02:57.970> 1st<00:02:59.220> fret<00:03:01.950> G<00:03:02.950> shop

got<00:03:20.250> D<00:03:21.280> tenth<00:03:22.120> fret<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:24.550> then<00:03:24.700> he<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.570> you

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.900 
got D tenth fret and then he and you
could<00:03:25.930> always<00:03:26.050> go<00:03:26.320> up<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.740> the<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:27.670> flat

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
could always go up to the to the flat

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.740 
could always go up to the to the flat
nine<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:30.760> can<00:03:30.880> use<00:03:30.970> something<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.360> bit<00:03:31.510> like

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
nine so you can use something a bit like

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.070 
nine so you can use something a bit like
this

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
this

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.280

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
of lifted the idea of it that's a really

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:59.270 
of lifted the idea of it that's a really
easy<00:03:46.210> thing<00:03:46.720> that<00:03:47.080> uses<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.880> Spanish<00:03:48.880> scale

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280

it's<00:04:00.280> something<00:04:00.579> along<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.849> lines<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.090> that

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
it's something along the lines of that

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.420 
it's something along the lines of that
but<00:04:02.349> that<00:04:02.469> kind<00:04:02.650> of<00:04:02.680> here<00:04:02.980> I'll<00:04:03.129> play<00:04:03.280> that

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
but that kind of here I'll play that

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:15.580

so<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:16.709> kind<00:04:16.920> of<00:04:16.980> thing<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.370> then<00:04:17.459> of<00:04:17.549> course

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
so that kind of thing and then of course

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.910 
so that kind of thing and then of course
you<00:04:17.820> can<00:04:17.940> move<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:19.170> scale<00:04:19.440> up<00:04:19.680> again

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
you can move that of the scale up again

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:30.890 
you can move that of the scale up again
onto<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.459> string<00:04:29.570> that's<00:04:30.570> a<00:04:30.690> really<00:04:30.870> easy

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
onto the a string that's a really easy

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.990 
onto the a string that's a really easy
way<00:04:31.260> of<00:04:31.410> remembering<00:04:31.620> that<00:04:31.860> scale<00:04:33.860> yeah

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000

open 2nd 3 fingers okay okay it's fairly

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.640 
open 2nd 3 fingers okay okay it's fairly
straightforward<00:07:30.960> I'm<00:07:31.730> the<00:07:32.730> same<00:07:32.970> with<00:07:33.090> all<00:07:33.840> of

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:34.650 
straightforward I'm the same with all of

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.530 
straightforward I'm the same with all of
the<00:07:34.800> scale<00:07:35.010> patterns<00:07:35.400> if<00:07:35.850> you<00:07:36.210> learn<00:07:36.360> that

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:36.540 
the scale patterns if you learn that

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.620 
the scale patterns if you learn that
pattern<00:07:36.930> or<00:07:37.110> that<00:07:37.290> shape<00:07:38.090> you<00:07:39.090> can<00:07:39.270> move<00:07:39.420> that

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:39.630 
pattern or that shape you can move that

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:46.100 
pattern or that shape you can move that
around<00:07:40.910> the<00:07:41.910> strings<00:07:44.240> but<00:07:45.240> I<00:07:45.450> would<00:07:45.960> suggest

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.110 
around the strings but I would suggest

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.720 
around the strings but I would suggest
for<00:07:46.530> now<00:07:46.820> stick<00:07:47.820> with<00:07:47.850> the<00:07:48.390> one<00:07:48.720> string

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:49.730 
for now stick with the one string

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.710 
for now stick with the one string
exercise<00:07:50.730> that<00:07:50.910> I've<00:07:51.000> shown<00:07:51.180> you<00:07:51.210> and<00:07:51.570> then

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 
exercise that I've shown you and then

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.270 
exercise that I've shown you and then
the<00:07:52.550> string<00:07:53.550> crossing<00:07:54.030> exercise<00:07:54.560> and<00:07:55.560> I<00:07:55.890> could

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 
the string crossing exercise and I could

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.120 
the string crossing exercise and I could
show<00:07:56.430> you<00:07:56.490> another<00:07:56.760> one<00:07:57.000> in<00:07:57.180> another<00:07:57.510> video

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:58.130 
show you another one in another video

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.130 
show you another one in another video
okay
