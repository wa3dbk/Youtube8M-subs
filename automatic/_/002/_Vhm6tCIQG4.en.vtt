00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.440 
and when I was younger for long for many
many<00:03:37.650> years<00:03:37.740> I<00:03:38.250> wouldn't<00:03:38.940> go<00:03:39.000> out<00:03:39.030> in<00:03:39.300> public

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
many years I wouldn't go out in public

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.970 
many years I wouldn't go out in public
wearing<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.990> tank<00:03:40.230> top<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.440> showed<00:03:40.800> my

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
wearing a tank top that showed my

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.250 
wearing a tank top that showed my
shoulders<00:03:41.400> or<00:03:41.940> my<00:03:42.180> chest<00:03:42.450> right<00:03:42.720> here<00:03:42.750> to

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
shoulders or my chest right here to

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.750 
shoulders or my chest right here to
where<00:03:43.380> it's<00:03:43.590> really<00:03:43.830> small<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.400> wouldn't<00:03:44.700> do

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
where it's really small I wouldn't do

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.730 
where it's really small I wouldn't do
that<00:03:44.790> because<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.540> was<00:03:45.990> really<00:03:46.260> self-conscious

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
that because I was really self-conscious

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.430 
that because I was really self-conscious
and<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:48.030> thought<00:03:48.330> people<00:03:48.720> already<00:03:48.990> gonna<00:03:49.230> be

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
and I thought people already gonna be

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.900 
and I thought people already gonna be
staring<00:03:49.650> at<00:03:49.890> me<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.250> shouldn't<00:03:50.640> give<00:03:50.760> them

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
staring at me so I shouldn't give them

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.660 
staring at me so I shouldn't give them
more<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.330> like<00:03:51.510> look<00:03:52.350> at<00:03:52.590> on<00:03:52.770> my<00:03:52.950> body<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.580> I

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
more to like look at on my body and I

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.160 
more to like look at on my body and I
just<00:03:53.700> kind<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.180> felt<00:03:54.360> like<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.570> needed<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.870> hide

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
just kind of felt like I needed to hide

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.860 
just kind of felt like I needed to hide
like<00:03:55.320> this<00:03:55.380> but<00:03:55.920> over<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.940> years<00:03:57.240> I<00:03:57.510> realized

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
like this but over the years I realized

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.080 
like this but over the years I realized
