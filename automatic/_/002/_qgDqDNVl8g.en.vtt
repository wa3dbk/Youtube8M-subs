00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.700
 freddy cÃ³rdova father of a student in 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.890
 competition told us what 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.120
 represents the festival of truncheons for 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.790
 normal community 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.030
 importance of these activities first 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.239
 because of the need for the integration of 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.349
 the students second by the 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.980
 involvement of parents 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.610
 that is to say the union between 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.170
 and educational institutions and the family 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.379
 around some students and a 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.290
 activity like this so important that 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.440
 of integration not only of them 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.430
 but of a whole community that 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.069
 we represent the parents of 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.670
 family in association with the institution and 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.069
 and the children that's why I think it's 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.470
 supremely important that they be followed 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.620
 doing these activities 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:16.420
 that integrate the family that we 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.970
 allow us to meet in a community to 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.799
 express not only the love that 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.660
 we have the children but also the 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:30.100

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:32.410
