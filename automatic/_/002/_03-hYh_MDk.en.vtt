one of our challenges walk through six

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.640 
one of our challenges walk through six
different<00:04:05.010> solutions<00:04:05.520> oh<00:04:05.760> wait<00:04:06.600> oh<00:04:06.900> there's

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
different solutions oh wait oh there's

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.230 
different solutions oh wait oh there's
six<00:04:07.770> places<00:04:08.070> why'd<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.430> go<00:04:08.640> out<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:08.910> get<00:04:09.060> the
