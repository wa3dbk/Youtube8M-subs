 saints we have here involved in the 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:40.780
 project the approximately 30 people between

 part of the fashion module 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.150
 I'm just a student of photography 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.790
 the course of the European center of saints and 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.030
 meetings it was decided that I would be 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.340
 the executive producer and each 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.160
 a task defined both for costumes 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.600
 production accountant 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.970
 7 and it was a really cool experience 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.869
 adding enough in the course in the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.150
 learning process and is valid even 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.310
 you deal with things that run away a little 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.080
 of the photograph but that in the end 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.800
 important the final result of the 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.800
 photography 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.010
 My name is the one I 'm here as 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.770
 today's model for core students 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.780
 Europe, enjoying much the experience already 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.729
 had made a notebook with him would 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.190
 very cool this exchange without us 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.890
 also learns a lot while he also 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.610
 It's being super super useful for 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.610
 I really like myself 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.630
 my name is Leticia 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.280
 I'm a photography student and today I'm 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.050
 people are doing a fashion editorial 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.230
 here at mount serrat 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.650
 is being a very great learning 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.680
 because in theory everything is very easy in 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.720
 practice time we see that it is well 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.690
 more complicated than most people think 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.860
 It's worth it and I 'm just leaving. 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.920
 cool and the result will be well 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.920
 cool 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.850
 in the arena the teacher of the 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.350
 photography of the European center and 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.860
 is administering a practical class today 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.170
 of the students' fashion essay is the theme 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.910
 that was developed was tropicalismo 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.610
 they are today is on the mountain serrat 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.230
 today is doing external photos in 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.280
 internal environment 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.310
 I think it was a very 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.870
 interesting for them because in a 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.640
 develops only the aspect of the photo he has 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.710
 worked for almost one 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.840
 week with meetings for the 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.900
 production running behind costumes 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.850
 running behind sponsorship support and 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.280
 also developing the difficulties 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.710
 the picture shows is question is a 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.690
 location that is far away people are high 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.180
 of a hill and I think they are 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.220
 developing very well they entered in 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.239
 of an abandoned house asking 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.680
 shall be subject to contingencies in 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.500
 possibilities are rehearsing models 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.690
 of some other conferences comments 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.430
 experience working with others 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.650
 professional hair and make up was the 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.570
 first time too then it was kind of 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.520
 a shot in the dark I think the 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.760
 participation of all of them do much 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.530
 positive is the help that the school 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.390
 also as support is being very 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.940
 positive and I think that learning 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.430
 building is also being very good 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.690
 is a very valid experience and I think 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.590
 which is very nice you will check the 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.590
 result is thing
