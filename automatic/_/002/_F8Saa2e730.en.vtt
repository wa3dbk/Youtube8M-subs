this review the sleep of death issue

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.910 
this review the sleep of death issue
occurred<00:00:44.879> which<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.360> when<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.289> device<00:00:46.559> for

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
occurred which is when the device for

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.029 
occurred which is when the device for
some<00:00:47.070> reason<00:00:47.460> puts<00:00:48.180> itself<00:00:48.480> into<00:00:49.200> suspend<00:00:49.680> or

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
some reason puts itself into suspend or

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.939 
some reason puts itself into suspend or
it<00:00:50.340> turns<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> screen<00:00:50.850> off<00:00:51.239> or<00:00:51.570> if<00:00:52.530> even<00:00:52.860> if

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
it turns the screen off or if even if

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.650 
it turns the screen off or if even if
you<00:00:53.039> hit<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:53.789> doesn't<00:00:54.360> wake<00:00:54.480> back

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you hit it and it just doesn't wake back

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.529 
you hit it and it just doesn't wake back
up<00:00:55.070> I<00:00:56.070> noticed<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.180> was<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.840> way<00:00:57.870> down<00:00:58.289> to

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
up I noticed it was all the way down to

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.569 
up I noticed it was all the way down to
fifteen<00:01:00.539> percent<00:01:00.899> life<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.250> might<00:01:02.399> have

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
fifteen percent life so it might have

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.690 
fifteen percent life so it might have
something<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.000> do<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.570> built-in<00:01:04.700> power

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
something to do with the built-in power

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.210 
something to do with the built-in power
saver<00:01:06.119> software<00:01:06.710> that<00:01:07.710> might<00:01:07.890> come<00:01:08.070> with

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
saver software that might come with

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.880 
saver software that might come with
cyanogenmod<00:01:08.820> 7.2<00:01:09.510> because<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.530> noticed<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.860> was

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
cyanogenmod 7.2 because I noticed it was

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.710 
cyanogenmod 7.2 because I noticed it was
exactly<00:01:11.460> at<00:01:11.640> 15<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> don't<00:01:12.479> know<00:01:12.540> that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
exactly at 15 but I don't know that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.399 
exactly at 15 but I don't know that
might<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.140> been<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.290> coincidence

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
might have just been a coincidence

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.219 
might have just been a coincidence
because<00:01:13.710> sometimes<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.220> runs<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:15.229> completely

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
because sometimes it runs out completely

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.380 
because sometimes it runs out completely
without<00:01:16.470> power<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:17.820> still<00:01:17.970> having<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
without power so it's still having the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.810 
without power so it's still having the
sleep<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.990> death<00:01:19.170> issue<00:01:19.409> unfortunately<00:01:20.400> I

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
sleep of death issue unfortunately I

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.580 
sleep of death issue unfortunately I
haven't<00:01:21.360> had<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> problem<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.140> about<00:01:22.350> two

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
haven't had the problem in about two

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.130 
haven't had the problem in about two
weeks<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> pretty<00:01:24.420> pretty<00:01:24.960> big

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
weeks so this is a pretty pretty big

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.950 
weeks so this is a pretty pretty big

devices people making these things

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.560 
devices people making these things

there<00:05:28.840> is<00:05:28.960> a<00:05:28.990> little<00:05:29.290> bit<00:05:29.530> of<00:05:29.620> lag<00:05:30.300> average

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
there is a little bit of lag average

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.700 
there is a little bit of lag average
people<00:05:31.600> probably<00:05:31.780> notice<00:05:32.260> it<00:05:32.380> playing<00:05:32.620> this

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710

generation ship when it comes to this
stuff<00:05:39.460> I<00:05:39.820> think<00:05:40.090> it's<00:05:40.210> pretty<00:05:40.570> damn<00:05:40.840> good

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
stuff I think it's pretty damn good

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.010 
stuff I think it's pretty damn good
because<00:05:42.370> this<00:05:43.060> is<00:05:43.210> not<00:05:43.390> what<00:05:43.540> the<00:05:43.630> device<00:05:43.870> was

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
because this is not what the device was

color<00:05:55.630> was<00:05:55.780> able<00:05:55.990> to<00:05:56.080> run<00:05:56.310> but<00:05:57.310> this<00:05:57.430> is<00:05:57.610> really

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
color was able to run but this is really

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.520 
color was able to run but this is really
going<00:05:58.090> above<00:05:58.330> and<00:05:58.390> beyond<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:58.960> just<00:05:59.380> so<00:05:59.440> you

going above and beyond and just so you

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.480

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
never really got the stability that I

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.690 
never really got the stability that I
was<00:06:13.570> really<00:06:13.750> looking<00:06:13.870> for<00:06:14.230> so<00:06:14.920> I<00:06:15.190> basically

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
was really looking for so I basically

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.850 
was really looking for so I basically
took<00:06:16.120> that<00:06:16.300> off<00:06:16.450> in<00:06:17.290> fact<00:06:17.470> every<00:06:17.680> time<00:06:17.830> I

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
took that off in fact every time I

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.530 
took that off in fact every time I
overclocked<00:06:18.340> a<00:06:18.670> YouTube<00:06:19.060> actually<00:06:19.390> ran

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 
overclocked a YouTube actually ran

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.010 
overclocked a YouTube actually ran
slower<00:06:20.130> net<00:06:21.130> for<00:06:21.340> transfer<00:06:21.760> so<00:06:22.150> obviously

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
slower net for transfer so obviously

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.290 
slower net for transfer so obviously
something<00:06:23.440> is<00:06:23.530> wrong<00:06:23.770> with<00:06:23.800> the<00:06:23.920> settings

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
something is wrong with the settings

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.800 
something is wrong with the settings
which<00:06:25.300> was<00:06:25.480> probably<00:06:25.660> a<00:06:25.810> Mayan<00:06:26.140> but<00:06:26.640> however

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
which was probably a Mayan but however

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.210 
which was probably a Mayan but however
so<00:06:28.810> there<00:06:29.290> you<00:06:29.410> have<00:06:29.440> it<00:06:29.620> right<00:06:29.830> there<00:06:30.040> it's

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
so there you have it right there it's

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.620 
so there you have it right there it's
actually<00:06:30.490> running<00:06:30.670> pretty<00:06:30.970> decently<00:06:31.390> and

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
actually running pretty decently and

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.290
