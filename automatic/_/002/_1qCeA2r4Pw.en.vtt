 FABULOUS CZECH BOYS CHOIR (Great Czech Boys Choir) 

00:02:36.085 --> 00:02:41.840
 They are absolutely fantastic. I'm from Hungary, so it's very touching for me. 

00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:45.840
 We have a lot in common, only the language is different. 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:56.440
 Their discipline is phenomenal. This discipline is truly seen at their concert. I love them! 

00:03:30.257 --> 00:03:37.900
 My name is Zimfira Poloz and I'm the Artistic Director of Hamilton Children's Choir. I really enjoyed the concert. 

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:46.980
 And I know how difficult it is, because the boys have come from such a distance, they have a time shift, yet it was wonderful every minute. 

00:03:46.975 --> 00:03:55.170
 Thank you very much, thank you all your parents for letting us go on a journey and sharing this music gift with us in Canada. 

00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:21.430
 Hi, I'd like to welcome the Czech Boys Choir at the Great Apple in Colbourne, Ontario, Canada. 

00:04:35.598 --> 00:04:45.300
 It is rare for us in Canada to hear such a great choir, a unique sound especially of young boys 

00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:52.060
 and we heard the repertoire we don't have here in Canada, so thank you for coming. 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Hi, my name is Julie, I'm a guide in the Canadian Parliament. I would like to welcome the famous Czech Boys Choir in the main hall of this building.
