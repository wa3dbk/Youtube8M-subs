00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.899
 Germany vs Japan World Cup Ninth July 2011 lower you strangely know them 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:08.599
 outet the strange Kenzie my luck 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.530
 three to one for Germany the second quarterfinals of the World Cup 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:17.360
 brings us the duel between the current master and host 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.769
 Germany and Japan 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.189
 who played great until the last group match 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.519
 interesting is that these two national teams also at the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.170
 last and penultimate World Cup have met each other just like 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.140
 at the last Olympics 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.570
 Every time the Germans have celebrated a victory and the Japanese have in 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.570
 not even scored a match for these three duels 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.690
 Ninth July 2011 to 20 clock 45 Germany had only in the third 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.240
 Round of the group phase showed up around the German team as the largest 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.730
 Favorite on the title applies 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.250
 it's interesting that they first started playing well 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.070
 Dreamer Silvia Neid has become clear that she has something on the grid 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.000
 or that the best German player Brigit Prinz 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.190
 Heat is not enough for this championship 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.150
 In the first two games she was very stressed though every time 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.990
 was replaced because she simply did not do anything 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.270
 At the same time the awesome Inka Grings sat on the spare bench 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.750
 he had to be content in the second half 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.820
 to become 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.170
 Germany had it unexpectedly difficult in the first two games 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.490
 but then they won every time 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.070
 it was not the best Germany against France either, but it is 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.310
 noticeably better 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.140
 Envy has made many changes in this encounter 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.030
 Grings has played instead of Prinz from the first minute and that has changed 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.010
 also shown as the absolute direct hit 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.010
 because this player scored twice 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.130
 since Pieringer was injured also Bajramaj from the first minute 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.420
 played what also proved to be the right one 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.599
 Now at least it is clear that you also win the urn the best player 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.459
 can and thus this time Prince will remain on the substitute bench 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:22.289
 it was great to have replaced Beira Mar, she probably will 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:27.979
 be back from the beginning while Bresonik and Kulig have recovered and 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:29.939
 certainly play 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.499
 if you still know the Garefrekes and grateful finally the right one 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:39.189
 Have found the form of the game then one can assume that would be the best Germany 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.319
 have not seen 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.679

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:47.850
 Bresonik Krahnen Bartusiak Peter 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.340
 according to Kulig 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.260
 Garefrekes then party at her stomach 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.199

 award-winning bookmaker unlike Germany, Japan has the 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.009
 Championship with a good game and a narrow victory against New Zealand 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:09.659
 started 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.249
 They have Mexico with a great party and a four to zero victory 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:15.329
 gone ahead 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.129
 but then with a bad idea the defeat of England 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.229
 cashed 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:23.879
 In this game absolutely all Japanese women have failed 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:28.079
 it's hard to guess why they've let up so much 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.079
 especially when you know that all key players are against England 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.099
 been there 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.799
 The team once again failed completely and it was hard to 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:39.719
 expect 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.379
 that the others can do something with players 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.180
 Luckily, this defeat did not make it to the quarter-finals 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.879
 endangered but get the Japanese women with their old 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.079
 Germany to do now 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.409
 They absolutely wanted to avoid the German team 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:03.149
 Coach Sasaki could have rested a few players, but he did 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:07.899
 did not do it because he needed at least one point to Germany 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:09.399
 dodge 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:13.249
 It seems as if the German team is talking about their fate at the 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:15.939
 decides big competitions 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.359
 is so is this time even though the Japanese hope that they are 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.360
 bad tradition finally can finish 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.169
 if you play similar to those against Mexico then you can legitimately 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.469
 to hope 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:33.879
 but if they play against England they are sure of a new debacle 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.349
 the team will definitely not change since it is not time for 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.439
 Changes and experiments is 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.020
 expected installation Japan

 Clean even Ayse meets Kumagai Sameshima 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.870
 this was Sakaguchi Union Miyama Angelo Nagasato 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.590
 the Germans obviously have all the bad in the first two 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.949
 Shown encounters and now they have found the right path in which they are in 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.879
 Could lead to the direction of the third title 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:10.099
 the new starting grid has been crystallized one has seen 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.180
 that they get along without Brigit Prinz and that's why they are now 

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:15.830
 very dangerous 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.180
 The Japanese have stumbled at the ECJ's first more serious opponent 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.819
 this is also the tradition on the side of the German team 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.430
 if you still consider the home advantage then you can on one 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.070
 Speculate higher victory of the German ladies
