00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.960
 how would you like to add a little magic 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.670
 to your personalized printing business 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.130
 turn the everyday into extraordinary 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.180
 a difficult project in a source of 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.480
 Benefits 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.210
 something normal in something personal 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.039
 once you know the secret actually 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.570
 it's very simple some call it magic 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.730
 we call it the excellent 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.780
 printing technology I saw that 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.730
 incorporates the new one to see health and the 20 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.699
 the cabbage I saw presents a combination 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.250
 Exclusive dry rain ink advanced 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.350
 with a safety and low led lamp 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.030
 heat emission and thanks to which 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.100
 it can be printed on practically 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.530
 Any material up to 10 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.840
 centimeters thick with an excellent 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.079
 print quality can be printed 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.980
 directly on acrylic materials 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.020
 wood 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.339
 charlton 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.460
 canvas 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.170
 plastic 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:15.200
 metal and even on soft materials 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.300
 Like leather and cloth, ink can be added 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.010
 white as the base color or 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.750
 increase the passes so that 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.479
 colors stand out on materials 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.300
 dark or transparent ink 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.540
 colubi varnishes adds a remarkable and 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.620
 special intensity to 3d textures and 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.500
 to custom embossed effects 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.200
 and the best thing of all is that the cabbage juve 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.630
 allows you to print a single object or 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.580
 make a short run without need 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.010
 of performing costly and prolonged 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.290
 configurations with the presentation of 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.270
 our new model less 20 we have 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.240
 innovated even more our award-winning 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.850
 first to be technology to offer some 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.580
 remarkable improvements first of all we have 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.400
 expanded the size of the table now the 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.800
 Printing area reaches up to 50 x 33 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.630
 centimeters this in addition to allow 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.840
 print directly on objects of 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.060
 larger size 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.280
 It also increases productivity when 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.890
 is printed on small objects like 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.280
 golf balls pens and covers for 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.230
 second mobile we have employed 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.480
 The most advanced technology for 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.910
 redefine the design of the hub lamp and 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.819
 the ink tubes and the system 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.040
 extraction of vapors and the lec 20 is 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.650
 fully compatible with materials 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.870
 magnetic can also be created up to 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.299
 20 different presets with the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.099
 configuration of law 20 with what 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.840
 will save valuable time in the 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.849
 different jobs you do with 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.680
 most often defects 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.690
 achieved with the varnish ink of the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.209
 rain cabbage have always been 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.920
 impressive but some users we 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.709
 had commented that I wish they were a 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.900
 little faster so that law 20 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.579
 presents a new mobile design of the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.190
 rain lamp that doubles the speed 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.980
 of printing both the varnish ink 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.230
 as of the acm and here all these changes 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.700
 they make the lec 20 faster 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.129
 reliable and safe 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.160
 the results are so incredible that 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.290
 your customers will think it's magic and that 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.799
 it's okay your secret is safe with 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.799
