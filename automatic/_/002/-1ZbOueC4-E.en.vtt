 be pulling out these podcasts and record me 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.080
 where I can and reach where I can 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.460
 is that the important thing about all this is that 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.020
 go feeding yourself with information 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.730
 so that he lives a life of higher quality 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.440
 remember that life what we want 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.090
 is to maintain good results in the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.239
 seven areas of balance remember 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.700
 economic intellectual aesthetic physics the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.320
 familiar the couple and the spiritual 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.210
 we need to maintain a balance in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.380
 these seven areas because this is the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.329
 only way we can follow 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.250
 growing and evolving as beings 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.809
 humans remember I do not care how old 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.579
 it has no matter what it does most 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.399
 important life is saying 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.469
 you be happy and little support little by little 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.320
 go grow and evolve look 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.390
 now let's talk about him the power of 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.340
 mental focus and I do not know if I do that for 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.690
 all this one podcast and if we do not 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.550
 let's go to the next 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.680
 but most importantly we started with the 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.600
 mental approach all life has to 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.370
 see what we are focusing on 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.990
 example is the lens of this camera is 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.550
 is focusing fear and is itself and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.710
 in what the camera is feeling 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.570
 our eyes are being like a 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.850
 camera that is focusing if we 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.440
 we see that there are problems or when we see 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.900
 an accident for example and kill one 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.090
 something rather drastic person what 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.740
 we are repeating it says 16 times 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.330
 after we experience it in 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.400
 our mind so is that the focus 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.720
 mental is still very important for 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.580
 achieve the results we want 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.200
 have to see the approach 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.270
 mental much more than what you 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.010
 imagine you think about this also by 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.840
 an instant I want you to make a 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.940
 exercise together with me if for a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.550
 instantly I want you to close your eyes and 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.560
 close your eyes and imagine everything 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.820
 I 'm going to tell you, let's do the accounts 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.240
 close your eyes for an instant do not 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.979
 nothing happens 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.650
 let go, come on, come, come 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.910
 with me what the eyes did 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.480
 we close our eyes and imagine that 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.020
 we're 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.330
 in our house in the kitchen now we go 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.550
 to the refrigerator and we get from where 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.520
 we keep the vegetables to a size a 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.020
 lemon of a spectacular size then 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.030
 we proceed to take it where we have the 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.890
 knives we take out one of our 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.260
 bigger knives and we started to 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.960
 split the lemon so that the leaf 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.630
 sharp metal begins to break the 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.130
 citrus peel we begin to perceive 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.230
 the smell of lemon where it starts 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.510
 cut the way we started to 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.210
 cut it and start slicing and split 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.750
 half is sharp knife blade 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.850
 begins to break the gallitos de 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.580
 lemon starts to come out a juice a game 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.750
 pretty acid we keep cutting 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.190
 until we get to the part of 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.410
 down and we've cut half of the lemon 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.910
 well now we take with the left hand 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.410
 in the middle of the lemon we let go of the 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.300
 right hand of the knife and we take a 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.490
 salt shaker we put a little salt to the 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.150
 lemon and now we open our mouths and we 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.850
 We take half a lemon to the mouth open 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.760
 the mouth big and leonard rich and tasty 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.100
 bitten the lemon at this moment the 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.360
 citrus juice that is on your palate 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.610
 down the tongue on your lips 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.970
 your salivary glands are ending 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.670
 and you're making my mouth water 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.700
 open your eyes here is the language the mouth 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.710
 raise your hand to many because 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.000
 we thought it was a truth remember that 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.260
 the mind is conscious it does not know the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.510
 difference between reality and 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.340
 fantasy why when we dream we can 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.680
 do anything we can even fly 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.030
 then fly in the night lift the 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.560
 true that good there is light of the night 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.540
 because also good what do you mean 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.430
 that the subconscious mind does not 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.230
 can only do anything and 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.620
 is able to create anything but 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.440
 It is also modulating each gland of the 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.530
 brain every organ of our body the 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.320
 blood pressure the skin the eyes the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.330
 Look at the saliva absolutely everything 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.160
 controls and as well as active your glands 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.130
 salivary towards here goes suddenly the 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.320
 pineal gland which is the gland of the 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.400
 visualization the pituitary gland that 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.470
 that is the one in charge of the 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.239
 body temperature to secrete a 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.370
 substance that is called endorphin and 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.440
 all this is why the mental focus is 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.060
 very powerful in his human behavior 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.220
 in your results and right now it's going to 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.720
 take the mental focus through a process 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.989
 listen to me well produce 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.880
 number 2 in a state of mind a state 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.470
 mental as the most quoted of all 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.770
 called happiness there is another peace of mind 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.870
 harmony joy all these states 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.430
 mental as well as depression anguish 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.620
 sadness loneliness 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.680
 all this is also produced by the 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.260
 mental that is the mind produces a state 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.450
 mental states are born from the 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.840
 then you get off in this area here 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.270
 to remember first is a thought 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.390
 and it becomes a feeling 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:56.270
 thought feeling neuron hormone 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.950
 neuron hormone everything starts with the 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.020
 mind if you want to be a cheerful person 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.150
 happy energetic constant all that 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.410
 talk walk, drive like the person 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.820
 what I would like to be until it is 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.010
 because they started pretending and we ended up 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.600
 that believing the mental focus we 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.900
 produces a state of mind the state 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.860
 mental causes us an emotional state 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.870
 champions it is very important that they know 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.630
 this all started with the mental focus 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.820
 we produce it mental state call it 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.610
 happiness joy or excitement 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.129
 call him depression remember we have 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.429
 The free will 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:29.559
 we choose what kind of emotional state 

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:31.959
 we want based on the mental state that 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:34.419
 we provoke with the approach that we are 

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:36.219
 giving life and things nothing is 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.319
 truth nothing is a lie everything depends on 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.999
 through the glass in which you look up 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:40.959
 Now we have talked about how to control 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.099
 mental focus 

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:43.899
 get up one morning and the first thing that 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:46.239
 you have to say is that I feel good 

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:47.769
 although you do not feel but the approach 

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:49.389
 mental will produce a mental state the 

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:51.219
 mental state bay causes a state 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.080
 emotional and when you get emotional and you 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.869
 enthusiasts you're usually happier 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.119

 we humans are not any 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:16.029
 improvised people god did not make us 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:18.669
 in series he made us seriously able to 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:21.669
 correct our life able to restart 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.979
 as reboot system as when 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:25.360
 we restart the computer so we can 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.209
 do it gently and I do not care if 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.460
 you are 15 or 65 years old and you are a man or 

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:32.590
 woman if she has or does not have school 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.789
 If you have money or just went through 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.680
 a divorce the death of a loved one 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:37.900
 nothing matters the most important thing is that 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.120
 that approach that the present is how it's going to 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.590
 build your future and the future is going to 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.180
 build with the mental focus that we 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.789
 mental state leads to the state 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.440
 emotional but this produces something more than 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:49.389
 it has to do with your body that's why 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.729
