00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.910
 Next ask my current more accurate 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.039
 training plan with which goal 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.300
 funnily enough i can ask exactly or 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.080
 better not come for the better 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.760
 time 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.310
 I have half a year ago than we did 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.760
 here were converted to full body 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.539
 I speak to the beginner level 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.890
 beginners downgraded 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:37.140
 this is a story you tell the man 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.329
 I am also reluctant to do so and I do 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.180
 But I had to be of the strength values 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:49.850
 am always of the opinion that yes yes 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.850
 classification beginner advanced 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.530
 There there is this norris 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.600
 intermediate advanced and elite belief 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.199
 So I resisted this power 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.740
 so to speak this force resisted this 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.439
 there are divisions and are with me 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.150
 actually all power plants between 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:17.030
 intermediate and advanced scarce 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.650
 Advents turn except for example the 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:25.049
 squat is scathing little and the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.600
 I have seven now 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.329
 years or something like that again 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.790
 started running relatively well and well 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.270
 the power values ​​are simply brutal 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.549
 bad year also logical and that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.290
 I 'll point out to you now 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.759
 have taken again long talk 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.780
 I now have a short mind on mad cow 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.500
 this is a powerlifting 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.020
 program 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.270
 I have the last week here now 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.119
 the States now is my penultimate 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:00.210
 workout now then immediately immediately 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.469
 I have used now so yes 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.509
 a little bit in those five by five 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.219
 history purely to move in so 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.020
 I use the last three units 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.200
 now for that is there is now the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.510
 mail program is then also in 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.560
 Germany continued to operate by me and 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.810
 then I can really 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.989
 exactly the plan and then I can 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.980
 also change the studio again 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.860
 or your own little one 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.930
 power room go with the baseballers on 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.130
 in the baseball stadium and there I can 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.500
 also film that means that will be 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.750
 finally be the time in which then 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.310
 or to that then all all workouts too 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.989
 can be filmed and where I am also in 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.519
 can make voice over or even 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.610
 not when no music is playing and so on 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.250
 So there will be more in the future 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.549
 but right now I am preparing 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.410
 on the match program, so to speak 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.110
 five times five program 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.870
 I try as yet to increase linearly 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.130
 So in the week by two and a half percent 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.430
 gain power or will do that like 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.250
 I how far I or how far I am 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.950
 esse rework do so to what extent I 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.810
 I still know how to do exercises 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.549
 not one hundred percent play with the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.069
 thoughts or it could 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.840
 maybe under certain circumstances 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.359
 that I'm actually in the best of it 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.799
 get in again and if I do that 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.700
 then i will use the access rework 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:27.870
 keep pretty low if not even 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.220
 completely stay out and if not then 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.200
 of course I have more 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.829
 regeneration time free and maybe 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.269
 still one or two sentence girls 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.579
 to do or maybe the one or 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.079
 to get another exercise but how 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.079
 said the exact exact 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:46.170
 training plan you will then 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:48.530
 of course by video and perverted videos 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.530
 to get
