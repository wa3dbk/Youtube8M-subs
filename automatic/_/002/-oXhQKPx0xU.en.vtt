mini-cooper experts in Glendora and I
have<00:00:05.339> an<00:00:05.460> example<00:00:05.790> here<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.299> carbon

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
have an example here of the carbon

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
something like that and I said all we

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.900 
something like that and I said all we
have<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> carbon<00:00:13.860> cleaning<00:00:14.219> well<00:00:14.790> this

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.340 
have to do a carbon cleaning well this
is<00:00:15.030> what<00:00:15.179> they're<00:00:15.330> doing<00:00:15.360> they're<00:00:15.780> taking<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
is what they're doing they're taking the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.939 
is what they're doing they're taking the
intake<00:00:17.340> manifold<00:00:17.820> off<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.230> coming<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.470> going

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
intake manifold off and coming in going

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.390 
intake manifold off and coming in going
into<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.369> valve<00:00:21.330> see<00:00:21.600> how<00:00:21.769> gummed<00:00:22.769> up<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.189> is

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
into the valve see how gummed up that is

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.490 
into the valve see how gummed up that is
right<00:00:23.699> there<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.390> Valve<00:00:24.660> trying<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.350> get<00:00:25.470> a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
right there that Valve trying to get a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.999 
right there that Valve trying to get a
clear<00:00:25.890> picture<00:00:26.220> here<00:00:26.990> where<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:29.630> wait<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
clear picture here where you wait a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.840 
clear picture here where you wait a
that's<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.189> valve<00:00:32.369> gummed<00:00:32.730> up<00:00:33.860> try<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.890> show

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
that's the valve gummed up try to show

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.799 
that's the valve gummed up try to show
you<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.180> other<00:00:36.360> one<00:00:36.570> over<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:38.510> it's<00:00:39.510> kind<00:00:39.750> of

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
you the other one over here it's kind of

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.410 
you the other one over here it's kind of
hard<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.050> see<00:00:40.320> see<00:00:41.100> how<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.579> one<00:00:41.760> just<00:00:42.239> kind

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
hard to see see how that one just kind

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.750 
hard to see see how that one just kind
of<00:00:42.480> looks<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.050> little<00:00:43.460> lighter<00:00:44.460> in

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
of looks like it's a little lighter in

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.840 
of looks like it's a little lighter in
color<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.899> left<00:00:46.079> side<00:00:46.289> there<00:00:46.590> as<00:00:47.129> opposed

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
color on the left side there as opposed

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.470 
color on the left side there as opposed
to<00:00:48.289> one<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.440> right<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.969> that's<00:00:51.149> what<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
to one on the right so that's what the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.779 
to one on the right so that's what the
dealer<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.809> doing<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.379> know<00:00:52.980> because<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.489> just

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
dealer is doing I know because I just

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.610 
dealer is doing I know because I just
came<00:00:54.000> from<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> dealer<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:56.600> we're<00:00:57.620> taking

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
came from the dealer and we're taking

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.290 
came from the dealer and we're taking
intake<00:00:58.890> manifold<00:00:59.399> off<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.850> we're<00:00:59.969> going<00:01:00.149> in

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
intake manifold off and we're going in

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.029 
intake manifold off and we're going in
there<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.690> cleaning<00:01:01.140> all<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.410> stuff<00:01:01.770> out

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
there and cleaning all that stuff out

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.490 
there and cleaning all that stuff out
now<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> normal<00:01:04.790> engine<00:01:06.049> you<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
now with the normal engine you have the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.200 
now with the normal engine you have the
fuel<00:01:07.799> injector<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.400> sits<00:01:08.580> right<00:01:08.670> behind<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
fuel injector that sits right behind the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450 
fuel injector that sits right behind the
valve<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> intake<00:01:10.799> manifold<00:01:11.310> so

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
valve in here on the intake manifold so

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.880 
valve in here on the intake manifold so
when<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.760> injects<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.510> fuel<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:13.020> sprays<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.710> so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
when it injects the fuel it sprays it so

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.830 
when it injects the fuel it sprays it so
it<00:01:13.979> keeps<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.310> clean<00:01:14.520> here<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.600> engine

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it keeps it clean here on this engine

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.310 
it keeps it clean here on this engine
your<00:01:16.790> fuel<00:01:17.790> injector<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:18.509> here<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
your fuel injector is right here it's a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.289 
your fuel injector is right here it's a
direct<00:01:19.650> injection<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.460> leads<00:01:21.060> right<00:01:21.240> into

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
direct injection this leads right into

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.330 
direct injection this leads right into
the<00:01:21.540> combustion<00:01:21.869> chamber<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.890> that's<00:01:23.040> why<00:01:23.189> we

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
the combustion chamber so that's why we

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.649 
the combustion chamber so that's why we
were<00:01:23.610> getting<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:23.970> carbon<00:01:24.390> buildup<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:25.220> so

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
were getting this carbon buildup here so

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.969 
were getting this carbon buildup here so
that's<00:01:27.659> what<00:01:27.810> they're<00:01:27.930> doing<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.680> little

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
that's what they're doing just a little

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.210 
that's what they're doing just a little
FYI<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.090> I've<00:01:30.720> seen<00:01:30.960> these<00:01:31.799> engines

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
FYI for you and I've seen these engines

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.880 
FYI for you and I've seen these engines
maybe<00:01:33.090> go<00:01:33.329> through<00:01:33.659> three<00:01:33.990> quarts<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.350> oil<00:01:34.530> in

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
maybe go through three quarts of oil in

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.249 
maybe go through three quarts of oil in
about<00:01:35.460> three<00:01:36.150> thousand<00:01:36.570> miles<00:01:36.689> after<00:01:37.079> an<00:01:37.170> oil

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
about three thousand miles after an oil

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.260 
about three thousand miles after an oil
change<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:37.890> very<00:01:38.220> important<00:01:38.850> if<00:01:39.240> you

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
change so it's very important if you

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.780 
change so it's very important if you
have<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> Cooper<00:01:39.900> s<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.619> turbo<00:01:40.950> motor<00:01:41.220> that

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
have a Cooper s the turbo motor that

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.310 
have a Cooper s the turbo motor that
you're<00:01:41.939> constantly<00:01:42.420> checking<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.960> oil<00:01:43.140> I

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
you're constantly checking the oil I

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.499 
you're constantly checking the oil I
would<00:01:43.380> recommend<00:01:43.950> checking<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> oil<00:01:44.759> every

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
would recommend checking the oil every

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.200 
would recommend checking the oil every
three<00:01:46.259> Phillips<00:01:46.740> at<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> gas<00:01:47.640> station<00:01:48.090> just

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
three Phillips at the gas station just

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.410 
three Phillips at the gas station just
to<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:49.259> safe<00:01:49.530> because<00:01:50.180> it<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.329> do

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
to be just be safe because it can do

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.690 
to be just be safe because it can do
some<00:01:51.630> catastrophic<00:01:52.259> damage<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.130> your<00:01:53.369> engine

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
some catastrophic damage to your engine

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.050 
some catastrophic damage to your engine
as<00:01:53.820> I've<00:01:54.000> shown<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.659> another<00:01:54.960> video<00:01:55.710> okay<00:01:56.280> so

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
as I've shown on another video okay so
