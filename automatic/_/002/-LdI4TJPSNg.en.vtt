00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.119 

all<00:00:06.700> right<00:00:06.940> we're<00:00:07.149> in<00:00:07.180> the<00:00:07.300> darkroom<00:00:08.129> and

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:09.129 
all right we're in the darkroom and

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:10.289 
all right we're in the darkroom and
that's<00:00:09.309> why<00:00:09.490> it's<00:00:09.639> called<00:00:09.790> a<00:00:09.910> darkroom

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:10.299 
that's why it's called a darkroom

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.950 
that's why it's called a darkroom
because<00:00:10.870> it's<00:00:11.200> dark<00:00:12.420> which<00:00:13.420> I<00:00:13.570> know<00:00:13.719> really

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
because it's dark which I know really

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:21.300 
because it's dark which I know really
goes<00:00:14.230> without<00:00:14.500> saying<00:00:14.889> but<00:00:18.150> at<00:00:19.150> any<00:00:19.330> rate<00:00:20.310> for

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
goes without saying but at any rate for

goes without saying but at any rate for
the<00:00:21.369> purposes<00:00:21.910> of<00:00:22.210> getting<00:00:22.900> this<00:00:23.310> going

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
the purposes of getting this going

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.150 
the purposes of getting this going
I'm<00:00:25.269> going<00:00:25.600> to<00:00:25.779> show<00:00:26.650> you<00:00:26.740> what<00:00:26.890> I'm<00:00:26.949> going<00:00:27.010> to

I'm going to show you what I'm going to

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.560 
I'm going to show you what I'm going to
do<00:00:27.279> and<00:00:27.430> then<00:00:27.519> I'm<00:00:27.580> going<00:00:27.699> to<00:00:27.789> actually<00:00:28.180> do<00:00:28.390> it

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
do and then I'm going to actually do it

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.210 
do and then I'm going to actually do it
and<00:00:28.689> come<00:00:28.930> back<00:00:28.990> in<00:00:29.439> just<00:00:29.560> a<00:00:29.740> second<00:00:30.039> while<00:00:30.160> I

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
and come back in just a second while I

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.670 
and come back in just a second while I
print<00:00:30.519> this<00:00:30.820> I'm<00:00:31.539> going<00:00:31.689> to<00:00:31.750> do<00:00:32.110> a<00:00:32.140> contact

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
print this I'm going to do a contact

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.670 
print this I'm going to do a contact
print<00:00:32.920> and<00:00:33.160> what<00:00:33.250> that<00:00:33.400> means<00:00:33.699> is<00:00:34.590> taking<00:00:35.590> a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
print and what that means is taking a

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.560 
print and what that means is taking a
single<00:00:36.070> sheet<00:00:36.280> of<00:00:36.550> photo<00:00:36.820> paper<00:00:37.150> and<00:00:37.299> this<00:00:37.390> is

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
single sheet of photo paper and this is

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.469 
single sheet of photo paper and this is
an<00:00:37.629> old<00:00:37.780> photo<00:00:38.110> paper<00:00:38.440> so<00:00:39.250> I'm<00:00:39.850> hoping<00:00:40.239> it'll

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:40.479 
an old photo paper so I'm hoping it'll

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:43.140 
an old photo paper so I'm hoping it'll
be<00:00:40.570> an<00:00:40.720> okay<00:00:41.080> and<00:00:41.409> analog<00:00:42.070> putting<00:00:43.000> the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
be an okay and analog putting the

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.719 
be an okay and analog putting the
negatives<00:00:43.870> on<00:00:44.019> top<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.470> it<00:00:44.589> printing<00:00:45.370> it<00:00:45.489> and

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
negatives on top of it printing it and

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.570 
negatives on top of it printing it and
then<00:00:46.479> developing<00:00:47.049> it<00:00:47.229> and<00:00:47.890> going<00:00:48.190> from<00:00:48.370> there

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
then developing it and going from there

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.759 
then developing it and going from there
and<00:00:51.449> seeing<00:00:52.449> which<00:00:53.019> of<00:00:53.049> my<00:00:53.260> prints<00:00:53.559> are<00:00:53.650> going

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
and seeing which of my prints are going

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.109 
and seeing which of my prints are going
to<00:00:53.830> be<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.010> best<00:00:54.250> because<00:00:54.489> it's<00:00:54.699> easier<00:00:55.089> to

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:55.119 
to be the best because it's easier to

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:57.180 
to be the best because it's easier to
evaluate<00:00:55.479> the<00:00:55.930> positives<00:00:56.619> and<00:00:56.799> it<00:00:56.920> is<00:00:57.040> to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
evaluate the positives and it is to

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.090 
evaluate the positives and it is to
evaluate<00:00:57.400> the<00:00:57.729> negatives<00:00:58.330> so<00:00:59.290> with<00:00:59.739> a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
evaluate the negatives so with a

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.880 
evaluate the negatives so with a
traditional<00:01:00.850> contact<00:01:01.479> print<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.500> want<00:01:02.769> to

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
traditional contact print you want to

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.100 
traditional contact print you want to
use<00:01:03.159> a<00:01:04.500> contact<00:01:05.500> printer<00:01:06.040> which<00:01:06.490> is<00:01:07.110> putting

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
use a contact printer which is putting

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.710 
use a contact printer which is putting
weight<00:01:08.680> on<00:01:08.710> this<00:01:09.160> to<00:01:09.310> keep<00:01:09.430> things<00:01:09.730> flat<00:01:10.090> this

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
weight on this to keep things flat this

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.570 
weight on this to keep things flat this
is<00:01:10.780> just<00:01:11.170> evaluative<00:01:11.920> so<00:01:12.070> I'm<00:01:12.160> going<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.370> do<00:01:12.430> it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
is just evaluative so I'm going to do it

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.830 
is just evaluative so I'm going to do it
for<00:01:12.670> thirty<00:01:12.910> seconds<00:01:15.420> which<00:01:16.420> I<00:01:16.570> should<00:01:16.750> have

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
for thirty seconds which I should have

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:29.840 
for thirty seconds which I should have
started<00:01:17.050> counting<00:01:17.410> so<00:01:18.370> let's<00:01:18.910> see<00:01:23.880> damn

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.679 

okay<00:01:30.850> so<00:01:31.180> 30<00:01:31.420> seconds<00:01:31.869> was<00:01:31.990> way<00:01:32.140> too<00:01:32.200> long<00:01:33.689> I'm

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
okay so 30 seconds was way too long I'm

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.539 
okay so 30 seconds was way too long I'm
doing<00:01:34.990> this<00:01:35.079> one<00:01:35.259> for<00:01:35.320> four<00:01:35.860> let's<00:01:36.280> see<00:01:36.399> how

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
doing this one for four let's see how

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.660 
doing this one for four let's see how
that<00:01:36.729> works<00:01:37.799> alright<00:01:38.799> four<00:01:39.100> seconds<00:01:39.580> was

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
that works alright four seconds was

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.070 
that works alright four seconds was
waiting<00:01:39.909> too<00:01:40.000> long<00:01:40.030> so<00:01:40.509> I'm<00:01:40.600> going<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.810> try<00:01:41.020> it

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
waiting too long so I'm going to try it

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.649 
waiting too long so I'm going to try it
now<00:01:41.530> again<00:01:41.860> at<00:01:41.979> four<00:01:42.220> seconds<00:01:42.670> but<00:01:43.390> with<00:01:43.509> the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
now again at four seconds but with the

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.630 
now again at four seconds but with the
enlarging<00:01:44.229> lens<00:01:44.259> stopped<00:01:44.950> down<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.970> about<00:01:46.119> f8

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
enlarging lens stopped down to about f8

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.520 
enlarging lens stopped down to about f8
there<00:01:48.640> we<00:01:48.759> go<00:01:48.850> that's<00:01:49.090> better<00:01:49.179> so<00:01:50.170> we're<00:01:50.380> back

then I'll print the image I have to put

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.770 
then I'll print the image I have to put
the<00:02:09.340> emulsion<00:02:09.610> on<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.000> glass<00:02:10.209> first<00:02:10.509> the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
the emulsion on the glass first the

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.640 
the emulsion on the glass first the
emulsions<00:02:11.610> liquefying<00:02:12.610> right<00:02:12.880> now<00:02:13.319> it's<00:02:14.319> it's

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
emulsions liquefying right now it's it's

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.240 
emulsions liquefying right now it's it's
still<00:02:14.920> on<00:02:15.040> acolytes<00:02:15.430> like<00:02:15.850> type<00:02:16.090> bottle<00:02:17.250> and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
still on acolytes like type bottle and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.289 
still on acolytes like type bottle and
then<00:02:18.370> what<00:02:18.519> I'll<00:02:18.580> do<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:18.760> I'll<00:02:18.940> pour<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.239> in

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
then what I'll do is I'll pour it in

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.759 
then what I'll do is I'll pour it in
here<00:02:19.480> pour<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.780> on<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.959> glass<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.470> let<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.650> go

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
here pour it on the glass and let it go

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.590 
here pour it on the glass and let it go
I<00:02:21.010> figured<00:02:21.730> out<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.940> photos<00:02:22.269> I'm<00:02:22.390> going<00:02:22.540> to

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
I figured out the photos I'm going to

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.420 
I figured out the photos I'm going to
print<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.080> what<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.530> did<00:02:23.739> was<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:24.010> took<00:02:24.040> the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
print and what I did was I took the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.020 
print and what I did was I took the
plastic<00:02:25.420> sheet<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:25.930> marked<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.580> little<00:02:27.580> mark

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
plastic sheet and I marked a little mark

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.030 
plastic sheet and I marked a little mark
next<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.750> negative<00:02:29.140> on<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.590> plastic

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
next to the negative on the plastic

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.229 
next to the negative on the plastic
sheet<00:02:30.269> not<00:02:31.269> on<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.510> negative<00:02:31.870> obviously<00:02:31.989> and

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
sheet not on the negative obviously and

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.610 
sheet not on the negative obviously and
now<00:02:34.239> I<00:02:34.269> just<00:02:34.510> have<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.720> take<00:02:34.840> those<00:02:35.019> out<00:02:35.230> put

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
now I just have to take those out put

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.289 
now I just have to take those out put
them<00:02:35.709> in<00:02:35.859> the<00:02:35.980> negative<00:02:36.430> carrier<00:02:36.700> oops

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
them in the negative carrier oops

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.509 
them in the negative carrier oops
go<00:02:37.959> through<00:02:38.109> the<00:02:38.549> negative<00:02:39.549> carrier<00:02:39.760> and

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
go through the negative carrier and

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.280 
go through the negative carrier and
we're<00:02:42.519> good<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.790> go<00:02:42.820> for<00:02:42.940> our<00:02:43.239> printing<00:02:43.600> next

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
we're good to go for our printing next

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.410 
we're good to go for our printing next
thing<00:02:44.440> you're<00:02:44.620> gonna<00:02:44.739> see<00:02:45.040> are<00:02:45.790> gonna<00:02:46.120> be<00:02:46.239> some

thing you're gonna see are gonna be some

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.039 
thing you're gonna see are gonna be some
finished<00:02:46.720> results<00:02:50.040> okay<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:52.870> one<00:02:52.989> of

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
finished results okay so this is one of

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.009 
finished results okay so this is one of
those<00:02:53.200> very<00:02:53.530> rare<00:02:53.920> up<00:02:54.730> early<00:02:55.510> enough<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:55.959> the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.120 
printing these 7'o paulo types last
night<00:03:03.030> took<00:03:04.030> almost<00:03:04.299> five<00:03:04.959> hours<00:03:05.290> in<00:03:05.980> the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
night took almost five hours in the

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.420 
night took almost five hours in the
darkroom<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:07.660> was<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.870> very<00:03:08.590> exhausting

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
darkroom it was a very exhausting

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.449 
darkroom it was a very exhausting
evening<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.980> here<00:03:11.980> are<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.130> finished

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
evening and here are the finished

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.819 
evening and here are the finished
results<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.180> they<00:03:13.870> vary<00:03:14.819> wildly<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:17.200> there

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
results and they vary wildly so there

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.150 
results and they vary wildly so there
are<00:03:18.010> some<00:03:18.370> interesting<00:03:19.590> interesting<00:03:20.590> flaws

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
are some interesting interesting flaws

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.400 
are some interesting interesting flaws
and<00:03:21.459> some<00:03:21.670> of<00:03:21.790> them<00:03:21.940> I'll<00:03:22.450> take<00:03:22.660> of<00:03:22.810> this<00:03:23.200> one

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
and some of them I'll take of this one

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.000 
and some of them I'll take of this one
right<00:03:23.590> up<00:03:23.739> here<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:26.519> some<00:03:27.519> of<00:03:27.639> them<00:03:27.790> have<00:03:29.010> the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
right up here and some of them have the

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.000 
right up here and some of them have the
the<00:03:30.940> fixer<00:03:31.450> did<00:03:31.870> not<00:03:32.049> completely<00:03:32.590> fix<00:03:32.829> the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
the fixer did not completely fix the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.780 
the fixer did not completely fix the
emulsion<00:03:33.280> in<00:03:33.609> me<00:03:34.859> rinse<00:03:35.859> now<00:03:36.190> I<00:03:36.220> fixed<00:03:36.700> these

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
emulsion in me rinse now I fixed these

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.030 
emulsion in me rinse now I fixed these
for<00:03:37.030> about<00:03:37.120> ten<00:03:37.449> minutes<00:03:37.600> each

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
for about ten minutes each

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.490 
for about ten minutes each
the<00:03:39.459> Amol<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:40.090> wall

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
the Amol the wall

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.320 
the Amol the wall
then<00:03:40.680> which<00:03:40.890> for<00:03:41.430> some<00:03:41.580> of<00:03:41.670> these<00:03:41.730> was<00:03:41.940> half<00:03:42.180> an

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
then which for some of these was half an

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.030 
then which for some of these was half an
hour<00:03:42.420> did<00:03:42.750> not<00:03:42.900> completely<00:03:43.290> take<00:03:43.560> off<00:03:43.740> some<00:03:44.010> of

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
hour did not completely take off some of

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.760 
hour did not completely take off some of
the<00:03:44.250> unfixed<00:03:44.910> emulsion<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.320> few<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.650> them

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
the unfixed emulsion so a few of them

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:53.540 
the unfixed emulsion so a few of them
have<00:03:46.950> some<00:03:47.870> purple<00:03:48.870> spots<00:03:50.960> and<00:03:51.960> then<00:03:52.550> where

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
have some purple spots and then where

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.150 
have some purple spots and then where
the<00:03:53.730> emulsion<00:03:54.000> was<00:03:54.330> extra<00:03:54.840> thick<00:03:55.080> and<00:03:55.350> then<00:03:56.010> in

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
the emulsion was extra thick and then in

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.430 
the emulsion was extra thick and then in
this<00:03:56.340> one<00:03:56.580> is<00:03:56.730> also<00:03:57.240> interesting<00:03:57.690> because<00:03:57.870> in

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
this one is also interesting because in

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.410 
this one is also interesting because in
the<00:03:58.650> wah<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.490> wash<00:03:59.670> even<00:04:00.030> though<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.240> was

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
the wah and the wash even though it was

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.380 
the wah and the wash even though it was
very<00:04:00.780> gentle<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.980> emulsion<00:04:02.340> tore<00:04:02.880> now<00:04:03.180> that

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
very gentle the emulsion tore now that

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.380 
very gentle the emulsion tore now that
it's<00:04:03.540> dry<00:04:03.750> it's<00:04:04.590> it's<00:04:05.040> solid<00:04:05.550> but<00:04:05.730> the

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
it's dry it's it's solid but the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.760 
it's dry it's it's solid but the
emulsion<00:04:06.660> tore<00:04:07.170> during<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.709> washing<00:04:08.190> process

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
emulsion tore during the washing process

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.130 
emulsion tore during the washing process
this<00:04:10.770> this<00:04:11.130> was<00:04:11.459> a<00:04:11.730> test<00:04:12.060> strip<00:04:12.360> this<00:04:12.930> was<00:04:13.110> a

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
this this was a test strip this was a

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.819 
this this was a test strip this was a
bad<00:04:13.380> idea<00:04:13.410> I<00:04:14.040> just<00:04:14.580> did<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.760> single<00:04:15.470> bead<00:04:16.470> down

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
bad idea I just did a single bead down

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.349 
bad idea I just did a single bead down
the<00:04:17.040> middle<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:17.400> try<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.730> conserve<00:04:18.090> my

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
the middle to try and conserve my

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.240 
the middle to try and conserve my
emulsion<00:04:18.690> didn't<00:04:19.320> work<00:04:19.440> as<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.650> test<00:04:19.950> strip<00:04:20.100> I

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
emulsion didn't work as a test strip I

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.280 
emulsion didn't work as a test strip I
couldn't<00:04:20.579> tell<00:04:20.700> what<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:20.940> was<00:04:21.120> looking<00:04:21.450> at

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.230 

here's<00:04:25.290> one<00:04:25.560> that<00:04:25.710> turned<00:04:25.950> out<00:04:26.100> fairly<00:04:26.460> fairly

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
here's one that turned out fairly fairly

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.090 
here's one that turned out fairly fairly
okay<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:28.050> can<00:04:28.169> see<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:28.530> there's<00:04:28.919> some<00:04:29.070> of

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
okay you can see that there's some of

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.409 
okay you can see that there's some of
the<00:04:29.220> emulsion<00:04:29.490> tearing<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.090> some<00:04:30.270> of<00:04:30.360> the

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
the emulsion tearing and some of the

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.430 
the emulsion tearing and some of the
discoloration<00:04:30.750> here<00:04:31.530> but<00:04:32.510> also<00:04:33.510> there's<00:04:33.960> a

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
discoloration here but also there's a

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.100 
discoloration here but also there's a
lot<00:04:34.860> of<00:04:35.010> bubbles<00:04:35.430> through<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.120> the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
lot of bubbles through it and the

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.600 
lot of bubbles through it and the
bubbles<00:04:37.440> were<00:04:37.590> because<00:04:37.950> I<00:04:38.070> dropped<00:04:38.370> the

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
bubbles were because I dropped the

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.030 
bubbles were because I dropped the
emulsion<00:04:38.910> bottle<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:39.630> it<00:04:39.720> got<00:04:39.870> shaken<00:04:40.230> up<00:04:40.470> in

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
emulsion bottle and it got shaken up in

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.280 
emulsion bottle and it got shaken up in
that<00:04:41.370> /<00:04:41.580> in<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:41.820> drop<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.630> so<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.050> lot<00:04:43.260> of

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
that / in the drop and so a lot of

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.380 
that / in the drop and so a lot of
bubbles<00:04:43.710> got<00:04:43.860> into<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.400> emulsion<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:45.229> didn't

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
bubbles got into the emulsion and didn't

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.090 
bubbles got into the emulsion and didn't
didn't<00:04:48.390> come<00:04:48.780> out<00:04:48.990> of<00:04:49.169> this<00:04:49.380> as<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.860> emulsion

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
didn't come out of this as the emulsion

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.360 
didn't come out of this as the emulsion
was<00:04:50.400> setting<00:04:50.700> before<00:04:51.060> development<00:04:52.220> so<00:04:53.220> these

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
was setting before development so these

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.190 
was setting before development so these
