step straight back we're going to get a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.460 
step straight back we're going to get a
little<00:00:26.640> bit<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.810> see<00:00:27.960> how<00:00:28.080> my<00:00:28.260> body

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
little bit of a you can see how my body

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.439 
little bit of a you can see how my body
is<00:00:28.650> starting<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.010> work<00:00:29.640> or<00:00:29.820> not<00:00:29.970> work<00:00:30.029> right

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
is starting to work or not work right

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.229 
is starting to work or not work right
now<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.439> got<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.710> start<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.070> swing<00:00:32.369> my

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
now is that I got to start to swing my

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.750 
now is that I got to start to swing my
leg<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.630> get<00:00:33.750> around<00:00:33.930> my<00:00:34.110> pivot<00:00:34.579> so<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:35.730> I

leg to get around my pivot so what I
want<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.360> start<00:00:36.750> slightly<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.350> an

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
want to do here start slightly on an

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.930 
want to do here start slightly on an
angle<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.000> have<00:00:39.000> small<00:00:39.480> direct<00:00:39.899> steps<00:00:40.940> okay

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
angle and have small direct steps okay

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.389 
angle and have small direct steps okay
so<00:00:42.000> I'm<00:00:42.540> going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> start<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.379> another<00:00:44.100> key

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
so I'm going to start and another key

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.010 
so I'm going to start and another key
here<00:00:44.670> especially<00:00:44.969> as<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.539> older<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.870> to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
here especially as we get older is to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.590 
here especially as we get older is to
keep<00:00:46.170> our<00:00:46.379> glove<00:00:46.760> point<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:47.969> towards<00:00:48.149> cells

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
keep our glove point it in towards cells

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.439 
keep our glove point it in towards cells
because<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.469> get<00:00:49.590> older<00:00:49.789> if<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:51.030> start<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
because as we get older if we start to

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.080 
because as we get older if we start to
move<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.289> keep<00:00:52.469> our<00:00:52.620> glove<00:00:52.829> open<00:00:53.219> third-base

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
move and keep our glove open third-base

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.150 
move and keep our glove open third-base
coach<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.840> our<00:00:54.989> grips<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.590> our<00:00:55.680> ball<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
coach can see our grips on our ball and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.910 
coach can see our grips on our ball and
can<00:00:56.610> start<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> relay<00:00:57.270> signs<00:00:57.620> okay<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.800> we're

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
can start to relay signs okay so we're

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.020 
can start to relay signs okay so we're
going<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.129> keep<00:00:59.520> closed<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:00.739> small<00:01:01.739> steps<00:01:02.039> so

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
going to keep closed here small steps so

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.010 
going to keep closed here small steps so
our<00:01:03.300> glove<00:01:04.170> step<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:04.949> out<00:01:06.020> but

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
our glove step is going to be out but

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.359 
our glove step is going to be out but
only<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.320> far<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> edge<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> rubber

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
only as far as the edge of the rubber

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.969 
only as far as the edge of the rubber
the<00:01:08.670> farther<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.090> go<00:01:09.240> out<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.600> way<00:01:09.979> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the farther we go out this way the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.109 
the farther we go out this way the
farther<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.549> we're<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.820> create

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
farther that we're going to create

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.609 
farther that we're going to create
ourselves<00:01:12.330> coming<00:01:12.840> back<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.290> other<00:01:13.320> way<00:01:13.500> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
ourselves coming back the other way and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.749 
ourselves coming back the other way and
cause<00:01:14.250> bad<00:01:14.549> balance<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.170> we're<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:17.100> small

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
cause bad balance so we're here small

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.359 
cause bad balance so we're here small
step<00:01:18.979> foot<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.490> squared<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.140> up<00:01:22.369> down

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
step foot in so it's squared in up down

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.730 
step foot in so it's squared in up down
and<00:01:24.090> throw

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.399 

so<00:01:29.430> slight<00:01:29.820> angle<00:01:30.470> ball<00:01:31.470> starts<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:31.979> our<00:01:32.130> chest

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
so slight angle ball starts at our chest

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.789 
so slight angle ball starts at our chest
small<00:01:34.409> step<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.920> our<00:01:34.950> left<00:01:35.689> pivot<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:37.310> up<00:01:38.570> down

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
small step to our left pivot in up down

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.859 
small step to our left pivot in up down
throw<00:01:43.759> okay<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.420> if<00:01:45.539> we've<00:01:45.689> done

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
throw okay and as you see if we've done

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.499 
throw okay and as you see if we've done
the<00:01:45.990> work<00:01:46.170> ahead<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.619> time<00:01:46.830> that<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:48.000> chest

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
the work ahead of time that the chest

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.539 
the work ahead of time that the chest
still<00:01:48.720> finishes<00:01:49.380> out<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.979> front<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.250> our<00:01:50.369> knee

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
still finishes out in front of our knee

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.760 
still finishes out in front of our knee
we<00:01:50.939> still<00:01:51.210> get<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.420> tuck<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.320> still<00:01:52.590> get
