00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
file that you saved the shader file in

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.600 
file that you saved the shader file in
or<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.670> shader<00:01:06.380> texture<00:01:07.380> pack<00:01:07.560> file<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.340> as

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
or the shader texture pack file in so as

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.380 
or the shader texture pack file in so as
you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.119> see<00:01:09.299> mine<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.409> DCIM<00:01:11.189> folder

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
you can see mine is in the DCIM folder

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.210 
you can see mine is in the DCIM folder
and<00:01:12.390> basically<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.840> already<00:01:13.350> selected<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.189> I

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and basically I already selected it so I

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.060 
and basically I already selected it so I
no<00:01:14.640> need<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.390> again<00:01:15.680> but<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.950> can

no need to do so again but as you can

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:25.850 
no need to do so again but as you can
see<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.369> says<00:01:17.549> shaders<00:01:18.509> mcpe<00:01:19.670> 0.12.10<00:01:24.860> shaders

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
see it says shaders mcpe 0.12.10 shaders

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.580 
see it says shaders mcpe 0.12.10 shaders
so<00:01:26.549> let's<00:01:26.880> go<00:01:27.060> ahead<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.540> go<00:01:27.900> into<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> game

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
so let's go ahead and go into the game

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and I will show you guys some shader

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.910 
and I will show you guys some shader

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
you can see the different textures in

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.460 
you can see the different textures in
this<00:01:41.490> texture<00:01:41.939> pack<00:01:41.970> good<00:01:42.750> thing<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.290> a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
this texture pack good thing I have a

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.679 
this texture pack good thing I have a
texture<00:01:43.979> pack<00:01:44.130> review<00:01:44.640> map<00:01:44.850> pretty<00:01:45.180> much<00:01:45.390> and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
texture pack review map pretty much and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.630 
texture pack review map pretty much and
as<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.320> see<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.649> different<00:01:47.040> warms<00:01:47.430> over
