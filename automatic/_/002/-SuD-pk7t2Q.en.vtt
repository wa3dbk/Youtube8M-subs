to<00:05:09.930> slot<00:05:10.139> into<00:05:10.169> place<00:05:10.500> over<00:05:10.800> here<00:05:10.889> before

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
to slot into place over here before

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.469 
to slot into place over here before
would<00:05:11.310> be<00:05:11.370> a<00:05:11.400> problem<00:05:11.610> just<00:05:11.940> work<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.300> first

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
would be a problem just work the first

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.850 
would be a problem just work the first
time<00:05:12.599> and<00:05:12.900> it<00:05:12.960> kind<00:05:13.169> of<00:05:13.229> all<00:05:13.349> just<00:05:13.530> went<00:05:13.650> really

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
time and it kind of all just went really

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.100 
time and it kind of all just went really
well<00:05:13.949> so<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.610> lot<00:05:14.940> of<00:05:14.969> our<00:05:15.150> hands<00:05:15.360> about<00:05:15.570> trees

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
well so a lot of our hands about trees

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.689 
well so a lot of our hands about trees
and<00:05:16.380> I'm<00:05:16.500> just<00:05:17.010> trying<00:05:17.250> to<00:05:17.310> get<00:05:17.460> them<00:05:17.580> in

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
and I'm just trying to get them in

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.040 
and I'm just trying to get them in
though<00:05:17.789> there's<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.210> lot<00:05:18.389> of<00:05:18.419> technical<00:05:18.779> work

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
though there's a lot of technical work

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.450 
though there's a lot of technical work
to<00:05:19.199> get

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
to get

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.850 
to get
into<00:05:20.150> the<00:05:20.240> hardware<00:05:20.630> but<00:05:20.840> we<00:05:21.470> think<00:05:21.590> it<00:05:21.740> looks

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
into the hardware but we think it looks

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.740 
into the hardware but we think it looks
really<00:05:22.069> great<00:05:22.280> and<00:05:22.610> it's<00:05:22.940> just<00:05:23.000> viewed<00:05:23.479> from<00:05:23.630> a

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
really great and it's just viewed from a

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.210 
really great and it's just viewed from a
sort<00:05:23.930> of<00:05:23.960> top-down<00:05:24.229> perspective<00:05:24.620> is<00:05:24.979> that<00:05:25.009> is

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
sort of top-down perspective is that is

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:34.210 
sort of top-down perspective is that is
that<00:05:25.250> was<00:05:25.729> that<00:05:25.819> technical

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.280
