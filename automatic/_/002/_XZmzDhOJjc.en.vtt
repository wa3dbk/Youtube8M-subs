 Soloists on double track 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.970
 like a father 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.990
 she is 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.990

 she is 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.650
 those around the horse 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.310
 I think it is the oecd study confirmed 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.760
 Dear Colleagues, I am disappointed with their current performance low for the 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.440
 Winners of a ten-year-old computer addict beat them recently 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.330
 legendary Section Blue to the absolute animal tricks elite and now that can 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.170
 do not go on like this Â»what's going on with the government course the red ones are us 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.010
 already hot on the heels and more 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.710
 So he reminds me at least one colleague 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.740
 Yes, I had worked a lot better anyway 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.549
 If you ask him together they are trying to solve private problems from the countries 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.630
 give test see 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.630
 the survival of the company is at stake 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.540
 if it is not enough

 Panini I am at work 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.569
 and I've just picked up a stand-up drummer 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.710
 it does not work well 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.030
 But I'm not the main thing in the matter you already know why 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.100
 So a shock fits two days ago so the test result 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.229
 I do not know what to do 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:13.799
 via Twitter 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.730
 if so how many times to fear do you know 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.609
 when the colleagues noticed more than they get with me that I'm hiv-positive 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.389
 no idea how they react then 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.919
 traffic 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.919
 later

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:41.359
 it is not commonplace, the minister is not 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.819
 the mold 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.819
 Werner m you are sure 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:46.830
 Dr 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.830
 You have to say that I like it, you can get infected 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.749
 I did not think so last winter I have enough others 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.749
 Problems of the region around house construction 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.999
 Mrs. MÃ¼ller Dear colleagues 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.579
 to prevent any rumors I would like to tell you soon 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.030
 I got an egg fortes back two days ago 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.939
 and that is positive 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.099
 in Munich 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.669
 old cityscape 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.169
 they spend a lot of time asking 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.680
 but this here turns out to be the same coffee cups the people rawhide 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:24.260
 and that is at work 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.709
 After all, we have a lot of body contact are also best Melle 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.560
 You can be easier with glass and paper I do not give up or do you want 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.319
 We are infected with an 11 his hands are enough now we will get this 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.980
 Dedicate the topic later in detail here it is only about the scores of 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:43.459
 the password 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.259
 the fia president 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:49.539
 who are waiting for them? 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:58.469
 Marco Polo is not that crowded in the country to join dapd 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.469
 we have been seen again 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.230
 Dear colleagues 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.550
 Unfortunately I have to tell them that our work result is even worse 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.640
 and I've been tougher with the opening 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.539
 could be related to the countless power 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:16.539
 Roberts to give an opportunity for pronunciation 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:21.559
 Miss Hoffmann missed the eleven target if DiCaprio can ask him 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:26.409
 answer and give information has cook 1 good day gentlemen 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.080
 we do not have everything serious take out 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.739
 I explain what's all this about the Internet track revealed 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.999
 we are still working together 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:40.319
 a "I as a family man would actually only make money substantially one 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:42.639
 Avoid contagion bile 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.419
 only the question is really outlandish 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.419
 if I may say so and just as absurd are your fears on the 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.669
 To infect work 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.069
 How does that work 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:55.240
 Pauli Faro is primarily sexually transmitted 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.789
 and is not transmitted through normal social contacts 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:04.559
 So you can confidently walk together phones toilets and tools 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:06.770
 to use more handy 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.229
 at the same time l now has a wife 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.800
 b you can then continue to work normally 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.860
 I'm watching for it 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.550
 Nocera does not stay at home I mean 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.240
 Kauder the 1 okay still has no wind he is hiv-positive 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.259
 they must not be confused 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:24.710
 is not that just a rumor 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.840
 as long as he is only infected or can continue to work fully 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.729
 First his immune system would be so weakened by the virus that he would be for others 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.270
 normally non-dangerous diseases would become vulnerable 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.250
 and if he got such a disease then he would have scene in Idstein 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.160
 Fortunately, there are medicines for a few years 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.379
 Keeping hi-virus in check very well 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:51.020
 This prolongs the phase without significant benefits for such diseases 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.240
 he will continue to work normally 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.360
 Secondly 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.730
 to the extent understandable Waldkirch 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.469
 but you should not get him to bath anyway 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:03.169
 For example, I mean when some people are hurt and bleeding 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.070
 There are black gloves in every first aid kit 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.610
 the screeching due 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.110
 so you can work with him unhindered you can hug him in the e10 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.509
 if you want but our precious still really bad in 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:16.559
 last time 

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:21.429
 Dr DAX was partly determined by the internal and the test result 

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:22.069
 could 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:25.879
 but everything I want to take my cap off 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:29.239
 to Meyenburg from the cathedral may need a bit more 

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:30.259
 exactly my thing 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:33.029
 some of them have had their problems lately 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:36.369
 behind Mrs. Hoffmann a fly like Stephen Bruton 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:42.559
 for Maria Riesch 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:46.019
 and with them I also have to pluck a chicken they should 

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:49.779
 maybe the mistakes try to look less at the others and not at 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:53.379
 to think of the new pets a bit at our work write them 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:56.379
 that the contacts are already safely stowed away 

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:59.469
 Soost 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:02.870
 what we had 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.979
 so learns 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:06.960
 Zoua plays 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:15.280
 so stand such a dealer we have been really good Wiesbaden AP 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.229
 Spokesman Jay Carney like that
