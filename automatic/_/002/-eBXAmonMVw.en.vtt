stuff<00:04:00.410> but<00:04:00.620> they<00:04:00.709> don't<00:04:00.860> have<00:04:00.920> a<00:04:01.010> trigger

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
stuff but they don't have a trigger

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.759 
stuff but they don't have a trigger
finger<00:04:01.700> so<00:04:02.330> what<00:04:02.630> I<00:04:02.660> did<00:04:02.750> was<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:03.260> just<00:04:03.320> cut<00:04:03.650> the

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
finger so what I did was I just cut the

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.550 
finger so what I did was I just cut the
trigger<00:04:04.010> guard<00:04:04.100> on<00:04:04.549> the<00:04:04.580> guns<00:04:05.570> so<00:04:06.350> that<00:04:06.470> it

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
trigger guard on the guns so that it

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.229 
trigger guard on the guns so that it
looked<00:04:06.799> like<00:04:06.950> his<00:04:07.430> finger<00:04:07.730> was<00:04:07.850> going<00:04:08.090> where

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
looked like his finger was going where

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.729 
looked like his finger was going where
the<00:04:08.269> trigger<00:04:08.540> would<00:04:08.780> be<00:04:08.930> even<00:04:09.380> though<00:04:09.500> it's

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
the trigger would be even though it's

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.680 
the trigger would be even though it's
just<00:04:10.370> kind<00:04:10.580> of<00:04:10.610> like<00:04:10.670> an<00:04:10.880> illusion<00:04:11.330> I<00:04:11.450> guess

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
just kind of like an illusion I guess

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.660 
just kind of like an illusion I guess
you<00:04:11.810> could<00:04:11.959> say<00:04:12.140> but<00:04:12.350> that<00:04:13.130> way<00:04:13.220> he<00:04:13.340> can<00:04:13.489> hold

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
you could say but that way he can hold

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.659 
you could say but that way he can hold

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.110 
prefer the Marvel Legends katanas just
because<00:04:55.770> they're<00:04:55.920> better<00:04:56.100> sculpt<00:04:56.580> and<00:04:56.730> made<00:04:57.090> a

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
because they're better sculpt and made a

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.060 
because they're better sculpt and made a
little<00:04:57.300> nicer<00:04:57.780> but<00:04:58.380> since<00:04:58.620> these<00:04:58.770> come<00:04:59.040> with

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
little nicer but since these come with

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.070 
little nicer but since these come with
the<00:04:59.370> scabbards<00:04:59.820> that<00:04:59.970> they<00:05:00.060> fit<00:05:00.240> in<00:05:00.450> and<00:05:00.660> their

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
the scabbards that they fit in and their

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.960 
the scabbards that they fit in and their
Chrome<00:05:01.350> it's<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:01.770> nice<00:05:01.920> detail<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.430> like<00:05:02.730> that<00:05:02.910> a

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
Chrome it's a nice detail I like that a

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.070 
Chrome it's a nice detail I like that a
lot<00:05:05.000> it<00:05:06.000> took<00:05:06.150> a<00:05:06.270> little<00:05:06.420> sanding<00:05:06.900> and

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
lot it took a little sanding and

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.540 
lot it took a little sanding and
sculpting<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.740> give<00:05:07.920> them<00:05:08.010> to<00:05:08.100> fit<00:05:08.250> together

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
sculpting to give them to fit together

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.240 
sculpting to give them to fit together
nicely<00:05:09.050> but<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.290> think<00:05:10.650> it's<00:05:10.800> worth<00:05:10.950> it<00:05:11.130> because

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
nicely but I think it's worth it because

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.410 
nicely but I think it's worth it because
it<00:05:11.430> looks<00:05:11.580> pretty<00:05:11.790> cool<00:05:13.700> other<00:05:14.700> weapons<00:05:15.180> he

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
it looks pretty cool other weapons he

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.800 
it looks pretty cool other weapons he
has<00:05:15.650> he<00:05:16.650> has<00:05:16.680> two<00:05:17.250> of<00:05:17.280> these<00:05:17.580> just<00:05:18.510> set<00:05:18.660> him

red scope things on there not really

to shoot real well or anything like that

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.580 
to shoot real well or anything like that
but<00:05:40.260> it<00:05:40.560> technically<00:05:40.980> will<00:05:41.280> shoot<00:05:42.440> let's<00:05:43.440> see

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
but it technically will shoot let's see

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.380 
but it technically will shoot let's see
if<00:05:43.680> I<00:05:43.740> can<00:05:43.770> do<00:05:44.040> it<00:05:46.670> it<00:05:47.670> shoots<00:05:47.850> actually<00:05:48.240> pretty

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
if I can do it it shoots actually pretty

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.180 
if I can do it it shoots actually pretty
well<00:05:48.570> because<00:05:48.690> this<00:05:48.840> is<00:05:48.990> elastic<00:05:49.500> and<00:05:49.740> this<00:05:49.980> is

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
well because this is elastic and this is

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.820 
well because this is elastic and this is
a<00:05:50.240> flexible<00:05:51.240> plastic<00:05:51.810> so<00:05:52.110> you<00:05:52.170> can<00:05:52.470> really<00:05:52.620> get

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
a flexible plastic so you can really get

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.770 
a flexible plastic so you can really get
some<00:05:53.010> nice<00:05:53.960> torque<00:05:54.960> on<00:05:55.140> there<00:05:55.320> he<00:05:55.890> can<00:05:56.160> hold<00:05:56.460> it

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
some nice torque on there he can hold it

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.240 
some nice torque on there he can hold it
the<00:05:57.780> hands<00:05:58.110> are<00:05:58.170> strong<00:05:58.470> enough<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:58.890> pull<00:05:59.100> the

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
the hands are strong enough to pull the

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.520 
the hands are strong enough to pull the
string<00:05:59.880> back<00:06:00.090> and<00:06:00.300> hold<00:06:00.480> it<00:06:00.570> in<00:06:00.630> place<00:06:00.810> for<00:06:01.500> the

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
string back and hold it in place for the

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.980 
string back and hold it in place for the
most<00:06:01.740> part<00:06:01.980> I<00:06:02.280> mean<00:06:03.090> it's<00:06:03.210> not<00:06:03.270> like<00:06:03.390> he's

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
most part I mean it's not like he's

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.450 
most part I mean it's not like he's
going<00:06:04.110> to<00:06:04.170> actually<00:06:04.320> be<00:06:04.470> firing<00:06:04.830> it<00:06:05.160> but<00:06:05.370> if

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
going to actually be firing it but if

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.980 
going to actually be firing it but if
you<00:06:05.580> can<00:06:05.700> get<00:06:06.090> it<00:06:06.210> and<00:06:06.330> get<00:06:06.480> them<00:06:06.600> to<00:06:06.630> hold<00:06:06.840> it

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
you can get it and get them to hold it

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.080 
you can get it and get them to hold it
just<00:06:07.200> right<00:06:07.440> and<00:06:07.680> pull<00:06:08.310> it<00:06:08.370> back<00:06:08.490> just<00:06:08.820> write

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
just right and pull it back just write

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.790 
just right and pull it back just write
everything<00:06:09.390> you<00:06:09.990> can<00:06:10.140> actually<00:06:10.380> get<00:06:10.620> some

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
everything you can actually get some

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.040 
everything you can actually get some
really<00:06:10.950> nice<00:06:11.130> poses<00:06:11.580> out<00:06:11.730> of<00:06:11.880> it<00:06:12.030> so<00:06:12.810> I<00:06:12.870> was

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
really nice poses out of it so I was

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.640 
really nice poses out of it so I was
pretty<00:06:13.230> pleased<00:06:13.530> with<00:06:13.680> how<00:06:13.860> that<00:06:14.040> turned<00:06:14.310> out

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
pretty pleased with how that turned out

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:26.000 
pretty pleased with how that turned out
see<00:06:16.650> if<00:06:16.740> I<00:06:16.800> can<00:06:16.950> do<00:06:17.040> it<00:06:17.160> real<00:06:17.340> quick<00:06:17.370> just<00:06:25.010> to

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
see if I can do it real quick just to

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.540 
see if I can do it real quick just to
show<00:06:26.280> you<00:06:26.310> how<00:06:26.490> it<00:06:26.760> would<00:06:26.910> work

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.940 

yeah<00:06:31.550> sometimes<00:06:32.330> the<00:06:32.450> arm<00:06:32.600> just<00:06:32.840> rotates<00:06:33.290> but

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
yeah sometimes the arm just rotates but

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.620 
yeah sometimes the arm just rotates but
you<00:06:34.100> can<00:06:34.340> get<00:06:34.610> if<00:06:34.790> you<00:06:35.150> could<00:06:35.270> line<00:06:35.420> it<00:06:35.450> up

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
you can get if you could line it up

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.150 
you can get if you could line it up
right<00:06:35.900> you<00:06:36.050> can<00:06:36.170> get<00:06:36.320> him<00:06:36.440> to<00:06:36.560> pull<00:06:36.740> the<00:06:36.860> string

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 
right you can get him to pull the string

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.440 
right you can get him to pull the string
back<00:06:37.400> and<00:06:37.640> it<00:06:37.700> looks<00:06:37.940> like<00:06:38.000> he's<00:06:38.210> actually

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
back and it looks like he's actually

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.840 
back and it looks like he's actually
firing<00:06:38.840> it<00:06:39.200> which<00:06:39.830> is<00:06:39.980> pretty<00:06:40.160> cool<00:06:40.430> you<00:06:40.640> gotta

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
firing it which is pretty cool you gotta

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.730 
firing it which is pretty cool you gotta
I<00:06:41.180> don't<00:06:41.630> have<00:06:41.750> time<00:06:41.960> to<00:06:42.140> line<00:06:42.290> it<00:06:42.320> up<00:06:42.500> just

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
I don't have time to line it up just

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.160 
I don't have time to line it up just
right<00:06:42.920> on<00:06:43.100> camera<00:06:43.340> but<00:06:44.270> there<00:06:44.600> that<00:06:44.900> kind<00:06:45.110> of

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170 
right on camera but there that kind of

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.020 
right on camera but there that kind of
shows<00:06:45.380> it<00:06:45.620> you<00:06:46.040> gotta<00:06:46.220> do<00:06:46.370> it<00:06:46.400> right<00:06:46.550> but<00:06:46.880> it

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
shows it you gotta do it right but it

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.730 
shows it you gotta do it right but it
does<00:06:47.180> work<00:06:47.390> so<00:06:47.600> it's<00:06:47.750> nice<00:06:47.960> nice<00:06:48.710> little

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
does work so it's nice nice little

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.160 
does work so it's nice nice little
detail<00:06:49.250> I<00:06:49.280> think<00:06:49.670> makes<00:06:50.420> for<00:06:50.600> some<00:06:50.750> cool<00:06:50.930> poses

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.170 
detail I think makes for some cool poses

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.320 
detail I think makes for some cool poses
and<00:06:51.590> he's<00:06:51.680> got<00:06:51.890> two<00:06:51.920> arrows<00:06:52.460> just<00:06:52.970> in<00:06:53.060> case<00:06:53.210> you

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
and he's got two arrows just in case you

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.560 
and he's got two arrows just in case you
lose<00:06:53.360> one<00:06:53.720> no<00:06:54.500> snow<00:06:54.920> quiver<00:06:55.910> forum<00:06:56.420> because

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.570 
lose one no snow quiver forum because

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.940 
lose one no snow quiver forum because
he's<00:06:56.750> already<00:06:56.900> got<00:06:57.110> the<00:06:57.200> sores<00:06:57.440> on<00:06:57.620> his<00:06:57.710> back

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:57.950 
he's already got the sores on his back

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.830 
he's already got the sores on his back
but<00:06:58.730> I<00:06:58.760> figured<00:06:59.120> I'd<00:06:59.210> throw<00:06:59.240> them<00:06:59.540> in<00:06:59.660> there

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
but I figured I'd throw them in there

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.800 
but I figured I'd throw them in there
anyway<00:07:00.440> nice<00:07:00.770> little<00:07:01.150> extra<00:07:02.150> accessory<00:07:02.570> can't

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
anyway nice little extra accessory can't

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.900 
anyway nice little extra accessory can't
go<00:07:02.900> wrong<00:07:03.020> with<00:07:03.230> more<00:07:03.620> accessories<00:07:04.330> and

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:06.910 
go wrong with more accessories and

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.010 
go wrong with more accessories and
that's<00:07:07.910> pretty<00:07:08.150> much<00:07:08.270> the<00:07:08.390> rundown<00:07:08.810> of<00:07:08.870> the

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.020 
that's pretty much the rundown of the

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.670 
that's pretty much the rundown of the
figure<00:07:09.440> it's<00:07:10.400> uh<00:07:10.990> not<00:07:11.990> not<00:07:12.350> the<00:07:12.410> most

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 
figure it's uh not not the most

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.130 
figure it's uh not not the most
complicated<00:07:13.130> figure<00:07:13.610> ever<00:07:13.850> but<00:07:14.570> I<00:07:14.600> think<00:07:15.050> it

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.140 
complicated figure ever but I think it

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.780 
complicated figure ever but I think it
really<00:07:15.170> comes<00:07:15.530> together<00:07:15.680> nicely<00:07:15.890> and<00:07:16.520> the

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:16.790 
really comes together nicely and the

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.490 
really comes together nicely and the
customer<00:07:17.180> is<00:07:17.240> happy<00:07:17.390> and<00:07:17.720> I'm<00:07:17.840> happy<00:07:18.020> with<00:07:18.290> it

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500 
customer is happy and I'm happy with it

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:25.300 
customer is happy and I'm happy with it
