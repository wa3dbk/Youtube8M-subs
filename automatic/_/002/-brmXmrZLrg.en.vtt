00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
at painting my nails perfectly how would

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.260 
at painting my nails perfectly how would
i<00:01:07.500> get<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.890> perfectly<00:01:08.340> painted<00:01:08.549> around<00:01:08.909> my

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
i get this perfectly painted around my

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
i get this perfectly painted around my
nails<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:09.930> actually<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.439> really<00:01:10.830> easy<00:01:11.040> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
nails but actually it's really easy to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.859 
nails but actually it's really easy to
use<00:01:11.310> because<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.030> little<00:01:12.240> bit<00:01:12.330> malleable

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
use because it's a little bit malleable

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.450 
use because it's a little bit malleable
and<00:01:13.110> once<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.470> get<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.189> kind<00:01:14.400> of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
and once you get it on you can kind of

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.039 
and once you get it on you can kind of
smoosh<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.030> work<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.270> into<00:01:15.450> place<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:15.960> it

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
smoosh it and work it into place so it

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.450 
smoosh it and work it into place so it
lines<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.409> perfectly<00:01:16.890> around<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.310> nails

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
lines up perfectly around your nails

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.820 
lines up perfectly around your nails
it's<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.450> easy<00:01:18.689> even<00:01:19.080> with<00:01:19.380> your<00:01:19.590> non-dominant

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
it's so easy even with your non-dominant

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.120 
it's so easy even with your non-dominant
hand<00:01:20.720> it's<00:01:21.720> also<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.110> really<00:01:22.470> cool<00:01:22.680> tool<00:01:22.890> for

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
so I paint polish on in one color and

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.030 
so I paint polish on in one color and
then<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.689> use<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.960> liquid<00:01:28.140> palisade<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.920> do<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
then I use the liquid palisade to do a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.280 
then I use the liquid palisade to do a
crescent-shaped<00:01:29.549> here<00:01:30.090> paint<00:01:30.720> another<00:01:30.930> color
