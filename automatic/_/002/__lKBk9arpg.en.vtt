 to bring the tuning goodbye to calls 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.400
 this application for what it serves us good 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.200
 this application helps us to add 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.200
 textures to our magic mouse 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.630
 but this one 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:48.050
 textures and can add them and innovate 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.010
 that is the whole system of the imac for you 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.010
 we can add 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:01:03.830
 good to add a new texture 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:07.250
 come on let's give it acnur if it's going to 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:12.950
 leave here the settings good adjustments 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:16.430
 that's how we're going to select the function of 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.830
 gesture so say what he wants 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:24.740
 May it be me, I 'm energized right now 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.900
 with the three fingers on the mouse and here 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.330
 we can put the function for the keyboard 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:34.060
 and if you have more pain etc 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.060
 and here the function 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.300
 and I 'm going to show you how the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.600
 mouse and the three fingers I'm going to apply are 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.600
 13 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.880
 I also have the function as they can 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.420
 see this here 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.979
 with three fingers 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.170
 with the 3 to 2 on his side to the right he had 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.180
 the brightness and with three fingers to the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.180
 left under wine 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.410
 another function that adds us by default 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.590
 this application this is something that 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.070
 can do as in windows this that by 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.360
 example here I would have to crowd this and 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.360
 if we do it to the corner 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.769
 it accommodates us in the corner if 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.140
 we make the nerve we raise our 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.870
 full screen if we do it to a 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:42.150
 half of us 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.440
 the page and I think it's a good 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.799
 I recommend for those who have 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.900
 controlled the operating system is already coming 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:52.830
 perfect with the simple ones like you 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.379
 they know online of we see them then they 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.410
 I recommend that if we go to writing 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:00.300
 three fingers up 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.070
