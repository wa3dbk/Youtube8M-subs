00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:13.020
 hello today I chose a recipe that 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:16.470
 called gypsy arm as you know is a 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:21.310
 square thin sponge cake 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.730
 and I've chosen it from the base blog and enjoy 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.039
 in the blog they say it's very simple 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.430
 I will explain it in the sign language of 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.430
 agreement 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.899
 you need 120 grams of flour 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.450
 120 grams of sugar 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:52.080
 4 eggs 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.080
 I have added the juice of an orange 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:10.720
 The first thing we will do is turn on the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.720
 180 degree oven 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.320
 in a bowl we put the sugar and the eggs 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.930
 we will beat for 10 minutes 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.930
 because it must double its volume 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.460
 now 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.680
 we will throw the flour with the help of a 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.790
 colander we will make 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.730
 the technique of sifting 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.790
 we will mix carefully with movements 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.790
 envelopes to prevent the dough from falling 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.610
 in a tray we will place the paper of 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.210
 oven in the base 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.630
 pour the dough and we must extend it 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.260
 so that it is the same thickness throughout 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.260
 the tray 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:28.600
 We introduce the tray in the oven for 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.600
 10-12 minutes approximately 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.210
 when we finish we now take a 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.260
 rag that should be wet we will place 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:47.340
 over the cake and we're rolling it 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.880
 little by little we will leave it rolled up 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.880
 let it cool 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:13.590
 I smeared him with desire of chocolate as 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.530
 it is done in a pot we put the 200 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.109
 milliliters of liquid cream when 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:24.340
 begin to boil remove 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.040
 and we added sliced ​​200 grams of 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.860
 black chocolate 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:34.100
 we'll see until it gets mixed 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:37.310
 completely and let cool 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.210
 we develop the cake and we count it 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:46.630
 inside with the desire we go back to 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.630
 roll and cover on the outside too 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.979
 I decorate it with pink shavings and 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.979
 white above
