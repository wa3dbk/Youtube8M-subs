00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:30.869
 we see a stand writing like 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.700
 the rechargeable batteries are created lektorate 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.850
 is pulled out and so on and so on 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.850
 on 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.399
 market experts lifestyle 38 break like that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.210
 100 nice everything in German again 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.160
 written 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.949
 original instructions apparently not 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:01:04.500
 the lightning itself was planned 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:18.810
 but in a small children's heart already 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:23.090
 have its nice size at the switch 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.090
 we connect for a battery pack 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:44.840
 that is the synchronous connection rich out 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:48.509
 After all, metal- typical types of grape are there 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.799
 one has very nice with us 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.799
 usually not in danger 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.840
 You can also see the colors 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.840
 very easy to pull out 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:19.069
 that's in the box now i have that 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.470
 Stand mounted is mine 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.590
 noticed that the small flap the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.320
 the synchronous connection does not cover 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.590
 really on her place unfortunately holds 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.120
 a small miss the 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.360
 recesses in the middle seems a bit too 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.600
 you have to be big either 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.200
 trifle with insulating tape or 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.320
 similar remedy or the card cup 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.610
 maybe make it up 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.950
 otherwise I wanted the stand now 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.340
 just off again and is there 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:56.480
 me the typical problem of these three 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.580
 wheels again come 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.860
 I just get it more loose and if 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:06.440
 I loose now I'll take him 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.930
 also the first time in operation with two 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.790
 hands , I succeeded in doing that 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.760
 I succeed with one normally 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.680
 could solve the turn team again 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.390
 here is the power of one place here 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.480
 does not exist apparently double 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.310
 but better if he is with there 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.380
 really stuck when under it 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.500
 would fall and mounted on the tripod 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:32.959
 is and it may break this way 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.250
 I think he now sees what once 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.650
 actually quite nice from 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.720
 small blue lights leds and marts 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.940
 the strength in manual mode is set 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.320
 then just over here the plus and 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.709
 minus button no goes without one now 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.840
 additional button to press 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:04:01.420
 I can also use the mode myself 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:04.540
 once to change the mode pressure 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:11.739
 I can always change the intensity 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:13.330
 no matter in which mode I am and it 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:20.459
 Of course there is the obligatory test 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:20.459
 button supported 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.760
 of course with the intensity of the 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.760
 you just set
