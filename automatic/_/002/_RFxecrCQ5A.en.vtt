was i mean you know that's what happens
in<00:00:37.950> like<00:00:38.129> high<00:00:39.090> variance<00:00:39.510> tournaments<00:00:40.079> when

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
in like high variance tournaments when

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.720 
in like high variance tournaments when
the<00:00:40.379> blinds<00:00:40.590> are<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:40.950> high<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.460> stacks

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the blinds are really high in the stacks

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.450 
the blinds are really high in the stacks
are<00:00:41.940> shallow<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.390> know<00:00:42.800> just<00:00:43.800> how<00:00:44.280> you're

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
are shallow you know just how you're

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.100 
are shallow you know just how you're
supposed<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.850> play<00:00:45.030> him<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.329> know<00:00:45.480> high

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
supposed to play him you know high

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.350 
supposed to play him you know high
variance<00:00:46.590> tournament<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.129> sounds<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:47.940> an

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
variance tournament that sounds like an

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.510 
variance tournament that sounds like an
internet<00:00:49.020> term<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.590> only<00:00:49.829> an<00:00:49.980> online<00:00:50.280> player

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
internet term that only an online player

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.400 
internet term that only an online player
would<00:00:51.059> use<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.690> actually<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:52.079> bit<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.320> an

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
would use it's actually a bit of an

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.990 
would use it's actually a bit of an
oxymoron<00:00:52.590> cuz<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.520> know<00:00:53.610> when<00:00:53.789> there's<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
oxymoron cuz you know when there's a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.970 
oxymoron cuz you know when there's a
tournament<00:00:54.270> there's<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.930> know<00:00:54.989> obviously<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
tournament there's you know obviously a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.650 
tournament there's you know obviously a
ton<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> variance<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> ton<00:00:57.600> of

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
ton of variance and you know a ton of

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.729 
ton of variance and you know a ton of
like<00:00:58.789> unjust<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.969> know<00:01:00.030> push<00:01:00.359> fold<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:01.559> true

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
like unjust you know push fold it's true

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.979 
like unjust you know push fold it's true
high<00:01:01.949> variance<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.430> completely<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.629> it's

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
high variance is completely it it's it's

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.899 
high variance is completely it it's it's
a<00:01:04.880> redundant<00:01:05.880> yeah<00:01:06.570> yeah<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:08.159> what's<00:01:08.400> what's

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
a redundant yeah yeah so what's what's

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.250 
a redundant yeah yeah so what's what's
going<00:01:09.180> forward<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.689> you're<00:01:09.900> 20<00:01:10.229> years

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
going forward for you you're 20 years

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.980 
going forward for you you're 20 years
old<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> huge<00:01:11.729> splash<00:01:11.939> from<00:01:12.689> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
old so this is a huge splash from a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.870 
old so this is a huge splash from a
circuit<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.979> pretty<00:01:14.280> much<00:01:14.460> well<00:01:14.700> known

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
circuit that is pretty much well known

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.730 
circuit that is pretty much well known
in<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> state<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.290> think<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.500> will

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
in the state so do you think that will

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.469 
in the state so do you think that will
lead<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.920> more<00:01:17.130> success<00:01:17.340> stateside<00:01:17.939> when<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
lead to more success stateside when you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.590 
lead to more success stateside when you
turn<00:01:18.630> 21<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.049> February<00:01:19.530> um<00:01:20.060> hopefully<00:01:21.060> you

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
turn 21 in February um hopefully you

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.710 
turn 21 in February um hopefully you
know<00:01:21.689> I'll<00:01:21.720> keep<00:01:22.560> playing<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.100> think<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.720> really

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
know I'll keep playing I think I really

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.210 
know I'll keep playing I think I really
want<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.900> go<00:01:24.990> back<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.170> school<00:01:25.409> actually<00:01:25.710> but

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220
