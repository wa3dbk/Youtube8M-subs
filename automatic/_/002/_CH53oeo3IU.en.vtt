 Greetings to all of us here we are again 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.420
 with very little and this time we are going to 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.869
 teach them how to give root access to their 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.210
 android in this case an lg of 510 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.630
 by using this tool that 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.730
 it's called super a clip for it you have to 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.279
 have a few elements before 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.800
 start to proceed first to have 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.530
 installed of course the tool in 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.629
 the computer then you have to have 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.120
 installed although they are the drivers or 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.379
 drivers of your device then 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.539
 let's leave the link in the description 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.460
 of the video and asia the program and the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.489
 driver or drivers so you can the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.370
 computer recognize the device a 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.559
 Once connected using the USB cable 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.449
 you also have to prepare the device 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.649
 or enable what is what is the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.690
 debug usb let's go to menu inside 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.270
 from the menu let's go to settings and inside 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.950
 of settings let's go to applications 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.439
 of applications let's go to the option 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.719
 where the development says and you have to have 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.939
 activated or pigeon gives this option where 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.340
 they say t per action a western one time 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.670
 done this we are going to connect the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.539
 device using the usb cable to the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.929
 computer and let's decompress this 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.640
 file let's decompress it once that 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.119
 compressed will open a folder 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.789
 like this one with these files and we're going to 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.869
 execute or throw block the super one 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:42.000
 click through the sad mouse clip and 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.799
 let's adjust it as administrator and 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.840
 we will get a screen like the one 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.610
 come next let's go to remove 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.849
 this folder that we no longer need 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.009
 let's say we're going to thunder next 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.530
 and this styler screens will come out 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.020
 with different options we are going to 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.360
 select this option instead of auto 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.369
 we are going to select this option later 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.590
 we are simply going to give this option 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.179
 where ruth says wait for the program 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.160
 recognize the device that you 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.250
 feed this process 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.560
 to show what the device is but 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.260
 you do not touch anything until it ends 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.450
 all because the process ends if all 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.490
 is going perfect a poster where 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.950
 it says here that in the routing facility 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.260
 has been completed now when they go to their 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.870
 Android device in this case with the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.190
 lg the client 10 will see an icon of 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.230
 an application that is called super 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.990
 bussereau superuser in this way already 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.090
 he has complete control where 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.730
 can eliminate those applications 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.980
 that introduce the company as games 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.200
 so as applications only we 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.730
 they serve to be occupying space 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.470
 new romÃ¡n in case you want 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.080
 update your device 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.270
 andrew a new version and do not have to 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.800
 wait so long until the 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.170
 version or update of the version 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.550
 of your device before but I think that 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.100
 you should throw over everything 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.990
 they are useful is owners with 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.230
 an android device in this case a 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.570
 LG GD510 can give root access to your 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.400
 smartphone or you must subscribe to the 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.170
 house that likes the video any 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.780
 doubt any suggestion leave us the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.780
