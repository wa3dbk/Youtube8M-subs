00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.260
 if you ran from this melody 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.510
 goosebumps if clicks for you 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.670
 buttons are nicer than anything in the world 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.950
 if you have not lost forgotten 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.990
 humanity secret skill set 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.000
 text message in your pocket well or do you have 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.070
 compact tablet that you everywhere 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.500
 carry with you and the smartphone has only become 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.900
 food demanding burden 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.570
 In general, for those and for other pins 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.570
 presented a mobile phone nokia 515 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.930
 in a big way all modern smartphones 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.200
 these are rectangles of different lengths and 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.030
 thickness era crazy design ideas 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.510
 sank into oblivion along with push-button 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.620
 phones with their variety of forms 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.340
 key layout and all that 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.340
 other things 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.590
 but with the design of 515 nokia decided not 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.170
 to risk and make both atoms strict 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.180
 rear removable cover bath done 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.640
 from aluminum with two plastic 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.860
 inserts apparently for NTV 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.380
 under it is a removable battery and 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.110
 two SIM card slots 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.880
 and the number two is even spring-loaded but 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.100
 From the first sim card to get much less 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.070
 conveniently located immediately slot for micro 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.710
 sd card on the entire front panel takes 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.570
 although something I talked half in 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.330
 front panel occupies display 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.610
 24 inches under which 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.159
 there is a traditional but Kiev block 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.530
 keys to know the remaining hole for 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.360
 microphone made of glossy plastic with white 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.100
 backlit because of what to consider 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.020
 inscriptions on them sunny day is enough 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.600
 problematic at least in our 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.640
 snow-white phone keys with time 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.259
 there will be scratch here the notation on them 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.540
 will remain as they are hidden under 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.360
 Plastic number keys are enough 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.520
 comfortable with a nice deep stroke though 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.320
 We are located close to each other but 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.180
 large central button left 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.520
 navigation frame quite a bit 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.229
 places now and then poke not there in general 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.970
 not the most comfortable keyboard of those 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.400
 I came across a mobile phone 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.190
 maybe I just lost the habit of 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.510
 anyway such nostalgia to 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.510
 Sasha how to lock the keyboard 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.350
 menu asterisk build quality in general 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.110
 very good but in the lower right 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.180
 cover a little backlash as always possible 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.520
 put the paper as a good old 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.800
 By the way, the smartphone understands the best 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.840
 traditions apple hole in the company 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.060
 the bottom of which I initially took 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.700
 for the second microphone is a hole 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.430
 for a complete clip we poke there and 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.560
 voila the back cover is moving away a little 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.850
 after which it is much easier to remove but 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.830
 if it was not at hand 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.170
 sharp object can be the old fashioned way 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.540
 nails the external speaker is located on 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.540
 back panel and it sounds very loud and 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.400
 Clearly tft display 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.950
 and yet more like guests from 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.260
 Past diagonal 24 inch viewing angles 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.970
 such an image at the slightest 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.940
 rejection turns into Soviet 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.070
 three-dimensional postcard only 262 thousand 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.560
 colors brightness is enough for 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.110
 dialing a phone number and from on bright 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.000
 the sun and there is no adjustment sensor but 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.550
 there is a small touch of modernity and 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.530
 premium screen covered with protective glass 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.230
 gorilla glass 2 scratch resistant 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.600
 about the technical characteristics of a special 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.850
 sense to say no yes nokia them and not 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.390
 reveals the only thing that is known so 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.120
 this is what the ROM size is 150 megabytes of RAM 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.550
 64 megabytes enough 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.250
 to run a snake well or any other 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.470
 java applications or games but what has 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.780
 the value is so is the battery capacity 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.330
 which is fully consistent with modern 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.180
 1200 milliampere hours 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.370
 this is enough for 8-10 days communion 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.380
 a half talk a day most likely 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.630
 not one smartphone will not be able to provide 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.160
 you have such autonomy even if you 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.530
 will only use it in 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.740
 As dialer charged by Naki 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.870
 micro and beat 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.660
 food does not have to shout at the scales out 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.430
 who has a slim charger to Noky 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.520
 thin not thick 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.200
 the basics of a nokia s40 platform phone with 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.030
 which i 'm sure faced 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.800
 almost everything and there is little 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.110
 changed except what appeared 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.030
 firmware update by air and even yourself 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.950
 began to unite in dialogue is here 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.600
 preloaded facebook application 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.520
 twitter youtube but hardly anyone 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.460
 will want to use them on a constant 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.380
 basis yes and Wi-Fi there is no only 3g 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.140
 unless you can not live without social 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.730
 networks and your smartphone or tablet 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.750
 discharged the rest is just tolerated for 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.090
 nearest outlet 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.940
 the browser loads the page in full 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.750
 format well, who cares the main thing 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.670
 calls and there 515 everything is fine excellent 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.740
 call quality is very good reception 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.420
 support for two simok implemented without 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.400
 Every time you need to will 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.050
 choose where to call send 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.920
 text message while you map go online 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.900
 however 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.240
 given the presence of buttons under your finger 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.330
 it does not bother at all, but what can 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.670
 and you need to put 515 rubles 3 so this 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.910
 no built-in sync with 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.740
 google hellish contacts 2013 already need 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.440
 it was somehow more comfortable to organize 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.380
 the camera in the device is she one she on 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.360
 5 megapixels without autofocus it is very 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.650
 average photographs and shoots video in 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.650
 320 by 240 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.089
 that's all i can say about the camera 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:28.330
 in nokia 515 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:31.119
 if now was 99, the conclusions 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.430
 would look something like this company 

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:35.740
 nokia introduced gorgeous 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.199
 premium metal phone with 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.860
 support of two huge sim cards 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:44.099
 display and camera 5 megapixels and 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.779
 another comfortable backlit keyboard 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.729
 speaker with polyphony but while working 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:51.969
 at quite standard intel level 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.860
 one and a half well, the revolutionary price of 170 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:57.879
 dollars does not leave a competitor 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.699
 no chance in 2013 I would have removed from 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:02.199
 text words about the camera display and price 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.459
 which still should be 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.069
 somewhat less 

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:08.709
 grandchildren seemed to have overheard the conversation and 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:11.020
 outlet managers with customers who 

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:12.899
 still want something with buttons 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.029
 to be sure with two sim cards 

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:18.249
 to be sure nokia in metal 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:20.319
 well, and not ashamed to get out 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:24.669
 pockets too gentlemen here's his phone 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:26.620
 your dream and if not for such a 99 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.629
 would have to give my soul to the devil 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.269
 now it can get 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:33.430
 almost everyone do not forget to put 

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:35.999
