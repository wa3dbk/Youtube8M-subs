00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:19.150
 at the blackest marched he seemed to be fracchia 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.770
 then who is there and the collaboration wants 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.349
 ask a question that raised his hand 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:29.619
 when this house we can ever do it 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:31.539
 said he was there before and I wanted to do one 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.650
 beautiful value to see them together 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.650
 first of all serious 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.239
 I would like to ask a question 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.970
 massimo lopez and ask him yes and 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.770
 ask him how his was born 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:58.309
 imitations in short, how guilt arise 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.350
 it's a nun it was the fault 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.690
 of a nun at school on the first day of 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.940
 elementary school 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:10.430
 because this nun I remember she said 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:13.880
 the Apulian team said children 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.070
 the secret to good learning and elections 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.670
 those watching wait while the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.289
 move your mouth to look only at 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.450
 mouth movements that remain there 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.280
 the speech after imprinted in the hood 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.440
 that speech I started at 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.080
 observe only the movement of the mouth 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.630
 without understanding anything about the content we say 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.610
 of the lesson then the observation but 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.500
 all the weird characters are me 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.360
 then everything happened there 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.530
 the as a child at school happened the 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.899
 professor profiles had one 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.340
 professor of art history who 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.310
 just made me get a little closer 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.289

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.009

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.539

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.230

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.270

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.860

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.840

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.780
 more because a character will come a little 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.970
 particularly an expert scholar 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.520
 of Kantian philosophy but me 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.740
 I recommend as a 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.520
 he is a small problem from time to time 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.050
 while he is speaking, he is really lost 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.540
 so please I beg you please 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.760
 make pretend nothing happened 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.090
 we can't wait for it to come 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.870
 obviously this professor the 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.630
 he arrives in the afternoon 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.220
 but the lesson in a compressor is here 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.050
 I introduce myself to the professor who will speak 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.580
 I recommend his Kantian one 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.330
 very skilled person please please yes 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.680
 Sit down 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.070
 a little hair is approaching all 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.890
 good morning good guys then today 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.590
 we'll talk about the philosophy of kant why 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.200
 the critique of pure reason and the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:27.330
 criticism of practical reason can 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:30.010
 to be put to today with phrases kakà kakà 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:35.170
 and professors but if it is one of those his 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:40.710
 moments so quiet it will recover e 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.710
 so we take up today the cat c 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:48.299
 then let's say the characters like that 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.530
 imitations were born a little spontaneous 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.530
 was the way
