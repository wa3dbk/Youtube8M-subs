00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.539
 I know very well what to tell you at this time 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:09.420
 that two minutes for the biggest battle of 

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:13.110
 our lives as professionals all 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.830
 is summarized to today or we consecrate ourselves as 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.020
 team we do not stay where we are 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.010
 judged by playing centimeter to 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.740
 centimeter until the final whistle we're 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.260
 at a vital crossroads we can 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.840
 stay there and they take out the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.660
 shit we can not fight for our 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.800
 way back to honor we can 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.440
 get out of this hell are you 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.680
 they can do it they are the only owners of 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.250
 your future no one else than you can 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.770
 make this story a legend 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.160
 to recover our honor that of you the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.969
 of the people you do not know very well the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.789
 life gives you and takes away that is part of the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.520
 life but you only assume it when you 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.350
 remove those things that hurt you and you 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.470
 realize that life is only 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.590
 a game of centimeters and so is the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.500
 football because in any game in the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.650
 life or in football the margin of error 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.500
 it's very small half passed late to a 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.409
 advance invest half second very 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.960
 slow very fast and you can not get there 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.600
 all those centimeters that we need 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.630
 be there on the court to be in each 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.289
 moment of the game in each minute in each 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.080
 second in this team we fight for each 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.690
 piece of court in this team we 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.909
 we kill every inch by removing the 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.020
 rival because we know that if we add 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.110
 all those centimeters that's going to be the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.179
 point difference between winning and losing 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.640
 between living or dying between staying in 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.610
 shade or retrieve the category that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.940
 follow 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.660
 something else in any fight who is 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.360
 willing to die is who wins his place 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.850
 and I know that if they are willing to live 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.729
 it's because they're still willing to 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.490
 fight and die on the court for that 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.460
 centimeter that we lack because that is 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.840
 what it means to live being willing to 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.840
 die for what one loves 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.440
 we have fought a year to recover 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.670
 our respect we are a team with 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.350
 story that you should not be where it is 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.480
 let's return the joy to our people 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:40.420
 to us to our children now now 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.420
 I can not force them to do it alone 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.880
 Just look at your classmates 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.490
 look them in the eyes and you will see a man 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.550
 willing to run every inch of the 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.110
 court for you look at them lead a 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.080
 man who is willing to die for 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.770
 this team because he knows that you 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.460
 they will do the same for him that's a team 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.950
 boys because we win now as a 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.730
 team we do not get lost in the shadows 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.810
 as individuals that is soccer gentlemen 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.810
 that's all it is
