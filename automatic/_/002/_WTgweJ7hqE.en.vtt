I've done that just to give me a larger
graduation<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.760> color<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.630> i<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.900> create

to<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.630> able<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.900> make<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.170> glass<00:01:10.409> look

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
to be able to make this glass look

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.210 
to be able to make this glass look
three-dimensional<00:01:11.869> now<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.049> really<00:01:13.590> amazing

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
three-dimensional now one really amazing

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.890 
three-dimensional now one really amazing
thing<00:01:14.400> about<00:01:14.520> distress<00:01:15.119> inks<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.450> how<00:01:15.630> well

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
thing about distress inks is how well

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.660 
thing about distress inks is how well
they<00:01:16.110> blend<00:01:16.470> together<00:01:16.799> how<00:01:17.189> will<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:17.460> work

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
they blend together how will they work

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.090 
they blend together how will they work
together<00:01:17.880> when<00:01:18.240> they're<00:01:18.420> mixed<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:18.840> water

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
together when they're mixed with water

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.890 
together when they're mixed with water
but<00:01:20.100> for<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.549> particular<00:01:20.909> image<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.659> don't

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
but for this particular image I don't

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.840 
but for this particular image I don't
want<00:01:22.170> them<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> mix<00:01:22.740> once<00:01:23.189> I've<00:01:23.340> finished<00:01:23.369> this

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
want them to mix once I've finished this

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.370 
want them to mix once I've finished this
part<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> glass<00:01:24.479> because<00:01:25.020> I'm<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
part of the glass because I'm going to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.630 
part of the glass because I'm going to
be<00:01:25.439> putting<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.740> completely<00:01:26.189> different<00:01:26.490> color

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
be putting a completely different color

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.200 
be putting a completely different color
inside<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.330> glass<00:01:27.890> so<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> discovered<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.700> my

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
inside the glass so I discovered that my

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.230 
inside the glass so I discovered that my
prismacolor<00:01:30.930> colorless<00:01:31.650> blender<00:01:31.829> pencil<00:01:32.549> was

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
prismacolor colorless blender pencil was

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.950 
prismacolor colorless blender pencil was
a<00:01:33.270> really<00:01:33.780> good<00:01:34.909> source<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.090> putting<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.540> resist

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
a really good source of putting a resist

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.870 
a really good source of putting a resist
over<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> top<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.829> because<00:01:38.369> prismacolor

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
over the top of it because prismacolor

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.910 
over the top of it because prismacolor
pencils<00:01:39.030> are<00:01:39.360> waxy<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.680> meant<00:01:40.829> that

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
pencils are waxy so it just meant that

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.609 
pencils are waxy so it just meant that
the<00:01:41.220> colors<00:01:41.490> weren't<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.329> blend<00:01:42.619> I'm

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the colors weren't going to blend I'm

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.200 
the colors weren't going to blend I'm
using<00:01:43.860> three<00:01:44.250> distress<00:01:44.640> colors<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
using three distress colors for the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.660 
using three distress colors for the
drink<00:01:45.479> scattered<00:01:46.409> straw<00:01:46.680> shabby<00:01:47.310> shutters

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
drink scattered straw shabby shutters

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.429 
drink scattered straw shabby shutters
and<00:01:47.880> peeled<00:01:48.180> paint<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.960> I'm<00:01:49.020> starting<00:01:49.259> off

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
and peeled paint so I'm starting off

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.260 
and peeled paint so I'm starting off
with<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.649> diluted<00:01:50.130> version<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.610> scattered

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
with a diluted version of scattered

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.940 
with a diluted version of scattered
straw<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.290> create<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> bit<00:01:52.860> of

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
straw and that's just to create a bit of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.920 
straw and that's just to create a bit of
warmth<00:01:53.250> underneath<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.909> green<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.360> then

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
warmth underneath the green and then

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.020 
warmth underneath the green and then
over<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> top<00:01:55.500> shabby<00:01:56.070> shutters<00:01:56.399> now<00:01:56.909> you'll

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
over the top shabby shutters now you'll

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.490 
over the top shabby shutters now you'll
be<00:01:57.060> able<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.360> see<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.750> moment<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.320> I'm

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
be able to see in a moment that I'm

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.560 
be able to see in a moment that I'm
using<00:01:58.710> quite<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.070> bit<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.369> water<00:01:59.610> in<00:01:59.880> with<00:02:00.360> these

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
using quite a bit of water in with these

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.330 
using quite a bit of water in with these
and<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.320> reason<00:02:01.680> for<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.009> because<00:02:02.040> i

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and the reason for that is because i

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.730 
and the reason for that is because i
want<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.210> deeper<00:02:03.810> colors<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.409> see<00:02:04.560> there

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
want the deeper colors you can see there

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.830 
want the deeper colors you can see there
lots<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.979> water<00:02:05.159> there<00:02:05.790> deeper<00:02:06.270> colors<00:02:06.540> i<00:02:06.630> want

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
lots of water there deeper colors i want

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.080 
lots of water there deeper colors i want
them<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.140> be<00:02:07.259> able<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.649> bleed<00:02:07.979> into<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.879> rest

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
them to be able to bleed into the rest

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.639 
them to be able to bleed into the rest
of<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.300> color<00:02:09.479> which<00:02:09.780> you'll<00:02:09.929> see<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.140> here

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
of the color which you'll see just here

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.520 
of the color which you'll see just here
so<00:02:11.640> that's<00:02:11.879> just<00:02:12.060> dabbing

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
so that's just dabbing

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.000 
so that's just dabbing
tiny<00:02:13.709> bits<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.720> shabby<00:02:15.720> shutters<00:02:16.140> all<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.920> way

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
tiny bits of shabby shutters all the way

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.320 
tiny bits of shabby shutters all the way
along<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.400> edge<00:02:17.520> because<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.090> how<00:02:18.209> I'm

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
along the edge because this is how I'm

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.110 
along the edge because this is how I'm
going<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.540> create<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.290> shadows<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:20.880> really

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
going to create the shadows you really

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.570 
going to create the shadows you really
do<00:02:21.209> want<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.480> be<00:02:21.660> able<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:22.160> layer<00:02:23.160> up<00:02:23.430> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
do want to be able to layer up the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.990 
do want to be able to layer up the
colors<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.980> then<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.190> able<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.550> take<00:02:26.730> away

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
colors and then be able to take away

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.260 
colors and then be able to take away
bits<00:02:27.569> if<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.840> need<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:29.069> lot<00:02:29.430> easier<00:02:29.610> to

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
bits if you need to it's a lot easier to

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.960 
bits if you need to it's a lot easier to
add<00:02:30.390> color<00:02:30.660> than<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.290> take<00:02:31.470> away<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
add color than it is to take away so the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.600 
add color than it is to take away so the
best<00:02:33.150> thing<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.630> go<00:02:34.410> slowly<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.010> layer<00:02:35.580> it

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
best thing is to go slowly and layer it

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.720 
best thing is to go slowly and layer it
up<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.930> after<00:02:37.110> shabby<00:02:37.590> shudders<00:02:37.920> um<00:02:38.160> I've

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
up so after shabby shudders um I've

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.600 
up so after shabby shudders um I've
added<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:39.870> some<00:02:39.900> peeled<00:02:40.590> paint<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:41.370> around

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
added in some peeled paint just around

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.610 
added in some peeled paint just around
the<00:02:41.730> edges<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.239> then<00:02:42.750> I've<00:02:42.870> gone<00:02:43.020> back<00:02:43.290> again

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
the edges and then I've gone back again

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.560 
the edges and then I've gone back again
with<00:02:43.980> shabby<00:02:44.250> shutters<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.819> just<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.360> blend

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
with shabby shutters and just to blend

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.940 
with shabby shutters and just to blend
that<00:02:45.810> through<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:46.620> see<00:02:46.800> it's

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
that through so you can see it's

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.400 
that through so you can see it's
starting<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.550> take<00:02:47.730> form<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.989> look<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.290> a

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
starting to take form of the look of a

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.530 
starting to take form of the look of a
drink<00:02:49.650> inside<00:02:49.950> now<00:02:50.850> over<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.180> top<00:02:51.360> I'm

putting more scattered straw I know that

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.490 
putting more scattered straw I know that
might<00:02:53.940> seem<00:02:54.120> like<00:02:54.300> an<00:02:54.390> odd<00:02:54.540> choice<00:02:54.750> but<00:02:55.260> again

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
might seem like an odd choice but again

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.440 
might seem like an odd choice but again

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
peeled paint it really is very easy

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.110 
peeled paint it really is very easy
sometimes<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.370> takes<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.640> bit<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.790> getting<00:03:35.910> used

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
sometimes it takes a bit of getting used

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.930 
sometimes it takes a bit of getting used
to<00:03:36.420> being<00:03:36.720> able<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.110> get<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.040> water<00:03:38.220> colors<00:03:38.700> to

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
to being able to get the water colors to

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.370 
to being able to get the water colors to
bleed<00:03:39.390> in<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.630> way<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.019> want<00:03:40.140> them<00:03:40.260> to

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
bleed in the way that you want them to

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.699 
bleed in the way that you want them to
you<00:03:40.620> bleed<00:03:40.799> into<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.130> water<00:03:41.510> but<00:03:42.510> it's<00:03:42.840> such<00:03:43.680> a

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
you bleed into the water but it's such a

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.199 
you bleed into the water but it's such a
pretty<00:03:44.040> effect<00:03:45.079> when<00:03:46.079> it<00:03:46.200> works<00:03:46.290> well<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:47.209> so

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
pretty effect when it works well and so

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.849 
pretty effect when it works well and so
I<00:03:48.480> think<00:03:48.870> probably<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.200> predominant<00:03:49.709> color

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
I think probably the predominant color

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.229 
I think probably the predominant color
that<00:03:50.040> I've<00:03:50.130> used<00:03:50.310> here<00:03:50.519> is<00:03:50.609> shabby<00:03:50.910> shutters

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
that I've used here is shabby shutters

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.030 
that I've used here is shabby shutters
but<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.019> other<00:03:52.049> two<00:03:52.350> colors<00:03:52.500> really<00:03:52.829> are

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
but the other two colors really are

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.220 
but the other two colors really are
important<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:54.510> add<00:03:54.660> some<00:03:54.810> extra<00:03:55.019> definition

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
important to add some extra definition

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.199 
important to add some extra definition
I'm<00:03:55.739> going<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.220> be<00:03:56.340> using<00:03:56.489> some<00:03:56.820> charcoal

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
I'm going to be using some charcoal

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.699 
I'm going to be using some charcoal
which<00:03:57.480> is<00:03:57.600> a<00:03:57.660> technique<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.140> first<00:03:58.410> learnt<00:03:58.590> from

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
which is a technique I first learnt from

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.490 
which is a technique I first learnt from
Kim<00:03:58.920> Teasdale<00:03:59.340> I'm<00:03:59.519> using<00:04:00.510> these<00:04:00.870> special

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
Kim Teasdale I'm using these special

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.229 
Kim Teasdale I'm using these special
brushes<00:04:01.709> called<00:04:02.130> color<00:04:02.400> shapers<00:04:02.880> which<00:04:03.090> are<00:04:03.209> a

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
brushes called color shapers which are a

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.199 
brushes called color shapers which are a
silicon<00:04:03.690> ended<00:04:03.989> brush<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.940> they're<00:04:05.940> going<00:04:06.120> to

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
silicon ended brush and they're going to

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.759 
silicon ended brush and they're going to
help<00:04:06.450> me<00:04:06.570> to<00:04:06.720> be<00:04:06.840> able<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.140> put<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.410> charcoal

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
help me to be able to put the charcoal

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.420 
help me to be able to put the charcoal
down<00:04:08.040> nice<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.519> softly<00:04:09.320> I'll<00:04:10.320> use<00:04:10.590> one<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.250> put

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
down nice and softly I'll use one to put

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.330 
down nice and softly I'll use one to put
the<00:04:11.519> charcoal<00:04:11.850> down<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.380> another<00:04:13.380> to<00:04:14.040> blend

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
the charcoal down and another to blend

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.099 
the charcoal down and another to blend
it<00:04:14.489> out<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.670> little<00:04:14.850> bit<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.209> tend<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:15.840> be<00:04:15.959> really

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
it out a little bit I tend to be really

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.840 
it out a little bit I tend to be really
heavy-handed<00:04:16.500> with<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.950> charcoal<00:04:17.280> pencil<00:04:17.340> and

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
heavy-handed with a charcoal pencil and

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.849 
heavy-handed with a charcoal pencil and
i<00:04:18.390> end<00:04:18.600> up<00:04:18.720> with<00:04:18.780> those<00:04:19.019> pencil<00:04:19.500> lines<00:04:19.530> around

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
i end up with those pencil lines around

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.710 
i end up with those pencil lines around
my<00:04:20.100> drawing<00:04:20.430> which<00:04:20.640> are<00:04:20.880> not<00:04:21.060> very<00:04:21.209> easy<00:04:21.359> to

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
my drawing which are not very easy to

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.330 
my drawing which are not very easy to
blend<00:04:21.900> away<00:04:22.080> particularly<00:04:22.890> if<00:04:23.039> you're<00:04:23.190> heavy

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
blend away particularly if you're heavy

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.310 
blend away particularly if you're heavy
handed<00:04:23.700> so<00:04:24.450> that's<00:04:24.630> why<00:04:24.750> i'm<00:04:24.840> using<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.169> color

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
handed so that's why i'm using the color

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.180 
handed so that's why i'm using the color
tapers

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
tapers

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.280 
tapers
so<00:04:26.820> you<00:04:26.880> can<00:04:27.030> see<00:04:27.210> all<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.390> darker<00:04:27.930> points

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
so you can see all the darker points

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.320 
so you can see all the darker points
where<00:04:28.470> I've<00:04:28.650> added<00:04:28.890> color<00:04:29.220> I'm<00:04:29.490> adding<00:04:30.210> a

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
where I've added color I'm adding a

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.090 
where I've added color I'm adding a
little<00:04:30.720> bit<00:04:30.840> of<00:04:30.960> charcoal<00:04:31.410> just<00:04:31.830> so<00:04:31.920> I<00:04:31.950> can

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
little bit of charcoal just so I can

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.560 
little bit of charcoal just so I can
blend<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.520> along<00:04:32.730> there<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.120> create<00:04:33.270> that

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
blend it along there and create that

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.470 
blend it along there and create that
shadow<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:34.590> might<00:04:34.800> look<00:04:34.980> dark<00:04:35.610> at<00:04:35.820> first<00:04:36.090> but

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
shadow it might look dark at first but

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.140 
shadow it might look dark at first but
once<00:04:36.630> you<00:04:36.780> blend<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.230> out<00:04:37.380> it<00:04:38.100> really<00:04:38.610> is<00:04:38.820> such

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
once you blend it out it really is such

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.660 
once you blend it out it really is such
a<00:04:39.180> stunning<00:04:39.570> effect<00:04:39.750> being<00:04:40.380> able<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:40.860> just<00:04:41.130> add

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
a stunning effect being able to just add

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.060 
a stunning effect being able to just add
these<00:04:41.910> little<00:04:42.450> shadows<00:04:42.810> everywhere<00:04:43.170> that<00:04:43.980> it

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
these little shadows everywhere that it

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.240 
these little shadows everywhere that it
needs<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.430> be<00:04:44.550> now<00:04:44.990> I'm<00:04:45.990> adding<00:04:46.170> a<00:04:46.410> tiny<00:04:46.800> bit<00:04:47.100> of

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
needs to be now I'm adding a tiny bit of

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.580 
needs to be now I'm adding a tiny bit of
charcoal<00:04:47.670> just<00:04:48.420> around<00:04:48.780> where<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.080> curve<00:04:49.440> of

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
charcoal just around where the curve of

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.440 
charcoal just around where the curve of
the<00:04:49.740> glass<00:04:50.010> would<00:04:50.280> be<00:04:50.460> you<00:04:50.970> don't<00:04:51.150> want<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.360> put

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
the glass would be you don't want to put

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.300 
the glass would be you don't want to put
a<00:04:51.570> lot<00:04:51.780> there<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.260> just<00:04:52.500> want<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:52.770> tiny<00:04:53.010> bit

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
a lot there you just want a tiny bit

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.620 
a lot there you just want a tiny bit
just<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.640> create<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:54.060> illusion<00:04:54.330> of<00:04:54.570> that

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
just to create the illusion of that

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.800 
just to create the illusion of that
curve<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:56.040> if<00:04:56.580> you<00:04:57.090> can<00:04:57.270> get<00:04:57.390> it<00:04:57.480> going<00:04:57.660> in<00:04:57.750> a

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
curve and if you can get it going in a

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.630 
curve and if you can get it going in a
semi-circle<00:04:58.140> that<00:04:58.890> will<00:04:59.040> help<00:04:59.160> the<00:04:59.310> illusion

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
semi-circle that will help the illusion

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.370 
semi-circle that will help the illusion
as<00:04:59.730> well<00:04:59.910> and<00:05:00.120> then<00:05:00.330> just<00:05:00.540> softening<00:05:00.960> that<00:05:01.170> and

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
as well and then just softening that and

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.580 
as well and then just softening that and
it<00:05:02.310> really<00:05:02.880> is<00:05:03.090> amazing<00:05:03.330> how<00:05:03.720> much<00:05:03.900> just<00:05:04.530> a

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
it really is amazing how much just a

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.470 
it really is amazing how much just a
little<00:05:04.830> bit<00:05:04.920> of<00:05:05.010> charcoal<00:05:05.370> can<00:05:05.880> lift<00:05:06.120> your

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
little bit of charcoal can lift your

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.960 
little bit of charcoal can lift your
entire<00:05:06.780> image<00:05:07.280> now<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.340> really<00:05:08.730> make<00:05:08.850> this

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
entire image now to really make this

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.880 
entire image now to really make this

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
is i'm going to add an extra bit of

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.310 
is i'm going to add an extra bit of
charcoal<00:06:02.450> just<00:06:03.450> where<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:03.780> shadows<00:06:04.110> would

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
charcoal just where the shadows would

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.760 
charcoal just where the shadows would
fall<00:06:04.880> so<00:06:05.880> underneath<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:06.480> glass<00:06:06.630> only<00:06:07.320> a<00:06:07.350> tiny

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
fall so underneath the glass only a tiny

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.760 
fall so underneath the glass only a tiny
tiny<00:06:08.190> bit<00:06:08.400> there<00:06:09.020> underneath<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:10.140> bowl<00:06:10.650> of

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
tiny bit there underneath the bowl of

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.280 
tiny bit there underneath the bowl of
the<00:06:10.800> glass<00:06:11.040> and<00:06:11.419> more<00:06:12.419> around<00:06:12.810> the<00:06:12.930> bottom

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
the glass and more around the bottom

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.780 
the glass and more around the bottom
where<00:06:13.620> the<00:06:13.680> shadow<00:06:13.950> would<00:06:14.130> actually<00:06:14.580> fall

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
where the shadow would actually fall

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.320 
where the shadow would actually fall
underneath<00:06:15.510> the<00:06:15.750> glass<00:06:16.250> so<00:06:17.250> I'm<00:06:17.520> again<00:06:18.210> the

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
underneath the glass so I'm again the

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.820 
underneath the glass so I'm again the
same<00:06:18.510> way<00:06:18.630> that<00:06:18.750> I<00:06:18.840> work<00:06:19.020> with<00:06:19.050> watercolours

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
same way that I work with watercolours

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.010 
same way that I work with watercolours
is<00:06:19.980> to<00:06:20.550> start<00:06:20.790> off<00:06:20.850> lightly<00:06:21.150> and<00:06:21.480> add<00:06:21.840> a<00:06:21.870> little

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
is to start off lightly and add a little

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.900 
is to start off lightly and add a little
bit<00:06:22.169> more<00:06:22.380> as<00:06:22.560> you<00:06:22.650> need<00:06:22.830> to<00:06:22.860> so<00:06:23.520> that<00:06:23.669> you<00:06:23.760> can

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
bit more as you need to so that you can

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.580 
bit more as you need to so that you can
create<00:06:24.060> the<00:06:24.360> kind<00:06:24.540> of<00:06:24.600> depth<00:06:25.110> of<00:06:25.290> the<00:06:25.380> shadow

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
create the kind of depth of the shadow

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.330 
create the kind of depth of the shadow
that<00:06:26.130> you<00:06:26.250> want<00:06:26.430> to<00:06:26.460> create<00:06:26.730> and<00:06:27.650> i<00:06:28.650> think<00:06:28.919> that

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
that you want to create and i think that

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.659 
that you want to create and i think that
the<00:06:29.760> charcoal<00:06:30.290> really<00:06:31.290> does<00:06:31.470> just<00:06:32.100> add<00:06:32.340> that

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
the charcoal really does just add that

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.490 
the charcoal really does just add that
extra<00:06:32.880> effect<00:06:33.360> that<00:06:33.540> makes<00:06:33.690> the<00:06:33.870> entire<00:06:34.140> image

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
extra effect that makes the entire image

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.290 
extra effect that makes the entire image
pop

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.610 

so<00:06:38.300> once<00:06:38.510> I've<00:06:38.690> finished<00:06:38.720> with<00:06:39.110> the<00:06:39.290> charcoal

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
so once I've finished with the charcoal

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.470 
so once I've finished with the charcoal
I<00:06:39.830> have<00:06:40.040> one<00:06:40.340> final<00:06:40.610> thing<00:06:40.940> that<00:06:41.000> I'm<00:06:41.210> going<00:06:41.390> to

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.480 
I have one final thing that I'm going to

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.940 
I have one final thing that I'm going to
do<00:06:41.630> over<00:06:41.840> the<00:06:41.930> top<00:06:42.110> and<00:06:42.260> that's<00:06:42.440> to<00:06:42.680> apply

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
do over the top and that's to apply

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.240 
do over the top and that's to apply
glossy<00:06:43.430> accents<00:06:44.030> now<00:06:45.020> I<00:06:45.050> wanted<00:06:45.500> to<00:06:45.620> make<00:06:46.040> the

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
glossy accents now I wanted to make the

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.520 
glossy accents now I wanted to make the
glass<00:06:46.490> appeared<00:06:47.180> glass<00:06:47.420> like<00:06:47.720> so<00:06:47.960> I'm<00:06:48.230> just

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
glass appeared glass like so I'm just

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.350 
glass appeared glass like so I'm just
applying<00:06:48.800> glossy<00:06:49.160> accents<00:06:49.730> to<00:06:50.000> the<00:06:50.150> glass

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
applying glossy accents to the glass

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.510 
applying glossy accents to the glass
itself<00:06:50.600> so<00:06:50.960> not<00:06:51.200> to<00:06:51.350> the<00:06:51.440> line<00:06:51.620> just<00:06:52.250> to<00:06:52.370> the

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
itself so not to the line just to the

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.240 
itself so not to the line just to the
glass<00:06:52.730> and<00:06:53.380> that<00:06:54.380> will<00:06:54.560> just<00:06:54.590> add<00:06:54.920> that<00:06:55.040> extra

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
glass and that will just add that extra

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.520 
glass and that will just add that extra
Sheen<00:06:55.700> and<00:06:55.940> I<00:06:56.600> think<00:06:56.840> it<00:06:56.930> makes<00:06:57.110> the<00:06:57.320> glass

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
Sheen and I think it makes the glass
