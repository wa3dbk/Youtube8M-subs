had the floor tom then we look at the
symbols<00:00:26.220> got<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.180> wired<00:00:27.449> up<00:00:28.099> that<00:00:29.099> is

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
symbols got that wired up that is

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.880 
symbols got that wired up that is
actually<00:00:29.990> 1/8<00:00:31.610> wire<00:00:33.950> 2/4<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.160> wire<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.090> I

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
actually 1/8 wire 2/4 a wire that I

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.270 
actually 1/8 wire 2/4 a wire that I
custom-made<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> jack<00:00:39.239> here<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.870> I

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
custom-made and have a jack here that I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.020 
custom-made and have a jack here that I
can<00:00:41.280> plug<00:00:41.489> up<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.730> my<00:00:41.850> phone<00:00:42.890> iPad<00:00:43.890> or<00:00:44.370> whatever

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
can plug up to my phone iPad or whatever

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.940 
can plug up to my phone iPad or whatever
so<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.890> jam<00:00:46.890> out<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.250> some<00:00:48.559> my<00:00:49.559> favorite

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
so I can jam out to some my favorite

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.189 
so I can jam out to some my favorite
bands<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.640> stuff<00:00:50.820> that's<00:00:51.629> hooked<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
bands and stuff that's hooked up to the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.880 
bands and stuff that's hooked up to the
module<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.489> through<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
module and it's going through the

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.910 
module and it's going through the
receiver<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.050> media<00:00:58.500> hugged<00:00:58.710> up

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
receiver so I have the media hugged up

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.840 
receiver so I have the media hugged up
which<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.449> this<00:01:03.449> little<00:01:03.780> M<00:01:04.170> audio<00:01:06.409> interface

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
which is this little M audio interface

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.460 
which is this little M audio interface
to<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> light<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.540> blinking<00:01:09.960> that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
to see that the light is blinking that

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.020 
to see that the light is blinking that
means<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.920> connected<00:01:13.460> right<00:01:14.460> there<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.939> I

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
means it's connected right there and I

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.910 
means it's connected right there and I
have<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> laptop<00:01:16.159> hooked<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:19.470> stereo

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
have the laptop hooked up to the stereo

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.850 
have the laptop hooked up to the stereo
receiver<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.759> got<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.869> hooked<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.140> into<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
receiver I got it hooked up into the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.350 
receiver I got it hooked up into the
video<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.580> got<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.780> drum<00:01:25.170> module<00:01:26.180> hooked<00:01:27.180> up

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
video I got this drum module hooked up

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
into CD so on the receiver I can switch

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.620 
into CD so on the receiver I can switch
from<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.950> drum<00:01:32.220> kit<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:33.799> laptop<00:01:34.799> so

from the drum kit to laptop so

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.030 
from the drum kit to laptop so
I<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:37.260> actually<00:01:37.440> switch<00:01:38.150> back<00:01:39.150> over<00:01:39.300> all

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040
