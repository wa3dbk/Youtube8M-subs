earlier sessions have given some solid

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.129 
earlier sessions have given some solid
evidence<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.220> effect<00:00:08.250> that<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.900> rapture

Christ after the Tribulation Period will

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.670 
Christ after the Tribulation Period will
be<00:00:14.910> separated<00:00:15.480> by<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> seven-year<00:00:16.260> span<00:00:16.410> of

be separated by a seven-year span of

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.240 
be separated by a seven-year span of
time<00:00:17.090> that<00:00:18.090> evidence<00:00:18.690> would<00:00:18.960> rule<00:00:19.199> out<00:00:19.250> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
time that evidence would rule out the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.189 
time that evidence would rule out the
trumpet<00:00:20.670> at<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> rapture<00:00:21.060> being<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.750> same<00:00:22.020> as

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
trumpet at the rapture being the same as

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.080 
trumpet at the rapture being the same as
the<00:00:22.350> trumpet<00:00:22.800> at<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.430> second<00:00:23.820> coming<00:00:24.000> of

the trumpet at the second coming of

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.810 
the trumpet at the second coming of

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
Christ after the Tribulation Period in

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.290 
Christ after the Tribulation Period in
addition<00:00:27.680> we<00:00:28.680> noted<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.820> expression

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
addition we noted that the expression

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.690 
addition we noted that the expression
the<00:00:30.420> last<00:00:30.660> trumpet<00:00:31.199> tied<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
the last trumpet tied in with the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.120 
the last trumpet tied in with the
rapture<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.120> church<00:00:33.450> does<00:00:34.290> not<00:00:34.530> mean<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
rapture of the church does not mean the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.510 
rapture of the church does not mean the
absolute<00:00:35.840> last<00:00:36.840> trumpet<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.890> sequence<00:00:38.370> of

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
absolute last trumpet in a sequence of

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.340 
absolute last trumpet in a sequence of
trumpets<00:00:39.030> after<00:00:39.450> which<00:00:39.629> there<00:00:39.840> would<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.020> no

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
trumpets after which there would be no

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.119 
trumpets after which there would be no
more<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.690> so<00:00:42.690> therefore<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.469> don't<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.829> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
more and so therefore you don't have to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.850 
more and so therefore you don't have to
conclude<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.690> it<00:00:45.690> will<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.440> trumpet

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
conclude that it will be the trumpet

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.529 
conclude that it will be the trumpet
that<00:00:46.890> sounded<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> second<00:00:48.000> coming<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.239> Christ

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
that sounded the second coming of Christ

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.090 
that sounded the second coming of Christ
and<00:00:48.719> as<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:49.050> noted<00:00:49.230> earlier<00:00:49.469> there<00:00:49.890> will<00:00:50.070> be

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and as we noted earlier there will be

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
and as we noted earlier there will be
other<00:00:50.370> trumpet<00:00:50.879> sounded<00:00:51.300> throughout<00:00:51.629> the

God promised that in the future he would

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.960 
God promised that in the future he would
regather<00:01:40.380> scattered<00:01:41.040> Jews<00:01:41.280> from<00:01:41.520> nations
