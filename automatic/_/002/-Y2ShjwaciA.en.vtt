00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
so all the dancers learn the same

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.130 
so all the dancers learn the same
choreography<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.729> then<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.659> break<00:01:06.840> them<00:01:06.990> off

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
choreography and then we break them off

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.990 
choreography and then we break them off
into<00:01:07.380> two<00:01:07.530> different<00:01:07.710> groups<00:01:07.890> usually<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.760> like

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
into two different groups usually I like

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.969 
into two different groups usually I like
to<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.240> two<00:01:09.420> different<00:01:09.780> styles<00:01:09.930> one<00:01:10.590> routine

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to do two different styles one routine

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.980 
to do two different styles one routine
is<00:01:11.250> probably<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> little<00:01:12.060> more<00:01:12.299> advanced<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
is probably a little more advanced and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.499 
is probably a little more advanced and
the<00:01:13.590> other<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.799> bit<00:01:14.220> more<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.000> intermediate

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the other a bit more on the intermediate

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.190 
the other a bit more on the intermediate
side<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:17.340> girls<00:01:17.490> they<00:01:17.790> learn<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.119> day

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.890 

next<00:01:22.200> seven<00:01:22.830> eight<00:01:23.280> hunch<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.850> two<00:01:24.299> three

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
next seven eight hunch one two three

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.550 
next seven eight hunch one two three
four<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
four and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.370 
four and
so<00:01:26.770> then<00:01:27.070> eight<00:01:27.310> dancers<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:27.940> are<00:01:28.780> watched

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
so then eight dancers that are watched

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.950 
so then eight dancers that are watched
from<00:01:29.619> afar<00:01:29.979> usually<00:01:30.670> get<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.659> have<00:01:31.930> a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960
