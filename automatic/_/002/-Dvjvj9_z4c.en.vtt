00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 in favor of what this system is about 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.269
 this is an air vehicle that takes us 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.700
 a person on board flies by itself 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.599
 at first he flies with a radio 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.250
 control and subsequent to radio control is 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.740
 commanded by the computer that we see 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.480
 here in this computer is loaded everything 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.699
 which is the flight plan in the area where 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.820
 I want to fly this flight plan is 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.910
 transferred to the computer 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.829
 and the plane does the whole plan not or the 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.329
 flight pattern now this flight plan 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.449
 can be updated in real time 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.809
 just in case during the mission we see that 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.609
 is that it is bad to go through some area 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.289
 some reason suddenly because of the weather or 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.120
 because they are shooting something like that 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.200
 then he changes it will change the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.510
 flight plan 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.940
 and this and this can be done in time 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.740
 not real and another of the advantages is that 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.380
 we will be able to carry 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.800
 you can see here 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.280
 This is a jimbal that has a bed 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.830
 right now 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.140
 this camera is diurnal at this time not 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.119
 but it can be nocturnal it can be a 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.159
 flow can be any other type of 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.380
 sensor this has also been developed 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.800
 here in the peru by the brain 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.290
 this jimbal 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.300
 and has the peculiarity of turning 360 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.640
 degrees for the right and for the 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.040
 left and these are here 180 degrees 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.530
 top down and this can be 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.270
 control from ground from ground I 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.600
 with a control joystick the jimbal 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.380
 and the jimbal this is put in the belly 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.329
 of the plane and I look at what I want to see 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.219
 from the ground independently of 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.159
 where the plane is flying now is 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:49.049
 important to mention that this is a 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.060
 joint project that you are doing with 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.429
 the army the navy and the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.549
 air force and is funded by the 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.979
 concytec consists that that is the group 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.200
 that is sponsoring us to perform 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.000
 this kind of work then they are 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.310
 working on some project 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.349
 technological innovation with the others 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.349
 forces the army air force 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.090
 I have very little a little subject of all the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.050
 projects what I do know they are 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.610
 developing 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.250
 9 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.080
 is in charge of the defense ministry 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.410
 and that development is made up of 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.470
 our staff 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.620
 armies and force the one in charge of 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.080
 project is the minister of defense there 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.050
 other projects more but that yes this one 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.050
 know the ones in charge of the ministry
