gluing so you fold all the creases and
then<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.919> fold<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.460> together<00:04:17.850> like<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.299> box<00:04:19.039> but

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
then you fold it together like a box but

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.060 
then you fold it together like a box but
you're<00:04:20.160> going<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.340> want<00:04:20.520> to<00:04:20.609> put<00:04:20.940> glue<00:04:21.600> on<00:04:22.070> the

you're going to want to put glue on the

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.760 
you're going to want to put glue on the
edges<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:23.880> that<00:04:24.419> it'll<00:04:24.600> stick<00:04:24.990> together<00:04:27.770> on

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
edges so that it'll stick together on

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.190 
edges so that it'll stick together on
the<00:04:28.979> white<00:04:29.220> outer<00:04:29.550> edges<00:04:29.910> you<00:04:30.600> can<00:04:30.750> add<00:04:30.900> some

little box and you can do this for all
of<00:04:37.020> them<00:04:37.350> so<00:04:38.780> once<00:04:39.780> again<00:04:40.110> fold<00:04:40.590> all<00:04:41.039> the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
of them so once again fold all the

of them so once again fold all the
creases<00:04:42.600> and<00:04:43.169> then<00:04:43.590> add<00:04:43.800> glue<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.520> glue<00:04:45.150> it

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
creases and then add glue and glue it

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.330 
creases and then add glue and glue it
together<00:04:45.600> and<00:04:45.900> if<00:04:46.530> you<00:04:46.560> find<00:04:46.979> that<00:04:47.100> it's

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
together and if you find that it's

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.210 
together and if you find that it's
easier<00:04:47.760> to<00:04:47.789> just<00:04:48.330> fold<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:49.470> windows<00:04:49.890> or<00:04:50.070> doors

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
easier to just fold the windows or doors

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.700 
easier to just fold the windows or doors
together<00:04:50.729> and<00:04:51.060> then<00:04:51.240> tape<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.720> corners<00:04:52.169> feel

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
together and then tape the corners feel

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.430 
together and then tape the corners feel
free<00:04:53.010> to<00:04:53.039> do<00:04:53.340> that<00:04:53.550> too<00:04:53.850> and<00:04:54.120> in<00:04:54.780> order<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.200> fit

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
free to do that too and in order to fit

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.010 
free to do that too and in order to fit
the<00:04:55.470> windows<00:04:56.190> in<00:04:56.460> once<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.270> do<00:04:57.479> that<00:04:57.720> you're

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
the windows in once you do that you're

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.219 
the windows in once you do that you're
going<00:04:58.140> to<00:04:58.229> have<00:04:58.320> to<00:04:58.470> cut<00:04:58.740> these<00:04:58.950> pieces<00:04:59.250> off<00:05:00.229> so

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
going to have to cut these pieces off so

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.460 
going to have to cut these pieces off so
just<00:05:01.740> go<00:05:01.890> ahead<00:05:01.919> and<00:05:02.220> cut<00:05:02.460> them<00:05:02.610> off<00:05:02.760> now<00:05:04.729> and

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
just go ahead and cut them off now and

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.010 
just go ahead and cut them off now and
then<00:05:07.470> you<00:05:08.070> can<00:05:08.280> add<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:09.060> windows<00:05:09.450> right<00:05:09.690> into

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
then you can add the windows right into

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.500 
then you can add the windows right into
these<00:05:10.169> pieces<00:05:10.500> right<00:05:10.830> here<00:05:10.890> if<00:05:11.520> you'd<00:05:12.030> like<00:05:12.060> to

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
these pieces right here if you'd like to

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.810 
these pieces right here if you'd like to
make<00:05:12.690> sure<00:05:12.720> that<00:05:12.930> they<00:05:13.289> stay<00:05:13.430> you<00:05:14.430> can<00:05:14.610> add<00:05:14.789> a

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
make sure that they stay you can add a

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.080 
make sure that they stay you can add a
little<00:05:15.150> bit<00:05:15.390> of<00:05:15.419> glue<00:05:16.160> around<00:05:17.160> their<00:05:17.610> edges

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
little bit of glue around their edges

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.330 
little bit of glue around their edges
and<00:05:18.800> then<00:05:20.240> fit<00:05:21.240> it<00:05:21.270> right<00:05:21.570> in<00:05:22.050> taking<00:05:23.010> off<00:05:23.130> the

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
and then fit it right in taking off the

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.380 
and then fit it right in taking off the
roof<00:05:23.550> might<00:05:23.849> make<00:05:24.060> it<00:05:24.240> easier<00:05:24.500> so<00:05:25.500> you<00:05:25.590> can<00:05:26.390> fit

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
roof might make it easier so you can fit

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.719 
roof might make it easier so you can fit
this<00:05:27.570> in<00:05:27.630> here<00:05:28.140> and<00:05:28.349> then<00:05:29.099> do<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.490> same<00:05:29.669> for

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
this in here and then do the same for

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:35.089 
this in here and then do the same for
the<00:05:30.090> other<00:05:30.270> window<00:05:31.340> and<00:05:32.780> then<00:05:33.780> you<00:05:34.650> can<00:05:34.830> add

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
the other window and then you can add

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.510 
the other window and then you can add
the<00:05:36.090> greenhouse<00:05:36.660> right<00:05:36.930> back<00:05:37.320> on<00:05:37.560> where<00:05:38.430> it

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
the greenhouse right back on where it

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.060 
the greenhouse right back on where it
was<00:05:38.550> before<00:05:39.120> noticing<00:05:40.020> that<00:05:40.200> the<00:05:40.410> rectangular

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
was before noticing that the rectangular

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.390 
was before noticing that the rectangular
holes<00:05:41.460> match<00:05:41.729> up<00:05:41.940> with<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.180> window<00:05:42.510> and

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
holes match up with the window and

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.700 
holes match up with the window and
come<00:05:44.550> out<00:05:44.669> the<00:05:44.820> door<00:05:45.030> and<00:05:45.479> once<00:05:46.080> again<00:05:46.259> you<00:05:46.560> can

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
come out the door and once again you can

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.629 
come out the door and once again you can
add<00:05:46.830> some<00:05:47.040> glue<00:05:47.400> to<00:05:47.430> the<00:05:47.729> edges<00:05:47.910> and<00:05:49.490> fit<00:05:50.490> it

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
add some glue to the edges and fit it

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.909 
add some glue to the edges and fit it
right<00:05:51.060> in<00:05:52.220> and<00:05:53.930> now<00:05:54.930> we've<00:05:55.139> built<00:05:55.440> our<00:05:55.620> power

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
right in and now we've built our power

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.160 
right in and now we've built our power
house
