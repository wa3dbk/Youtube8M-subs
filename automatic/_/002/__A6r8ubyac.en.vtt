00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
not playing as the center forward as he

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.479 
not playing as the center forward as he
initially<00:02:49.079> comes<00:02:49.440> out<00:02:49.620> but<00:02:50.040> I've<00:02:50.099> put<00:02:50.280> him<00:02:50.400> out

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
initially comes out but I've put him out

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.580 
initially comes out but I've put him out
wide<00:02:50.760> because<00:02:51.060> he's<00:02:51.390> much<00:02:51.599> much<00:02:51.840> faster<00:02:52.079> and

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
wide because he's much much faster and

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.229 
wide because he's much much faster and
he<00:02:52.980> doesn't<00:02:53.340> have<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.549> greatest

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
he doesn't have the greatest

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.630 
he doesn't have the greatest
passing<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.379> really<00:02:55.590> he's<00:02:55.920> much<00:02:56.190> better<00:02:56.400> out

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
passing so really he's much better out

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.670

and<00:03:13.019> he<00:03:13.590> scores<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:13.980> heck<00:03:14.129> of<00:03:14.159> a<00:03:14.310> lot<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.459> goals

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
and he scores a heck of a lot of goals

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.129 
and he scores a heck of a lot of goals
for<00:03:15.030> me<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.720> there's<00:03:16.590> Gomez<00:03:17.069> up<00:03:17.310> top<00:03:17.639> and<00:03:18.139> then

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
for me so there's Gomez up top and then

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.080 
for me so there's Gomez up top and then
in<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.530> centre<00:03:19.919> forward<00:03:20.190> position<00:03:20.790> we<00:03:21.060> have

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
in the centre forward position we have

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.789 
in the centre forward position we have
van<00:03:21.450> der<00:03:21.599> Vaart<00:03:21.810> moved<00:03:22.109> in<00:03:22.260> from<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> central

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
van der Vaart moved in from a central

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.470 
van der Vaart moved in from a central
attacking<00:03:22.950> mid<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.700> put<00:03:23.880> him<00:03:23.970> centre<00:03:24.209> forward

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
attacking mid and put him centre forward

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.150 
attacking mid and put him centre forward
now<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.049> reason<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.380> did<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.709> because<00:03:25.889> his

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
now the reason I did that is because his

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.920 
now the reason I did that is because his
pace<00:03:26.430> doesn't<00:03:26.700> allow<00:03:27.000> him<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.299> be<00:03:27.389> put<00:03:27.599> out<00:03:27.750> on

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
pace doesn't allow him to be put out on

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.509 
pace doesn't allow him to be put out on
the<00:03:28.049> wing<00:03:28.230> he's<00:03:28.709> not<00:03:28.889> quick<00:03:29.099> enough<00:03:29.129> to<00:03:29.459> you

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
the wing he's not quick enough to you

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.430

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
ridiculous amount for me I think he's

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.780

in this Felipe Santana there you can see
him<00:04:59.320> getting<00:04:59.500> ahead<00:04:59.740> he<00:05:00.010> was<00:05:00.160> probably<00:05:00.370> the

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
him getting ahead he was probably the

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.160 
him getting ahead he was probably the
most<00:05:00.670> solid<00:05:01.000> centre-back<00:05:01.420> I've<00:05:01.570> used<00:05:01.780> on<00:05:02.020> this

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
most solid centre-back I've used on this

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.860 
most solid centre-back I've used on this
game<00:05:02.410> and<00:05:03.030> there<00:05:04.030> are<00:05:04.150> a<00:05:04.180> whole<00:05:04.390> bunch<00:05:04.420> of

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
game and there are a whole bunch of

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.060 
game and there are a whole bunch of
other<00:05:04.990> players<00:05:05.320> that<00:05:05.590> were<00:05:05.680> really<00:05:05.890> really

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
other players that were really really

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.470 
other players that were really really
good<00:05:06.220> as<00:05:06.400> well<00:05:06.430> van<00:05:06.730> der<00:05:06.850> Vaart<00:05:07.030> being<00:05:07.270> one<00:05:07.450> of

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
good as well van der Vaart being one of

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.090 
good as well van der Vaart being one of
already<00:05:07.780> mentioned<00:05:08.170> it<00:05:08.230> but<00:05:08.380> he<00:05:08.470> scores<00:05:08.800> some

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
already mentioned it but he scores some

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.070 
already mentioned it but he scores some
absolutely<00:05:09.550> amazing<00:05:09.640> goals<00:05:10.180> this<00:05:10.750> team<00:05:10.960> could

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
absolutely amazing goals this team could

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.540 
absolutely amazing goals this team could
probably<00:05:11.260> use<00:05:11.500> a<00:05:11.530> bit<00:05:11.710> more<00:05:11.740> Flair<00:05:12.130> in<00:05:12.340> it<00:05:12.430> I

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
probably use a bit more Flair in it I

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.620 
probably use a bit more Flair in it I
think<00:05:12.790> that's<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.000> one<00:05:13.180> thing<00:05:13.330> it's<00:05:13.480> lacking

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
think that's the one thing it's lacking

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.960 
think that's the one thing it's lacking
it's<00:05:13.990> very<00:05:14.170> you<00:05:14.830> know<00:05:14.860> German<00:05:15.550> roofing

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
it's very you know German roofing

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.820 
it's very you know German roofing
ruthlessly<00:05:16.480> efficient<00:05:17.050> I<00:05:17.140> guess<00:05:17.350> is<00:05:17.530> what<00:05:17.560> you

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
ruthlessly efficient I guess is what you

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.760 
ruthlessly efficient I guess is what you
would<00:05:17.950> probably<00:05:18.280> say<00:05:18.870> other<00:05:19.870> than<00:05:20.350> that<00:05:20.560> you

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
would probably say other than that you

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.310 
would probably say other than that you
know<00:05:20.940> it's<00:05:21.940> a<00:05:22.060> counter-attacking<00:05:22.750> ability<00:05:23.230> is

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
know it's a counter-attacking ability is

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.770 
know it's a counter-attacking ability is
probably<00:05:23.590> a<00:05:23.680> strongest<00:05:24.100> point<00:05:24.340> so<00:05:24.880> yeah<00:05:25.570> if

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
probably a strongest point so yeah if

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.390 
probably a strongest point so yeah if
you<00:05:25.900> guys<00:05:26.080> please<00:05:26.500> drop<00:05:26.710> this<00:05:26.860> video<00:05:27.100> I<00:05:27.160> like
