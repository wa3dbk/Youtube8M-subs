00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.300
 moments of tension were experienced this 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:07.419
 tomorrow at the international airport 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.520
 august is sandino mainly between 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:12.760
 the passengers of a particular plane 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.000
 it turns out that an airline plane 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.210
 delta airlines that took off from this 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.980
 air terminal heading to atlanta usa 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.560
 he was forced to return to his point of 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.720
 departure after I presented a problem 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.659
 in the landing gear the plane the 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.659
 plane has capacity for 120 passengers 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:34.210
 among them these citizens that we see 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.920
 there on the screen the device managed 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.410
 descend before 10 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.350
 at the airport without any kind of 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.580
 problems but first toured almost everything 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.000
 the territory 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.400
 at least managua in the air at 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.380
 time of the announcement in midair the 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.570
 Severe passengers were busy 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.250
 they obviously ask but they valued 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.870
 positive the preventive measure of 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.430
 return to the air terminal 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.770
 I understand that the train 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.420
 landing could not climb then 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.340
 would have to return for safety 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.020
 there was panic in the no 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.560
 and nothing has happened to me, everybody is 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.560
 quiet 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.890
 not only exactly but still 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.860
 from the lake 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:40.500
 the first time it happens 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.500
 to my first time in 25 years 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.590
 panic gu 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.789
 and how long did the airplane expand 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.789
 to land 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.630
 in an hour for the whole round 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.630
 here I think that this is 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.680
 I have time to get there 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.659
 25 years that has happened to me 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.769
 I am that it was a good measure 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.769
 preventive the rector 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.950
 I'm pretty thundering a lot 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.480
 reporting with the situation then 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.730
 So we kept the information that 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:41.220
 they received although this way 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.060
 to something bad on the plane we were going to 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.060
 return to managua 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.069
 well the pilot was not reporting that 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.790
 the landing gear had not been able 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.430
 close which produced a huge 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.840
 sound noise that if we all put on 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.910
 tense 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.180
 I've never had a headache and for 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.130
 sorry first if then I'm 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.239
 flying I think about 40 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.209
 minutes 45 minutes prepared walls of 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:22.420
 the track with the fireman body and everything 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.150
 to see also the pilot does not 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.819
 communicated that they expected older 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.460
 consequences but it was a risk the 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.680
 landing 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.940
 a preventive measure was good 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.710
 return to clear yes 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.440
 I even thought that we are going to 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.830
 land in water because we were 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.310
 always flying over water over the lake 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.650
 from Nicaragua 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.630
 what recommendations do you as a user 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.940
 they give the airlines 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.510
 should you please can a little more than 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.150
 maintenance to the airline for 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.550
 aircraft because yesterday I happened to be 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.100
 watching the news of a plane 3 stick 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.880
 HernÃ¡n and this first thing that happens with 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:11.210
 this airplane that travels to atlanta since in 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.250
 several times we have had delay 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.030
 that they have taken us off the plane 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.030
 mechanical problems
