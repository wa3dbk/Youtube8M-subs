00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.160 
know I looked around at a bunch of them
and<00:03:31.040> for<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.459> price<00:03:31.640> this<00:03:31.880> was<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.810> best

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
and for the price this was the the best

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.260 
and for the price this was the the best
option<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.950> what<00:03:34.370> it<00:03:34.459> does<00:03:34.640> is<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:35.090> keeps

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
option and what it does is it keeps

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.080 
option and what it does is it keeps
track<00:03:35.600> of<00:03:35.630> your<00:03:36.230> Excel<00:03:37.130> acceleration<00:03:38.000> it's

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
track of your Excel acceleration it's

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.790 
track of your Excel acceleration it's
called<00:03:38.239> an<00:03:38.300> accelerometer<00:03:38.600> and<00:03:39.140> it<00:03:39.650> keeps

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
called an accelerometer and it keeps

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.280 
called an accelerometer and it keeps
track<00:03:40.100> of<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:41.270> acceleration<00:03:41.930> between

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
track of the acceleration between

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.440 
track of the acceleration between
walking<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:42.950> running<00:03:43.239> basically<00:03:44.239> like

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
walking and running basically like

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.780 
walking and running basically like
having<00:03:44.870> your<00:03:44.959> own<00:03:45.019> personal<00:03:45.590> trainer<00:03:45.800> all

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
having your own personal trainer all

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.050 
having your own personal trainer all
right<00:03:46.940> so<00:03:47.150> I'm<00:03:47.300> shower<00:03:47.660> it<00:03:47.900> up<00:03:48.019> and<00:03:48.320> cooled<00:03:48.530> off

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
right so I'm shower it up and cooled off

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.430 
right so I'm shower it up and cooled off
you<00:03:50.060> know<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.420> got<00:03:50.720> this<00:03:50.810> watch<00:03:50.989> originally

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
you know I I got this watch originally

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.860 
you know I I got this watch originally
for<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.680> exercise<00:03:52.070> but<00:03:52.400> obviously<00:03:53.269> it's<00:03:53.510> also

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
for the exercise but obviously it's also

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.009 
for the exercise but obviously it's also
a<00:03:54.580> fully<00:03:55.580> functioning<00:03:56.120> watch<00:03:56.300> it's<00:03:56.780> got<00:03:56.900> the

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
a fully functioning watch it's got the

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.979 
a fully functioning watch it's got the
time<00:03:57.260> there's<00:03:58.070> an<00:03:58.190> alarm<00:03:58.519> on<00:03:58.760> there<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.930> know

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
time there's an alarm on there you know

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.410 
time there's an alarm on there you know
light<00:04:00.519> I'm<00:04:01.519> not<00:04:01.670> going<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:01.850> run<00:04:02.000> through<00:04:02.269> all

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
light I'm not going to run through all

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.540 
light I'm not going to run through all
the<00:04:02.780> ways<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:04.040> set<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.400> alarm<00:04:04.730> and

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
the ways to set the alarm and

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.470 
the ways to set the alarm and
and<00:04:05.820> things<00:04:05.940> like<00:04:06.030> that's<00:04:06.180> pretty

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
and things like that's pretty

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.990 
and things like that's pretty
self-explanatory<00:04:07.650> does<00:04:08.100> come<00:04:08.370> with<00:04:08.490> a<00:04:08.550> manual

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
self-explanatory does come with a manual

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.120 
self-explanatory does come with a manual
which<00:04:09.420> you<00:04:10.260> know<00:04:10.350> some<00:04:10.560> parts<00:04:10.800> of<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:11.010> you'll

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
which you know some parts of it you'll

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.760 
which you know some parts of it you'll
need<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.550> follow<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.030> instructions<00:04:12.540> as<00:04:13.500> far

need to follow the instructions as far
as<00:04:13.860> like<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.070> calibration<00:04:14.850> and<00:04:15.150> getting<00:04:15.480> the

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
as like the calibration and getting the

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.080 
as like the calibration and getting the
heart<00:04:15.780> rate<00:04:15.840> monitor<00:04:15.960> set<00:04:16.470> up<00:04:16.620> just<00:04:17.459> follow

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
heart rate monitor set up just follow

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.740 
heart rate monitor set up just follow
it's<00:04:18.360> what's<00:04:18.810> in<00:04:18.930> here<00:04:19.110> about<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.500> real<00:04:19.980> easy

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750

it's what's in here about that real easy
also<00:04:21.750> on<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.710> computer<00:04:23.130> side<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.340> things<00:04:23.730> it

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
also on the computer side of things it

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.420 
also on the computer side of things it
has<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.660> comes<00:04:24.810> with<00:04:24.960> this<00:04:25.020> disc<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.530> you<00:04:26.250> just

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
has it comes with this disc and you just

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.970 
has it comes with this disc and you just
load<00:04:26.670> the<00:04:26.820> disc<00:04:27.000> in<00:04:27.240> it<00:04:27.870> pulls<00:04:28.410> up<00:04:28.650> the

load the disc in it pulls up the

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.850 
load the disc in it pulls up the
interface<00:04:29.460> which<00:04:30.030> is<00:04:30.060> free<00:04:30.750> and<00:04:31.140> very<00:04:31.500> easy<00:04:31.620> to

interface which is free and very easy to
follow<00:04:32.450> you<00:04:33.450> know<00:04:33.540> I<00:04:33.570> just<00:04:33.810> pull<00:04:34.710> this<00:04:34.890> off

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
follow you know I just pull this off

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.930 
follow you know I just pull this off
plug<00:04:35.940> it<00:04:36.060> straight<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.540> my<00:04:36.660> USB<00:04:37.050> and<00:04:37.620> it<00:04:38.550> pulls

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
plug it straight to my USB and it pulls

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.990 
plug it straight to my USB and it pulls
up<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.480> page<00:04:40.260> like<00:04:40.500> this<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:40.980> just<00:04:41.190> basically

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000
