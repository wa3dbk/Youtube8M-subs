hello youtube today what I'm going to do
is<00:00:04.170> just<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.650> quick<00:00:05.130> speed<00:00:05.850> comparison<00:00:06.540> between

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
is just a quick speed comparison between

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.540 
is just a quick speed comparison between
an<00:00:07.109> iphone<00:00:07.319> 3gs<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.940> gsm<00:00:09.480> iphone<00:00:09.990> 4<00:00:10.550> running

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
an iphone 3gs and a gsm iphone 4 running

an iphone 3gs and a gsm iphone 4 running
iOS<00:00:12.090> 5<00:00:12.420> 11<00:00:13.519> so<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.580> begin<00:00:14.820> let's<00:00:15.150> just<00:00:15.299> power

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
iOS 5 11 so to begin let's just power

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.939 
iOS 5 11 so to begin let's just power
these<00:00:15.660> up<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.049> while<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.500> power<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.830> I'll

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
these up and while the power up I'll

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.570 
these up and while the power up I'll
talk<00:00:17.130> about<00:00:17.160> some<00:00:17.400> stuff<00:00:20.689> ok<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:22.800> 3gs<00:00:23.310> is

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
talk about some stuff ok the 3gs is

higher<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.239> iphone<00:00:51.570> 4<00:00:51.870> though<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.190> this

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
higher the iphone 4 though so this

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.799 
higher the iphone 4 though so this
comparison<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.000> interesting<00:00:54.510> because<00:00:54.629> you

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
comparison is interesting because you

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.750 
comparison is interesting because you
have<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> keep<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.379> mind<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.010> 4<00:00:56.309> has<00:00:56.579> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
have to keep in mind that the 4 has to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.810 
have to keep in mind that the 4 has to
power<00:00:57.000> 4<00:00:57.960> times<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> amount<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.859> pixels<00:00:59.989> using

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
power 4 times the amount of pixels using

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.299 
power 4 times the amount of pixels using
relatively<00:01:02.820> similar<00:01:03.180> hardware<00:01:03.920> so<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
relatively similar hardware so the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.010 
relatively similar hardware so the
results<00:01:05.700> are<00:01:05.790> going<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> be<00:01:06.119> they're<00:01:06.750> going<00:01:06.900> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
results are going to be they're going to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.929 
results are going to be they're going to
interest<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.890> little<00:01:08.070> bit<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.549> first<00:01:08.580> we

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
interest you a little bit but first we

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.940 
interest you a little bit but first we
have<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.090> wait<00:01:09.240> until<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.570> power<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.680> four

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
have to wait until I power on the four

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.230 
have to wait until I power on the four
just<00:01:11.280> finished<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:13.290> 3gs<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:14.130> close<00:01:14.760> second

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
just finished and the 3gs a close second

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.840 
just finished and the 3gs a close second
that<00:01:15.420> was<00:01:15.570> about<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.200> two<00:01:16.229> seconds<00:01:16.710> behind

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
that was about one to two seconds behind

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.070 
that was about one to two seconds behind
so<00:01:17.850> I'm<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.210> put<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> passcode<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
so I'm going to put the passcode on the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:31.130 
so I'm going to put the passcode on the
four<00:01:23.570> ok<00:01:24.619> unlock<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> 3gs

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.300 

so<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.230> three<00:01:32.380> just<00:01:32.590> kind<00:01:32.800> of<00:01:32.830> stutter<00:01:33.070> doll

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
so the three just kind of stutter doll

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.910 
so the three just kind of stutter doll
unlocking<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:33.940> a<00:01:34.000> little<00:01:34.240> bit<00:01:34.740> button<00:01:35.740> push

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
unlocking that a little bit button push

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.520 
unlocking that a little bit button push
those<00:01:36.070> are<00:01:36.190> a<00:01:36.220> little<00:01:36.340> bit<00:01:36.520> slow<00:01:36.760> but<00:01:37.530> nothing

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
those are a little bit slow but nothing

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.520 
those are a little bit slow but nothing
too<00:01:38.770> bad<00:01:39.060> okay<00:01:40.060> we're<00:01:41.020> just<00:01:41.050> going<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.350> run

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
too bad okay we're just going to run

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.670 
too bad okay we're just going to run
some<00:01:41.560> basic<00:01:42.070> app<00:01:42.360> opening<00:01:43.360> tests<00:01:43.960> stock<00:01:44.410> apps

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
some basic app opening tests stock apps

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.670 
some basic app opening tests stock apps
first<00:01:45.070> so<00:01:45.490> one<00:01:46.330> app<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.990> everyone<00:01:47.410> uses<00:01:47.530> a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
first so one app that everyone uses a

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.050 
first so one app that everyone uses a
lot<00:01:47.830> is<00:01:48.010> the<00:01:48.040> Settings<00:01:48.520> app<00:01:48.730> so<00:01:48.910> we're<00:01:49.030> just

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
lot is the Settings app so we're just

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.840 
lot is the Settings app so we're just
going<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.390> open<00:01:49.570> that<00:01:49.840> up<00:01:50.110> see<00:01:50.320> who<00:01:50.470> wins<00:01:53.850> okay

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
going to open that up see who wins okay

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.130 
going to open that up see who wins okay
the<00:01:55.690> 41<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.470> 3gs<00:01:56.830> was<00:01:57.040> about<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.840> quarter<00:01:58.840> half

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
the 41 the 3gs was about a quarter half

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.870 
the 41 the 3gs was about a quarter half
a<00:01:59.290> second<00:01:59.620> behind<00:01:59.710> we're<00:02:00.550> going<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.700> leave

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
a second behind we're going to leave

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.490 
a second behind we're going to leave
those<00:02:01.090> apps<00:02:01.330> and<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.600> multi-tasking<00:02:02.259> you<00:02:02.380> can

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
those apps and the multi-tasking you can

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.790 
those apps and the multi-tasking you can
see<00:02:02.619> there's<00:02:02.800> nothing<00:02:03.130> else<00:02:03.250> open<00:02:03.670> beforehand

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
see there's nothing else open beforehand

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.140 
see there's nothing else open beforehand
all<00:02:05.800> right<00:02:05.950> next<00:02:06.490> we're<00:02:06.700> going<00:02:06.790> to<00:02:06.880> open<00:02:06.970> up

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
all right next we're going to open up

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:15.210 
all right next we're going to open up
the<00:02:07.300> maps<00:02:07.570> application<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:14.500> very<00:02:14.740> similar

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
the maps application so very similar

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.370 
the maps application so very similar
although<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.209> four<00:02:16.450> had<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.900> load<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:17.200> on

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
although the four had to load this on

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.150 
although the four had to load this on
light<00:02:17.620> tile<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.190> let's<00:02:19.290> put<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.380> on<00:02:20.440> hybrid<00:02:21.010> and

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
light tile so let's put it on hybrid and

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.390 
light tile so let's put it on hybrid and
see<00:02:21.280> how<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.520> does<00:02:22.709> so<00:02:23.709> those<00:02:23.890> load<00:02:24.070> it<00:02:24.190> up<00:02:24.280> but

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
see how it does so those load it up but

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.310 
see how it does so those load it up but
pretty<00:02:24.640> much<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.940> same<00:02:25.120> rate<00:02:28.080> next<00:02:29.080> up<00:02:29.200> we're

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
pretty much the same rate next up we're

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.979 
pretty much the same rate next up we're
going<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.500> do<00:02:29.590> some<00:02:29.770> web<00:02:29.920> browsing<00:02:30.190> tests<00:02:30.790> a

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
going to do some web browsing tests a

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.190 
going to do some web browsing tests a
cache<00:02:31.989> has<00:02:32.170> been<00:02:32.350> cleared<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.959> let's<00:02:34.959> go<00:02:35.110> to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
cache has been cleared so let's go to

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:45.420 
cache has been cleared so let's go to
the<00:02:35.260> New<00:02:35.410> York<00:02:35.650> Times

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:57.800 

calm<00:02:46.989> okay<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:49.510> go

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.339 

for<00:02:58.650> has<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.040> site<00:02:59.510> loaded<00:03:00.510> quicker<00:03:00.780> although

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
for has the site loaded quicker although

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.460 
for has the site loaded quicker although
they're<00:03:01.500> both<00:03:01.650> still<00:03:01.860> loading<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:04.170> force

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
they're both still loading the force

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.979 
they're both still loading the force
finished<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.970> 3gs<00:03:09.180> was<00:03:09.569> about<00:03:09.750> five

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
finished and the 3gs was about five

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.140 
finished and the 3gs was about five
seconds<00:03:10.380> behind<00:03:10.560> now<00:03:11.370> remember<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.819> four<00:03:12.030> has

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
seconds behind now remember the four has

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.910 
seconds behind now remember the four has
a<00:03:12.180> Retina<00:03:12.599> display<00:03:12.989> which<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.230> four<00:03:13.560> times<00:03:13.830> the

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
a Retina display which is four times the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.140 
a Retina display which is four times the
amount<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.190> pixels<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.730> double<00:03:15.060> the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
amount of pixels to double the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.509 
amount of pixels to double the
resolution<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:16.530> it's<00:03:16.860> going<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.040> look<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.370> lot

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
resolution so it's going to look a lot

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.000 
resolution so it's going to look a lot
better<00:03:17.760> on<00:03:18.150> with<00:03:19.019> your<00:03:19.170> own<00:03:19.319> eyes<00:03:19.530> once<00:03:19.860> you

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
better on with your own eyes once you

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.280 
better on with your own eyes once you
see<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.250> screen<00:03:20.489> up<00:03:20.610> close<00:03:21.080> let's<00:03:22.080> see<00:03:22.230> just

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
see the screen up close let's see just

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.250 
see the screen up close let's see just
one<00:03:22.560> more<00:03:22.769> website<00:03:23.540> let's<00:03:24.540> do<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.870> Deccan

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
one more website let's do the Deccan

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.020 
one more website let's do the Deccan
Herald<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.459> is<00:03:29.550> there<00:03:29.670> because<00:03:29.850> it's<00:03:29.970> a

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
Herald and this is there because it's a

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.229 
Herald and this is there because it's a
bookmark<00:03:30.480> it's<00:03:30.660> not<00:03:30.840> been<00:03:31.049> cash<00:03:31.350> or<00:03:32.180> store<00:03:33.180> it

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
bookmark it's not been cash or store it

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:48.080 
bookmark it's not been cash or store it
in<00:03:33.390> any<00:03:33.540> way<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:34.500> ready<00:03:34.799> go

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:04:01.059 

for<00:03:48.840> finished

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:13.470 

3gs<00:04:01.939> is<00:04:02.060> still<00:04:02.390> going<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:07.040> going<00:04:10.090> going<00:04:11.090> and

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.009 

it's<00:04:14.480> done<00:04:15.729> so<00:04:16.729> the<00:04:17.239> four<00:04:17.479> is<00:04:17.599> a<00:04:17.630> little<00:04:17.900> bit

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
it's done so the four is a little bit

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.259 
it's done so the four is a little bit
faster<00:04:18.229> I<00:04:18.709> would<00:04:19.130> attribute<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.579> to<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.820> 200

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
faster I would attribute it to the 200

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.529 
faster I would attribute it to the 200
megahertz<00:04:20.479> faster<00:04:20.959> processor<00:04:22.120> now<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.419> last

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
megahertz faster processor now the last

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.120 
megahertz faster processor now the last
thing<00:04:23.810> I'm<00:04:23.870> going<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.020> do<00:04:24.169> is<00:04:24.440> just<00:04:24.680> go<00:04:24.919> through

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
thing I'm going to do is just go through

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.040 
thing I'm going to do is just go through
some<00:04:25.280> benchmarks<00:04:25.940> there's<00:04:26.150> an<00:04:26.300> application

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
some benchmarks there's an application

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.680 
some benchmarks there's an application
called<00:04:27.169> GPU<00:04:27.860> bench<00:04:28.190> which<00:04:29.120> doesn't<00:04:29.479> pretty

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
called GPU bench which doesn't pretty

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.719 
called GPU bench which doesn't pretty
intensive<00:04:30.349> graphics<00:04:30.800> testing<00:04:31.250> on<00:04:31.400> both<00:04:31.580> the

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
intensive graphics testing on both the

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.330 
intensive graphics testing on both the
phones<00:04:32.259> so<00:04:33.259> remember<00:04:33.500> what<00:04:33.770> I<00:04:33.800> said<00:04:33.860> about<00:04:34.070> the

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
phones so remember what I said about the

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.499 
phones so remember what I said about the
iphone<00:04:34.669> for<00:04:34.970> having<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:35.479> run<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:37.300> oddest<00:04:38.300> the

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
iphone for having to run the oddest the

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.080 
iphone for having to run the oddest the
retina<00:04:38.840> display<00:04:39.229> on<00:04:39.470> similar<00:04:40.070> hardware<00:04:40.250> so

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
retina display on similar hardware so

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.390 
retina display on similar hardware so
performance<00:04:41.870> stutters<00:04:42.139> a<00:04:42.169> bit<00:04:42.410> you<00:04:43.039> open<00:04:43.310> up

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
performance stutters a bit you open up

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.120 
performance stutters a bit you open up
folders<00:04:43.910> it<00:04:44.320> stutters<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.349> lot<00:04:45.560> compared<00:04:46.039> to

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
folders it stutters a lot compared to

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.339 
folders it stutters a lot compared to
the<00:04:46.220> 3gs<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.970> 3g<00:04:47.060> s<00:04:47.449> also<00:04:47.630> stutters<00:04:48.020> but<00:04:48.199> not

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
the 3gs the 3g s also stutters but not

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.270 
the 3gs the 3g s also stutters but not
as<00:04:48.560> much<00:04:50.020> you<00:04:51.020> can<00:04:51.169> just<00:04:51.349> see<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.470> overall

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
as much you can just see that overall

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.629 
as much you can just see that overall
scrolling<00:04:52.940> is<00:04:53.740> smoother<00:04:54.740> on<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:54.949> 3gs<00:04:55.400> and

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
scrolling is smoother on the 3gs and

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:02.050 
scrolling is smoother on the 3gs and
iphone<00:04:55.820> 4<00:04:56.470> so<00:04:57.470> opening<00:04:57.770> up<00:04:57.889> folders<00:04:58.280> again<00:05:01.060> the

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
iphone 4 so opening up folders again the

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.939 
iphone 4 so opening up folders again the
forward<00:05:02.389> skips<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.810> little<00:05:03.020> bit<00:05:03.139> and<00:05:03.349> you'll

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
forward skips a little bit and you'll

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.200 
forward skips a little bit and you'll
notice<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:04.340> micro<00:05:04.639> stutters<00:05:04.970> when<00:05:05.120> you're

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
notice the micro stutters when you're

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.939 
notice the micro stutters when you're
opening<00:05:05.599> and<00:05:05.810> closing<00:05:06.080> apps<00:05:06.409> on<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.680> floor

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
opening and closing apps on the floor

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.390 
opening and closing apps on the floor
but<00:05:07.940> most<00:05:08.150> of<00:05:08.270> all<00:05:08.419> I'd<00:05:08.630> like<00:05:08.659> to<00:05:08.810> open<00:05:09.800> up<00:05:09.949> GPU

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
but most of all I'd like to open up GPU

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:21.390 
but most of all I'd like to open up GPU
bench<00:05:13.360> okay

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.770 

sorry<00:05:22.210> I'll<00:05:22.540> just<00:05:22.720> set<00:05:22.870> up<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.110> shaders<00:05:24.780> do

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
sorry I'll just set up the shaders do

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.980 
sorry I'll just set up the shaders do
sit<00:05:26.169> here<00:05:29.430> okay<00:05:30.430> everything's<00:05:31.330> good<00:05:31.509> to<00:05:31.539> go<00:05:31.630> so

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
sit here okay everything's good to go so

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.210 
sit here okay everything's good to go so
you'll<00:05:32.169> notice<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:34.720> 3gs<00:05:35.289> is<00:05:35.320> there<00:05:35.860> and<00:05:36.100> the

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
you'll notice the 3gs is there and the

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.100 
you'll notice the 3gs is there and the
four<00:05:36.460> are<00:05:36.610> both<00:05:36.789> averaging<00:05:37.300> about<00:05:37.449> 60<00:05:37.870> frames

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
four are both averaging about 60 frames

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.840 
four are both averaging about 60 frames
per<00:05:38.229> second<00:05:38.710> in<00:05:38.830> this<00:05:39.009> full<00:05:39.250> screen<00:05:39.580> shot

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
per second in this full screen shot

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.400 
per second in this full screen shot
let's<00:05:40.150> see<00:05:40.270> if<00:05:40.330> I<00:05:40.389> can<00:05:40.419> frame<00:05:40.930> rates<00:05:41.139> there

the 3gs is up to about fifty four frames
per<00:06:43.330> second<00:06:43.690> so<00:06:44.620> you<00:06:44.680> can<00:06:44.770> see<00:06:45.099> that<00:06:45.280> in<00:06:45.430> heavy

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:45.699

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.180 
per second so you can see that in heavy
gaming<00:06:46.000> you<00:06:46.930> will<00:06:47.050> find<00:06:47.260> the<00:06:47.349> 3gs<00:06:47.770> a<00:06:47.800> little

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190 
gaming you will find the 3gs a little

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.460 
gaming you will find the 3gs a little
bit<00:06:48.310> faster<00:06:48.520> if<00:06:49.000> not<00:06:49.270> as<00:06:49.510> high-quality<00:06:49.930> as

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
bit faster if not as high-quality as

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.290 
bit faster if not as high-quality as
