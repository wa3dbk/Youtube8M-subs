still<00:00:30.599> some<00:00:30.750> contain<00:00:31.109> issues<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:31.619> got<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.890> be

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
still some contain issues we got to be

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.729 
still some contain issues we got to be
better<00:00:32.189> about<00:00:32.809> and<00:00:33.809> then<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.050> also<00:00:34.230> made<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> bad

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
better about and then we also made a bad

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.530 
better about and then we also made a bad
play<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.190> gave<00:00:35.370> him<00:00:35.460> up<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:36.000> gave<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
play we gave him up we gave a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.990 
play we gave him up we gave a
fourth-down<00:00:37.160> conversion<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.280> two<00:00:38.700> minutes

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
fourth-down conversion in two minutes

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.389 
fourth-down conversion in two minutes
because<00:00:39.090> we<00:00:39.300> panic<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:40.680> was<00:00:40.829> grabbed<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.280> guy

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
because we panic it was grabbed a guy

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.770 
because we panic it was grabbed a guy
and<00:00:41.579> didn't<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.270> know<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.450> got<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.660> be

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
and didn't have to you know we got to be

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.110 
and didn't have to you know we got to be
better<00:00:43.620> about<00:00:43.770> trusting<00:00:44.250> our<00:00:44.370> technique<00:00:44.789> so

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
better about trusting our technique so

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.750 
better about trusting our technique so
but<00:00:46.050> they<00:00:46.170> did<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:47.010> played<00:00:47.219> well<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.730> think

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
but they did it played well and I think

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.520 
but they did it played well and I think
a<00:00:47.969> lot<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> communication<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:49.170> lot<00:00:49.320> of

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
a lot of is the communication a lot of

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.450 
a lot of is the communication a lot of
them<00:00:49.590> they're<00:00:49.739> starting<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.039> understand

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
them they're starting to understand

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.510
