tablets comm just having a look here at
the<00:00:05.100> surface<00:00:05.400> three<00:00:06.200> trying<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.319> see<00:00:07.500> what<00:00:07.770> the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
the surface three trying to see what the

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.970 
the surface three trying to see what the
exact<00:00:08.639> speeds<00:00:09.269> are<00:00:09.510> from<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.080> ports<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.679> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
exact speeds are from the ports on the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.459 
exact speeds are from the ports on the
system<00:00:11.370> so<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.670> have<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.969> microUSB<00:00:12.330> port<00:00:13.080> here

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
system so we have the microUSB port here

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.160 
system so we have the microUSB port here
which<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.190> can<00:00:14.400> happily<00:00:15.030> say<00:00:15.330> does<00:00:15.690> support

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
which I can happily say does support

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.800 
which I can happily say does support
running<00:00:17.060> flash<00:00:18.060> drives<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.510> things<00:00:18.720> like

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
running flash drives and things like

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.330 
running flash drives and things like
that<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.140> can<00:00:19.170> hook<00:00:19.470> up<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.770> wireless

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
that so you can hook up a wireless

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.269 
that so you can hook up a wireless
receiver<00:00:20.609> running<00:00:21.150> Mouse<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.859> I<00:00:22.859> was<00:00:23.130> just

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
receiver running Mouse and I was just

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.980 
receiver running Mouse and I was just
wanting<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.580> know<00:00:23.670> whether<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.330> was<00:00:24.600> running

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
wanting to know whether it was running

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.830 
wanting to know whether it was running
on<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.289> USB<00:00:25.590> 3<00:00:25.920> port<00:00:26.220> or<00:00:26.369> not<00:00:26.670> whether<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.210> new

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
on a USB 3 port or not whether the new

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.890 
on a USB 3 port or not whether the new
Atom<00:00:28.260> could<00:00:28.470> support<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.189> mini<00:00:29.970> USB<00:00:30.090> 3<00:00:30.599> port

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
Atom could support that mini USB 3 port

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.100 
Atom could support that mini USB 3 port
or<00:00:31.080> would<00:00:31.260> all<00:00:31.470> run<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.980> USB<00:00:32.250> 3<00:00:32.610> hub<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.899> can

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.660 
or would all run on a USB 3 hub you can

Samsung Evo 64 gigabyte card and those

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.800 
Samsung Evo 64 gigabyte card and those
are<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.250> top<00:01:05.430> speeds<00:01:05.729> there<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:06.330> their

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
are the top speeds there so that's their

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.500 
are the top speeds there so that's their
kind<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.049> upper<00:01:07.380> limits<00:01:07.770> there<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.369> USB<00:01:08.610> 2

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
kind of upper limits there of a USB 2

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.469 
kind of upper limits there of a USB 2
speed<00:01:10.159> so<00:01:11.159> they<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.880> see<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.270> running

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
speed so they you can see it's running

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.399 
speed so they you can see it's running

it<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.280> those<00:01:23.490> are<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> top<00:01:23.880> speed<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
it and those are the top speed so that

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.660 
it and those are the top speed so that
that's<00:01:24.869> good<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.320> know<00:01:25.439> that's<00:01:25.619> USB<00:01:26.100> 3<00:01:26.340> speeds

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
that's good you know that's USB 3 speeds

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.700 
that's good you know that's USB 3 speeds
quite<00:01:26.970> high<00:01:27.180> there<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.659> actually<00:01:28.140> runs<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.530> lot

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
quite high there and actually runs a lot

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.280 
quite high there and actually runs a lot
faster<00:01:29.280> than<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.670> internal<00:01:29.970> storage<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:31.140> is

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570

Drive<00:01:37.759> those<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.030> speeds<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.780> we

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
Drive those are the speeds here so we

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.380 
Drive those are the speeds here so we
have<00:01:40.020> 131<00:01:42.590> sequential<00:01:43.590> read<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.390> 39

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
have 131 sequential read and 39

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.810 
have 131 sequential read and 39
sequential<00:01:46.020> write<00:01:46.259> these<00:01:47.250> numbers<00:01:47.700> are

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
sequential write these numbers are

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.850 
sequential write these numbers are
pretty<00:01:47.850> low<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.899> quite<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> slow<00:01:49.500> driver

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
pretty low that is quite a slow driver

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.139 
pretty low that is quite a slow driver
so<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:50.700> obviously<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
so it's going to be obviously a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.270 
so it's going to be obviously a
bottleneck<00:01:51.780> for<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.140> system<00:01:52.590> though<00:01:53.100> I'm<00:01:53.220> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
bottleneck for the system though I'm a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.639 
bottleneck for the system though I'm a
little<00:01:53.520> bit<00:01:53.610> concerned<00:01:53.820> about<00:01:54.350> for<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.439> price

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
little bit concerned about for the price

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.139 
little bit concerned about for the price
range<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.159> would<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.399> been<00:01:56.490> great<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:56.850> they

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
range it would have been great if they

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.980 
range it would have been great if they
had<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.630> set<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.619> three<00:01:59.100> SSD<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.030> there<00:02:00.240> but

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
had a set of three SSD in there but

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.709 
had a set of three SSD in there but
apparently<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.770> new<00:02:01.979> Athens<00:02:02.399> still<00:02:03.390> can't

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
apparently the new Athens still can't

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.260 
apparently the new Athens still can't
run<00:02:04.049> set<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.159> three<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.729> only<00:02:05.939> run<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
run set of three that can only run the

run set of three that can only run the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
embedded multimedia carts which is why

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.969 
embedded multimedia carts which is why
we<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.720> limiting<00:02:10.170> speed<00:02:10.619> there<00:02:10.800> that's

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
we have that limiting speed there that's

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.840 
we have that limiting speed there that's
a<00:02:11.099> fact<00:02:11.370> okay

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
a fact okay

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.370 
a fact okay
to<00:02:12.000> consider<00:02:12.420> if<00:02:12.600> you're<00:02:12.690> gonna<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.960> moving<00:02:13.290> a

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
to consider if you're gonna be moving a

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.670 
to consider if you're gonna be moving a
lot<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.680> files<00:02:14.340> off<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.410> system<00:02:16.410> then<00:02:16.560> you're

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
lot of files off the system then you're

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.570 
lot of files off the system then you're
gonna<00:02:16.770> have<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> little<00:02:17.460> bit<00:02:17.550> of

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
gonna have to have a little bit of

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.280 
gonna have to have a little bit of
patience<00:02:18.030> there<00:02:18.270> especially<00:02:18.780> when<00:02:19.020> writing

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
patience there especially when writing

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.050 
patience there especially when writing
files<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.100> move<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> file<00:02:20.580> from<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.850> USB

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
files so if you move a file from the USB

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.460 
files so if you move a file from the USB
3<00:02:21.420> you're<00:02:21.570> gonna<00:02:21.660> write<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.020> under<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> system

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
3 you're gonna write it under the system

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.290 
3 you're gonna write it under the system
it's<00:02:23.430> gonna<00:02:23.550> take<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.760> little<00:02:23.880> while<00:02:24.120> because

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
it's gonna take a little while because

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.850 
it's gonna take a little while because
you're<00:02:24.570> gonna<00:02:24.780> be<00:02:24.870> limited<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.320> this<00:02:25.530> 40

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
you're gonna be limited to this 40

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.560 
you're gonna be limited to this 40
megabytes<00:02:26.220> per<00:02:26.340> second<00:02:26.730> which<00:02:26.850> is<00:02:26.880> reasonably

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
megabytes per second which is reasonably

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.810 
megabytes per second which is reasonably
quick<00:02:27.930> but<00:02:28.800> if<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.010> aren't<00:02:29.190> running<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.550> drive

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
quick but if you aren't running a drive

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.210 
quick but if you aren't running a drive
like<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.210> Sandusky<00:02:30.600> write<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.170> God<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.920> can

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
like the Sandusky write of God that can

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.150 
like the Sandusky write of God that can
read<00:02:32.490> up<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:32.990> 250<00:02:33.990> megabytes<00:02:34.410> per<00:02:34.620> second

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
read up to like 250 megabytes per second

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.370 
read up to like 250 megabytes per second
it<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:35.880> not<00:02:35.910> performing<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.660> its<00:02:36.810> full<00:02:37.050> speed

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
it is not performing to its full speed

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.140 
it is not performing to its full speed
there<00:02:37.650> when<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.280> are<00:02:38.400> only<00:02:38.580> moving<00:02:38.820> files

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
there when you are only moving files

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.110 
there when you are only moving files
over<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.630> writing<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.520> also<00:02:41.700> wanted<00:02:42.000> to

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
over and writing and I also wanted to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.710 
over and writing and I also wanted to
know<00:02:42.210> what<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.720> port<00:02:42.990> here<00:02:43.050> run<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:44.720> external

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
know what this port here run a external

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.050 
know what this port here run a external
2.5<00:02:46.380> inch<00:02:46.650> dry<00:02:47.070> will<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.550> enough<00:02:47.580> power<00:02:48.000> so

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
2.5 inch dry will I have enough power so

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.480 
2.5 inch dry will I have enough power so
I'm<00:02:48.300> just<00:02:48.420> gonna<00:02:48.510> test<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.930> right<00:02:49.230> now<00:02:52.310> if<00:02:53.310> I

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
I'm just gonna test that right now if I

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.160 
I'm just gonna test that right now if I
remove<00:02:53.820> this<00:02:54.030> this<00:02:55.020> is<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.200> Toshiba<00:02:55.650> 1<00:02:55.920> terabyte

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
remove this this is a Toshiba 1 terabyte

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.660 
remove this this is a Toshiba 1 terabyte
drive<00:02:58.170> here<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:59.040> can<00:02:59.190> see<00:02:59.340> if<00:02:59.400> it's<00:02:59.520> been

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
drive here and you can see if it's been

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.590 
drive here and you can see if it's been
to<00:02:59.850> be<00:03:00.000> able<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.240> run<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.900> open<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.350> up

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
to be able to run that and open it up

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.530 
to be able to run that and open it up
which<00:03:03.600> some<00:03:03.840> people<00:03:03.960> might<00:03:04.260> want<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.560> do

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
which some people might want to do

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.000 
which some people might want to do
hopefully<00:03:06.540> it's<00:03:06.660> got<00:03:06.780> enough<00:03:06.990> power<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.830> do

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
hopefully it's got enough power to do

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.180 
hopefully it's got enough power to do
this<00:03:08.180> seems<00:03:09.180> good<00:03:09.360> so<00:03:09.540> far<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:13.680> does<00:03:13.920> look<00:03:14.160> like

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
this seems good so far it does look like

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.970 
this seems good so far it does look like
it<00:03:14.520> is<00:03:14.730> going<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.030> open<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.360> up

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
it is going to open it up

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.380 
it is going to open it up
that's<00:03:16.980> installing<00:03:17.490> their<00:03:17.670> driver<00:03:17.940> there<00:03:18.150> for

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
that's installing their driver there for

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.730 
that's installing their driver there for
it<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.920> looks<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.250> be<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.370> good<00:03:20.550> sign

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
it so it looks to be a good sign

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.770 
it so it looks to be a good sign
can<00:03:22.740> I<00:03:22.860> open<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.310> though<00:03:26.300> yes<00:03:27.300> I<00:03:27.450> can

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
can I open it though yes I can

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.990 
can I open it though yes I can
so<00:03:27.930> that's<00:03:28.500> good<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.890> seems<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.280> be<00:03:29.370> able<00:03:29.430> to

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
so that's good it seems to be able to

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.140 
so that's good it seems to be able to
run<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.360> fine<00:03:31.730> because<00:03:32.730> there's<00:03:32.940> only<00:03:33.030> gonna

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
run that fine because there's only gonna

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.140 
run that fine because there's only gonna
be<00:03:33.270> running<00:03:33.510> at<00:03:33.630> USB<00:03:33.870> 2<00:03:34.260> speeds<00:03:34.560> there<00:03:35.120> so<00:03:36.120> I

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
be running at USB 2 speeds there so I

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.120 
be running at USB 2 speeds there so I
can<00:03:36.420> run<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.780> external<00:03:37.380> hard<00:03:37.560> drives<00:03:37.830> from

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
can run to external hard drives from

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.130 
can run to external hard drives from
both<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.400> those<00:03:38.550> ports<00:03:39.000> which<00:03:39.600> is<00:03:39.750> good<00:03:39.930> if<00:03:40.050> you

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
both of those ports which is good if you

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.110 
both of those ports which is good if you
did<00:03:40.350> happen<00:03:40.770> to<00:03:40.980> need<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.460> transfer<00:03:41.880> files

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
did happen to need to transfer files

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.000 
did happen to need to transfer files
from<00:03:42.210> one<00:03:42.450> hard<00:03:42.690> drive<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:43.080> another<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.650> mean

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
from one hard drive to another I mean

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.490 
from one hard drive to another I mean
this<00:03:44.250> isn't<00:03:44.430> something<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:44.910> can't<00:03:45.300> do<00:03:45.600> on<00:03:45.870> the

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
this isn't something you can't do on the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.120 
this isn't something you can't do on the

use<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.700> hub<00:03:51.030> day<00:03:51.210> then<00:03:51.450> you'll<00:03:51.600> be<00:03:51.690> able<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.930> do

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
use a hub day then you'll be able to do

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.130 
use a hub day then you'll be able to do
that<00:03:52.580> now<00:03:53.580> I<00:03:53.610> just<00:03:53.730> show<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.150> those<00:03:54.480> speeds

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
that now I just show you those speeds

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.790 
that now I just show you those speeds
compared<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:55.890> people<00:03:57.470> w3<00:03:58.470> this<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:58.770> a

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
compared to a people w3 this is a

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.620 
compared to a people w3 this is a
Chinese<00:03:59.100> tablet<00:03:59.730> that<00:03:59.910> has<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.270> older

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
Chinese tablet that has the older

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.670 
Chinese tablet that has the older
generation<00:04:01.200> Bay<00:04:02.130> Trail<00:04:02.750> in<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:03.960> and<00:04:04.200> this<00:04:04.500> is

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
generation Bay Trail in it and this is

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.230 
generation Bay Trail in it and this is
the<00:04:04.710> speed<00:04:05.040> here<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.460> managed<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.760> get<00:04:06.030> out

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
the speed here that I managed to get out

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.320 
the speed here that I managed to get out
of<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.750> internal<00:04:07.260> e<00:04:07.620> MMC<00:04:08.520> that's<00:04:09.000> actually

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
of the internal e MMC that's actually

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.710 
of the internal e MMC that's actually
faster<00:04:09.780> than<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.080> Microsoft<00:04:10.860> Surface<00:04:11.540> 3<00:04:12.540> you

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
faster than the Microsoft Surface 3 you

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.960 
faster than the Microsoft Surface 3 you
can<00:04:12.900> see<00:04:13.050> they're<00:04:13.820> quite<00:04:14.820> a<00:04:14.940> bit<00:04:15.180> faster<00:04:16.970> which

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
can see they're quite a bit faster which

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.240 
can see they're quite a bit faster which
is<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.180> shame<00:04:18.540> that<00:04:18.710> Microsoft<00:04:19.710> didn't<00:04:19.979> use<00:04:20.130> a

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
is a shame that Microsoft didn't use a

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.710 
is a shame that Microsoft didn't use a
faster<00:04:20.729> drive<00:04:20.940> there<00:04:21.150> maybe<00:04:21.299> they<00:04:21.450> could<00:04:21.630> have

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
faster drive there maybe they could have

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.430 
faster drive there maybe they could have
gone<00:04:21.900> with<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.290> newer<00:04:22.610> MMC<00:04:23.610> 5

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
gone with the newer MMC 5

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.170 
gone with the newer MMC 5
drives<00:04:26.440> get<00:04:27.100> a<00:04:27.130> little<00:04:27.430> bit<00:04:27.520> more<00:04:27.669> speed<00:04:27.910> over

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
drives get a little bit more speed over

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.320 
drives get a little bit more speed over
there<00:04:28.330> I've<00:04:28.510> actually<00:04:28.690> seen<00:04:29.139> on<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:30.010> PPO<00:04:30.340> w4s

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
there I've actually seen on the PPO w4s

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.080 
there I've actually seen on the PPO w4s
I've<00:04:31.930> seen<00:04:32.350> write<00:04:32.770> rates<00:04:33.010> of<00:04:33.160> up<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.610> close<00:04:33.850> to

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
I've seen write rates of up to close to

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.560 
I've seen write rates of up to close to
80<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.410> reads<00:04:36.070> of<00:04:36.220> almost<00:04:36.520> 200<00:04:37.090> once<00:04:37.270> on<00:04:37.510> a

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
80 and reads of almost 200 once on a

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.490 
80 and reads of almost 200 once on a
another<00:04:38.260> Samsung<00:04:38.800> 64<00:04:39.460> gigabyte<00:04:39.990> ETM<00:04:40.990> seen<00:04:41.290> but

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
another Samsung 64 gigabyte ETM seen but

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.930 
another Samsung 64 gigabyte ETM seen but
so<00:04:41.710> this<00:04:41.830> is<00:04:41.949> a<00:04:41.979> little<00:04:42.130> bit<00:04:42.250> slower<00:04:42.490> something

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
so this is a little bit slower something

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.629 
so this is a little bit slower something
to<00:04:43.030> consider<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:43.720> those<00:04:44.680> are<00:04:44.889> your<00:04:45.040> ports

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
to consider and those are your ports

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.469 
to consider and those are your ports
beats<00:04:45.910> there<00:04:47.639> what<00:04:48.639> it<00:04:48.760> will<00:04:48.850> do<00:04:48.970> later<00:04:49.120> on<00:04:49.270> is

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
beats there what it will do later on is

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.060 
beats there what it will do later on is
a<00:04:49.510> couple<00:04:49.810> of<00:04:49.900> benchmarks<00:04:50.440> as<00:04:50.590> well<00:04:50.770> just<00:04:50.979> to

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
a couple of benchmarks as well just to

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.710 
a couple of benchmarks as well just to
compare<00:04:51.400> what<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.729> new<00:04:51.880> cheery<00:04:52.150> trail<00:04:52.479> is

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
compare what the new cheery trail is

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.530 
compare what the new cheery trail is
like<00:04:52.930> against<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:53.680> Old<00:04:53.889> Bay<00:04:54.280> Trail<00:04:54.610> see<00:04:55.300> what

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
like against the Old Bay Trail see what

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.360 
like against the Old Bay Trail see what
kind<00:04:55.720> of<00:04:55.810> difference<00:04:56.110> there<00:04:56.560> is<00:04:56.710> apparently

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
kind of difference there is apparently

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.940 
kind of difference there is apparently
there's<00:04:57.970> quite<00:04:58.930> a<00:04:58.960> large<00:04:59.290> difference<00:04:59.530> when<00:04:59.860> it

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
there's quite a large difference when it

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.190 
there's quite a large difference when it
comes<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.190> graphics<00:05:00.600> but<00:05:01.600> when<00:05:01.900> it<00:05:01.990> comes<00:05:02.110> to

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
comes to graphics but when it comes to

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.379 
comes to graphics but when it comes to
the<00:05:02.320> CPU<00:05:02.710> power<00:05:02.979> they<00:05:03.790> are<00:05:03.940> very<00:05:04.120> similar

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
the CPU power they are very similar

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:05.850 
the CPU power they are very similar
that's<00:05:04.660> not<00:05:04.870> much<00:05:05.110> of<00:05:05.260> an<00:05:05.350> upgrade<00:05:05.500> they're

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
that's not much of an upgrade they're

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.650 
that's not much of an upgrade they're
from<00:05:06.040> Intel

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
from Intel

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.879 
from Intel
alright<00:05:07.660> so<00:05:07.810> that's<00:05:08.080> the<00:05:08.260> video<00:05:08.530> I<00:05:08.650> will<00:05:08.860> have

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
alright so that's the video I will have

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.520 
alright so that's the video I will have
more<00:05:09.160> becoming<00:05:09.520> videos<00:05:09.880> on<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.330> surface<00:05:10.810> 3<00:05:11.410> if

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
more becoming videos on the surface 3 if

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.409 
more becoming videos on the surface 3 if
you<00:05:11.650> are<00:05:11.830> interested<00:05:12.370> we're<00:05:13.030> testing<00:05:13.330> out

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
you are interested we're testing out

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.790 
you are interested we're testing out
lots<00:05:13.600> of<00:05:13.720> things<00:05:13.780> or<00:05:14.139> try<00:05:14.350> and<00:05:14.440> do<00:05:14.500> a<00:05:14.530> bit<00:05:14.650> of

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
lots of things or try and do a bit of

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
to see if it can support the resolution

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.110 
to see if it can support the resolution
we<00:05:20.289> wanted<00:05:20.530> to<00:05:20.620> have<00:05:20.800> which<00:05:21.070> goes<00:05:21.250> up<00:05:21.430> to<00:05:21.460> 1440p

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
we wanted to have which goes up to 1440p

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.060 
we wanted to have which goes up to 1440p
hopefully<00:05:22.750> can<00:05:22.930> run<00:05:23.110> that<00:05:23.229> fine<00:05:23.560> out<00:05:23.830> of<00:05:23.949> the
