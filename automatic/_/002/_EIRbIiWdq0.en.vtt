00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.350
 whatsapp guys welcome to the gitti mi 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.940
 I'm always there that falls today I'm here 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.490
 with a video a sort of unboxing 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.660
 tutorial how i did it to speed up 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.130
 your pc 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.140
 today I teach you to record on ps4 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.190
 record and then your gameplay from 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.590
 ps 4 and I'll show you the unboxing note 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.920
 of the two matrix for a neige splitter of 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.630
 and never 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.239
 first let's see what it is first 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.090
 This splitter matrix splitter is a 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.930
 really comfortable object that allows us 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.180
 to duplicate the signal and export it 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.980
 on our on our card 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.040
 acquisition in fact we have as been 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.670
 seeing from the video three hdmi sockets of which 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.130
 one is hdmi where we will connect the cable 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.910
 that comes from our console and the 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.370
 two others are two outs therefore we at one 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.670
 to an output port we will connect the cable 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.549
 hdmi that goes to our monitor e 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.749
 on the other hand we will attack what 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:14.450
 go to our capture card 

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:17.840
 then bound game capture hd and the taj e 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.520
 hd pvr 2 or here what is the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.130
 your acquisition card the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.350
 resolution with which we will export and video 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.079
 it is the native one of the console therefore not 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.029
 there are differences in quality or otherwise 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.880
 there are no variations in the resolution 

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:34.039
 in fact this splitter also supports 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.759
 3d if you decided to 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.300
 use it to make other others like 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.770
 I can say others 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.320
 use so maybe you want 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.630
 view the content on a monitor 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.510
 3d rather than on a late TV 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.120
 this splitter also supports this 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.910
 technology therefore costs little about 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.860
 22 euros on amazon I will leave the link in 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.170
 description to buy it and it is a 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.170
 product that offers us anyway 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.390
 good qualities therefore on this 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.400
 what box we find we find 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.130
 besides that it is precisely the holds we have 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.840
 we find the power from five times 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.120
 if I'm not mistaken, that anyway supplied 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.100
 in the box as you see the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.260
 instruction booklet completely 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.030
 in Chinese so if you understand 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.790
 you can safely come to Ticino 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.350
 read it but if you don't understand it you have to 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.690
 follow this video in fact at the end 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.180
 I will show you quickly how to do it 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.550
 and the three LEDs excuse me for that 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.550
 and the ignition and the cider that mark 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.920
 which attacks were connected 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.250
 so in the case there is from zac assimo una 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.290
 Only HDMI will light up only one LED and 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.570
 case does not turn simo and attack 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.970
 also the other two output ports of the 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.070
 respective LEDs would start to link 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.840
 then to blink for the rest 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.090
 guys this is really an object 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.450
 simple seems done pretty well in 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.120
 how the materials are discrete 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.620
 the weight is not very light 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.770
 so it makes me think that anyway 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.830
 are quality components or at least 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.360
 what makes it look like I can't 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.090
 to really talk about what's inside 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.730
 because honestly I didn't open it is a 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.560
 product that probably comes from 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.510
 from china but almost kids anyway 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.180
 everything now comes from China then 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.750
 you just have to trust this is one of the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.930
 products that supports the hdcp then the 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.180
 protection that the year consoles have 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.060
 then imposed in dreams is imposed on us 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.980
 gamers waiting for the king liszt 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.020
 then the update that precisely 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.730
 will release the Japanese house we will have to 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.519
 use this contraption for 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.470
 record our gameplay because how 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.769
 you will know the sony has imposed this 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.530
 HDMI output protection because it had 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.050
 afraid that the contents were copied 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.570
 which we can find on the console 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.450
 then the blu ray movie rather than 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.460
 therefore other contents had to find 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.140
 this solution however I tell you that in 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.890
 future will release update between 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.720
 which it will be possible to use ours 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.180
 capture cards without sperm 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.910
 if you want to register until you do 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.520
 the update will be released 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.470
 use this contraption the kids there 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.570
 I leave the link in the description for 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.459
 be able to buy it as mentioned above 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.360
 price of about 22 euros shipping 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.519
 included 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.130
 I invite you to buy it if you have 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.410
 precisely this haste to register the 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.180
 quality is really good I will bring you a 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.780
 another video in which I will show you well 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.730
 what are the real capabilities of this 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.420
 splitter and what is the quality of 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.180
 export video export e 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.520
 I tell you that higher than that of 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.130
 share because the share is really low 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.440
 in fact I was able to prove quality 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.950
 exporting the console video to 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.180
 facebook and then download it and it really is 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.970
 low with this contraption instead 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.400
 we could record fine at high 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.320
 quality so I just have to 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.140
 advise you the guys you have we have 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.440
 saw the ace splitter matrix of and never is 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.270
 a really comfortable object I invite you to 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.710
 buy it if you enjoyed the video there 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.580
 I invite you to leave a like if you don't 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.110

 the invitation to leave a do not like e 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.620
 maybe write me in the comments because not 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.270

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.520
 invitation to join the channel for 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.040
 find more videos on computers on 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.330
 console and on everything about everything that is 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.330
 hi technology guys
