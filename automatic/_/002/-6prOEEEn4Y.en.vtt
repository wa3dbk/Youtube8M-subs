drives you could play on the beach for
hopefully<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.750> isn't<00:01:57.930> leading<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> trend

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
hopefully this isn't leading to a trend

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.230 
hopefully this isn't leading to a trend
I<00:01:58.740> mean<00:01:58.920> probably<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.340> more<00:01:59.460> gigs<00:01:59.759> on<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> disc

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
I mean probably the more gigs on a disc

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.730 
I mean probably the more gigs on a disc
the<00:02:00.420> better<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.930> game's<00:02:01.110> gonna<00:02:01.320> look<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the better the game's gonna look and the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.109 
the better the game's gonna look and the
more<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.040> can<00:02:02.159> include<00:02:02.430> which<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.880> always<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
more it can include which is always a

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.209 
more it can include which is always a
good<00:02:03.270> thing<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:04.409> get<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.680> most<00:02:04.829> out<00:02:04.979> I

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
good thing I to get the most out I

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.980 
good thing I to get the most out I
cannot<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.759> cam<00:02:05.939> him<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.479> guess<00:02:06.689> love<00:02:06.869> to

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
cannot have cam him so I guess love to

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.359 
cannot have cam him so I guess love to
see<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.170> mean<00:02:07.409> 60<00:02:07.710> gigabytes<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.190> only<00:02:08.340> a

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
see I mean 60 gigabytes it's only a

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.940 
see I mean 60 gigabytes it's only a
rumor<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.849> know<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:09.840> not<00:02:09.959> even<00:02:10.140> confirmed<00:02:10.530> but

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
rumor I know it's not even confirmed but

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.010 
rumor I know it's not even confirmed but
it<00:02:11.550> suggests<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.030> was<00:02:12.180> 60<00:02:12.450> gigabytes<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:12.989> I

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
it suggests that was 60 gigabytes so I

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.910 
it suggests that was 60 gigabytes so I
guess<00:02:13.260> we'll<00:02:13.379> have<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.560> see<00:02:13.709> this

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
guess we'll have to see this

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.410 
guess we'll have to see this
is<00:02:13.980> really<00:02:14.250> not<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:14.610> look<00:02:15.030> forward<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.390> that

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
is really not but look forward to that

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.699 
is really not but look forward to that
game<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:15.840> guess<00:02:15.959> coming<00:02:16.200> out<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:18.500> this<00:02:19.500> is

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
pretty sure it was an HD I don't know I

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.350 
pretty sure it was an HD I don't know I
could<00:02:48.750> be<00:02:48.780> wrong<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:50.190> was<00:02:50.340> listed<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.970> force<00:02:51.180> a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
could be wrong it was listed to force a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.690 
could be wrong it was listed to force a
temper<00:02:51.600> 30th<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.250> they<00:02:53.250> should<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.489> little

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
temper 30th and they should a little

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.430 
care that there's a remastered version
not<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:07.680> much<00:03:07.940> but<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.150> cool<00:03:09.330> idea<00:03:09.480> yes

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
not so much but is it a cool idea yes

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.100 
not so much but is it a cool idea yes
cuz<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.430> already<00:03:11.549> played<00:03:11.760> 133<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:12.690> don't<00:03:12.959> have

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
cuz I already played 133 so I don't have

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.809 
cuz I already played 133 so I don't have
any<00:03:13.290> use<00:03:13.500> for<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:14.069> mean<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.489> game<00:03:14.640> was

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
any use for it I mean the game was

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.069 
any use for it I mean the game was
perfect<00:03:15.330> as<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:17.810> it's<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.870> good<00:03:18.989> idea

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
perfect as it is and it's a good idea

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.470 
perfect as it is and it's a good idea
for<00:03:19.290> people<00:03:19.620> who<00:03:19.680> came<00:03:19.859> from<00:03:20.010> xbox<00:03:20.459> 360<00:03:21.090> over

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
for people who came from xbox 360 over

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.690 
for people who came from xbox 360 over
to<00:03:21.660> ps4<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.769> didn't<00:03:23.070> ever<00:03:23.190> get<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.430> play<00:03:23.579> the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
to ps4 that didn't ever get to play the

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.220 
to ps4 that didn't ever get to play the
Uncharted<00:03:24.030> series<00:03:24.180> because<00:03:24.570> then<00:03:25.019> they'll

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
Uncharted series because then they'll

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.140 
Uncharted series because then they'll
get<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.380> chance<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.680> play<00:03:25.829> it<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.850> guess<00:03:27.000> in

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
get a chance to play it and I guess in

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.020 
get a chance to play it and I guess in
really<00:03:27.420> high<00:03:27.750> definition<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:29.730> yeah<00:03:29.850> that's

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
really high definition so yeah that's

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.330 
really high definition so yeah that's
pretty<00:03:30.180> cool<00:03:30.660> for<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.049> mean<00:03:31.470> can't<00:03:32.220> go

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
pretty cool for that I mean can't go

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.380 
pretty cool for that I mean can't go
wrong<00:03:32.549> with<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.880> i<00:03:32.940> guess<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:34.700> yeah<00:03:35.700> i<00:03:36.000> mean

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
wrong with that i guess and yeah i mean

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.120 
wrong with that i guess and yeah i mean
hopefully<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.200> comes<00:03:37.320> out<00:03:37.560> that'd<00:03:37.859> be<00:03:37.890> cool

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
hopefully it comes out that'd be cool

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.460 
hopefully it comes out that'd be cool
