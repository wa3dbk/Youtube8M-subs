00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.590
 you have a ferret that bites you 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.000
 so do not bring it to your nose 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:14.270
 listen to our advice that will go 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.270
 everything much better let's go to the video ratti is 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.789
 a ferret nibbling and we are going to show you 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.369
 how we have to treat a ferret that 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.990
 bites us the first of the things of 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.169
 what we have to talk about is because a 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.429
 ferret bites us the ferrets bite 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.650
 basically for three or four reasons 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.560
 different the first of them is that 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.120
 when they are puppies between them they play 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.250
 very fervently the ferrets have the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.930
 very tough skin and precisely how it has 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.080
 the skin so hard between them they bite 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.180
 very strong and they do not measure that their mouth to 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.490
 our skin if it hurts us between 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.410
 they will be a few bites if you have seen 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.420
 play two ferrets you think they are 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.330
 killing but between them simply 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.400
 are playing we have to teach them that 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.650
 the bites that make other ferrets 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.840
 playing at us hurt us and that's 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.470
 the first reason why a ferret 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.720
 usually mont biting the second of them 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.030
 it's because ferrets feel fear in 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.390
 occasions when they get home for 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.240
 they 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.580
 it's an unknown place then when 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.760
 they do not know they are afraid and if we 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.190
 we do actions that they understand 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.130
 as an aggression they can bite us for 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.020
 defend yourself then the third of the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.240
 reasons why a ferret can 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.630
 biting is because of jealousy they establish a 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.060
 very important link with its owner and 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.070
 new people can bite you is 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.070
 very typical and it happens to me as his 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.990
 veterinarian who 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.390
 the owners and ask me says no 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.580
 I look at it does not bite it takes phenomenal and 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.890
 when we are going to touch us from 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.530
 Suddenly it bites us all clear 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.590
 strange people they do not recognize them 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.200
 and they can often show those 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.600
 signs of fear and therefore when it has 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.720
 fear your first defense is to give a 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.880
 bite then you have to take care of them and 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.920
 handle them very quietly the 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.350
 fourth of the reasons is when they are in 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.060
 a place that you do not know simply by 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.670
 fear for ignorance by odors 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.470
 new ones make them afraid and that 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.720
 anything make them jump and that 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.030
 can bite and the fifth of the reasons 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.670
 it's because they have a very very very 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.530
 sensitive if we have caressed an animal 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.390
 that they want to bite like 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.160
 example a rabbit you have to have a lot 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.920
 be careful because rabbits are your 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.200
 potential dams and we have caressed a 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.330
 rabbit and our smell on the hands 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.120
 when we are going to touch the ferret the ferret 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.640
 he can detect that smell and throw us 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.819
 bite their prey so that you 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.530
 I say rabbits as I can also tell you 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.959
 we have touched even a cat other 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.069
 pets they can detect that smell 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:53.489
 It's funny but the smell of feet hears you 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.590
 it's strangely attractive and it's very 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.420
 typical that one does not bite anyone but is 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.610
 true that when you smell the feet of 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.680
 suddenly it goes and hits a good morgan 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.000
 It is these nibbles snacks such as 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.610
 they also do them because these smells 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.140
 they get a lot of attention and they 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.520
 things that catch their attention go and 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.740
 they bite them 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.420
 as a general consideration we have to 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.510
 to say that you do not have to be afraid 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.130
 because ferrets can detect that 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.290
 fear that we have them are animals 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.170
 quite ready, even somewhat hierarchical 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.310
 and if they detect that we are afraid of them and 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.020
 that we 're not going to touch them they're going to 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.690
 take advantage of that and it will cost us a 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.840
 can educate them so much that 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.370
 do not be afraid of them and try to get them 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.850
 hand and catch them since they are well 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.850
 little ones 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.050
 come then let's put solution to 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.900
 the bites when a ferret bites us 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.780
 we should recriminate him and we owe him 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.360
 to do emphatically 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.060
 always accompanying with a no and I'm going to 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.010
 say three actions that some 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.710
 they annoy a lot but they do not do it 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.110
 damage the first of them is taps 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.360
 in the nose 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.440
 the nose of the ferrets is a very organ 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.270
 sensitive 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.060
 those little touches are telling you what 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.220
 he has done is wrong other way 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.720
 what we can do is holding him and 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.260
 blowing on his face 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.930
 and saying always no no 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.100
 second action that some bothers you and 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.419
 We are telling you that what you have done 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.340
 is wrong and the third of them is 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.320
 grasping the fold neck 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.690
 this way is the one that their 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.669
 parents his mother in this case he 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.770
 We we hold and shakes him a little bit 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.750
 the pair that we say no when a ferret is 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.670
 it holds him from the neck crease in the 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.730
 Most of the times you will yawn 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.440
 the neck triggers a reflex that 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.639
 we call vagal reflex makes the 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.229
 relax animal 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.879
 and grab him from the neck crease and 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.550
 shaking him a little bit is another of the 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:52.249
 solutions that without hurting it makes you 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.800
 understand that what he has done is wrong 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:57.419
 but if the bites persist a 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.219
 good way to teach them what they are 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.189
 doing wrong is putting them in the 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:03.749
 carrier is the ferret follows us 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:06.180
 biting we do not work 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:08.999
 little touches what we do say no 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.979
 and we punish it, we're going to put it in 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:13.080
 to calm down for half an hour in the 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.389
 carrier never in the cage because the 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.969
 cage should not be a punishment system 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.650
 the punishment is the carrier is told 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:22.009
 do not 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.020
 and for inside 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.199
 and now we will wait half an hour in a 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.789
 place dark in twilight so that the 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.249
 animal understand that what he has done is 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.009
 wrong and instead of playing you have to go to 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:36.110
 your room to sleep 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.360
 we should not be in a hurry you have to have 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.580
 patience many of them take time 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.249
 to get used to one of the tricks 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.069
 that work very well for me is to put a 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:48.649
 shirt in the place where they sleep 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:52.369
 this shirt that should be ours with 

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:55.430
 our smell we will use it as your 

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:57.229
 cradle your home your bed so to speak and 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.529
 when they sleep here they will identify 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:03.350
 this smell with tranquility with something that 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:07.220
 with what they sleep with what gives them peace 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:09.590
 in this way we must also 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.690
 walk around the house so that it takes all 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.040
 the house smells a ferret until not 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.950
 be calm and do not know 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.360
 perfectly your house all your surroundings not 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.460
 going to rest will not be at peace 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.350
 then let's let him recognize his 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.560
 environment and let's let it recognize 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.450
 our smells the time to sleep is 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.940
 the best time to touch the ferret 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.620
 when the animal is more relaxed and 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.690
 many times they sleep so deep that 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.390
 allows us to touch him during a lot of 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.760
 time to be able to relax and that he 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.730
 familiar with our touch and with 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.700
 our texture of hands and I tell you of 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:46.160
 hands never use gloves 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.380
 gloves all they do is encourage 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.940
 to the ferret biting even stronger 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.820
 and also as it does not hurt us 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:56.270
 we allow our gloves to bite us 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:58.610
 they let us also let the ferret catch and 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.400
 detect our smell 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.520
 and finally as a general recommendation 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.229
 is that he recriminates the ferret at the time 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.110
 in which does the damage of the moment in the 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:11.800
 that bites you not no of you die that that 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.800
 recrimination
