00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
at hiding what the the caveat to that is

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.319 
at hiding what the the caveat to that is
that<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:51.590> didn't<00:00:52.590> hit<00:00:52.860> anyone<00:00:53.309> well<00:00:53.940> that's<00:00:54.090> not

that I didn't hit anyone well that's not

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.569 
that I didn't hit anyone well that's not
true<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.899> did<00:00:55.800> hit<00:00:56.039> someone<00:00:56.460> right<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> mask

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
true I did hit someone right in the mask

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.150 
true I did hit someone right in the mask
they<00:00:59.579> were<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.789> my<00:01:00.120> team<00:01:00.149> I

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.320 

really<00:01:03.520> bad<00:01:03.730> at<00:01:03.910> paintball

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
really bad at paintball

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.350 
really bad at paintball
I<00:01:05.390> think<00:01:05.990> I'll<00:01:06.080> just<00:01:06.110> stick<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:06.770> shooters<00:01:07.360> yeah

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
I think I'll just stick to shooters yeah

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.200 
I think I'll just stick to shooters yeah
I'm<00:01:09.200> pretty<00:01:09.350> good<00:01:09.530> at<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:09.820> because<00:01:10.820> it

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
I'm pretty good at that because it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.180 
I'm pretty good at that because it
doesn't<00:01:11.480> involve<00:01:11.750> running<00:01:12.080> around<00:01:12.410> which

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
doesn't involve running around which

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.420 
doesn't involve running around which
usually<00:01:13.460> makes<00:01:13.820> me<00:01:13.970> trip<00:01:14.210> because<00:01:14.750> I<00:01:15.170> am<00:01:16.010> very

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
usually makes me trip because I am very

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.780 
usually makes me trip because I am very
very<00:01:16.610> clumsy<00:01:17.350> so<00:01:18.350> speaking<00:01:19.070> of<00:01:19.190> shooters<00:01:19.460> I

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
very clumsy so speaking of shooters I

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.880 
very clumsy so speaking of shooters I
picked<00:01:20.330> out<00:01:20.480> black<00:01:20.720> ops<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.350> I<00:01:21.590> got<00:01:21.770> the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
picked out black ops and I got the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.310 
picked out black ops and I got the
chance<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.250> try<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.520> now<00:01:22.910> I<00:01:23.270> think<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.230> a<00:01:24.260> little

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
chance to try it now I think is a little

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.860 
chance to try it now I think is a little
over<00:01:24.680> height<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.360> I'm<00:01:26.360> thinking<00:01:27.050> lately<00:01:28.010> that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
over height and I'm thinking lately that

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.990 
over height and I'm thinking lately that
game<00:01:29.870> developers<00:01:30.410> are<00:01:30.590> like<00:01:30.800> any<00:01:31.460> time<00:01:31.760> they

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
game developers are like any time they

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.700 
game developers are like any time they
don't<00:01:32.120> have<00:01:32.540> a<00:01:32.570> strong<00:01:33.170> enough<00:01:33.230> product

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
don't have a strong enough product

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.080 
don't have a strong enough product
they're<00:01:34.010> like<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:34.340> all<00:01:34.550> those<00:01:34.670> throw<00:01:34.910> some

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
they're like that all those throw some

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.350 
they're like that all those throw some
zombies<00:01:35.480> in<00:01:35.600> there<00:01:35.750> I'll<00:01:35.990> be<00:01:36.080> fine<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:38.270> know
