to<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.120> D<00:03:55.390> we<00:03:55.630> actually<00:03:56.020> just<00:03:56.200> change<00:03:56.380> our

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
to the D we actually just change our

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.400 
to the D we actually just change our
base<00:03:56.740> note<00:03:57.600> so<00:03:58.600> we're<00:03:58.750> actually<00:03:58.870> not<00:03:59.110> holding

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
base note so we're actually not holding

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.870 
base note so we're actually not holding
down<00:03:59.440> any<00:03:59.770> notes<00:04:00.010> with<00:04:00.310> our<00:04:00.400> hat<00:04:00.580> with<00:04:00.760> our

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
left hand and our right hand our thumb

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.000 
left hand and our right hand our thumb
just<00:04:02.650> jumps<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.160> D<00:04:03.370> string

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.320 

and<00:04:06.099> then<00:04:06.310> our<00:04:06.400> middle<00:04:06.670> ring<00:04:06.879> finger<00:04:07.209> just

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
and then our middle ring finger just

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.660 
and then our middle ring finger just
stay<00:04:07.870> in<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.080> same<00:04:08.110> spot<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:09.430> we're<00:04:09.519> going<00:04:09.610> to

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
stay in the same spot so we're going to

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.330 
stay in the same spot so we're going to
go

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.500 

so<00:04:14.340> what<00:04:14.459> ends<00:04:14.580> up<00:04:14.670> happening<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:15.209> when<00:04:15.390> that

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
so what ends up happening is when that

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.970 
so what ends up happening is when that
little<00:04:15.810> note<00:04:15.959> change<00:04:16.230> happens<00:04:16.620> we<00:04:16.709> bring<00:04:16.889> our

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
little note change happens we bring our

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.909 
little note change happens we bring our
pointer<00:04:17.370> finger<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.880> G<00:04:18.410> pluck<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:19.620> with

pointer finger to the G pluck that with

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.550 
pointer finger to the G pluck that with
our<00:04:20.040> middle<00:04:20.280> finger<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:21.600> then<00:04:22.230> do<00:04:22.320> it<00:04:22.350> like<00:04:22.440> a

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
our middle finger and then do it like a

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.960 
our middle finger and then do it like a
little<00:04:22.800> pick<00:04:22.980> up<00:04:23.010> note<00:04:23.370> with<00:04:23.580> our<00:04:23.610> pointer

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
little pick up note with our pointer

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.180 
little pick up note with our pointer

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
finger on the D on the open D before we

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.100 
finger on the D on the open D before we
change<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.700> that<00:04:26.820> C<00:04:27.030> chord<00:04:27.240> so<00:04:27.750> once<00:04:27.900> again

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
change to that C chord so once again

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:37.390 
change to that C chord so once again
it's<00:04:28.230> going<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.380> go<00:04:28.500> like<00:04:28.680> this

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.150 

and<00:04:38.330> change<00:04:38.600> it<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.840> sea<00:04:39.110> now<00:04:39.830> when<00:04:39.979> we<00:04:40.040> get

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
and change it to the sea now when we get

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.260 
and change it to the sea now when we get
to<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.340> sea<00:04:40.520> we're<00:04:40.699> going<00:04:40.820> to<00:04:40.880> do<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.030> same

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
to the sea we're going to do the same

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.150 
to the sea we're going to do the same
exact<00:04:41.630> thing<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:42.350> only<00:04:42.500> difference<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:43.010> we're

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
exact thing the only difference is we're

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.920 
exact thing the only difference is we're
just<00:04:43.190> going<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:43.520> change<00:04:43.850> our<00:04:44.120> bass<00:04:44.389> note<00:04:44.419> here

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
our thumb is plucking the a string but

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.320 
our thumb is plucking the a string but
doing<00:04:53.389> the<00:04:53.479> same<00:04:53.720> motion<00:04:53.960> so<00:04:54.380> once<00:04:54.530> again<00:04:54.680> just

we make the same change that launches us
back<00:05:11.780> into<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.170> court<00:05:12.410> so<00:05:13.220> altogether<00:05:13.460> once

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
back into the court so altogether once

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:39.740 
back into the court so altogether once
again<00:05:14.060> it's<00:05:14.210> going<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.390> go<00:05:14.480> like<00:05:14.660> this

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.150 

so<00:05:40.750> that's<00:05:40.930> what<00:05:41.080> I<00:05:41.140> would<00:05:41.260> do<00:05:41.350> for<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:41.650> intro

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
so that's what I would do for the intro

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.560 
so that's what I would do for the intro
and<00:05:42.430> that<00:05:42.670> first<00:05:42.970> verse

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
and that first verse

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.660 
and that first verse
now<00:05:43.960> when<00:05:44.200> you<00:05:44.380> when<00:05:45.130> you<00:05:45.250> you<00:05:45.340> know<00:05:45.430> you<00:05:45.490> can

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
now when you when you you know you can

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.740 
now when you when you you know you can
kind<00:05:45.850> of<00:05:45.880> start<00:05:46.090> bringing<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.390> little<00:05:46.600> bit<00:05:46.690> of

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
kind of start bringing a little bit of

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.780 
kind of start bringing a little bit of
strumming<00:05:47.040> when<00:05:48.040> you<00:05:48.100> start<00:05:48.340> changing<00:05:48.520> around

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
strumming when you start changing around

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.400 
strumming when you start changing around
with<00:05:49.150> those<00:05:49.300> different<00:05:49.660> when<00:05:50.140> the<00:05:50.230> chord

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
with those different when the chord

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.510 
with those different when the chord
changes<00:05:50.680> happen<00:05:50.950> a<00:05:51.010> little<00:05:51.100> bit<00:05:51.310> quicker

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
changes happen a little bit quicker

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.730 
changes happen a little bit quicker
about<00:05:51.700> halfway<00:05:52.000> through<00:05:52.330> that<00:05:52.360> verse<00:05:52.710> it<00:05:53.710> says

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
about halfway through that verse it says

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.740 
about halfway through that verse it says
and<00:05:54.100> you<00:05:54.160> look<00:05:54.310> at<00:05:54.430> this<00:05:54.550> prisoner<00:05:54.940> right<00:05:55.150> so

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
and you look at this prisoner right so

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.060 
and you look at this prisoner right so
at<00:05:55.840> that<00:05:55.990> point<00:05:56.200> I'd<00:05:56.410> still<00:05:56.680> kind<00:05:56.860> of<00:05:56.920> just

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
at that point I'd still kind of just

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:08.779 
at that point I'd still kind of just
keep<00:05:57.220> a<00:05:57.370> real<00:05:57.910> light<00:05:58.530> real<00:05:59.530> light<00:05:59.770> strumming

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:13.139 

your<00:06:09.789> chorus<00:06:10.269> I<00:06:10.479> am<00:06:10.989> redeemed<00:06:11.649> and<00:06:12.189> at<00:06:12.999> that

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:13.149 
your chorus I am redeemed and at that

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:14.909 
your chorus I am redeemed and at that
point<00:06:13.389> I<00:06:13.539> would<00:06:13.749> just<00:06:13.929> kind<00:06:14.229> of<00:06:14.259> use<00:06:14.589> a<00:06:14.619> nice

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
point I would just kind of use a nice

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.129 
point I would just kind of use a nice
quiet<00:06:15.369> like<00:06:16.029> in<00:06:16.209> terms<00:06:16.419> of<00:06:16.509> dynamics<00:06:16.689> you<00:06:17.110> know

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 
quiet like in terms of dynamics you know

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:19.199 
quiet like in terms of dynamics you know
nice<00:06:17.469> and<00:06:17.649> quiet<00:06:17.889> but<00:06:18.369> just<00:06:18.519> using<00:06:18.669> that<00:06:18.819> basic

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:19.209 
nice and quiet but just using that basic

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:20.909 
nice and quiet but just using that basic
strum<00:06:19.449> pattern<00:06:19.749> that<00:06:19.899> you're<00:06:20.019> using<00:06:20.259> for<00:06:20.860> the

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
strum pattern that you're using for the

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.039 
strum pattern that you're using for the
rest<00:06:21.039> of<00:06:21.189> the<00:06:21.309> song<00:06:21.689> now<00:06:22.689> when<00:06:22.839> you<00:06:22.899> get<00:06:22.989> to

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:23.049 
rest of the song now when you get to

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.079 
rest of the song now when you get to
verse<00:06:23.139> two<00:06:23.559> I<00:06:23.799> would<00:06:24.610> stick<00:06:24.909> with<00:06:24.939> the

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:25.089 
verse two I would stick with the

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:28.559 
verse two I would stick with the
strumming<00:06:25.449> but<00:06:25.719> what<00:06:25.869> I<00:06:25.899> would<00:06:26.049> do<00:06:26.349> is<00:06:27.569> bring

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:28.569 
strumming but what I would do is bring

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:30.089 
strumming but what I would do is bring
in<00:06:28.659> that<00:06:28.809> little<00:06:29.019> note<00:06:29.199> change<00:06:29.559> whenever<00:06:29.860> you

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
in that little note change whenever you

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.619 
in that little note change whenever you
can<00:06:30.309> so<00:06:30.610> for<00:06:30.789> example<00:06:31.119> when<00:06:31.239> you<00:06:31.299> get<00:06:31.389> to<00:06:31.509> that

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:31.629 
can so for example when you get to that

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:33.329 
can so for example when you get to that
second<00:06:32.049> verse<00:06:32.169> you<00:06:32.379> can<00:06:32.499> kind<00:06:32.649> of<00:06:32.679> stick<00:06:33.279> with

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:33.339 
second verse you can kind of stick with

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:35.189 
second verse you can kind of stick with
the<00:06:33.519> strum<00:06:33.729> pattern<00:06:34.059> but<00:06:34.599> within<00:06:34.749> the<00:06:34.989> strum

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 
the strum pattern but within the strum

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:41.749 
the strum pattern but within the strum
pattern<00:06:35.559> and<00:06:35.949> besides<00:06:36.279> that<00:06:36.459> note<00:06:36.669> so<00:06:36.699> we'd<00:06:37.029> go

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:47.700 

called<00:06:42.759> the<00:06:43.059> failure

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.570 

so<00:06:48.710> we're<00:06:48.830> still<00:06:49.009> using<00:06:49.040> those<00:06:49.550> other

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
so we're still using those other

00:06:49.580 --> 00:07:03.200 
so we're still using those other
voicings<00:06:50.270> that<00:06:50.360> we're<00:06:50.570> using

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.390 

etc<00:07:04.210> you<00:07:04.570> just<00:07:04.720> kind<00:07:04.840> of<00:07:04.900> fill<00:07:05.050> those<00:07:05.169> out

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 
etc you just kind of fill those out

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.249 
etc you just kind of fill those out
finally<00:07:06.400> on<00:07:06.580> that<00:07:06.880> Secord<00:07:07.570> at<00:07:07.660> the<00:07:07.750> very<00:07:08.020> end

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:08.259 
finally on that Secord at the very end

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:09.840 
finally on that Secord at the very end
of<00:07:08.410> verse<00:07:08.560> two<00:07:08.889> I<00:07:09.130> would<00:07:09.340> bring<00:07:09.490> in<00:07:09.610> a<00:07:09.669> little

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:09.850 
of verse two I would bring in a little

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.090 
of verse two I would bring in a little
bit<00:07:09.970> of<00:07:10.120> a<00:07:10.180> walk<00:07:10.389> up<00:07:10.600> kind<00:07:10.780> of<00:07:10.900> mimicking<00:07:11.889> what

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.100 
bit of a walk up kind of mimicking what

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.560 
bit of a walk up kind of mimicking what
the<00:07:12.250> strings<00:07:12.550> are<00:07:12.699> doing<00:07:12.970> so<00:07:13.150> when<00:07:13.300> you<00:07:13.389> land

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:13.570 
the strings are doing so when you land

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.749 
the strings are doing so when you land
on<00:07:13.660> that<00:07:13.720> sea<00:07:16.979> you<00:07:17.979> kind<00:07:18.190> of<00:07:18.250> just<00:07:18.400> bring<00:07:18.610> in

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 
on that sea you kind of just bring in

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:23.580 
on that sea you kind of just bring in
that<00:07:19.169> fourth<00:07:20.169> fret<00:07:20.410> of<00:07:20.440> your<00:07:20.530> D<00:07:20.650> string<00:07:22.590> your

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590 
that fourth fret of your D string your

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.150 
that fourth fret of your D string your
cool<00:07:23.919> little<00:07:24.100> C<00:07:24.880> chord<00:07:25.150> there<00:07:25.830> and<00:07:26.830> then<00:07:26.979> lift

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 
cool little C chord there and then lift

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.529 
cool little C chord there and then lift
it<00:07:27.250> back<00:07:27.370> up<00:07:27.430> there<00:07:27.789> it<00:07:27.880> gives<00:07:28.060> the<00:07:28.270> impression

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:28.539 
it back up there it gives the impression

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:30.779 
it back up there it gives the impression
of<00:07:29.110> like<00:07:29.289> a<00:07:29.320> little<00:07:29.800> note<00:07:30.009> climb<00:07:30.340> there<00:07:30.580> so

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:30.789 
of like a little note climb there so

then at that point I would just go to

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.629 
then at that point I would just go to
the<00:07:41.080> other<00:07:41.259> chord<00:07:41.650> voicings<00:07:42.130> that<00:07:42.190> we<00:07:42.340> used<00:07:42.520> on
