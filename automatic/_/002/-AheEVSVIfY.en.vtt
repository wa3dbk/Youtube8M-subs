00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
something so this isn't taking up your

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.830 
something so this isn't taking up your
only<00:01:35.630> spot<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:37.049> charging<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.780> said

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
only spot for charging so like I said

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
this is also something that can take

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.989 
this is also something that can take
calls<00:01:43.859> so<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.310> are<00:01:44.369> some<00:01:44.520> things<00:01:44.729> on

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:44.999

you're<00:02:30.420> driving<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.500> go<00:02:31.620> ahead<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:32.040> you

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
you're driving you go ahead and you

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.699 
you're driving you go ahead and you
mount<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.849> disc<00:02:33.329> and<00:02:33.689> then<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.170> actually

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
mount that disc and then this actually

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.690 
mount that disc and then this actually
just<00:02:35.030> sticks<00:02:36.030> right<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:37.129> that<00:02:38.129> way<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.370> can

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
just sticks right to it that way you can

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.089 
just sticks right to it that way you can
actually<00:02:38.849> take<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.329> down<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.920> don't

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
actually take this down and you don't

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.479 
actually take this down and you don't
have<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.400> always<00:02:41.609> have<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:42.439> installed<00:02:43.439> now<00:02:44.400> if

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
have to always have it installed now if

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.039 
have to always have it installed now if
you<00:02:44.549> can't<00:02:44.760> tell<00:02:44.939> this<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.299> actually<00:02:45.659> pretty

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
you can't tell this is actually pretty

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:46.729 
you can't tell this is actually pretty
small

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
small

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.710 
small
it's<00:02:47.069> about<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.819> size<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.299> silver<00:02:48.569> dollar

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
it's about the size of a silver dollar

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.039 
it's about the size of a silver dollar
maybe<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.680> little<00:02:50.099> bit<00:02:50.310> smaller<00:02:50.639> so<00:02:50.939> it<00:02:51.780> doesn't

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
maybe a little bit smaller so it doesn't

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.720 
maybe a little bit smaller so it doesn't
take<00:02:52.139> up<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.439> lot<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.590> room<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:53.159> really

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
take up a lot of room and it's really

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.179 
take up a lot of room and it's really
easy<00:02:53.909> to<00:02:54.030> find<00:02:54.299> somewhere<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:55.019> actually<00:02:55.799> mount

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
easy to find somewhere to actually mount

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.849 
easy to find somewhere to actually mount
this<00:02:57.019> so<00:02:58.019> yeah<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.230> definitely<00:02:58.560> got<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.680> say

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
this so yeah I definitely got to say

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.050 
this so yeah I definitely got to say
that<00:02:59.010> this<00:02:59.129> is<00:02:59.310> something<00:02:59.549> that<00:02:59.700> I've<00:02:59.909> been

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
that this is something that I've been

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.670 
that this is something that I've been
looking<00:03:00.299> for<00:03:00.689> for<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.959> long<00:03:01.109> time<00:03:01.439> I<00:03:01.470> never

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
looking for for a long time I never

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.159 
looking for for a long time I never
really<00:03:02.250> considered<00:03:02.689> something<00:03:03.689> like<00:03:03.840> this

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:04.169 
really considered something like this

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.369 
really considered something like this
but<00:03:04.829> it<00:03:05.010> does<00:03:05.310> make<00:03:05.700> listening<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.840> music<00:03:07.169> and

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
but it does make listening to music and

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.229 
but it does make listening to music and
taking<00:03:07.590> phone<00:03:07.919> calls<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.459> your<00:03:08.639> vehicle<00:03:09.120> a

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
taking phone calls and your vehicle a

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.860 
taking phone calls and your vehicle a
lot<00:03:09.510> more<00:03:09.720> convenient<00:03:10.159> and<00:03:11.599> actually<00:03:12.599> a<00:03:12.629> lot

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
lot more convenient and actually a lot

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.960 
lot more convenient and actually a lot
more<00:03:12.930> safe<00:03:13.500> than<00:03:13.530> trying<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.400> fiddle<00:03:14.849> with

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
more safe than trying to fiddle with

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.970 
more safe than trying to fiddle with
your<00:03:15.090> phone<00:03:15.419> at<00:03:15.659> a<00:03:15.689> red<00:03:15.930> light<00:03:15.959> or<00:03:16.169> you<00:03:16.859> know

some people might try to mess with their
phone<00:03:18.599> while<00:03:18.780> they're<00:03:18.959> driving<00:03:19.250> this<00:03:20.250> here

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
phone while they're driving this here

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.309

somewhere and go forward and back with

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.800 
somewhere and go forward and back with
the<00:03:25.319> tracks<00:03:26.150> yeah<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.269> was<00:03:27.359> just<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.659> quick

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
the tracks yeah that was just a quick

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.719 
the tracks yeah that was just a quick
look<00:03:28.019> at<00:03:28.169> this<00:03:28.290> product<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.829> really<00:03:29.549> highly

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729 
look at this product I really highly

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.149 
look at this product I really highly
recommend<00:03:29.819> it<00:03:30.389> it's<00:03:31.169> something<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.979> I<00:03:32.010> think

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
recommend it it's something that I think

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.759 
recommend it it's something that I think
could<00:03:33.060> potentially<00:03:33.810> make<00:03:34.049> people<00:03:34.440> out<00:03:34.530> there

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
could potentially make people out there

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.240 
could potentially make people out there
safer<00:03:35.220> drivers<00:03:36.079> it's<00:03:37.079> really<00:03:37.440> convenient<00:03:37.919> and

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
safer drivers it's really convenient and

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.479 
safer drivers it's really convenient and
it's<00:03:38.489> really<00:03:38.819> clever<00:03:40.040> you<00:03:41.040> know<00:03:41.069> a<00:03:41.159> really

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
it's really clever you know a really

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.949 
it's really clever you know a really
clever<00:03:41.729> idea<00:03:41.849> I'm<00:03:42.239> sure<00:03:42.329> they're<00:03:42.659> not<00:03:42.810> the

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
clever idea I'm sure they're not the

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.629 
clever idea I'm sure they're not the
first<00:03:43.109> ones<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.560> do<00:03:43.680> something<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.159> this<00:03:44.370> but

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
first ones to do something like this but

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.719 
first ones to do something like this but
I<00:03:44.729> think<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.090> implementation<00:03:45.949> is<00:03:46.949> fantastic

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
I think the implementation is fantastic

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.280 
I think the implementation is fantastic
