00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.000
 Copperfield told by himself very 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.800
 like the promo 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.660
 but it turned out that at home for 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.450
 teke I never had it why 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.790
 the fact that in childhood he took 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.820
 libraries in the village in the summer remember and there 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.220
 I read and I really didn’t like it 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.369
 I recently remembered something I thought 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.200
 need to buy went to the bookstore and there 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.370
 That is, 400 rubles, is it worth it? 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.440
 inspected here in the online store and there 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.770
 it turned out only 111 like to deliver it 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.350
 here's a hard cover publisher this 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.300
 us alphabet 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:51.540
 St. Petersburg here is paper but to me 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.970
 it seems for the price of 111 rubles is good 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.300
 the quality of this day is not a soft cover 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.489
 so I hope and will last the same 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.650
 said this evening makeup book 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.619

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.880
 there was a budget purchase of 841 rubles became 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.530

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.600

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.520

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.229
 photos from a book with makeup and me 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.330

 here for the sake of these photos with these 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.110
 beautiful beaches need to take me 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.620
 completely unknown to some author 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.229

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.400
 reproductions of money 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.310
 I showed in my opinion in the last part 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.420
 clerical maniac that by chance in 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.479
 our bookstore stumbled upon here 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.510
 such an album up male that is here 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.030
 work model and they can not be such a tonic 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.700
 we can be glued and postcards 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.759

 single copy to you there 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.090
 accidentally hit 405 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.620
 from if I'm not mistaken, it cost us 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.590
 book and then I saw the same book with 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.270
 mana reproductions and it cost 404 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.430
 rubles in their online store in 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.230
 principle not much cheaper but still i 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.790
 just decided to take his girlfriend in 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.590

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.930
 here it doesn't watch this video now and 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.640
 just liked it very much 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.760
 this album when I bought it myself and 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.370
 so I decided to order too 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.530
 well what can I say and this mania is more 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.450
 a detailed review of my class 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.980
 leading clerical not me 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.830
 the last thing I said is if not 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.160
 could hold very very pretty 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.960
 countryman small notebooks 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.020
 it's really like that in country 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.880
 style look so cute 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.580
 and then everything in the line and the top just 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.560
 changing this design would be so 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.060
 in blocks 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.670
 Zaz in one for recording rustic motives 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.740
 he is very thin but he also became 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.420
 absolutely absolutely 61 rubles I therefore 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.010
 immediately two said one can be on 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.610
 a gift to someone was and the minute that I 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.250
 ordered 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.160
 and there is also in the online store 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.240
 the maze and they have such a thing like 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.900
 bookcrossing 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.550
 that is, they are in the pickup points 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.240
 shelves there you bring 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.010
 some books that you don’t have 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.380
 needed but in good condition naturally 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.630
 and in return and take it any days without 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.490
 sticks there by up to three books 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.380
 at a time bring take that is 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.050
 bookcrossing decided to get 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.850
 take advantage why not here 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.580
 dragged me first in some way 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.860
 there was a little spider book or 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.020
 light warrior book i'm not a fan at all 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.270
 absolutely spider or honestly don't even know 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.540
 where I had it from I therefore decided 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.239
 just take her there because no I 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.940
 I know that many like the spider and thought 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.860
 that maybe someone will come in handy and she 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.160
 was all the more very good condition 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:18.440
 for an outstanding Michael came to women 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.450

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.120
 I generally like to come back from school 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.979
 since times I've always liked it 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.740
 gladly took this book here at all 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.960
 in '86 still Moscow 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.370
 I took the second true book 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.650
 singing in the thorns 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.910
 I also had some 90 years 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.099
 release we are also in very good 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.470
 condition I do not know why some 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:42.740
 irrational not love and precisely here 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.000
 digging stern he will just hire 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.410
 arranging honestly speaking not for again 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.389
 what I don't like is not 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.240
 You know what others do not like, I took 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.099
 just such a book shop fiction consider 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.240
 content saw 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:59.370
 kir bulychev robert heinlein food on 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.020

 the last authors did not know but kir 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.270
 bulychev I thought like sturla necessarily 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.310
 to take 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.500
 I really didn’t think that the picker 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.800
 goby ubs wrote just the preface and 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.330
 there are no his works here of course 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.970
 there was such a little charm 2 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.099
 Nezhdanchik expected never I will refuse this 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.830
 book now i say censor him 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.419
 general here as a little before 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.789
 intertwined this book 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.460
 whether that's open look and there's 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.470
 bank some 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.800
 newspaper clippings with updated girls 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.090
 even i would like to say two more things 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.250
 probably not enough for a full 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.050
 next clerical video is not that world 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.669

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.000
 my collection of moomin trolls 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:45.750
 I added just such a book Mid role well, not 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.289
 dad me mom and you can pass such 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.870
 figurines 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:53.280
 they have such a downside 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.210
 You can insert a stand 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.210
 publishing house exmo 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.580
 there is 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.289
 There are a lot of children's books in this series. 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.880
 different that is, there are some with 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.159
 cars for boys all but something 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.349
 I was alone with my trolls 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.849
 immediately took and also such 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.190
 a set of cards and bought my first 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:15.569
 japanese words 333 cards 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:21.300
 see there are different languages ​​not only 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:23.849
 Japanese and inside there are such very 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.840
 comfortable little cards really 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:29.699
 broken down by topic and the picture is written here 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.229
 hero danko so she is well here only 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:35.009
 one way of writing is because it 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:37.349
 borrowed words a couple by on the floor 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.010
 it turns out she did so I looked and 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:38.350
 understood that 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.910
 and 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.760
 with a topic that I know best 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.500
 almost all cards are animal 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.170
 Naturally I think those who can anime 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.070
 they get so that you know in the end 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:53.110
 water anyway 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:57.670
 here for example here on and count or panic 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:07:00.550
 cat costume chanterelle by the way who watched 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.680
 anime triplexogolik there in the world of spirits and 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:06.940
 gods have such a cool service 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:09.910
 delivering pizza on and but 11 fox 1 and there 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.220

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.380
 one is cooking and very so kawai 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.990
 shy little fox like 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.030
 the courier delivers this one to everyone 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.400
 so sweet 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.960
 still more such a passive 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.030
 learning happens that is when i 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.620
 I look they may the most there or look 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.070
 some Japanese bloggers something here 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.990
 such a 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.640
 memorized something to learn from 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.850
 context well, so here's an example session 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.620
 grammar or here's the alphabet and start 

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.690
 learn until there is no such honest but 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.780
 anyway and hope that someday 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.190
 strongly I made it food very cool 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.460
 a set of cards can really them 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:47.890
 there are many and they are so compact overall i 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.180
 very pleased in principle
