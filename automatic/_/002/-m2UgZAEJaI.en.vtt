three<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.269> added<00:04:00.720> probably<00:04:01.049> like<00:04:01.170> 50<00:04:01.500> files<00:04:01.739> in

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
three I added probably like 50 files in

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.270 
three I added probably like 50 files in
there<00:04:02.129> or<00:04:02.370> more<00:04:03.349> so<00:04:04.349> what<00:04:04.799> you<00:04:04.920> don't<00:04:05.099> want<00:04:05.220> to

there or more so what you don't want to

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.960 
there or more so what you don't want to
do<00:04:05.400> from<00:04:05.610> there<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:06.030> go<00:04:06.329> to<00:04:06.390> actions<00:04:07.049> and

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
do from there is go to actions and

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.440 
do from there is go to actions and
rebuild<00:04:09.530> once<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:11.280> it's<00:04:11.760> really<00:04:12.030> important

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
rebuild once you it's really important

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.119 
rebuild once you it's really important
that<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.689> do<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.590> reason<00:04:13.920> why<00:04:14.069> this

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
that you do that the reason why this

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.279 
that you do that the reason why this
this<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:14.849> gonna<00:04:15.000> take<00:04:15.209> forever<00:04:15.359> so<00:04:15.599> I'm<00:04:16.019> gonna

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
this is gonna take forever so I'm gonna

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.689 
this is gonna take forever so I'm gonna
pause<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.769> video<00:04:16.979> if<00:04:17.039> I'm<00:04:17.190> gonna<00:04:17.310> tell<00:04:17.609> you

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
pause the video if I'm gonna tell you

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.879 
pause the video if I'm gonna tell you
guys<00:04:17.729> why<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.989> should<00:04:19.199> always<00:04:19.320> do<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.739> the

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
guys why you should always do that the

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.140 
guys why you should always do that the
reason<00:04:20.160> why<00:04:20.250> you<00:04:20.310> should<00:04:20.400> always<00:04:20.639> do<00:04:20.850> that<00:04:21.030> is

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
reason why you should always do that is

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.080 
reason why you should always do that is
because<00:04:21.949> if<00:04:22.949> you<00:04:23.130> don't<00:04:23.340> your<00:04:23.610> files<00:04:23.880> are

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
because if you don't your files are

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.820 
because if you don't your files are
everywhere<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.750> they're<00:04:24.840> not<00:04:25.020> organized<00:04:25.590> how

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
everywhere and they're not organized how

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.379 
everywhere and they're not organized how
gt8<00:04:27.530> made<00:04:28.530> them<00:04:28.800> so<00:04:29.550> what<00:04:29.880> you're<00:04:30.060> gonna<00:04:30.180> want

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
gt8 made them so what you're gonna want

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.029 
gt8 made them so what you're gonna want
to<00:04:30.479> do<00:04:30.570> is<00:04:30.720> always<00:04:30.870> rebuild<00:04:31.260> your<00:04:31.410> image<00:04:31.800> files

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
to do is always rebuild your image files

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.800 
to do is always rebuild your image files
so<00:04:32.340> they<00:04:32.460> could<00:04:32.639> be<00:04:32.760> organized<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.479> you<00:04:33.600> won't

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
so they could be organized and you won't

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.790 
so they could be organized and you won't

that reason the reason why might be is

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.779 
that reason the reason why might be is
