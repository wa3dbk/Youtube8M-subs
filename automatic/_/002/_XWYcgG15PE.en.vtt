eight<00:01:10.770> inches<00:01:11.220> long<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.909> was<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.510> probably

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
eight inches long it was and it probably

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.670 
eight inches long it was and it probably
was<00:01:13.110> 12<00:01:13.380> inches<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.100> hair<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.680> whatever

anyway<00:01:17.189> blonde<00:01:17.610> hair<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.119> think<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.840> maybe

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
anyway blonde hair I think this is maybe

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.690 
anyway blonde hair I think this is maybe
27<00:01:20.659> maybe<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> took<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.220> wrapped<00:01:23.520> it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
27 maybe so I took that and I wrapped it

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.539 
27 maybe so I took that and I wrapped it
around<00:01:23.790> my<00:01:24.090> ponytail<00:01:24.810> right<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.979> my<00:01:26.310> real

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
around my ponytail right and my real

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.460 
around my ponytail right and my real
hair<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.060> wrapped<00:01:27.420> around<00:01:27.570> my<00:01:27.869> ponytail

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
hair was that wrapped around my ponytail

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.980 
hair was that wrapped around my ponytail
and<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.710> took<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.369> flipped<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.240> over<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.810> I

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and I took it I flipped it over and I

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.710 
and I took it I flipped it over and I
wrapped<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.619> around<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.790> Bobby<00:01:33.090> pendant

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720

wrapped it around and I Bobby pendant
going<00:01:33.990> around<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.360> final<00:01:36.360> result

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
going around so this is the final result

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.240 
going around so this is the final result
it<00:01:36.869> looks<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.290> fuzzy<00:01:37.590> because<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.040> was
