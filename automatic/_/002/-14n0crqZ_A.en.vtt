compromising the iPad size and weight so
rather<00:01:40.590> than<00:01:40.800> developing<00:01:41.190> a<00:01:41.789> separate<00:01:42.300> case

rather than developing a separate case

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.620 
rather than developing a separate case
we<00:01:43.289> created<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.890> cover<00:01:44.250> at<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.820> same<00:01:45.090> time<00:01:45.360> that

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
we created a cover at the same time that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.810 
we created a cover at the same time that
we<00:01:45.720> were<00:01:45.840> actually<00:01:45.930> designing<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.860> iPad<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
we were actually designing the iPad the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.910 
we were actually designing the iPad the
two<00:01:48.000> are<00:01:48.119> made<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.600> work<00:01:48.750> together<00:01:48.960> it

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
two are made to work together it

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.740 
two are made to work together it
attaches<00:01:50.250> magnetically<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:51.329> aligns

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
attaches magnetically it aligns

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.780 
attaches magnetically it aligns
perfectly<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.400> as<00:01:53.520> easy<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
perfectly and it's just as easy to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.969 
perfectly and it's just as easy to
remove<00:01:54.150> when<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> iPad<00:01:55.140> detects<00:01:55.770> you've

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
remove when the iPad detects you've

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.069 
remove when the iPad detects you've
opened<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.369> cover<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.090> immediately<00:01:57.659> wakes

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
opened the cover it immediately wakes

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.840 
opened the cover it immediately wakes
from<00:01:58.170> sleep<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.829> when<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.159> close<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.670> cover

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
from sleep and when you close the cover

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.880 
from sleep and when you close the cover
it<00:02:00.210> could<00:02:00.420> get<00:02:00.570> back<00:02:00.720> to<00:02:00.899> see<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.740> also

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
it could get back to see you can also

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
orientation and in full 1080p we've done

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.080 
orientation and in full 1080p we've done
things<00:04:23.169> with<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:23.590> iPad<00:04:24.009> that<00:04:24.520> we<00:04:24.639> never

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
things with this iPad that we never

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.300 
things with this iPad that we never
could<00:04:25.389> have<00:04:25.479> done<00:04:25.630> before<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.530> it's<00:04:27.009> because

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
could have done before and it's because

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.850 
could have done before and it's because
there's<00:04:27.940> a<00:04:28.000> lot<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.270> new<00:04:28.630> innovation<00:04:29.289> driving

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
there's a lot of new innovation driving

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.029 
there's a lot of new innovation driving
it<00:04:30.539> it<00:04:31.539> starts<00:04:31.930> with<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.259> new<00:04:32.410> dual-core<00:04:32.979> a5

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.640 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5
chip<00:04:33.849> that's<00:04:34.180> added<00:04:34.599> a<00:04:34.660> lot<00:04:34.870> more<00:04:34.930> speed<00:04:35.410> to

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
chip that's added a lot more speed to

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.800 
chip that's added a lot more speed to
things<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:36.039> do<00:04:36.190> every<00:04:36.220> day<00:04:36.669> like<00:04:37.180> surfing<00:04:37.660> the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
things you do every day like surfing the

things you do every day like surfing the

web sending email and multitasking in

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.469 
web sending email and multitasking in
fact<00:04:40.960> it's<00:04:41.349> up<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.740> twice<00:04:41.919> as<00:04:42.160> fast<00:04:42.370> but<00:04:43.360> the

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.120 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the
place<00:04:43.690> we've<00:04:43.930> made<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.229> biggest<00:04:44.500> jump<00:04:44.949> is

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
place we've made the biggest jump is

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.430 
place we've made the biggest jump is
with<00:04:45.430> graphics<00:04:45.970> with<00:04:46.449> performance<00:04:47.110> that's<00:04:47.320> up

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
with graphics with performance that's up

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.159 
with graphics with performance that's up
to<00:04:47.590> nine<00:04:47.860> times<00:04:48.220> faster<00:04:48.870> you'll<00:04:49.870> really

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
to nine times faster you'll really

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.379 
to nine times faster you'll really
notice<00:04:50.470> this<00:04:50.770> in<00:04:50.979> games<00:04:51.280> and<00:04:51.669> apps<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:52.240> use<00:04:52.360> a

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
notice this in games and apps that use a

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.290 
notice this in games and apps that use a
lot<00:04:52.690> of<00:04:52.720> data<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:53.259> for<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:54.340> first<00:04:54.550> time<00:04:54.849> we've

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
lot of data and for the first time we've

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.870 
lot of data and for the first time we've
built<00:04:55.539> a<00:04:55.660> gyro<00:04:56.080> into<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.530> side<00:04:56.740> of<00:04:56.770> head<00:04:57.039> that

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
built a gyro into the side of head that

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.879 
built a gyro into the side of head that
gives<00:04:58.150> you<00:04:58.300> very<00:04:58.630> precise<00:04:59.080> control<00:04:59.650> in

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
gives you very precise control in

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.490 
gives you very precise control in
multiple<00:05:00.520> dimensions<00:05:00.669> and<00:05:01.330> it<00:05:01.599> allows<00:05:01.840> us<00:05:02.169> to

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
multiple dimensions and it allows us to

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.500 
multiple dimensions and it allows us to
really<00:05:02.800> measure<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.580> orientation<00:05:04.360> of<00:05:04.449> the

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
really measure the orientation of the

forward

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.629 

the<00:05:36.520> original<00:05:37.030> iPad<00:05:37.530> defined<00:05:38.530> a<00:05:38.740> category<00:05:39.370> and

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
the original iPad defined a category and

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.179 
the original iPad defined a category and
i<00:05:40.419> think<00:05:40.689> that<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:40.960> ipad<00:05:41.349> 2<00:05:41.650> will<00:05:41.949> really

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:42.189 
i think that the ipad 2 will really

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:47.580 
i think that the ipad 2 will really
define<00:05:42.639> that<00:05:42.789> category<00:05:43.389> for<00:05:43.659> years<00:05:43.930> to<00:05:43.990> come

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590
