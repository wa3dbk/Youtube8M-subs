00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:06.149
 hello classmates the afternoons 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.490
 let's try opening this 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:13.820
 It is a tubular lock disc d 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.910
 of said motorcycle brake for this I have 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.200
 improvised this tensor since I had no 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.460
 none 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.419
 I have used this 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:28.329
 will be to recycled was an adjustment for 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.890
 circumstances match to the hook and not 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.430
 it was a matter of throwing it out of the question 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.699
 to recycle let's see if you want 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.699
 open 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.990
 Y 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.760
 There are 7 pins 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.280
 any 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.280
 and well I've opened sometime before 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:08.590
 but it is not always my first opening d 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.590
 of a tubular 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.300
 oh what 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.710
 to chop it a couple of times because the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:33.120
 opening is achieved at 90 degrees of rotation and 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:37.320
 the first pique or we advance to 45 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.830
 with which then then we have the 45 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.830
 remaining 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.710
 that you have to reapply logically 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:49.600
 although the second time is slightly more 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.140
 easy now I just dropped out there 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.140
 any 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.170
 again this is working on the day of 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.170
 that they are letting go 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.590
 but we will try here gives me a kind 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.569
 of false placed I think it must be missing 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.860
 one for the advance 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:23.500
 I have effectively touched this and advances 45 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.360
 degrees now we have one here in this 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.020
 position in which pique with which 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.130
 now we only have 6 left 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.130
 let's go there to see 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.360
 again and nothing of the false placed and 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.800
 one remains to be opened I do not know 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.700
 exactly what is this this is what 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.170
 it gives me the opening 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:05.010
 good mates this is the opening of 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.780
 my first tubular I hope you like it and 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.959
 do not forget to promote the campu side 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.959
