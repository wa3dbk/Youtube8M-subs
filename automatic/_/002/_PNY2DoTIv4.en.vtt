00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.570
 well after doing our rodeo of 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.640
 our motorola will show us these 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.029
 three local applications as we said 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.520
 in the previous video the two of the 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.010
 shore can be eliminated without any 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.910
 problem but this new one because this is 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.789
 the superuser in Chinese and good for 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.750
 this is necessary to go to our store 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:51.670
 of plays thor 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:54.130
 and install the install signpost read and 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.290
 look for it as broken install and you're going to 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.390
 live this application that I am 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.989

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.940

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:21.880

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.600

 when this means that almost 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:04.910
 we have finished updating our 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.910
 Spanish device 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.970
 we close this application or the 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.510
 we minimize as we can and open the mouse 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.510
 installer 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.640
 once our application of 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.640
 rondÃ³n install 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.870
 will begin to load our applications 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.640
 that we have installed 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.480

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.830
 and let's wait a moment until 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.690
 this screen appears that we are 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.660
 watching at this moment 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.720
 and those who tell us to install proposals 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.510
 request access to superuser let's 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.530
 to give it allow once we give it 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.900
 allow and we will leave we will look for the 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.600
 Chinese application which we have here the 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.140
 let's go find it 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.140
 we are going to give click and we will give 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.140

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.840
 it's ours 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.269

 our Chinese application and that that super 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.450

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.680
 let's go back to us and open this was from 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.270
 user in Spanish 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.120
 let's do the same as we did 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.120
 previously we go to information 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.180
 This option must be checked and 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.180
 we click to check for updates 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.890
 When you click on it, this window will appear 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.880
 which says checked the installed version 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:03.010
 and it will no longer appear red 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.010
 let's sell this option 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:12.210
 let's have our version 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.210
 updated that is already 3.1 point 1 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.249
 well now we close our application 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.739
 and we reset our mobile 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:25.619
