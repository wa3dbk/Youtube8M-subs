00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.369 

I'm<00:00:05.640> just<00:00:06.000> trying<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.420> little<00:00:06.600> experiment

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
I'm just trying a little experiment

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:15.140 
I'm just trying a little experiment
using<00:00:07.740> this<00:00:07.890> adhesive<00:00:13.400> just<00:00:14.400> for<00:00:14.639> fastening

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
using this adhesive just for fastening

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.320 
using this adhesive just for fastening
stuff<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.840> walls<00:00:16.310> I'm<00:00:17.310> just<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:18.119> will

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
stuff to the walls I'm just this will

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.439 
stuff to the walls I'm just this will
probably<00:00:18.510> end<00:00:18.690> up<00:00:18.779> coming<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:20.210> so<00:00:21.210> there's

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
probably end up coming on so there's

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.200 
probably end up coming on so there's
just<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.779> hardwood<00:00:22.230> block<00:00:22.820> it's<00:00:23.820> got<00:00:24.060> my

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
just a hardwood block it's got my

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.609 
just a hardwood block it's got my
threaded<00:00:24.660> insert<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.199> there<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.529> I've

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
threaded insert in there and I've

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.069 
threaded insert in there and I've
screwed<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.039> nut<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.369> there<00:00:26.539> now<00:00:27.539> hopefully<00:00:28.019> I

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
screwed the nut in there now hopefully I

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.659 
screwed the nut in there now hopefully I
put<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> little<00:00:28.439> glue<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.009> threaded

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
put a little glue on that threaded

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.460 
put a little glue on that threaded
insert<00:00:30.029> as<00:00:30.210> well<00:00:30.419> hopefully<00:00:30.869> it'll<00:00:31.199> stay<00:00:31.259> in

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
insert as well hopefully it'll stay in

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.340 
insert as well hopefully it'll stay in
there<00:00:31.829> when<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.360> see<00:00:33.360> my<00:00:33.540> mother<00:00:34.220> this<00:00:35.220> has<00:00:35.430> been

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
there when I see my mother this has been

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.540 
there when I see my mother this has been
this<00:00:37.350> has<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:37.650> been<00:00:37.830> sitting<00:00:38.040> overnight<00:00:38.400> I

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
this has just been sitting overnight I

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.760 
this has just been sitting overnight I
think<00:00:38.850> they<00:00:38.940> wanted<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.300> sit<00:00:39.480> for<00:00:39.720> 24<00:00:40.140> hours

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
think they wanted to sit for 24 hours

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.860 
think they wanted to sit for 24 hours
I'll<00:00:41.310> take<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.580> wrench<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.970> this<00:00:42.240> twist<00:00:42.660> this

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
I'll take a wrench to this twist this

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:56.920 
I'll take a wrench to this twist this
hopefully<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.590> threaded<00:00:44.010> insert

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.920 

that<00:00:57.530> seems<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.490> far<00:00:58.730> it<00:00:58.880> seems<00:00:59.060> okay<00:00:59.540> as<00:00:59.720> long

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
that seems so far it seems okay as long

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.280 
that seems so far it seems okay as long
as<00:01:00.110> there's<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.590> file<00:01:01.190> is<00:01:01.430> down<00:01:01.670> smooth<00:01:02.290> so

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
as there's a file is down smooth so

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.490 
as there's a file is down smooth so
there's<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.680> idea<00:01:05.080> chances<00:01:06.080> are<00:01:06.230> what<00:01:06.380> I'll

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
there's the idea chances are what I'll

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.280 
there's the idea chances are what I'll
do<00:01:06.620> is<00:01:06.770> I'll<00:01:06.920> fiberglass<00:01:07.520> these<00:01:07.820> blocks<00:01:08.290> to

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
do is I'll fiberglass these blocks to

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.070 
do is I'll fiberglass these blocks to
the<00:01:09.410> wall<00:01:09.620> and<00:01:09.979> a<00:01:10.850> little<00:01:11.420> bit<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:11.630> fiberglass

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
the wall and a little bit of fiberglass

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.950 
the wall and a little bit of fiberglass
over<00:01:12.290> them<00:01:12.590> too<00:01:12.800> and<00:01:13.100> again<00:01:13.970> I'll<00:01:14.390> take<00:01:14.780> this

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
over them too and again I'll take this

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.380 
over them too and again I'll take this
to<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.290> planer<00:01:15.530> I'll<00:01:15.770> want<00:01:15.979> this<00:01:16.130> down<00:01:16.400> when

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
to the planer I'll want this down when

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.969 
to the planer I'll want this down when
it's<00:01:17.510> built<00:01:17.750> up<00:01:17.960> I<00:01:18.110> want<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:18.410> to<00:01:18.530> be<00:01:18.650> roughly

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
it's built up I want it to be roughly

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.160 
it's built up I want it to be roughly
the<00:01:19.190> same<00:01:19.280> level<00:01:19.850> as<00:01:20.000> my<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.479> thickness<00:01:20.869> of<00:01:21.050> my

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
the same level as my the thickness of my

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.000 
the same level as my the thickness of my
insulation<00:01:22.450> so<00:01:23.450> then<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.780> idea<00:01:23.810> will<00:01:24.500> be<00:01:24.530> to

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
insulation so then the idea will be to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.690 
insulation so then the idea will be to
attach<00:01:25.610> my<00:01:25.850> cabinets<00:01:26.979> get<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.160> appropriate

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
attach my cabinets get the appropriate

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.660 
attach my cabinets get the appropriate
length<00:01:28.910> bolt<00:01:29.300> put<00:01:30.290> it<00:01:30.410> through<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.649> flange<00:01:31.160> or

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
length bolt put it through a flange or

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.400 
length bolt put it through a flange or
whatever<00:01:32.000> in<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.330> back<00:01:32.509> of<00:01:32.660> the<00:01:32.750> cabinet<00:01:33.170> and

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
whatever in the back of the cabinet and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.700 
whatever in the back of the cabinet and
then<00:01:34.899> secure<00:01:35.899> it<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.140> wall<00:01:38.259> so<00:01:39.259> here's<00:01:39.500> the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
then secure it to the wall so here's the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.530 
then secure it to the wall so here's the
gist<00:01:39.950> of<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.160> idea<00:01:40.280> I<00:01:40.610> just<00:01:40.700> grabbed<00:01:41.180> it<00:01:41.360> back

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
gist of the idea I just grabbed it back

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.330 
gist of the idea I just grabbed it back
up<00:01:41.690> this<00:01:41.810> is<00:01:41.960> for<00:01:42.140> demonstration<00:01:42.340> purposes

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
up this is for demonstration purposes

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.690 
up this is for demonstration purposes
only<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.880> wouldn't<00:01:44.030> be<00:01:44.210> this<00:01:44.450> big<00:01:45.520> I'll<00:01:46.520> either

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
only it wouldn't be this big I'll either

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.560 
only it wouldn't be this big I'll either
use<00:01:46.970> brackets<00:01:47.300> on<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.869> cabinet's<00:01:48.380> or

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
use brackets on the cabinet's or

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.760 
use brackets on the cabinet's or
actually<00:01:50.570> that<00:01:50.660> might<00:01:50.840> be<00:01:50.960> easiest<00:01:51.380> thing<00:01:51.649> to

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
actually that might be easiest thing to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.830 
actually that might be easiest thing to
do<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:51.950> could<00:01:52.250> just<00:01:52.430> fiberglass<00:01:53.000> this<00:01:53.300> into<00:01:53.720> the

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
do I could just fiberglass this into the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.719 
do I could just fiberglass this into the
back<00:01:54.020> of<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.290> cabinet<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:56.320> then<00:01:57.580> secure<00:01:58.580> it

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
back of the cabinet and then secure it

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.080 
back of the cabinet and then secure it
to<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:58.910> wall<00:02:00.369> like<00:02:01.369> I<00:02:01.490> say<00:02:01.640> this<00:02:01.790> has<00:02:01.940> only

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
to the wall like I say this has only

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.980 
to the wall like I say this has only
been<00:02:02.210> on<00:02:02.390> for<00:02:02.450> about<00:02:02.690> 12<00:02:03.049> hours<00:02:03.430> can't<00:02:04.990> hold

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
been on for about 12 hours can't hold

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.660 
been on for about 12 hours can't hold
them<00:02:06.140> pretty<00:02:06.350> good<00:02:08.860> but<00:02:09.860> chances<00:02:10.280> are<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:10.429> will

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
them pretty good but chances are I will

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.620 
them pretty good but chances are I will
fiberglass<00:02:11.330> these<00:02:11.630> blocks<00:02:12.019> to<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.410> wall
