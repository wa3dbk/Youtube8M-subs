00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.319
 I'm ok it's scarface coc beats then 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.680
 I tell you there is very much 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.210
 soon 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.759
 but I think I'll try to do 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.610
 videos will virtually leave everything 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:20.279
 the time I will try to help points 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.650
 go on a video every week on 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.609
 we will say yes on a tea video 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.410
 week on or more a week two or 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.550
 three if I do not see what she told me 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.380
 my mother so here we have one to the rules the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.980
 house and like like everyone and 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.860
 if it's notes 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.120
 I would have more down on the most what 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.410
 because you take it from me and I 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.030
 find he's right I have to learn 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.590
 I have to study so that's it because 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.960
 it's been two years since I give 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.199
 nothing would be nice that I'm anything 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.680
 thing so in this video I you 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.090
 shows that we are a trophy there is nothing 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.170
 incredible 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.850
 I agree this video I'm doing 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.250
 really small because I'm not 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.430
 at home I do not have anything to do here I 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.590
 I am not very good at the material level 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.020
 so here's what I like 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.880

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.950
