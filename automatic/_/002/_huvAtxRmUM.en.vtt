 Hi guys 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.869
 today the makeup is less colorful but 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.330
 not less remarkable, this was the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.430
 second most requested makeup on my 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.160
 instagram to do the step by step in 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.640
 video for you eyes in shades of brown 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 with many Syrians and shine on the skin 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.219
 we just go around and break a 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.410
 super bright makeup full of 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.840
 glamor and current for you to use in 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.969
 any party the skin is already clean and already 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.520
 apply the moisturizer or use a 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.300
 trailer that keeps the skin moisturized by 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.300
 more time 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.050
 in the eye area I will use the moisturizer 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.160
 beach that will keep the concealer in the 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.160
 place for more hours 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.439
 the basis of average coverage and 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.210
 natural finish I apply throughout the 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.210
 face smoothing the skin 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:57.500
 the corrective illuminator in the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.500
 dark circles 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
 O 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.969
 with the loose powder colorless I apply only in the 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.969
 center of the face 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.470
 looks 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.400
 to the eyebrow 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.660
 I'll use a shadow and a color mask. 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.660
 to hold them in place 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.210
 I'm going to fix a movable eyelid 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.070
 shadow on cream take rom to create 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.070
 the background color for the other shadows 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.960
 brown shade with a slight flicker 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.520
 through the entire movable eyelid and also 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.520
 yields to the root of lower lashes 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:18.709
 in the waterline of the eye or in the air 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.709
 super black and smear with small brush 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:36.430
 the cold-pressed inem with the fingers 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.430
 get more shine shine 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.690
 the idea of this makeup is to have this 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.670
 wet effect on the eyes so 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:06.680
 apply another shade with more 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:09.080
 brightness all children 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.790
 like to apply on both pairs 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.790
 for a more dramatic effect 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:40.970
 to finish the skin let's use only 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:42.320
 control blush to illuminate some 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.210
 face regions 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.930
 I'm going to use a champagne pigment. 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.930
 illuminator 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:47.409
