00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.810 
crystal masters or gold silver something
like<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.650> not<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:40.979> Champions<00:01:41.700> champions

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
like that but not in Champions champions

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.149 
like that but not in Champions champions
are<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.600> too<00:01:42.780> smart<00:01:42.990> for<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.890> we're

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
are just too smart for that so we're

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.560 
are just too smart for that so we're
just<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> look<00:01:44.729> through<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.240> next<00:01:45.780> one

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.780 

and<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.380> attack<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.190> outside<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.730> my

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
and this attack is on the outside of my

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.460 
and this attack is on the outside of my
vase<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.300> works<00:01:51.510> on<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.900> inside<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
vase so this works on the inside the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.230 
vase so this works on the inside the
space<00:01:52.680> works<00:01:52.950> from<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> inside<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
space works from the inside and the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.920 
space works from the inside and the
outside

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
outside

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.500

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
usually on tier one troops so definitely

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.610 
usually on tier one troops so definitely
not<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> work<00:01:57.960> against<00:01:58.290> something<00:01:58.500> like

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
not going to work against something like

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.100 
not going to work against something like
golems<00:01:59.220> or<00:01:59.400> pekka's<00:01:59.820> but<00:02:00.390> he's<00:02:00.660> gonna<00:02:00.840> just

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
golems or pekka's but he's gonna just

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.990 
golems or pekka's but he's gonna just
test<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.500> some<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.920> traps<00:02:02.250> down<00:02:02.550> here<00:02:02.880> you

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
from the outside since he knows he can't

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.110 
from the outside since he knows he can't

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.880 
get to that dark elixir some barbarians
and<00:02:15.210> goblins<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.690> follow<00:02:15.870> up<00:02:16.080> he<00:02:16.290> thought<00:02:16.560> some

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and goblins to follow up he thought some

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.890 
and goblins to follow up he thought some
of<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.070> loop<00:02:17.280> was<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.760> there<00:02:17.970> but

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
of the loop was in there but

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.540 
of the loop was in there but
unfortunately<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.920> was<00:02:20.040> not<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.400> we're<00:02:20.520> just

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
unfortunately it was not so we're just

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.130 
unfortunately it was not so we're just
gonna<00:02:20.700> speed<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.060> up<00:02:21.240> just<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.480> little<00:02:21.570> fit

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
gonna speed it up just a little fit
