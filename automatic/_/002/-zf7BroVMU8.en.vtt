talking kind of brush and here is my one
which<00:01:05.840> turned<00:01:06.840> out<00:01:06.990> pretty<00:01:07.290> nice<00:01:08.570> at<00:01:09.570> one

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
which turned out pretty nice at one

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.170 
which turned out pretty nice at one
hundred<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.520> eighteen<00:01:11.520> percent<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.970> believe

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
hundred and eighteen percent I believe

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.210 
hundred and eighteen percent I believe
it<00:01:12.299> was<00:01:13.340> it<00:01:14.340> looks<00:01:14.640> pretty<00:01:14.909> good<00:01:15.680> now<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:17.040> I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
it was it looks pretty good now if I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.030 
it was it looks pretty good now if I
keep<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.670> exact<00:01:17.970> same<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.140> five<00:01:19.560> pixels

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
keep the exact same it's on five pixels

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.249 
keep the exact same it's on five pixels
I'm<00:01:20.340> zoom<00:01:20.610> out<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> full<00:01:21.360> canvas<00:01:21.810> which<00:01:22.110> is

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
I'm zoom out to a full canvas which is

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.719 
I'm zoom out to a full canvas which is
about<00:01:22.470> twenty<00:01:22.920> five<00:01:23.100> twenty<00:01:23.460> eight<00:01:23.490> percent

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
about twenty five twenty eight percent

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.969 
about twenty five twenty eight percent
right<00:01:24.090> now<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.350> lot<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.710> people

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
right now and I know a lot of people

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.219 
right now and I know a lot of people
will<00:01:26.100> work<00:01:26.340> from<00:01:26.700> looking<00:01:27.390> at<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> full<00:01:27.810> canvas

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
will work from looking at a full canvas

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.770 
will work from looking at a full canvas
so<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.920> sketches<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.240> everything

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
so we can do sketches and everything

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.460 
so we can do sketches and everything
else<00:01:31.549> I'm<00:01:32.549> taking<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.420> doing<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> exact

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
else I'm taking it and doing the exact

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.149 
else I'm taking it and doing the exact
same<00:01:34.850> design<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.350> already<00:01:37.530> see<00:01:37.890> from

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
same design you can already see from

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.280 
same design you can already see from
this<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.520> looks<00:01:39.090> weird<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.840> then<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.110> go<00:01:40.229> to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
this that looks weird so then you go to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.160 
this that looks weird so then you go to
zoom<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.040> sure<00:01:41.790> enough<00:01:41.850> become<00:01:42.780> crappy

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
zoom in and sure enough become crappy

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.330 
zoom in and sure enough become crappy
those<00:01:43.320> lines<00:01:43.619> are<00:01:44.360> I've<00:01:45.360> turned<00:01:45.780> off<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.340> snap
