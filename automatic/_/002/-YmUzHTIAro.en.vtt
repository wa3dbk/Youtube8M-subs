00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
that translates into wins at the major

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.470 
that translates into wins at the major
league<00:02:09.500> level<00:02:09.649> but<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.729> next<00:02:11.000> wave<00:02:11.210> could

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
league level but the next wave could

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.390 
league level but the next wave could
really<00:02:11.900> set<00:02:12.140> them<00:02:12.350> up<00:02:12.530> for<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.770> good<00:02:12.980> run<00:02:13.190> in<00:02:13.310> the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
really set them up for a good run in the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.660 
really set them up for a good run in the
years<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.670> come<00:02:14.709> now<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.740> fastball<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.610> he

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
years to come now a fastball and he

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.270 
years to come now a fastball and he
popped<00:02:16.970> him<00:02:17.240> up<00:02:17.360> over<00:02:18.110> toward<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.740> left<00:02:18.950> side

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
popped him up over toward the left side

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.980 
popped him up over toward the left side
of<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.490> infield<00:02:21.160> number<00:02:22.160> 19<00:02:22.580> is<00:02:22.970> there<00:02:23.540> two

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
of the infield number 19 is there two

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.360 
of the infield number 19 is there two
down<00:02:26.170> yeah<00:02:27.170> here's<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.530> look<00:02:27.770> at<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:28.070> last

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
down yeah here's a look at this last

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.090 
down yeah here's a look at this last
pitch<00:02:28.900> will<00:02:29.900> stop<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.440> on<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.680> point<00:02:30.980> of

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
pitch will stop it on the point of

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.670 
pitch will stop it on the point of
impact<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.790> show<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.060> where<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.390> was<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.140> this

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
impact to show you where it was and this

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.070 
impact to show you where it was and this
is<00:02:33.890> very<00:02:34.280> clearly<00:02:34.910> going<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.270> be<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.450> ball<00:02:35.780> high

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
is very clearly going to be a ball high

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.960 
is very clearly going to be a ball high
but<00:02:36.560> he<00:02:36.650> just<00:02:36.800> couldn't<00:02:36.980> stop<00:02:37.310> himself<00:02:37.580> and

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
but he just couldn't stop himself and

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.390 
but he just couldn't stop himself and
winds<00:02:38.300> up<00:02:38.390> popping<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.930> up<00:02:39.080> on<00:02:39.830> this<00:02:40.100> kicks

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
winds up popping it up on this kicks

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.640 
winds up popping it up on this kicks
right<00:02:40.670> off<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:40.940> them<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:42.050> throw<00:02:42.320> will<00:02:42.500> be

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
right off of them and the throw will be

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.820 
right off of them and the throw will be
too<00:02:42.860> late<00:02:42.890> as<00:02:43.340> he<00:02:43.489> can't<00:02:43.790> recover<00:02:44.120> in<00:02:44.420> time

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
too late as he can't recover in time

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.199 
too late as he can't recover in time
well<00:02:45.830> so<00:02:46.010> much<00:02:46.220> of<00:02:46.400> fielding<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.910> about

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
well so much of fielding is about

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.120 
well so much of fielding is about
getting<00:02:47.600> into<00:02:47.720> good<00:02:47.959> position<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:48.830> time

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
getting into good position and that time

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.640 
getting into good position and that time
the<00:02:49.280> mechanics<00:02:49.790> were<00:02:49.940> not<00:02:50.360> very<00:02:50.750> good<00:02:51.080> I'll

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
the mechanics were not very good I'll

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.190 
the mechanics were not very good I'll
see<00:02:52.040> this<00:02:52.220> Escobar<00:02:52.910> is<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.420> batter<00:02:53.600> now<00:02:53.870> as<00:02:54.080> he

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
see this Escobar is the batter now as he

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.740 
see this Escobar is the batter now as he
looks<00:02:54.410> at<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.620> bowl<00:02:54.830> of<00:02:54.860> 1<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.340> 0<00:02:55.430> he<00:02:56.330> knows<00:02:56.570> he

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
looks at a bowl of 1 and 0 he knows he

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.449 
looks at a bowl of 1 and 0 he knows he
should<00:02:56.989> be<00:02:57.140> out<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.470> inning<00:02:57.680> already<00:02:57.950> but

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
should be out of the inning already but

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.520 
should be out of the inning already but
he's<00:02:59.030> got<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.239> pick<00:02:59.510> up<00:02:59.630> his<00:02:59.750> defender<00:03:00.230> behind

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
he's got to pick up his defender behind

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.370 
he's got to pick up his defender behind
him<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:00.770> get<00:03:01.010> out<00:03:01.160> of<00:03:01.310> this<00:03:01.400> but<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.209> foul<00:03:02.900> ball

boy<00:03:15.370> that's<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.760> great<00:03:15.909> approach<00:03:16.299> there<00:03:16.629> with

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
boy that's a great approach there with

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.839 
boy that's a great approach there with
two<00:03:16.989> away<00:03:17.140> if<00:03:17.500> he<00:03:17.650> tries<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:17.920> pull<00:03:18.099> this<00:03:18.549> it's

two away if he tries to pull this it's

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.300 
two away if he tries to pull this it's
out<00:03:19.030> number<00:03:19.269> three<00:03:19.750> instead<00:03:20.680> he<00:03:20.859> just<00:03:21.069> rides

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
out number three instead he just rides

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.039 
out number three instead he just rides
it<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.640> other<00:03:21.790> way<00:03:21.909> to<00:03:22.120> make<00:03:22.269> this<00:03:22.599> a<00:03:22.659> two-run

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
it the other way to make this a two-run

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.920 
it the other way to make this a two-run
game<00:03:23.290> now<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:24.549> this<00:03:24.760> is<00:03:24.819> low<00:03:25.269> but<00:03:25.689> nice

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
game now and this is low but nice

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.080 
game now and this is low but nice
footwork<00:03:26.260> back<00:03:26.709> there<00:03:26.980> by<00:03:27.159> Mauer<00:03:27.459> as<00:03:27.730> he<00:03:27.849> hangs

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
footwork back there by Mauer as he hangs

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:36.059 
footwork back there by Mauer as he hangs
on<00:03:33.659> swing<00:03:34.659> and<00:03:34.780> he<00:03:34.900> takes<00:03:35.260> this<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.769> other<00:03:35.920> way

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
on swing and he takes this the other way

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.149 
on swing and he takes this the other way
to<00:03:36.250> right<00:03:36.370> dives<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:37.750> he<00:03:38.260> makes<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.859> catch

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
to right dives and he makes the catch

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.339 
to right dives and he makes the catch
how<00:03:39.670> about<00:03:39.909> that<00:03:40.239> for<00:03:40.480> an<00:03:40.599> exclamation<00:03:40.989> point

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
how about that for an exclamation point

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.740 
how about that for an exclamation point
to<00:03:41.859> the<00:03:42.010> end<00:03:42.189> of<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.430> inning<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.329> he<00:03:43.420> probably

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
to the end of the inning and he probably

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.479 
to the end of the inning and he probably
saved<00:03:44.139> a<00:03:44.349> run<00:03:44.379> with<00:03:44.739> this<00:03:44.889> one<00:03:45.129> let's<00:03:45.340> look

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
saved a run with this one let's look

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.509 
saved a run with this one let's look
again<00:03:45.720> boy<00:03:46.720> he<00:03:46.989> never<00:03:47.319> gives<00:03:47.650> up<00:03:47.859> on<00:03:48.010> this<00:03:48.250> ball

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
again boy he never gives up on this ball

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.479 
again boy he never gives up on this ball
that's<00:03:48.819> a<00:03:49.000> magnificent<00:03:49.900> play<00:03:50.109> royal<00:03:50.919> settle

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
that's a magnificent play royal settle

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.619 
that's a magnificent play royal settle
for<00:03:51.700> just<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.180> one<00:03:53.459> Justin<00:03:54.459> Morneau<00:03:54.909> will<00:03:55.329> start

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
for just a one Justin Morneau will start

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:03.490 
for just a one Justin Morneau will start
things<00:03:55.810> off<00:03:56.079> in<00:03:56.139> the<00:03:56.319> bottom<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:56.859> second

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.410 

and<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:05.220> good<00:04:05.370> idea<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.790> hold<00:04:05.970> off<00:04:06.180> on<00:04:06.210> that

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
and a good idea to hold off on that

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.660 
and a good idea to hold off on that
swing<00:04:06.900> its<00:04:07.140> ball<00:04:07.350> one<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.430> thing

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
swing its ball one and that thing

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.580 
swing its ball one and that thing
started<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.420> zone<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:09.870> that's<00:04:10.050> a<00:04:10.170> good<00:04:10.350> job
