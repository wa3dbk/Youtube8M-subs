00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.910 
actually because when I file my nails I
tend<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.869> start<00:01:25.470> thinking<00:01:25.619> about

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
tend to just start thinking about

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.130 
tend to just start thinking about
something<00:01:26.220> or<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> usually<00:01:27.240> watch<00:01:27.420> TV<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.930> then

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
something or I usually watch TV and then

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.910 
something or I usually watch TV and then
I<00:01:28.229> gaze<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.890> I'm<00:01:29.400> looking<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> TV<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
I gaze out and I'm looking at the TV and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.100 
I gaze out and I'm looking at the TV and
sometimes<00:01:31.920> my<00:01:32.070> hand<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.430> slips<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.150> this

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
sometimes my hand just slips and this

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.789 
sometimes my hand just slips and this
black<00:01:34.439> side<00:01:35.000> leaves<00:01:36.000> every<00:01:36.689> deep<00:01:37.110> deep

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
black side leaves every deep deep

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.740 
black side leaves every deep deep
scratch<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.520> my<00:01:38.700> nails<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.600> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
scratch on my nails so then I have to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.889 
scratch on my nails so then I have to
restart<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.439> whole<00:01:40.860> process<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:42.360> step<00:01:42.630> one

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
restart the whole process with step one

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.280 
restart the whole process with step one
to<00:01:43.229> step<00:01:43.259> four<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.390> if<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.899> over<00:01:46.049> and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
to step four and if I do it over and

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
to step four and if I do it over and
over<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.799> really

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
over it really

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.999 
over it really
Yunel<00:01:48.180> become<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.780> thin<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.380> that's<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:49.740> good

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
Yunel become so thin and that's not good

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.740 
Yunel become so thin and that's not good

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
little bit more careful but it usually

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.380 
little bit more careful but it usually
happens<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.479> rare<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.880> anyway<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:56.939> last

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.740 
time I actually cut up my nail file in
half<00:02:00.710> because<00:02:01.710> usually<00:02:02.250> when<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> use<00:02:03.060> my<00:02:03.360> nail

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
half because usually when I use my nail

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.220 
half because usually when I use my nail
a<00:02:04.110> buffer<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.710> hold<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.070> like<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.280> and

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
a buffer I hold it like this and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.830 
a buffer I hold it like this and
but<00:02:06.380> my<00:02:06.560> nyl<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.040> besides<00:02:07.820> get<00:02:08.120> used<00:02:08.330> up<00:02:08.540> but
