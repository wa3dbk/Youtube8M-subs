 try to contact us for it 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.750
 to make room 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.279
 only the sc idar ii has a new technology 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.650
 developed and I wanted you once 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.449
 just show who knows what 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.800
 he has his own here 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.170
 Pirates ill built 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.660
 at the time or at the he down 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.740
 jumps when it gets too hot what has 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.140
 to mean this 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.690
 how does the king want it in that 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.290
 king of the tower will build here alone 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.090
 given out 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.340
 and what does this disputed plate mean 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.010
 since he's there he's from below tnt 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.719
 built what is going on is that 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.000
 there is a plate at all , that is 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.070
 a plate she will follow that too 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.829
 that does not make any sense why is that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.750
 tread plate because what has he since he has 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.430
 a dispenser with finely built or what 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.510
 Did he make interesting and here 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.239
 what are you building here 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.300
 he builds his water outlet week or 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.589
 is it what he is doing there airport 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.070
 what the hell is that? 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.890
 mean 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.290
 and he gets off arrow what he tries 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.939
 because what is it because of cracked technology because of that 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.840
 I just got up here too 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.180
 admission 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.920
 because that's the new technology I have 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.979
 I at the sc dari in person 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.060
 not seen 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.439
 now he is in danger if he 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.049
 he could be hit by arrow now 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.549
 fly down what is he doing? 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.680
 makes something that looks for something or already 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.390
 what is he thinking right now what is going on in the head 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.920
 one of them right now 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.630
 what's going on, he thinks about 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.220
 to meet his dispenser the people below 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.229
 he really believes he can do that 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.939
 if there is something going on at the team power rangers 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.400
 half started the trek with 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.259
 stretch stairs with protection because here 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.540
 below maybe a small bunker what 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.710
 the team tries 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.380
 or maybe they 'll take it first 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.420
 What else do you take here? 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.100
 take the lava tower in the im 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.259
 remaining possibly still the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.920
 Next life is still life 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.200
 in her job 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.570
 They are still waiting for something 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.219
 happens here in the next time now 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.140
 really try in the try 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.030
 did this building attack here 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.920
 and what about first dari where he is 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.509
 Do you think the opponents are always something 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.800
 back then, the ender peter is already recovering 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.020
 rouse recovers the appeals i believe 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.370
 he wants to run away he wants and he wants to leave 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.220
 since it is very natural like what he is 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.140
 he cuts down the stairs he uses 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.990
 The chance he gets out of the dust 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.360
 simply because he knows nothing there knows there 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.810
 nothing to eat dari underneath 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.810
 there just runs that's really 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.200
 Unbelievable, again, here's running and 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.290
 it almost in the middle 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.330
 he hollows himself in the middle of me 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.570
 do not believe here and then david 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.470
 Dynamite and eat dani from behind 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.570
 unbelievable , though, is the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.090
 first attack succeeded and now he hits 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.580
 nothing more and it tarifs died yes 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:03:02.550
 that was very stupid indeed 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:04.740
 action from the food roof of the koenig bauer s 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.440
 Diary probably died 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.150
 he runs from behind on the david yours 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.580
 with it then meets not a single 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.380
 sword more and died 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.930
 but the action escaped with this one 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.300
 is really epic but one thing must be 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.360
 he will eventually explain something to us 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.900
 everything in the world that has hell 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.090
 whether or not they mean their blog 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.240
 When should this be your blog? 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.250
 what use does this one have? 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.520
 the blog I think I want it 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.770
 do not understand what the third one is 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.780
 Maybe you know it's why 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.490
 yes , we have something like that someday 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.700
 now here is the team power rangers around 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.250
 summer glp debitor the way, too 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.590
 they have killed us now they are here 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.180
 No, no, not the next life 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.040
 here still good day dear nixon 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.630
 I have always welcomed one here 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.430
 I would like to go back there once 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.480
 let's get out of here, the team seems well 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.430
 also to have escaped 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.230
 but basically that was all 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.570
 I wanted to show you the epic fight 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.360
 Esse Dari died an epic 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.239
 tragic figure has left us 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.220
 and, as I said, his tower will probably be for 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.220
 all time remain a mystery
