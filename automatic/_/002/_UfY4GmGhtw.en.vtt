00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
below that for even larger pieces but

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.070 
below that for even larger pieces but
this<00:00:27.560> system<00:00:29.300> makes<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.480> really<00:00:30.630> easy<00:00:30.750> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080

slide my glass in it's very gentle but
it<00:00:35.430> holds<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.880> very<00:00:36.059> securely<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:36.870> grinding

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
it holds it very securely for grinding

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.020 
it holds it very securely for grinding
the<00:00:39.329> tub<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.780> pretty<00:00:40.140> deep<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:41.280> if<00:00:41.790> I'm<00:00:42.000> doing

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the tub is pretty deep so if I'm doing

the tub is pretty deep so if I'm doing
the<00:00:42.390> end<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:43.860> go<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> 24<00:00:45.149> inch

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the end I can go this is the 24 inch

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.440 
the end I can go this is the 24 inch
panel<00:00:46.219> so<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.550> go<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.879> way<00:00:48.000> down<00:00:48.239> to

there and also get a pretty perfect

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.650 
there and also get a pretty perfect
height<00:00:52.199> for<00:00:52.410> grinding<00:00:53.300> now<00:00:54.300> I've<00:00:54.449> already

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
height for grinding now I've already

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.889 
height for grinding now I've already
done<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.710> rougher<00:00:56.190> grits<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.270> I'm<00:00:57.420> all<00:00:57.719> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
way down to a 404 beveling the other

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.579 
way down to a 404 beveling the other
thing<00:01:03.510> that's<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:03.870> great<00:01:04.049> about<00:01:04.170> this

thing that's really great about this
setup<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:06.470> it's<00:01:07.470> very<00:01:07.680> adjustable<00:01:08.540> for

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
setup is it's very adjustable for

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.130 
setup is it's very adjustable for
beveling<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:11.220> gonna<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.600> loud<00:01:12.750> but

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
beveling so gonna be a little loud but

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.499 
beveling so gonna be a little loud but
I'm<00:01:13.229> going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.590> proceed<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.090> see<00:01:15.299> how

whenever you get a belt grinder it was
facing<00:01:52.270> away<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:52.900> felt<00:01:53.140> that

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:04.240 

besides<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:56.780> had<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.259> hold<00:01:57.409> heat
