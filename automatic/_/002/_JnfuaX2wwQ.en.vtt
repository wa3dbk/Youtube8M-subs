that<00:00:26.310> makes<00:00:26.580> no<00:00:26.730> sense<00:00:26.789> whatsoever<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.480> just

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
that makes no sense whatsoever I just

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.169 
that makes no sense whatsoever I just
made<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.779> up<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.490> I'm<00:00:29.490> hoping<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.000> case

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179

guess new for me I think that's one of
the<00:00:59.100> few<00:00:59.190> steps<00:00:59.399> Ivan<00:00:59.670> do<00:00:59.760> yet<00:00:59.940> haven't<00:01:00.690> ever

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the few steps Ivan do yet haven't ever

the few steps Ivan do yet haven't ever
done<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.590> clue<00:01:01.770> yet<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.100> think<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.520> don't

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
done on a clue yet and I think I don't

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:03.920 
done on a clue yet and I think I don't
know<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.030> I've<00:01:03.090> done<00:01:03.239> every<00:01:03.420> set<00:01:03.629> that'll<00:01:03.840> be

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
know if I've done every set that'll be

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.719 
know if I've done every set that'll be
interesting<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.220> didn't<00:01:05.460> die<00:01:05.580> even

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
interesting to see but I didn't die even

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.070 
interesting to see but I didn't die even
this<00:01:05.909> one<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.210> don't<00:01:06.360> think<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.510> had<00:01:06.630> one<00:01:06.840> single

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
this one I don't think I had one single

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.330 
this one I don't think I had one single
water<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.130> which<00:01:08.280> is

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
water this one on this one which is

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670 
water this one on this one which is
pretty<00:01:08.520> nice<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:08.970> that's<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.140> usually<00:01:10.560> always

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
pretty nice so that's I usually always

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.140 
pretty nice so that's I usually always
have<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:10.979> least<00:01:11.040> one<00:01:11.189> water<00:01:11.340> nuh<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.729> those

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
have at least one water nuh so those

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.700 
have at least one water nuh so those
nice<00:01:12.360> I've<00:01:12.600> never<00:01:12.750> died<00:01:13.020> doing<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.350> clue<00:01:13.530> on

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
nice I've never died doing a clue on

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.899 
nice I've never died doing a clue on
this<00:01:13.860> series<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.250> far<00:01:14.280> which<00:01:14.610> i<00:01:14.729> guess<00:01:14.880> is

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
this series so far which i guess is

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.789 
this series so far which i guess is
surprising<00:01:15.540> more<00:01:16.320> impressive<00:01:16.770> than

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
surprising more impressive than

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.950 
surprising more impressive than
surprising<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.330> our<00:01:18.360> final<00:01:18.659> step

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
surprising but we have our final step

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.510 
surprising but we have our final step
here<00:01:19.140> which<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.740> steal<00:01:20.040> from<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
here which is just to steal from the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.700 
here which is just to steal from the
king<00:01:20.700> lattices<00:01:21.119> chest<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:22.229> usual<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> had

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
king lattices chest and as usual I had

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.440 
king lattices chest and as usual I had
the<00:01:22.799> boost<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.640> get<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.270> should

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
the boost up to get it I really should

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.510 
the boost up to get it I really should
just<00:01:24.570> get<00:01:24.659> 72<00:01:25.080> thieving<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:26.100> would<00:01:26.220> make<00:01:26.400> my

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
just get 72 thieving it would make my

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.130 
just get 72 thieving it would make my
life<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.939> lot<00:01:27.090> easier<00:01:27.150> but<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.780> managed<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.020> get

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
life a lot easier but we managed to get

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.569 
life a lot easier but we managed to get
the<00:01:28.259> plus<00:01:28.439> 5<00:01:28.619> boost<00:01:28.950> which<00:01:29.130> happens<00:01:29.430> like

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the plus 5 boost which happens like

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.219 
the plus 5 boost which happens like
every<00:01:29.700> time<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.450> always<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> plus<00:01:31.020> 5

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
every time we always get the plus 5

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.050 
every time we always get the plus 5
boost<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.740> guess<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.400> more<00:01:32.670> common<00:01:32.939> than<00:01:33.000> I

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
boost I guess it's more common than I

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.730 
boost I guess it's more common than I
thought<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.479> we're<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.439> go<00:01:34.530> ahead<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
thought but we're going to go ahead and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.620 
thought but we're going to go ahead and
loot<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.579> chest<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.150> then<00:01:36.210> we're<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.570> to

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
loot this chest and then we're going to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.480 
loot this chest and then we're going to
teleport<00:01:36.869> back<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.500> Camelot<00:01:37.860> talk<00:01:38.310> to
