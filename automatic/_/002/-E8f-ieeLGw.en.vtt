00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 that's the effect the meaning you're going 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.740
 well today I share my this 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.599
 experience house for ignore if 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.059
 their this super easy 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.190
 the chances that you will not hurt 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.610
 the years I would like are enough 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.740
 thin 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.359
 it's actually because the recipe for 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.840
 base is to create a unity 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.520
 expectations 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.250
 so it's not bad everyone a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.869
 sugar and olive oil at home not 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.510
 stop I use other products that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.849
 this possible to have them but indicates 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.309
 me what I'm doing is a scary 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.710
 all chocolate and vanilla 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.219
 looks like it makes sense that it's not 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.610
 very beautiful but this is either link or 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.670
 chocolate is like principle at the end 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.969
 but it feels divinely good I you 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.649
 Guaranteed sticks to it's up to you 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.059
 eat because hotels f1 scratch 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.530
 like no it's super simple call for 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.100
 the sugar you need we need a 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.260
 sugar which is more refined so sugar 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.019
 do not say your word say where the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.960
 brown sugar little unrefined sugar in 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.939
 big little cube and jose sugar that more 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.470
 big because whatever it is more to 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.900
 to burn on the lips it's just that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.210
 going minus an exploit bound by all so 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.220
 a thinner sugar is better 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.130
 - wrestler uses jojoba oil 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.570
 that I found at the blaze lot in 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.090
 the year of natural products is 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.540
 the mark of 16 years so it looks like 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.850
 this 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.740
 these super hydrating places so much for 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.360
 the lips only for the skin than for the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.759
 hair me I'm really like on 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.979
 my skin in hair everywhere then that 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.360
 is going to hydrate super well but you 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.850
 could use another city that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.409
 you prefer but why do you 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.590
 love a lot at home only at home 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.470
 that's not easy to prepare 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.149
 I have four ingredients and it 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.860
 keeps in the background how I 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.570
 keeps what in a little pot like 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.770
 that in my bathroom there are few 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.509
 young people need to know only because 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.149
 I have it next - you could 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.659
 buy a few drops of god 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.220
 vitamins 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.770
 because he had a 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.110
 it's an antioxidant so it's not a 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.540
 conservation officer but that's fine 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.369
 prevent incidents of oxidized then that 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.190
 we can extend the life of 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.920
 your product but I do not feel 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.710
 the need then also that I do not put 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.060
 it must directly in the product 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.410
 my favorite method of a fund for 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.300
 they are linked but then it's going to be a 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.430
 cult ips so I take my little cotton 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.200
 rod and I just take a little bit 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.400
 there will find a lot that I spend 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.740
 the commentary yves on my lips 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.020
 then after a boot removes the 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.790
 the already exfoliating oil offers a very 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.490
 good dating but after never 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.130
 never a good manager like to apply 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.930
 I had a good handler surelevate then the 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.120
 next day waking my lips are 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.860
 very sweet then it's really very fun 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.800
 then it's true for your charms 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.390
 so here we start with the 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.820
 second time you need and after 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.700
 we will go to the mennais commander 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.920
 weak fund the Aixois link then 6.1 of the 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.420
 questions do not hesitate to drop in 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.870
 comments without giving pleasure to it 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.390
 reply 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.140
 so let's start about ten hours and 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.140
 after the steps 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.969
 So first I put sugar in 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.359
 little bowl my little ramekin here and 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:36.760
 after I put the cocoa in this same one 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.040
 little bowl then eyes in the team 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.269
 so jojoba oil you could 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.920
 put olive oil in the oil 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.510
 sweet almond nut really 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.519
 is not the cleat the oil you 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.950
 have at home that is liquid and 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.579
 finally the vanilla extract and then 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.459
 that's all so after I will not mix 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.180
 his form a rough but very 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.739
 moisturizing 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.989
 if you want a more exfoliator 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.639
 liquids put more oil if not 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.669
 you want to be drier even summer 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.949
 more sugar and so all the texture 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:07.959
 looks like that's a pop it's 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:10.359
 really very very pleasant about 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.459
 lips that expo reads really well then 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.769
 I love it so I hope my video 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.299
 you have more to give you an idea of 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.590
 small projects start again at the end of the week 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.959

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.400

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.599
