00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.919
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.240
 Electric bicycles are in maybe 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.340
 you already proud owner one 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.890
 such bicycle with electric 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.210
 Hilfsantrieb then they want 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.099
 even on vacation not on your bike 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.629
 renounce 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.370
 However, these bicycles make high 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.219
 requirements for the carriers 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.200
 We tested ten carriers for you 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.840
 the loud manufacturer for the high weight 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.120
 are designed by e bikes 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.920
 Three criteria are evaluated 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.739
 Assembly the handling and the 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.420
 after the installation of the 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.580
 The carriers will be on the clutch 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.570
 fastened for it there are different 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.460
 solutions 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.650
 The easiest way to assemble the assembly 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.660
 the carrier is placed straight from behind 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.059
 can be and with a long lever 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.369
 the firm seat is tense on the 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.080
 Ball head is extremely important to the ball 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.780
 must be fat-free 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.390
 the attachment of a little something 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.369
 laborious our puzzle is solved the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.520
 Anti-theft device without heavy 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.860
 tool nt 4 no chance once the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.360
 The carrier can be stuck and just sit 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.610
 bicycles are attached 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.200
 the compact hinges must have carrier 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.130
 but be unfolded before 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.890
 what is done quickly is the bicycles 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.630
 should with the utmost care 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.720
 be fixed the towers lurking like that 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.860
 often here in detail a contact of the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.000
 Bikes should be possible 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.340
 be avoided 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.990
 Frame gripper made of hard plastic can 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.220
 the paint of the bike already at the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.009
 damage assembly 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.619
 heavier in this case, however, is the 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.929
 small adjustment range of the boom what 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.910
 this leads to the shipowner very much 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.720
 far beyond the outlines of the vehicle 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.300
 protrude 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.849
 very important are also the holding straps 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.310
 in the fields a ratchet like here 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:08.899
 the best solution 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.110
 after careful assembly of wheels 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.480
 it goes on the test track 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.120
 First, the carrier four 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.980
 full braking from 80 km / h survive 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.140
 already here are some carriers 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.720
 weaken the tailgate of the test car 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.560
 gets first bumps and also the 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.560
 bicycles are suffering 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.410
 also at the next discipline 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.690
 Dodge procedures many manufacturers 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.750
 obviously according to the motto 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.610
 Moving does not break when there is too much movement 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:46.870
 However, there is damage to the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:49.730
 car a special challenge 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.250
 make ground waves there through the 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.200
 position far behind the car 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.840
 the bumps for the bikes 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.840
 much stronger than for the occupants 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.130
 as the only manufacturer waived 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.110
 paulchen loud instructions on one 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.450
 additional fixation of velden at 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.280
 carrier prompt jumps the rear wheel 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.230
 out of the guide we strongly recommend 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.210
 in addition to link the wheels 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.980
 that the ribbons may even 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.620
 save lives can show this 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.190
 shots the holders break the wheels 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.110
 only hang on the fields bands 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.670
 so that your vacation should not end like this 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.200
 you choose and assemble your 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.780
 wear very thoroughly 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.170
 here the results test winner will be the 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.260
 model over s21 nano just before westfalia 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.450
 and do the best ratio out of price 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.739
 however, the eufab offers and performance 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.739
 Jake in fourth place
