00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:11.580
 this is what the council today 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.580
 we continue 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:20.240
 and the blacks why then because they are 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.189
 in the house it seems that of them the 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.980
 authority they have them for 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.500
 supposed 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.710
 the owners of the house good because they 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.770
 they pay everything or are supposed and are inviting 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.559
 to young marriage let's say in this case 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.720
 the son not to live there but I do not think 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.330
 they have the authority and I think that 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.980
 the blacks because it's young marriage 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.280
 must be apart so they can 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.740
 develop your marriage 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.450
 [Music] 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.180
 we are back in your program the one 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.030
 hey advice seeing the theme of the family 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.390
 policy and we are reviewing with 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.430
 our experts the matter of living with 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.890
 the fathers gilberto you were going to comment 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.920
 something if not I do not see any solution to 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.470
 opposite if we compare it with a body 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.470
 with two heads our being a monster 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.580
 then when in a house two live 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.470
 families then only see two heads 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.070
 or four true because in the kitchen then 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:22.060
 who is going to send the mother-in-law or the daughter-in-law or 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.760
 the mom or the daughter and there are conflicts and 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.740
 all the time the babies and what is 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.790
 mentioned that truth may come out to 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.910
 work the marriage and leave the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.550
 parents in charge of the children but 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.080
 also there is conflict to all because 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.600
 how are we going to tell them there are 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.790
 I order them but you do not have any 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.610
 right to correct them or to call the 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.780
 Attention 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.750
 it is impossible for that reason the healthiest is 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.900
 get out of the house and that these problems 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.160
 derive from living in the house of the 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.560
 In-laws for good I think there's 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.450
 many simply the privacy of the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.930
 couple is something that can not 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.910
 develop if this part we talked about 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.830
 of the education of the children of the 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.070
 authority who sends who does not send 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.130
 let's allow dads to follow 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.820
 influencing giving advice the blackmail no 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.800
 there is control if then all this type 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.440
 of situations is causing you to be 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.830
 it returns a toxic relationship nothing healthy 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.170
 then the most convenient thing I think is 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.780
 get out of there as soon as possible and 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.150
 as you said sometimes not comfort 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.010
 part conchuda that they take care of me 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.510
 that they take me to school they give them 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.090
 of eating in the end all that kind of stuff 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.480
 makes them stay there and also for 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.790
 those for the children is conflicting because 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.640
 there are two authorities the two heads 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.440
 children start like not knowing what 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.720
 side of that hand 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.850
 here I am conscious in more then life 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.100
 on that side for them it is also a 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.690
 great lack of control I think the healthiest is 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.640
 say fourth round but just follow the 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.520
 example sorry other aspects what 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.970
 economic and in the counseling that I give 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.950
 always so much that so much of a part 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.180
 of the games as part of the children 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.879
 single 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.700
 tender was not always think they are 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.280
 contributing more money ball and always 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.409
 there are problems that because he joined us 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.290
 more light on ice plus water who spends 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.750
 more gas have this doctor who eats 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.519
 more and the hints begin and they are 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.000
 thousands of times of not being of the things 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.069
 in front and there is always rivalry for 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.099
 have sea ​​and I wanted to ask you in 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.500
 which cases could be extreme if 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.109
 will read with the parents if it is 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.859
 it can be good I think there are no cases 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.689
 extremes but none is valid for 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:51.230
 go to the parents go to the in-laws 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:54.290
 and we're talking about in- laws but 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.230
 in the vast majority of households in 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.469
 where this type of situation occurs is 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.810
 because there is a single mother who is the 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:06.620
 daughter and they have nowhere to leave the child 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.859
 or that the two of the two spouses 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.350
 They work and have no where to leave 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:15.560
 the children and leave him 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.300
 fast 6 with dad with mom and I 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.630
 I referred a little more to the case of when 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:23.060
 It floods your house and you do not have where 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.570
 run in this case you feel that if you 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.400
 will read with parents or passives perhaps 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.750
 do not put it on you have a campaign in a 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.410
 park or good maybe like help 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.900
 it may be ideal but it should not happen 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.870
 up about 23 days while it's already 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.390
 is looking for the right solution not 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.730
 must be mixed two places should not 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.970
 be two families under the same 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.620
 roof because finally look at me 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.450
 remembering something in the ark of 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.620
 noah 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.410
 there were problems four families did not 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.460
 I do it as an extreme situation 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.340
 effectively but long of 9 had 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.040
 cubicles and were gifted separate not 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.090
 they mixed giraffes with tigers 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.490
 etcetera not so also in a home not 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.249
 must mix in here we were talking 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.019
 also the education of children 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.999
 normally parents get upset 

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:22.590
 because the grandparents are educating or 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:24.630
 what way are you educating him 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.280
 God is clear and he tells us to instruct the 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.380
 child on his way and even when he was 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.810
 old man will not turn away from him is a 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.370
 instruction that gives the parents do not 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.280
 give that instruction to grandparents the 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.780
 jaguars then if we apply 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.360
 correctly what the word of 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.060
 God 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.759
 we would find a solution to all these 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.490
 problems that are occurring in the 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:49.490
 now it's time to go to a second 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.860
 cut but look back clear I'll 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.560
 I will expose this and what happens with 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.199
 those couples that maybe physically 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.490
 they are not 24 hours there in their homes 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:03.170
 dads but then they live there 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.060
 we come back after this cut 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.490
 [Music] 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.030
 we must be very attached to the family 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:16.220
 policy in a moment we will know 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:20.920
 [Music] 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:24.069
 He who hears advice we return 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.069
 [Applause]
