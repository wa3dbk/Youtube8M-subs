00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 how is it so good and have these two 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:10.170
 products that you could buy if you 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.160
 they are not products mostly because 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.620
 they are products that you have to 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.179
 to invest already for example and to wish coberta 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.830
 you but it's easier compared to other 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.050
 tubey buy more expensive then I think that 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.279
 those products no you can not anymore but if 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.289
 I go for the most expensive product is that if 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.289
 I would buy the number 10 again 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.830
 with investment definitely enough 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.770
 expensive 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.670
 hundred and sixty-something dollars but in 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:39.110
 the purchase already effectively takes me 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.430
 much better on my skin so there would not be 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.270
 number nine 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.800
 in the afternoon the amazonia clive I think that 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.700
 along with the den up to the best 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.930
 places that there are 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:56.150
 but and I do not know 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.650
 the panels that are and the durability that 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.080
 have is greater than the threat so 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.360
 definitely these are the only things 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.960
 I have promotional size the only 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.760
 for full 6 in the background but I do believe that 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.440
 they last a lot the environment leaves a finish 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.270
 very pretty 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.620
 for example this one that is the expos has 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.070
 a finish plus a very natural color 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.070
 so 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.600
 another process that I would buy again 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.630
 definitely I love it and what if 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.200
 ultra fanatical are the labials of command 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.320
 since there are some but at this moment 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.670
 From my favorites 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.510
 the latter goes in summer as a coral 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.510
 but rosadito 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.780
 zimmer that is wonderful color the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.810
 Summer is her dress that performs 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.180
 limited embedded and that is a pink 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.390
 for every day or could it 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.650
 follow and with everyone I have this 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.340
 is from the collection of the villains of 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.770
 firm and a natural color united here 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.510
 I have the angel of mate as everyone knows 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.670
 is the best pink newt to the whole world 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.650
 two beautiful ones come 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.650
 For example, what do I have 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.230
 another thing that I would buy again 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.510
 definitely this eye cream 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.120
 has a touch that is passion fruit without 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.520
 brighter that I love I think it makes a 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.520
 very good work at night 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.780
 the truth is that it is exquisite for 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.450
 night for the life of the eyes is the 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.130
 leave tied and bright if you want to use the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.570
 under the makeup I see problem 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.020
 Super good 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.020
 marias 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.950
 of mascara that has been 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.330
 returned from favorite masks and that 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.870
 obviously he would buy it again despite 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.870
 that caritas is this that is the 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.040
 area where there is football and without a mask 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.450
 since it is basically the mask of 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.760
 lashes that is not the long one but that 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.100
 his sinusitis has stayed like that and it's 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.690
 black already but what is the grace that 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.120
 have that I have the eyelashes 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.530
 things and very little in short 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.069
 it looks like it has a lot of tabs 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.030
 and very long 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.030
 if you want to have it 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.310
 another product that has been testing 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.160
 this last time that I love this 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.470
 base is open 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.450
 and it's the Amazon that there are 12 hours to 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.430
 colista foundation which is a base of 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.380
 high coverage that makes a review 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:34.070
 about this 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:36.440
 the truth is that I have an effect 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:41.340
 sparkly 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.660
 and it is very very rich in the skin and in addition to 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.420
 all the imperfections and you're going to 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.420
 apply is with the fingers and it is blurred 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.420
 wonders 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.950
 in another that I would buy again I do not know 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.790
 what number 23 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.790
 56 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.050
 on multiple occasions 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.380
 is one of the things like multipurpose that 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.820
 I will not miss you because if you do not have 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.710
 a lot of makeup for example if you lost 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.200
 until auto makeup this I can use it 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.520
 of lipstick can not use blush I'll 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.250
 to use illuminator they can use 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.310
 shade and covers many of those things 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.640
 then in truth and the color in case of 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.460
 a coral color with reflections 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.650
 gilded since all faded in the 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.260
 skin and you can leave it more charged more 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.560
 soft and for example blur to the site 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.190
 how it illuminates 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.470
 so obviously yes 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.760
 and the other is a proofreader in this case 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.680
 the one that I was using art 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.370
 lately this topic is that is the 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.590
 studio philips consider in that 35 already 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.300
 that as they see already touch the bread and that is 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.130
 this is right that you have in time 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.710
 it's about a year old so it's on the edge 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.360
 of his death but the truth is that it continues 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.750
 with the same creaminess 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:59.020
 copper texture whatever but you tour by 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.539
 pinna imperfections on rosacea 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.280
 already in fact there are times that I use this 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.620
 mode and with a little bit of dust and it's as if 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.960
 there would be full base then really 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.340
 they take you out a lot but of another product that 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.800
 I think I would buy again in the eyes of 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.800
 rice is that of chanel soleil 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.040
 exquisite as it smells exquisite as it 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.680
 applied is very easy on the skin is 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.720
 very creamy this there 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.720
 and there it is as 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:33.779
 if you notice that it is' ​​a silkiness that 

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:36.409
 has to melt with the skin that makes 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:39.059
 who wants is so natural me so 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:41.309
 I would really use it again because 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:43.109
 in the background with these things that are my 

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:46.139
 days in creating true that I can make a 

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:49.049
 full makeup and you would not have to 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.669
 be let's go and finally how do I want to 

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:52.019
 the shadows were missing and I the shadows 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.669
 that if I would buy again I would go back 

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:55.799
 investing in them a thousand times are the 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.959
 shadow of more and in this case this is the 

00:05:55.799 --> 00:05:59.669
 palette of the cold neutrons are the 

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:02.729
 that is not that I think it seems more 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.439
 well it 's more so definitely like that 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.999
 I would buy it again 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:07.559
 not having all the worst is that I have but 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:11.759
 have at least one neutral palette 

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:13.750
 with it being four colors that would be 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.820
 one of the investments that I would value 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.620
 so those are the 10 products that yes 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.030
 I would buy back in my life in the 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.220
 what if I would invest in what 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.630
 it's absolutely worth it so 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.190
 I hope you like what they do 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.910
