00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.060 

now<00:00:23.539> unfortunately<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:24.349> first<00:00:24.619> round<00:00:24.890> was

cold and windy with gusts up to 50 km/h

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.650 
cold and windy with gusts up to 50 km/h
making<00:00:28.699> the<00:00:28.789> take<00:00:29.060> off<00:00:29.240> from<00:00:29.359> the<00:00:29.449> platform

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
making the take off from the platform

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:37.410 
making the take off from the platform
all<00:00:30.140> the<00:00:30.410> more<00:00:30.529> difficult

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.439 

the<00:00:38.050> main<00:00:38.230> problem<00:00:38.410> is<00:00:38.800> that<00:00:38.980> they<00:00:39.879> have<00:00:40.089> they

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
the main problem is that they have they

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:41.759 
the main problem is that they have they
have<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.750> balance<00:00:40.960> at<00:00:41.289> the<00:00:41.410> edge<00:00:41.530> of<00:00:41.649> a

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
have to balance at the edge of a

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.040 
have to balance at the edge of a
platform<00:00:41.890> and<00:00:42.519> even<00:00:43.359> if<00:00:43.449> we're<00:00:43.659> standing

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
platform and even if we're standing

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.020 
platform and even if we're standing
there<00:00:44.230> and<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.379> gust<00:00:44.649> of<00:00:44.829> wind<00:00:44.859> come<00:00:45.309> in<00:00:45.489> you

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
there and the gust of wind come in you

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.420 
there and the gust of wind come in you
know<00:00:46.149> it<00:00:46.449> pushes<00:00:47.109> you<00:00:47.229> off<00:00:47.260> balance<00:00:47.559> which

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
know it pushes you off balance which

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.549 
know it pushes you off balance which
means<00:00:48.670> their<00:00:49.089> takeoff<00:00:49.539> has<00:00:50.079> to<00:00:50.260> be<00:00:50.379> completely

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
means their takeoff has to be completely

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.619 
means their takeoff has to be completely
in<00:00:51.129> balance<00:00:51.609> and<00:00:51.760> if<00:00:51.969> all<00:00:52.120> of<00:00:52.149> a<00:00:52.300> sudden<00:00:52.539> the

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
in balance and if all of a sudden the

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.600 
in balance and if all of a sudden the
gust<00:00:52.809> of<00:00:52.989> wind<00:00:53.019> comes<00:00:53.379> it<00:00:53.979> could<00:00:54.190> be<00:00:54.309> extremely

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
gust of wind comes it could be extremely

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:12.810 
gust of wind comes it could be extremely
dangerous

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.460
