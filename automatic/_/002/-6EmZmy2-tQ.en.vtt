 incognito you will not see that we are here 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.759
 directly already have two hosts 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:18.009
 because it has happened to me very rare things 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.230
 with minecraft and that is that it results from 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.910
 with the new version 1.6 listen 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.349

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.169
 It's normal because it makes you hot 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.700
 right now and good thing is that I've 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.040
 tried to play and it turns out that he has 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.379
 appeared on the server of good in the 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.730
 map of black ops 2 that I think is 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.379
 call plaza or something like that and I was wrong 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.670
 with that of the boats but it is a square and 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.690
 good that the true competition play a 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.160
 little the hunger games since 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.590
 lately I do not have much equipment to 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.420
 record and I just uploaded a game of a 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.590
 map left by subscriber and such and the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.090
 true that many of you have to upload me 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.290
 asthmatic and all that yes I say good 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.820
 I'm going to take advantage and I do some games 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.770
 hunger 'that are short and the more or 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.730
 less how is the theme of the channel and is that 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.470
 right now you know that we are in summer 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.610
 and I almost did not stop at home before because 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.140
 we are taking care of and now why not for 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.100
 because so and so the thing is that now 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.360
 when I have a little time to 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.190
 record of series like smash and that everything 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.079
 that I have it more more left behind 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.320
 newspaper that just when 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.969
 asked for a series as a type brand that 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.649
 end of which has a bit of 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:10.090
 survival I do not like to mix with 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.110
 magical in this case that I finished 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.969
 falling I say today that I was doing 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.439
 here that was doing there and the 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.010
 truth is that we will do that walking like 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.330
 yes 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.980
 as if there was en route to hell 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.420
 because they are and what I am doing 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.100
 that what I tell you if you see that in your bar 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.470
 magical because as I have extreme then 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.910
 I like to have a survival to know 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.200
 what am I doing because it costs me 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.270
 when I have what the fuck was going to do 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.430

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.940
 helmet around here good and the truth that 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.440

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.410
 it also remains yellow is the brightness to 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.790
 molina these moments shine dies but 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.430

 refers to what we ask of us 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.180
 We ask you to evaluate if you took more than one 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.270
 little if you see that it does not matter to hit him with 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.270
 the 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.530
