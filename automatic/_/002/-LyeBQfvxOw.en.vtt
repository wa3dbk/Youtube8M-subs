 Come on, everyone. All right. 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.240
 well this here the first video of the channel 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.119
 and as it says the title is the opening of it and 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.580
 in the case because I'm creating it too 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.369
 It would be more to show how it is 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.699
 games on a computer that is not very 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.140
 powerful for the present and you can 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:35.130
 simply run and without having to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.670
 a seven or a powerful video card 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.760
 What are you going to see in the video? 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.260
 settings is very basic the price 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.469
 also for those who do not want to spend too much 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.250
 does not have that money there is very reasonable 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.590
 It's very affordable to buy from him. 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.500
 I even did it on the website of the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.210
 megamamute that I did not know very well 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.570
 but I searched the internet 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.660
 I found him and I highly recommend it. 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.380
 the computer arrived in great condition came 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.030
 everything perfect and until now I have not had 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.170
 many problems with it 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.860
 the only thing that I've let down 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.790
 it would be a bit in the cabinet that in the case 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.650
 it only comes with a cooler I had to 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.270
 put 2 more spoons and well that's what 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.650

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.329
