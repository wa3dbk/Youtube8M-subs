like if actually not too bad in certain

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.109 
like if actually not too bad in certain
respects<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.100> say<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.790> relatively

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
respects I have to say it's a relatively

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.730 
respects I have to say it's a relatively
low-budget<00:01:30.390> film<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.350> made<00:01:31.560> by

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
low-budget film and it's made by

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.010 
low-budget film and it's made by
relatively<00:01:32.460> inexperienced<00:01:33.210> people<00:01:33.780> i

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
relatively inexperienced people i

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.899 
relatively inexperienced people i
believe<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> director<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.460> only<00:01:35.670> her

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
believe the director this is only her

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.730 
believe the director this is only her
second<00:01:36.390> movie<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.960> think<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.290> looks<00:01:37.500> fantastic

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
second movie I think it looks fantastic

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160 
second movie I think it looks fantastic
I<00:01:38.460> think<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.240> all<00:01:39.329> shot<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.570> Ireland<00:01:40.049> i

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
I think that it's all shot in Ireland i

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.289 
I think that it's all shot in Ireland i
believe<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.619> i<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> does<00:01:41.850> show<00:01:42.000> show

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
believe and i think it does show show

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.270 
believe and i think it does show show
off<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.689> acting<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.110> pretty<00:01:43.320> good<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
off and the acting is pretty good the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.030 
off and the acting is pretty good the
two<00:01:44.460> leads<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.350> iden<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.500> i<00:01:46.530> think<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.770> Ellen

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
two leads the iden and i think is Ellen

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.319 
two leads the iden and i think is Ellen
I<00:01:47.130> believe<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> characters<00:01:47.850> are<00:01:47.880> called<00:01:48.149> I

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
I believe the characters are called I

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.490 
I believe the characters are called I
actually<00:01:48.689> think<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.170> pretty<00:01:49.439> good

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
actually think they have a pretty good

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.590 
actually think they have a pretty good
decent<00:01:49.799> chemistry<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.820> actually<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.479> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
decent chemistry that actually have to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.450 
decent chemistry that actually have to
say<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> acting<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.350> fairly<00:01:52.950> good<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.340> this

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
much time is kind of spent on this of

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.180 
much time is kind of spent on this of
though<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.200> Romans<00:02:22.680> when<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.920> get<00:02:23.070> the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
though the Romans when I get the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.740 
though the Romans when I get the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
impression it kind of wants to be this

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.560 
impression it kind of wants to be this
kind<00:02:24.960> of<00:02:25.110> big<00:02:25.740> romantic<00:02:26.130> epic<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.120> really

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
kind of big romantic epic and it really

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.270 
kind of big romantic epic and it really
just<00:02:27.780> kind<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.020> waste<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.530> little<00:02:28.770> bit<00:02:28.890> too<00:02:29.100> much

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
just kind of waste a little bit too much

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.220 
just kind of waste a little bit too much
time<00:02:29.550> on<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:30.060> have<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.600> say<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> script

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
time on that I have to say the script

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.200 
time on that I have to say the script
isn't<00:02:31.620> fantastic<00:02:31.890> as<00:02:32.400> well<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:32.790> was

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
isn't fantastic as well and this was

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.600 
isn't fantastic as well and this was
co-written<00:02:33.750> by<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.200> director<00:02:34.830> here<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.580> I

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
co-written by the director here but I

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.910 
co-written by the director here but I
think<00:02:35.910> maybe<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.660> script<00:02:37.320> wasn't<00:02:37.560> fantastic

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
think maybe the script wasn't fantastic

that it's just them there's a future of

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.150 
that it's just them there's a future of
instances<00:02:58.140> where<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.500> think<00:02:58.740> it's<00:02:58.860> just<00:02:58.920> very

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160

cliche<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.060> ready<00:03:00.210> to<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.420> pedestrian<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.350> guess

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
cliche and ready to a pedestrian I guess

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.190 
cliche and ready to a pedestrian I guess
maybe<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.610> major<00:03:02.820> issue<00:03:03.090> here<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.690> we

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
maybe the major issue here is that we

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.450 
maybe the major issue here is that we
may<00:03:04.380> not<00:03:04.440> have<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.890> kind<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.250> female

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460

champion<00:03:29.520> because<00:03:30.030> she's<00:03:30.660> just<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:31.020> sort<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.230> a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
champion because she's just a sort of a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.790 
champion because she's just a sort of a
damsel<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:32.070> distress<00:03:32.280> ultimately<00:03:33.320> so<00:03:34.320> it's

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
damsel in distress ultimately so it's

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.860 
damsel in distress ultimately so it's
the<00:03:35.670> other<00:03:35.790> gate<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.000> guess<00:03:36.180> think<00:03:36.360> it<00:03:36.600> maybe

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
the other gate I guess think it maybe

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.020 
the other gate I guess think it maybe
gets<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.440> little<00:03:37.560> bit<00:03:37.770> boring<00:03:38.220> like<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.760> said<00:03:38.850> I

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
gets a little bit boring like I said I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.370 
gets a little bit boring like I said I
think<00:03:39.210> maybe<00:03:39.360> your<00:03:39.570> focus<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:39.990> a<00:03:40.050> little<00:03:40.260> bit

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
think maybe your focus is a little bit

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.020 
think maybe your focus is a little bit
too<00:03:40.560> much<00:03:40.770> on<00:03:40.950> this<00:03:41.040> trying<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.550> business<00:03:41.820> of

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
too much on this trying to business of

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.090 
too much on this trying to business of
what<00:03:42.209> this<00:03:42.360> epic<00:03:42.750> romance<00:03:43.260> type<00:03:43.560> thing<00:03:43.890> but

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
what this epic romance type thing but

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.160 
what this epic romance type thing but
this<00:03:44.580> many<00:03:44.850> evil<00:03:45.150> romance<00:03:45.540> but<00:03:45.720> just<00:03:45.930> ends<00:03:46.110> up

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
this many evil romance but just ends up

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.140 
this many evil romance but just ends up
being<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.530> little<00:03:46.650> bit<00:03:46.800> boring<00:03:47.280> sometimes<00:03:47.610> and

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
being a little bit boring sometimes and

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.790 
being a little bit boring sometimes and
they<00:03:48.570> also<00:03:48.690> thought<00:03:48.990> maybe<00:03:49.200> sometimes<00:03:49.709> the

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
they also thought maybe sometimes the

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.460 
they also thought maybe sometimes the
characters<00:03:50.190> motivations<00:03:50.340> where<00:03:51.260> when<00:03:52.260> you

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
characters motivations where when you

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.110 
characters motivations where when you
know<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> little<00:03:52.830> bit<00:03:52.950> murky<00:03:53.430> sometimes<00:03:53.940> I

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
know a little bit murky sometimes I

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.270 
know a little bit murky sometimes I
didn't<00:03:54.780> really<00:03:54.870> quite<00:03:55.110> understands<00:03:55.800> what<00:03:56.160> the

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
didn't really quite understands what the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.430 
didn't really quite understands what the
bad<00:03:56.490> guys<00:03:56.790> for<00:03:57.180> example<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.840> don't<00:03:58.260> really

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
bad guys for example I don't really

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.449 
bad guys for example I don't really
quite<00:03:58.680> understand<00:03:59.100> some<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.340> their

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
quite understand some of their

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.850 
quite understand some of their
motivations<00:04:00.120> some<00:04:00.570> of<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.750> time<00:04:00.959> but<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:01.620> have

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
motivations some of the time but I have

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.699 
motivations some of the time but I have
certainly<00:04:02.220> seen<00:04:02.630> worse<00:04:03.630> fantasy<00:04:04.230> films<00:04:04.590> of

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
certainly seen worse fantasy films of

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.680 
certainly seen worse fantasy films of
this<00:04:04.800> kind<00:04:04.920> of<00:04:05.010> low-budget<00:04:05.400> genre<00:04:06.030> yes<00:04:06.540> the

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
this kind of low-budget genre yes the

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.810 
this kind of low-budget genre yes the
CGI<00:04:07.080> is<00:04:07.290> never<00:04:07.650> going<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:07.890> be<00:04:07.950> fantastic<00:04:08.250> in

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
CGI is never going to be fantastic in

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.090 
CGI is never going to be fantastic in
these<00:04:08.970> films<00:04:09.180> but<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:09.750> think<00:04:10.050> it<00:04:10.170> serves<00:04:10.800> it

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
these films but I think it serves it

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.190 
these films but I think it serves it
over<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:11.550> sort<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.850> level<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.270> b<00:04:12.630> movies<00:04:12.840> I've

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
over this sort of level of b movies I've

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.880 
over this sort of level of b movies I've
seen<00:04:13.230> worse<00:04:13.820> certainly<00:04:15.230> but<00:04:16.230> you<00:04:16.620> know<00:04:16.739> it's

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
seen worse certainly but you know it's

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.440 
seen worse certainly but you know it's
fine<00:04:17.100> I<00:04:17.310> got<00:04:17.609> actually<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:17.910> think<00:04:17.940> maybe<00:04:18.270> the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
fine I got actually I think maybe the

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.650 
fine I got actually I think maybe the
dragon<00:04:19.100> wasn't<00:04:20.100> fantastic<00:04:20.580> because<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:21.570> just

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
dragon wasn't fantastic because it just

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.960 
dragon wasn't fantastic because it just
simply<00:04:21.900> hanging<00:04:22.740> around<00:04:23.190> pretty<00:04:23.520> much<00:04:23.610> all

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
simply hanging around pretty much all

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.600 
simply hanging around pretty much all
the<00:04:24.090> time<00:04:24.120> we<00:04:25.110> sort<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.380> seat<00:04:25.590> we<00:04:26.190> see<00:04:26.370> some

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
the time we sort of seat we see some

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.170 
the time we sort of seat we see some
sort

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
sort

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.490 
sort
to<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.419> throughout<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.840> film<00:04:28.080> it<00:04:28.199> doesn't

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
to it throughout the film it doesn't

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.810 
to it throughout the film it doesn't
really<00:04:28.620> do<00:04:28.800> very<00:04:28.979> much<00:04:29.220> Department<00:04:29.759> just

say<00:04:35.250> is<00:04:35.370> a<00:04:35.400> bit<00:04:35.580> of<00:04:35.639> a<00:04:35.729> letdown<00:04:35.940> now<00:04:36.870> in<00:04:37.080> regards

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
say is a bit of a letdown now in regards

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.590 
say is a bit of a letdown now in regards
that<00:04:37.620> other<00:04:37.860> fans<00:04:38.430> do<00:04:38.699> stuff<00:04:39.000> in<00:04:39.180> this<00:04:39.300> film

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
that other fans do stuff in this film

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.749 
that other fans do stuff in this film
there's<00:04:39.780> not<00:04:39.930> a<00:04:39.960> lot<00:04:40.229> hearing<00:04:41.220> that's<00:04:41.460> kind<00:04:41.699> of

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
there's not a lot hearing that's kind of

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.450 
there's not a lot hearing that's kind of
more<00:04:41.940> that<00:04:42.479> it's<00:04:42.630> really<00:04:42.810> fancy<00:04:43.380> like<00:04:43.919> I<00:04:44.100> think

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
more that it's really fancy like I think

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.580 
more that it's really fancy like I think
one<00:04:44.580> of<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.729> best<00:04:44.940> bits<00:04:45.930> in<00:04:46.110> this<00:04:46.229> film<00:04:46.470> is

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
one of the best bits in this film is

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.840 
one of the best bits in this film is
kind<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:46.860> where<00:04:46.979> we<00:04:47.070> said<00:04:47.250> it's<00:04:47.400> kind<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.639> like

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
kind of where we said it's kind of like

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.540 
kind of where we said it's kind of like
Darth<00:04:48.210> Vader<00:04:48.539> type<00:04:48.949> shadow<00:04:49.949> he<00:04:50.220> looks<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.460> bit

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
Darth Vader type shadow he looks a bit

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.070 
Darth Vader type shadow he looks a bit
like<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.789> nazgûl<00:04:51.270> from<00:04:51.479> all<00:04:51.660> of<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.870> Rings

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
like the nazgûl from all of the Rings

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.560 
like the nazgûl from all of the Rings
and<00:04:52.229> he<00:04:52.320> kind<00:04:52.530> of<00:04:52.590> blood<00:04:52.830> as<00:04:53.100> I<00:04:53.160> say<00:04:53.570> disappears

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
and he kind of blood as I say disappears

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.029 
and he kind of blood as I say disappears
in<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:54.810> bunch<00:04:55.139> of<00:04:55.229> crows<00:04:55.440> and<00:04:55.620> he's<00:04:55.770> pretty

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
in a bunch of crows and he's pretty

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.770 
in a bunch of crows and he's pretty
eaten<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:56.580> he<00:04:56.639> kind<00:04:56.820> of<00:04:56.880> math<00:04:57.090> Marquez<00:04:57.539> is<00:04:57.660> he

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
eaten and he kind of math Marquez is he

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.779 
eaten and he kind of math Marquez is he
still<00:04:57.990> talking<00:04:58.199> you<00:04:59.039> know<00:04:59.070> he<00:04:59.280> looked<00:04:59.460> kind<00:04:59.550> of

still talking you know he looked kind of

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.640 
still talking you know he looked kind of
cool<00:05:00.030> but<00:05:00.210> forgery<00:05:00.660> he's<00:05:00.840> probably<00:05:01.110> alienate

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
cool but forgery he's probably alienate

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.980 
cool but forgery he's probably alienate
about<00:05:02.190> half<00:05:02.430> film<00:05:02.880> but<00:05:03.240> certainly<00:05:03.539> not<00:05:03.690> about

about half film but certainly not about

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.800 
about half film but certainly not about
if<00:05:04.199> I<00:05:04.380> think<00:05:04.710> maybe<00:05:05.130> more<00:05:05.479> safer<00:05:06.479> more<00:05:06.630> from

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
if I think maybe more safer more from

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.659 
if I think maybe more safer more from
this<00:05:06.900> creative<00:05:07.470> team<00:05:07.710> myself<00:05:08.250> maybe<00:05:08.400> get<00:05:08.610> a

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
this creative team myself maybe get a

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:09.980 
this creative team myself maybe get a
little<00:05:08.699> bit<00:05:08.910> more<00:05:09.030> experience<00:05:09.330> I<00:05:09.599> know<00:05:09.720> I

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
little bit more experience I know I

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.600 
little bit more experience I know I
maybe<00:05:10.349> get<00:05:10.590> a<00:05:10.650> little<00:05:10.710> bit<00:05:11.039> but<00:05:11.190> it's

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
maybe get a little bit but it's

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.140 
maybe get a little bit but it's
certainly<00:05:11.759> not<00:05:12.060> a<00:05:12.120> bad<00:05:12.690> film<00:05:13.020> especially<00:05:14.150> if

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
certainly not a bad film especially if

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.990 
certainly not a bad film especially if
you<00:05:15.240> wanted<00:05:15.570> like<00:05:15.720> a<00:05:15.870> a<00:05:16.050> big<00:05:16.680> scale<00:05:17.070> lots<00:05:17.820> of

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
you wanted like a a big scale lots of

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.550 
you wanted like a a big scale lots of
like<00:05:18.270> violence<00:05:19.259> lots<00:05:19.590> of<00:05:20.930> you<00:05:21.930> know<00:05:22.080> fancy

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
like violence lots of you know fancy

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.409 
like violence lots of you know fancy
creatures<00:05:23.190> you're<00:05:23.669> not<00:05:23.820> going<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.000> you're<00:05:24.389> not

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
creatures you're not going to you're not

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.210 
creatures you're not going to you're not
really<00:05:24.630> going<00:05:24.810> to<00:05:24.870> find<00:05:25.110> it<00:05:25.229> here<00:05:25.410> and<00:05:25.620> lastly

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
really going to find it here and lastly

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.560 
really going to find it here and lastly
I<00:05:26.310> guess<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.610> only<00:05:26.669> other<00:05:26.789> that<00:05:27.060> negative

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
I guess the only other that negative

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.850 
I guess the only other that negative
thing<00:05:27.660> I<00:05:27.750> would<00:05:27.870> have<00:05:27.990> to<00:05:28.080> say<00:05:28.139> about<00:05:28.320> it<00:05:28.470> the

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
thing I would have to say about it the

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.230 
thing I would have to say about it the
fight<00:05:29.099> card<00:05:29.370> raphy<00:05:29.639> isn't<00:05:29.849> particularly

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
fight card raphy isn't particularly

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.909 
fight card raphy isn't particularly
great<00:05:30.630> there's<00:05:30.990> not<00:05:31.169> a<00:05:31.229> lot<00:05:31.380> of<00:05:31.409> fighting<00:05:31.650> in

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
great there's not a lot of fighting in

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.770 
great there's not a lot of fighting in
it<00:05:32.039> if<00:05:32.130> I'm<00:05:32.280> completely<00:05:32.669> honest<00:05:33.000> with<00:05:33.150> you<00:05:33.389> but

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
it if I'm completely honest with you but

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.600 
it if I'm completely honest with you but
the<00:05:33.900> fighting<00:05:34.110> that<00:05:34.320> we<00:05:34.409> do<00:05:34.560> have<00:05:34.830> is<00:05:34.979> pretty

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
the fighting that we do have is pretty

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.450 
the fighting that we do have is pretty
pretty<00:05:36.510> boring<00:05:36.870> to<00:05:36.900> watch<00:05:37.130> but<00:05:38.130> like<00:05:38.280> I<00:05:38.310> said

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
pretty boring to watch but like I said

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.070 
pretty boring to watch but like I said
that<00:05:39.030> is<00:05:39.180> kind<00:05:39.389> of<00:05:39.449> a<00:05:39.510> bit<00:05:39.630> of<00:05:39.659> a<00:05:39.750> mixed<00:05:40.050> bag

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
that is kind of a bit of a mixed bag

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.839 
that is kind of a bit of a mixed bag
there<00:05:40.530> are<00:05:40.680> some<00:05:40.860> sort<00:05:41.159> of<00:05:41.190> certain<00:05:41.699> things

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
there are some sort of certain things

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:43.700 
there are some sort of certain things

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
you can enjoy here the score i think is

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.490 
you can enjoy here the score i think is
fantastic<00:05:43.919> and<00:05:44.610> it<00:05:44.699> does<00:05:45.270> bring<00:05:45.690> out<00:05:45.840> he<00:05:46.139> makes

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
fantastic and it does bring out he makes

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.960 
fantastic and it does bring out he makes
you<00:05:46.680> feel<00:05:46.860> like<00:05:46.889> it's<00:05:47.130> a<00:05:47.190> higher<00:05:47.400> budget<00:05:47.580> film

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
you feel like it's a higher budget film

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.839 
you feel like it's a higher budget film
the<00:05:48.060> midi<00:05:48.210> so<00:05:48.479> I<00:05:48.539> think<00:05:48.630> sometimes<00:05:49.490> but<00:05:50.490> I<00:05:50.669> want

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
to give this one a 4.5 out of 10 so it's

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.219 
to give this one a 4.5 out of 10 so it's
certainly<00:05:53.460> not<00:05:53.729> a<00:05:53.789> bad<00:05:54.000> film<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:54.810> you<00:05:55.110> know
