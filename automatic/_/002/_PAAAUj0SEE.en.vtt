00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.830 
method now find the HC f of 24 and 36
using<00:00:20.590> the<00:00:20.800> prime<00:00:21.360> factorization<00:00:22.360> method

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
using the prime factorization method

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.600 
using the prime factorization method
first<00:00:23.740> we<00:00:24.130> will<00:00:24.520> start<00:00:24.880> with<00:00:25.119> the<00:00:25.270> number<00:00:26.190> 24

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
first we will start with the number 24

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.760 
first we will start with the number 24
now<00:00:28.480> here<00:00:29.130> 24<00:00:30.130> is<00:00:30.310> a<00:00:30.539> composite<00:00:31.539> number

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
now here 24 is a composite number

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.989 
now here 24 is a composite number
it<00:00:33.309> is<00:00:33.579> also<00:00:33.850> an<00:00:34.420> even<00:00:35.079> number<00:00:35.589> so<00:00:35.920> we<00:00:36.789> can

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:36.999 
it is also an even number so we can

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:41.610 
it is also an even number so we can
divide<00:00:37.390> it<00:00:37.569> by<00:00:37.859> 2<00:00:38.859> the<00:00:39.489> smallest<00:00:40.199> even<00:00:41.199> number

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
divide it by 2 the smallest even number

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.770 
divide it by 2 the smallest even number
so<00:00:42.420> 24<00:00:43.420> we<00:00:43.870> can<00:00:44.079> divide<00:00:44.379> by<00:00:44.679> 2<00:00:45.030> two<00:00:46.030> ones<00:00:46.479> are

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
so 24 we can divide by 2 two ones are

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.709 
so 24 we can divide by 2 two ones are
two<00:00:47.170> and<00:00:48.479> two<00:00:49.479> twos<00:00:49.929> are<00:00:50.289> four<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:52.210> we<00:00:52.420> have

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
two and two twos are four so we have

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.139 
two and two twos are four so we have
here<00:00:53.379> 12<00:00:54.059> now<00:00:55.059> 12<00:00:55.510> is<00:00:55.989> an<00:00:56.559> even<00:00:57.100> number<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.639> we

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
here 12 now 12 is an even number and we

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:06.469 
here 12 now 12 is an even number and we
can<00:00:58.179> again<00:00:58.870> divide<00:00:59.260> it<00:00:59.589> by<00:00:59.769> 2<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.510> 2<00:01:03.059> 6<00:01:04.059> are<00:01:04.649> 12

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
can again divide it by 2 so 2 6 are 12

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.959 
can again divide it by 2 so 2 6 are 12
we<00:01:07.479> get<00:01:07.799> 6<00:01:08.799> here<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:10.210> 6<00:01:10.719> is<00:01:10.899> again<00:01:11.469> an<00:01:11.969> even

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
we get 6 here now 6 is again an even

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:19.560 
we get 6 here now 6 is again an even
number<00:01:13.360> so<00:01:14.369> 2<00:01:15.960> threes<00:01:16.960> are<00:01:17.350> 6<00:01:18.280> now<00:01:19.000> we<00:01:19.030> have

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
number so 2 threes are 6 now we have

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.679 
number so 2 threes are 6 now we have
three<00:01:20.759> threes<00:01:21.759> in<00:01:21.789> odd<00:01:22.780> number<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:25.030> is

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
three threes in odd number and it is

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.630 
three threes in odd number and it is
also<00:01:25.930> a<00:01:26.140> prime<00:01:26.649> number<00:01:27.159> so<00:01:27.899> three<00:01:29.250> ones<00:01:30.250> are

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
also a prime number so three ones are

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.300 
also a prime number so three ones are
three<00:01:31.630> so<00:01:32.500> our<00:01:33.240> prime<00:01:34.409> factorization<00:01:35.409> of<00:01:35.590> 24

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
three so our prime factorization of 24

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.639 
three so our prime factorization of 24
is<00:01:36.880> over<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.920> got<00:01:39.310> all<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.600> prime<00:01:41.170> number

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
is over and we got all the prime number

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.440 
is over and we got all the prime number
here<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.960> we<00:01:44.170> get<00:01:44.460> 24<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.700> equal<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.799> 2<00:01:47.799> into

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
here and so we get 24 is equal to 2 into

00:01:48.450 --> 00:02:01.010 
here and so we get 24 is equal to 2 into
2<00:01:49.450> into<00:01:49.840> 2<00:01:50.829> into<00:01:51.219> 3<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:53.340> 2<00:01:54.810> x<00:01:55.810> 2<00:01:56.520> x<00:01:57.520> 2<00:01:58.710> x<00:01:59.710> 3<00:02:00.130> and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
2 into 2 into 3 so 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.739 
2 into 2 into 3 so 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 and
this<00:02:02.020> is<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.530> prime<00:02:03.810> factorization<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:05.020> 24

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:06.749 
this is the prime factorization of 24

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:10.430 
this is the prime factorization of 24
understood<00:02:07.749> now<00:02:08.380> let<00:02:09.220> us<00:02:09.250> do<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.850> prime

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
understood now let us do the prime

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.360 
understood now let us do the prime
factorization<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.620> number<00:02:12.630> 36

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
factorization of number 36

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.110 
factorization of number 36
t6<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.879> also<00:02:15.269> an<00:02:15.530> even<00:02:16.530> number<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.159> it<00:02:17.670> can<00:02:17.940> be

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
t6 is also an even number and it can be

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.320 
t6 is also an even number and it can be
divided<00:02:18.510> by<00:02:19.010> two<00:02:20.010> which<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:20.700> smallest

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
divided by two which is the smallest

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.309 
divided by two which is the smallest
even<00:02:22.170> number<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.799> let's<00:02:23.549> do<00:02:23.849> it

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
even number so let's do it

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:33.140 
even number so let's do it
36<00:02:25.640> two<00:02:27.739> now<00:02:28.739> two<00:02:29.370> ones<00:02:29.760> are<00:02:30.060> two<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:31.790> two<00:02:32.790> aids

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
36 two now two ones are two and two aids

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.619 
36 two now two ones are two and two aids
are<00:02:33.780> 16<00:02:34.730> we<00:02:35.730> get<00:02:36.000> here<00:02:36.329> 18<00:02:37.430> again<00:02:38.430> 18<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:39.329> an

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
are 16 we get here 18 again 18 is an

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.539 
are 16 we get here 18 again 18 is an
even<00:02:40.440> number<00:02:40.829> and<00:02:40.860> we<00:02:41.190> can<00:02:41.400> divide<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.730> by<00:02:42.030> 2<00:02:42.659> so

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
even number and we can divide it by 2 so

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:51.140 
even number and we can divide it by 2 so
2<00:02:44.549> 9s<00:02:45.180> are<00:02:45.349> 18<00:02:46.349> we<00:02:47.099> get<00:02:47.370> 9<00:02:48.120> here<00:02:48.680> 9<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.980> an<00:02:50.220> odd

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
2 9s are 18 we get 9 here 9 is an odd

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.390 
2 9s are 18 we get 9 here 9 is an odd
number<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.319> we<00:02:52.410> need<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.709> divide<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.069> by

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
number so we need to divide it by

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.630 
number so we need to divide it by
another<00:02:54.239> odd<00:02:54.569> number<00:02:55.079> so<00:02:55.620> let's<00:02:55.829> try<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.250> do<00:02:56.519> it

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
another odd number so let's try to do it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.390 
another odd number so let's try to do it
with<00:02:56.879> 3<00:02:57.319> so<00:02:58.319> 3<00:02:59.129> threes<00:02:59.819> are<00:03:00.500> 9<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:02.010> we'll<00:03:02.190> put

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
with 3 so 3 threes are 9 so we'll put

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.640 
with 3 so 3 threes are 9 so we'll put
here<00:03:02.780> 3<00:03:03.780> threes<00:03:04.409> are<00:03:04.739> 9<00:03:05.069> then<00:03:05.579> last<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:06.480> get<00:03:06.810> 3

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
here 3 threes are 9 then last we get 3

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.839 
here 3 threes are 9 then last we get 3
which<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.069> in<00:03:08.459> our<00:03:09.109> number<00:03:10.109> and<00:03:10.379> also<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:11.040> prime

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
which is in our number and also a prime

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.300 
which is in our number and also a prime
number<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:13.040> 3<00:03:14.040> ones<00:03:14.849> are<00:03:15.239> 3

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
number so 3 ones are 3

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.509 
number so 3 ones are 3
so<00:03:17.310> here<00:03:17.879> the<00:03:18.120> prime<00:03:18.560> factorization<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.680> 36<00:03:20.160> is

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
so here the prime factorization of 36 is

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:27.009 
so here the prime factorization of 36 is
done<00:03:20.849> and<00:03:21.560> we<00:03:22.560> get<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.919> factors<00:03:23.430> as<00:03:23.669> 2<00:03:24.060> 2<00:03:24.840> 3<00:03:25.560> 3

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
done and we get the factors as 2 2 3 3

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.949 
done and we get the factors as 2 2 3 3
so<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.620> prime<00:03:28.889> factorization<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:30.090> 36<00:03:30.540> is

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
so the prime factorization of 36 is

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:42.949 
so the prime factorization of 36 is
equal<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.650> 2<00:03:32.629> x<00:03:33.629> 2<00:03:34.160> x<00:03:35.160> 3<00:03:37.400> x<00:03:38.400> 3<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:40.639> see<00:03:41.639> here<00:03:42.000> all

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
equal to 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 and see here all

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.970 
equal to 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 and see here all
the<00:03:43.260> factors<00:03:43.859> are<00:03:44.209> prime<00:03:45.209> numbers<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:46.530> this<00:03:46.769> is

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
the factors are prime numbers so this is

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.099 
the factors are prime numbers so this is
the<00:03:47.190> prime<00:03:48.230> factorization<00:03:49.230> of<00:03:49.410> 36<00:03:50.400> now<00:03:51.389> what

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
the prime factorization of 36 now what

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.659 
the prime factorization of 36 now what
did<00:03:52.290> we<00:03:52.470> do<00:03:52.650> we<00:03:53.430> found<00:03:53.879> all<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.930> prime<00:03:55.470> factors

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
did we do we found all the prime factors

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:02.420 
did we do we found all the prime factors
of<00:03:56.669> both<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.840> numbers<00:03:58.549> 24<00:03:59.549> and<00:03:59.840> 36<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.709> now<00:04:01.949> the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
of both the numbers 24 and 36 so now the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.869 
of both the numbers 24 and 36 so now the
second<00:04:02.819> step<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:03.359> let's<00:04:04.319> find<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:05.069> common

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
second step is let's find the common

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
2 into 2 into 3 into 3 and what are the

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.129 
2 into 2 into 3 into 3 and what are the
common<00:04:25.409> factors<00:04:26.060> if<00:04:27.060> we<00:04:27.360> see

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
common factors if we see

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:38.679 
common factors if we see
two<00:04:28.919> two<00:04:29.460> two<00:04:29.900> two<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:33.080> three<00:04:34.280> so<00:04:35.689> two<00:04:37.310> two<00:04:38.310> and

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:38.689 
two two two two and three so two two and

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:44.350 
two two two two and three so two two and
three<00:04:39.689> are<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.400> common<00:04:41.400> factors<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.169> 24<00:04:43.169> and

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
three are the common factors of 24 and

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.369 
three are the common factors of 24 and
36<00:04:46.129> now<00:04:47.129> if<00:04:47.550> we<00:04:47.909> multiply<00:04:48.599> these<00:04:48.659> common

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
36 now if we multiply these common

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:56.240 
36 now if we multiply these common
factors<00:04:50.120> we<00:04:51.120> get<00:04:51.419> the<00:04:51.689> HC<00:04:52.620> f<00:04:52.770> so<00:04:54.199> HC<00:04:55.199> f<00:04:55.289> of<00:04:55.560> 24

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
factors we get the HC f so HC f of 24

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:04.990 
factors we get the HC f so HC f of 24
and<00:04:56.840> 36<00:04:57.860> is<00:04:58.860> equal<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.849> two<00:05:00.469> x<00:05:01.669> two<00:05:02.689> x<00:05:03.689> three

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
and 36 is equal to two x two x three

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.080 
and 36 is equal to two x two x three
which<00:05:06.000> are<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.419> common<00:05:06.779> factors<00:05:07.199> of<00:05:07.560> both<00:05:08.090> 24

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
which are the common factors of both 24

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:17.929 
which are the common factors of both 24
and<00:05:10.279> 36<00:05:11.659> so<00:05:12.830> this<00:05:13.830> is<00:05:14.039> equal<00:05:14.699> to<00:05:14.729> 12<00:05:15.560> so<00:05:16.560> at<00:05:16.939> CFO

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:17.939 
and 36 so this is equal to 12 so at CFO

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:23.089 
and 36 so this is equal to 12 so at CFO
of<00:05:17.969> 24<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:19.050> 36<00:05:19.500> is<00:05:20.039> 12<00:05:20.819> and<00:05:21.199> this<00:05:22.199> we<00:05:22.469> found<00:05:22.740> out

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
of 24 and 36 is 12 and this we found out

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.909 
of 24 and 36 is 12 and this we found out
by<00:05:23.969> using<00:05:24.569> the<00:05:24.960> prime<00:05:25.879> factorization<00:05:26.879> method
