00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.529
 or the world I'm black and welcome 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.299
 back to my channel yeah ya know guys 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.760
 it had been a long time since a 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.559
 video and this transitory stage vÃ©lez 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.780
 little place for you I'm sure it's 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.610
 It's over because I have to tell you 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.460
 that I'm going to upload more videos from 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.109
 now on my channel with more content not 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.239
 I know how often because if I have something 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.919
 learned in this era and at this stage 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.749
 of deep meditation away from the 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.189
 entrails of my channel is that I have to 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.109
 upload videos when I feel like it 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.089
 when you consider that the content is the 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.800
 more appropriate and when the relationship of 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.170
 the things that can bring us to 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.260
 us collectively like me to 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.000
 personal level is more or less optimal as well 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.530
 that there is a better way than after a 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.940
 month of inactivity that come back with a 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.309
 small video with a criticism 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.530
 constructive to something that you're not 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.480
 agree and you would like to manifest 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.420
 well what I have done is to structure 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.829
 points in a script to point 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.260
 those things that I would like 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.640
 claim in this video and I'll 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.620
 do focusing from a point of 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.030
 creative view as if it were a top 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.370
 competitive of what I usually do in 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.110
 optic esp senna weekly a top 5 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.580
 I think it can be quite 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.500
 interesting 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.650
 and if you think we're going to start with 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.020
 this top critical education 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.300
 well then we started with the top guys yo 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.980
 I'm tight and in number 5 we have the 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.380
 fact that the effort is rewarded and not 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.780
 the knowledge that predisposes the 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.060
 obligation before the interest that the notes 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.700
 do not reflect anything at all 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.050
 what has been learned during the year 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.990
 becoming a role with which 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.650
 can be cleaned after the nice ass 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.630
 click and in number 4 we have the fact 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.090
 that the teacher follows a pattern 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.950
 systematic unable to see more 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.380
 beyond the limits imposed on a 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.240
 matter that you intend to explain by 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.190
 science a unique reality and 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.900
 dogmatic that is just as non-existent 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.900
 that I'm defending myself now 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.049
 well let's go now with the number 3 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.329
 we have the fact that it is predisposed 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.399
 the way to the content both in speech 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.840
 as in the writing that what 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.970
 It is intended to convey remains 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.539
 completely relegated to importance it 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.769
 abused in excess of a bad spelling 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.060
 regardless of whether or not having a 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.160
 good writing ability 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.870
 let me mark here a first point 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.489
 of inflection to explain why I have 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.410
 said that and that is that the other day I 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.630
 they delivered the first reading test 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.630
 that I had mandatory and I say mandatory 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.069
 Beware of this word the first 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.810
 quarter of this second of 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.060
 baccalaureate good because the case is that 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.739
 by content I got a 9 with 2 but 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.390
 by system and as a rule I 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:41.390
 They dropped 3 points from a 9 to a 6 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.880
 make 37 mistakes it 's true that I write to you 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.800
 with faults is wrong it is true that 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.860
 must write without excess of bad 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.299
 spelling but is that damn 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.330
 predispose that to the content I'm not in 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.730
 Absolutely, I do not agree for you to see 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.480
 which it is a thing that touches me quite the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.940
 balls 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.110
 so we went to number 2 to avoid 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.970
 frustrations 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.950
 and we have the fact that the 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.440
 prejudice towards the student as something 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.360
 rational on the part of the faculty the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.860
 which makes the impartiality when 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.560
 to correct an exam or another one 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.720
 nonexistent that when a teacher looks 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.910
 attacked in a discussion for lack of 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.430
 arguments use your situation in the 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.260
 school hierarchy to attack you that 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.840
 a student is penalized for arriving five 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.280
 minutes later I say this because 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.989
 who has not passed is at school 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.579
 that we notice that the teacher feels 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.650
 predisposition by one student or the other 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.079
 when you really do not know the person 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.910
 which is trying that is my 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.290
 main criticism at this point and 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.819
 after that sometimes they penalize you for 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.650
 arrive five minutes late 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.299
 Damn that matter please 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.489
 you arrive five minutes late it's true 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.379
 you will arrive five minutes after 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.810
 the class has started but you will not have 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.000
 lost nothing transcendental that you what 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.299
 I assure but good things are like that 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.299
 Boys 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.090
 this is over, guys, we're going 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.459
 then with the number one in which 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.780
 we find what bothers me most and 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.999
 is the fact that people 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.129
 manifest by the economic cuts and 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:08.329
 do not worry absolutely about anything 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.060
 of what we have named above 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.549
 that according to my humble opinion and criteria 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.349
 much more important and alarming than the 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.410
 fact that some institutions 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:21.209
 school before short of money 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.980
 in oshima they misinterpret my words 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.870
 I totally agree that the people 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.450
 go out to demonstrate on the streets and more 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.860
 even if this claim of the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.690
 fact that the state removes the system 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.120
 educational a lot of money 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.470
 predisposing this institution to others 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.120
 less momentous 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.740
 but it's that I think guys that we're 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.690
 try to solve a problem that we 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.710
 worries a lot from the area more 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.720
 superficial 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.210
 we're trying to get the shit out of 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.130
 above the most superficial rust and 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.540
 we should find the root problem 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.460
 that is underground because it is a 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.040
 much deeper problem 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.980
 then I close where the root of the 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.040
 problem according to your criterion good then I 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.810
 I think the problem comes when I do not 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.120
 We accept the fact that the system 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.550
 score is not the most convenient nor 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.110
 the most correct if the 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.030
 scoring system think about it 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.320
 we would avoid many more problems 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.210
 as the fact that a student 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.490
 university that has suspended in the 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.770
 selectivity can not access a 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.760
 career that he wishes for the fact that 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.250
 they do not have the economic resources 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.960
 necessary as you see is absolutely 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.960
 a shame that a country can not be 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.120
 allow then I think it should be 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.130
 assess the student's knowledge of 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.200
 a totally different way to the 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.080
 currently implanted 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.520
 so as the gtm would say in summary 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.290
 what is the question that requires 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.060
 solution in this video why we 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.770
 it costs so damn to get up 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.740
 every day from Monday to Friday at 7 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.720
 the morning I do not think it is to leave your 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.070
 opinions in the comments so 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.570
 says your mother every time 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.700
 get up and keep eating them 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.620
 krispies with eyes closed son 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.210
 You have not slept very little because you spend 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.160
 so many hours the computer looks like you 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.350
 wake up I do not think that's why 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.610
 after going that infernal cry of son 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.500
 wake up since you have to go to 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.750
 school if it puts us done that we do not 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.970
 like to go where we go and if we do not 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.610
 like to go where we go, nothing can give 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.170
 nothing can give off a result to 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.000
 less what it refers of course to the 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.260
 personal knowledge to be able to 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.200
 see beyond or have a criterion 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.570
 simply your goal with arguments 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.950
 obviously but good guys this was 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.570
 the main asset of this video that 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.820
 let be your comments 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.710
 own opinion and well then we'll see you in 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.190
 the next video guys a greeting 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.190
 goodbye
