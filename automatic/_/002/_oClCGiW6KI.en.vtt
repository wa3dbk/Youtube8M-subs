make your dream come true that's

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.280 
make your dream come true that's
actually<00:05:26.840> a<00:05:26.870> good<00:05:26.960> idea<00:05:28.840> so<00:05:29.840> yeah<00:05:29.990> you<00:05:30.200> can

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
actually a good idea so yeah you can

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.230 
actually a good idea so yeah you can
heal<00:05:30.470> your<00:05:30.590> Pokemon<00:05:31.010> here<00:05:31.190> but<00:05:31.730> once<00:05:31.940> you<00:05:32.030> go

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
heal your Pokemon here but once you go

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.510 
heal your Pokemon here but once you go
in<00:05:32.419> there's<00:05:32.900> no<00:05:33.050> turning<00:05:33.440> back<00:05:33.470> and<00:05:34.250> I<00:05:34.340> should

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
in there's no turning back and I should

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.770 
in there's no turning back and I should
probably<00:05:34.580> make<00:05:34.880> the<00:05:35.030> doors<00:05:35.270> up<00:05:35.390> ahead<00:05:35.570> iron

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
probably make the doors up ahead iron

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.200 
probably make the doors up ahead iron
doors<00:05:36.400> back<00:05:38.650> also<00:05:39.650> try<00:05:40.580> to<00:05:40.610> straight<00:05:40.910> up<00:05:41.090> in

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
doors back also try to straight up in

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.120 
doors back also try to straight up in
the<00:05:41.300> levels<00:05:41.600> or<00:05:41.840> so<00:05:42.560> they<00:05:42.680> don't<00:05:42.830> come<00:05:43.010> in

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
the levels or so they don't come in

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.950 
the levels or so they don't come in
early

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.409
