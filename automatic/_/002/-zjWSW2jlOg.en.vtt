00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.890
 how am i nicola magnetic fitch but 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.830
 puntocom dot we are here finally 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.809
 with the htc one 1 I usually do not 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.339
 unboxing because good really I 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.410
 they seem very interesting videos to see 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.150
 I really like it a lot but let's go 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.590
 I have to fulfill a promise I remember 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.210
 that in a comment of a video of 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.430
 youtube that we did asked me 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.650
 specifically that they wanted to see my 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.570
 reaction when you see the htc one screen 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.550
 ix so thank you very much to the people 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.780
 from the common point manager to the one who sent us 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.120
 to sell is good but you will see the review 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.500
 let's move quickly with what 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.420
 is the unboxing we are going to cut very 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.129
 slowly everything that is the film here 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.420
 rest assured that they continue I am 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.190
 signing with a single camera who here 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.929
 it was already and you see everything very far 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.070
 when you open the box and the 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.719
 phone that is quiet that I'm going to 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.339
 show it well up close so why not 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.140
 can see well what the band looks like 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.489
 you know they will not be able to realize 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.319
 exactly how it is given but at least 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.179
 they are going to keep a minimal idea so 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:56.429
 we are going to start with a lot of video 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.379
 cut here we're going to use my scalpel kills 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:01.440
 are seen very chiquititos these 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.140
 infants small but hey I do not think that 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.570
 were they dreaming good we're going to try 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.810
 do it without damaging the box 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:15.030
 so we end up with our fingers measured 2 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:19.440
 for the moment this pod if I do not 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.200
 I'm wrong because the real majority 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.630
 you already know what the one has and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.700
 we are going to open the little box, let's see the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.150
 We are going to go the little box 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.790
 open the good box the fifth attempt 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.970
 we're not going to do it with a little more 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.970
 force 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:51.180
 he does not want the force not to want to leave 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:54.390
 the files it seems that a 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.280
 presentation is basically the one here 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.320
 they were designated saw in a next 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.730
 from another video the least they have now 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.700
 well argento we raise here and we take 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.260
 well the truth quickly deposit 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.970
 Pretty cute with the little plates 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.910
 over so let's see the 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.470
 plastics very quickly really 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.820
 Excuse me, I'm not filming the phone 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.500
 front but I think that 's what I 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.850
 they had asked for me when I 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.960
 did and does not go to the phone itself 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.060
 assumption of first engine and in the 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.860
 phone by arrai film that is to say the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.330
 phone and I was born salary although there is the 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.800
 htc one ex so they can see the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.070
 difference for a shot because our 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.900
 well up close and the thickness if you notice it 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.270
 feels for the finite the one and 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.850
 while I leave it on by turning on the phone 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:43.370
 while granting we are going to battery 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:46.580
 please thanks in the box do not take out 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.170
 this and we have just two htc stickers 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.810
 I do not know so that the calculation that stops with 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.510
 the name so good thing this yes I do not 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.440
 such as headphones and headphones that 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.540
 then also 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.440
 and it got pretty strong and pretty 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.340
 all right 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.040
 let's see later what wave some audio 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.360
 where in reality and good forget the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.190
 accessories created when you guys 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.570
 they are desperate I had to endure 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.400
 all day but above during 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.840
 you putting out the government of the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.890
 other side but only to be able 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.480
 I made the promise 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.130
 and this screen not only what it is 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.840
 resolution and input colors 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.060
 they jump much more than others with him is that 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.860
 I obviously need something 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.350
 well fine but from what I see 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.970
 now pretty well they got a lot 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.260
 the batteries and I really think that up 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.000
 now it does not disappoint comparing it with 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.410
 taiwan is let's see two and 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.360
 quickly what we got the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.160
 we follow headphones is here charger and 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.900
 here the usb cable and here all the 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.820
 manuals those things that nobody interests 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.010
 and goat we will not see specifically 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.290
 the phone we will order these modes 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.000
 quickly when the bags there and 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.739
 this is why we left it behind and now yes 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.150
 let's go into what is the phone 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.709
 and now yes quickly seeing it from 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.780
 front and not even here to configure 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.489
 side I leave the htc one ex for you 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.769
 can see problems the difference what 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.030
 that is more years was etcetera 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.769
 imagine that I am so so 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.910
 desperate and with as many anxieties as 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.959
 you to start seeing everything that is 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.090
 phone so let's give it to 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.739
 forward let's put the password to 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.239
 my wifi and let's continue we're going to 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.620
 give it forward and if they listen 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.540
 background barks excuse me but 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.760
 unfortunately the beloved neighbor left 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.440
 on vacation and left the dog outside 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.940
 puffing up for everyone so good I'm going to 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.109
 hurry up I will not play then in this 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.759
 moment 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.439
 touches and next I do not care if I have to 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.969
 be before one because if I want that 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:30.189
 march with reese because change it does not happen 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:33.069
 nothing and here at least we see the home 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:34.419
 Of course, really imagine yourself 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.650
 that I did not have any experience with 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.569
 the phone so I really do not know 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.129
 absolutely nothing that is interface 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.259
 I was obviously watching other reviews 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:43.000
 but I do not know how to use third party like that 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.379
 what problems do not wait, we do not see 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.389
 here we have the displacement 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:48.370
 vertical and the truth that what is the 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.229
 panel so far what we were very 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.150
 quickly what is impressive is 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.310
 see say not only in definition as 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.110
 we saw with that 4 the colors in seem 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.060
 very good the same is basically as if 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.490
 outside the panel of the one ex that we have it 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.020
 here only that good with the 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.490
 1080p resolution and let's see by 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.039
 course afterwards what is the sun 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.270
 as seen in brightness levels and so on 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.009
 etcetera or something busy that I can 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.689
 to know how to say at this moment is that 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.219
 at least without having loaded it with anything 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:13.930
 it works very fluid and sure that more one 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:16.659
 of you want to see how the theme comes 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.759
 from the camera to see what he says to me 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.199
 download several things to look but force to 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.270
 move to the front camera town walks 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.129
 do from top to bottom and the show and 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.910
 I have it here so he took the touch we are going to 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:29.360
 remove own focuses 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.890
 oh well the speed with which it is is 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.090
 impressive to see will make 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.480
 times 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.360
 no no 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.630
 that's why we have a vast improvement with what 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:45.180
 that was the camera of the one and we go to the 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.180
 load that is appreciated enough 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:55.139
 there are changes and obviously it is faster and 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:59.330
 wang because really besides almost to the 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.330
 same time we are going to do 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.970
 let's do it again 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.639
 there is the time difference in what 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.320
 which is video after going testing well 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.600
 because if such massu do not interest them 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.160
 know is the album sound theme and that 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.050
 really now check it because no 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.120
 I have nothing with sound so I really 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.500
 I prefer to make them wait a little bit and 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.910
 then watch a well complete video and 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.470
 well done of course because that's 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.660
 said totally broadcast as they were given 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.250
 account so I'm nicolás filman de 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.050
 techno under the world world this was a 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.700
 shows recontra super mega fast what 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.990
 what is the htc one with the unboxing 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.419
 showing at least my face and my 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.220
 reaction watching the panel what is the 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.690
 phone design so see you in 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.669
 next videos and of course after 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.669
 in the full radius of the htc one
