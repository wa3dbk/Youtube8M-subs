00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
lots of free mass videos this one's

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.310 
lots of free mass videos this one's
about<00:00:07.529> finding<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.429> highest<00:00:08.820> common<00:00:09.150> factor

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
about finding the highest common factor

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.919 
about finding the highest common factor
or<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.380> hcf<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:12.179> lowest<00:00:12.570> common<00:00:12.809> multiple

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
or the hcf the lowest common multiple

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.460 
or the hcf the lowest common multiple
otherwise<00:00:13.710> known<00:00:14.040> as<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.250> LCM<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.470> prime

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
otherwise known as the LCM and prime

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.439 
otherwise known as the LCM and prime
numbers<00:00:17.130> I'm<00:00:17.430> going<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.670> begin<00:00:17.789> with<00:00:18.090> prime

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
numbers I'm going to begin with prime

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.720 
numbers I'm going to begin with prime
numbers<00:00:18.930> because<00:00:19.439> they<00:00:20.039> actually<00:00:20.340> help<00:00:20.550> you

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
numbers because they actually help you

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.210 
numbers because they actually help you
work<00:00:20.970> out<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.449> hcf<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.080> LCM<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.859> need<00:00:23.070> to

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
work out the hcf in LCM so you need to

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.370 
work out the hcf in LCM so you need to
know<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> little<00:00:23.580> bit<00:00:23.760> about<00:00:23.970> these<00:00:24.240> first<00:00:24.660> so

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
know a little bit about these first so

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.920 
know a little bit about these first so
here<00:00:25.740> are<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.980> couple<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.640> prime<00:00:26.939> numbers<00:00:26.970> and

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
here are a couple of prime numbers and

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.660 
here are a couple of prime numbers and
what<00:00:28.080> they<00:00:28.230> all<00:00:28.439> have<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.830> common<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.580> that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
what they all have in common is that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.799 
what they all have in common is that
they<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.330> no<00:00:30.990> factors<00:00:31.830> except<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.640> course

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
they have no factors except of course

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.090 
they have no factors except of course
themselves<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.960> one<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.380> any<00:00:34.590> other<00:00:34.800> number

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
themselves and one like any other number

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.310 
themselves and one like any other number
does<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.489> here<00:00:35.700> are<00:00:35.850> two<00:00:36.059> prime<00:00:36.809> numbers<00:00:36.840> are

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
does so here are two prime numbers are

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.319 
does so here are two prime numbers are
stuck<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:37.860> side<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.399> each<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:39.000> them<00:00:39.090> only

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
stuck on one side and each of them only

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.360 
stuck on one side and each of them only
have<00:00:39.600> themselves<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:40.910> their<00:00:41.910> factors

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
have themselves and one as their factors

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.819 
have themselves and one as their factors
okay<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.879> that's<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.840> you'll<00:00:46.260> notice<00:00:46.649> of

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
okay so that's that and you'll notice of

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.090 
okay so that's that and you'll notice of
course<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.510> prime<00:00:48.989> number<00:00:49.100> even

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
course one is not a prime number even

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.060 
course one is not a prime number even
though<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.399> fulfills<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.469> requirement<00:00:52.469> and

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
though it fulfills this requirement and

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.700 
though it fulfills this requirement and
that's<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:53.899> prime<00:00:54.899> numbers<00:00:55.469> actually

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that's because prime numbers actually

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.400 
that's because prime numbers actually
have<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> special<00:00:56.699> job<00:00:57.000> again<00:00:57.840> you'll<00:00:58.020> see<00:00:58.260> that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
have a special job again you'll see that

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.500 
have a special job again you'll see that
in<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> minute<00:00:58.710> basically<00:00:59.370> they<00:00:59.879> are<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
in a minute basically they are the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.720 
in a minute basically they are the
building<00:01:00.840> blocks<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:01.800> numbers<00:01:02.129> so

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
building blocks of all numbers so

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.789 
building blocks of all numbers so
they're<00:01:02.940> times<00:01:03.300> together<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:04.199> make<00:01:04.470> other

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
they're times together to make other

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.590 
they're times together to make other
bigger<00:01:05.549> numbers<00:01:06.030> now<00:01:06.330> if<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.750> one<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
bigger numbers now if you have one as a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.870 
bigger numbers now if you have one as a
prime<00:01:09.600> number<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.470> he<00:01:10.710> times<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.220> by<00:01:11.460> another

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
prime number and he times it by another

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.730 
prime number and he times it by another
prime<00:01:12.390> P<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:13.080> doesn't<00:01:13.470> actually<00:01:13.560> change

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
prime P it doesn't actually change

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.429 
prime P it doesn't actually change
anything<00:01:14.340> x<00:01:15.180> mean<00:01:15.390> by<00:01:15.509> one<00:01:15.750> does<00:01:15.930> nothing<00:01:16.290> so

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
anything x mean by one does nothing so

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.859 
anything x mean by one does nothing so
that's<00:01:16.650> why<00:01:17.090> one<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.270> not<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.479> prime<00:01:18.840> number

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
that's why one is not a prime number

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.690 
that's why one is not a prime number
because<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.860> really<00:01:20.189> much<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.549> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
because it is not really much of a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.700 
because it is not really much of a
building<00:01:21.180> block<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.420> other<00:01:21.750> numbers<00:01:22.200> when

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
building block for other numbers when

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.140 
building block for other numbers when
you<00:01:22.740> times<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.280> together<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.759> make<00:01:23.909> another

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you times it together to make another

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.149 
you times it together to make another
number<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.170> really<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.950> let's

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
number so that's that really so let's

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.789 
number so that's that really so let's
talk<00:01:26.280> about<00:01:26.369> finding<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.299> hcf<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.080> LCM<00:01:28.500> in

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
talk about finding the hcf and LCM in

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.100 
talk about finding the hcf and LCM in
this<00:01:29.130> example<00:01:29.610> 4<00:01:30.180> 12<00:01:30.570> 18<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.409> 24<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:33.110> what

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
this example 4 12 18 and 24 now what

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.620 
this example 4 12 18 and 24 now what
does<00:01:34.229> hcf<00:01:34.799> stand<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.670> highest<00:01:36.299> common<00:01:36.600> factor

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
does hcf stand for highest common factor

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.140 
does hcf stand for highest common factor
what<00:01:37.259> does<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.500> mean<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.460> means<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
what does that mean it just means the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.270 
what does that mean it just means the
biggest<00:01:39.540> factor<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.470> goes<00:01:40.710> into<00:01:40.979> all<00:01:41.250> of

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
biggest factor that goes into all of

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.300 
biggest factor that goes into all of
these<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.090> factor<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.750> 12<00:01:43.049> 18<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.560> 24<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.070> to

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
these so a factor of 12 18 and 24 is to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.800 
these so a factor of 12 18 and 24 is to
for<00:01:44.549> example<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.210> not<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.390> biggest

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
for example but it's not the biggest

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.469 
for example but it's not the biggest
factor<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.619> what<00:01:46.740> does<00:01:46.829> LCM<00:01:47.399> mean<00:01:47.729> well<00:01:48.329> it's

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
factor and what does LCM mean well it's

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.300 
factor and what does LCM mean well it's
the<00:01:48.600> lowest<00:01:48.990> common<00:01:49.320> multiple<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:50.130> means

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the lowest common multiple that means

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.670 
the lowest common multiple that means
the<00:01:50.430> lowest<00:01:50.850> multiple<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.140> common<00:01:52.530> to

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the lowest multiple that is common to

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.990 
the lowest multiple that is common to
all<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.920> these<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.869> what<00:01:54.869> does<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.020> mean<00:01:55.409> well

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
all of these so what does that mean well

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.450 
all of these so what does that mean well
let's<00:01:57.000> say<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.479> 12<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.990> 18<00:01:58.140> for<00:01:58.320> now<00:01:58.710> not

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
let's say just for 12 and 18 for now not

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.859 
let's say just for 12 and 18 for now not
common<00:01:59.820> multiple<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.369> 36<00:02:02.369> okay<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.450> a

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
common multiple of that is 36 okay so a

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.190 
common multiple of that is 36 okay so a
multiple<00:02:04.590> 12<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.310> 36<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.240> motor<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.689> 18<00:02:07.049> is

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
multiple 12 is 36 in a motor of 18 is

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.760 
multiple 12 is 36 in a motor of 18 is
also<00:02:07.590> 36<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:08.670> that's<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:09.000> common<00:02:09.330> multiple<00:02:09.840> what

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
also 36 so that's a common multiple what

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.199 
also 36 so that's a common multiple what
we<00:02:10.920> want<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.250> do<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.489> something<00:02:11.819> even<00:02:12.000> more

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
we want to do is something even more

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.700 
we want to do is something even more
complicated<00:02:12.690> we<00:02:12.870> want<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.170> lower

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
complicated we want the lower

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.820 
complicated we want the lower
a<00:02:14.010> multiple<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:15.060> all<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.990> these<00:02:16.110> three<00:02:16.620> numbers

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
a multiple of all of these three numbers

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.550 
a multiple of all of these three numbers
so<00:02:17.520> let's<00:02:17.760> go<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.330> do<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.380> first

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
so let's go and do that so the first

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.260 
so let's go and do that so the first
thing<00:02:19.650> we<00:02:19.800> need<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.980> do<00:02:20.130> break<00:02:20.640> down<00:02:20.940> our

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
thing we need to do break down our

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.020 
thing we need to do break down our
numbers<00:02:21.630> are<00:02:21.660> 12<00:02:22.500> 18<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:22.980> 24<00:02:23.460> can<00:02:23.670> be<00:02:23.790> broken

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
numbers are 12 18 and 24 can be broken

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.820 
numbers are 12 18 and 24 can be broken
down<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:25.280> into<00:02:26.840> multiples<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:28.290> prime

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
down like this into multiples of prime

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.450 
down like this into multiples of prime
numbers<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.970> 12<00:02:30.440> let's<00:02:31.440> say<00:02:31.560> 24<00:02:32.100> let's<00:02:32.310> take<00:02:32.430> a

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
numbers so 12 let's say 24 let's take a

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.110 
numbers so 12 let's say 24 let's take a
big<00:02:32.700> one<00:02:33.200> 24<00:02:34.200> can<00:02:34.440> be<00:02:34.530> broken<00:02:34.770> down<00:02:35.220> into<00:02:35.400> say

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
big one 24 can be broken down into say

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.420 
big one 24 can be broken down into say
12<00:02:36.450> times<00:02:36.660> 2<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.140> could<00:02:37.620> have<00:02:37.710> done<00:02:37.800> six<00:02:38.160> times

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
12 times 2 I could have done six times

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.300 
12 times 2 I could have done six times
for<00:02:38.700> for<00:02:38.970> example<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.950> doesn't<00:02:41.130> really

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
for for example but it doesn't really

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.680 
for for example but it doesn't really
matter<00:02:41.520> how<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:41.850> break<00:02:42.180> them<00:02:42.360> down<00:02:42.390> because

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
matter how you break them down because

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.230 
matter how you break them down because
you<00:02:42.930> end<00:02:43.140> up<00:02:43.320> with<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.590> same<00:02:43.850> prime<00:02:44.850> factors

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
you end up with the same prime factors

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.630 
you end up with the same prime factors
at<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.230> end<00:02:46.350> which<00:02:46.710> is<00:02:46.860> what<00:02:47.010> we're<00:02:47.160> looking

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
at the end which is what we're looking

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.600 
at the end which is what we're looking
to<00:02:47.820> get<00:02:48.270> at<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.630> end<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.620> 24<00:02:50.430> equals

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
to get at the end of this so 24 equals

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.780 
to get at the end of this so 24 equals
12<00:02:51.000> x<00:02:51.240> 22<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:51.960> a<00:02:52.050> prime<00:02:52.380> number<00:02:52.740> so<00:02:53.460> you<00:02:53.550> can't

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
12 x 22 is a prime number so you can't

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.690 
12 x 22 is a prime number so you can't
really<00:02:53.850> be<00:02:54.180> broken<00:02:54.660> down<00:02:54.690> into<00:02:55.100> new<00:02:56.100> factors

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
really be broken down into new factors

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.060 
really be broken down into new factors
because<00:02:57.660> prime<00:02:58.110> numbers<00:02:58.440> only<00:02:58.560> break<00:02:58.860> down

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
because prime numbers only break down

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.860 
because prime numbers only break down
into<00:02:59.280> themselves<00:02:59.550> and<00:03:00.120> one<00:03:00.270> as<00:03:00.480> we<00:03:00.690> said

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
into themselves and one as we said

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.430 
into themselves and one as we said
earlier<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:01.320> so<00:03:01.950> 24<00:03:02.490> equals<00:03:02.640> 12<00:03:03.060> x<00:03:03.270> 22<00:03:04.020> can't<00:03:04.320> be

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
earlier on so 24 equals 12 x 22 can't be

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.560 
earlier on so 24 equals 12 x 22 can't be
broken<00:03:04.590> down<00:03:04.800> circle<00:03:05.460> it<00:03:05.580> looks<00:03:06.150> like<00:03:06.270> a<00:03:06.300> full

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
broken down circle it looks like a full

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.590 
broken down circle it looks like a full
stop<00:03:06.900> 12<00:03:07.620> can<00:03:08.340> be<00:03:08.460> broken<00:03:08.670> down<00:03:08.820> two<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.270> three

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
stop 12 can be broken down two to three

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.500 
stop 12 can be broken down two to three
times<00:03:09.630> four<00:03:10.170> again<00:03:10.830> as<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.850> said<00:03:11.880> earlier<00:03:12.060> on<00:03:12.480> I

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
times four again as I said earlier on I

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.900 
times four again as I said earlier on I
can<00:03:12.780> pick<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:13.140> two<00:03:13.200> numbers<00:03:13.830> at<00:03:13.980> times<00:03:14.220> 28<00:03:14.580> 12

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
can pick a two numbers at times 28 12

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.370 
can pick a two numbers at times 28 12
because<00:03:15.360> at<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.690> end<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.930> get<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.140> same

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
because at the end you get the same

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.340 
because at the end you get the same
factors<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.550> 12<00:03:17.880> me<00:03:17.970> because<00:03:18.120> 3<00:03:18.330> times<00:03:18.540> 4<00:03:18.840> 3

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
factors so 12 me because 3 times 4 3

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.280 
factors so 12 me because 3 times 4 3
can't<00:03:19.590> be<00:03:19.680> broken<00:03:19.860> down<00:03:20.040> circlet<00:03:20.850> 4<00:03:21.600> equals<00:03:22.110> 2

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
can't be broken down circlet 4 equals 2

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.440 
can't be broken down circlet 4 equals 2
times<00:03:22.320> 2<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.310> circle<00:03:23.760> each<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:24.060> those<00:03:24.180> because

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
times 2 and circle each of those because

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.140 
times 2 and circle each of those because
they<00:03:24.600> also<00:03:24.780> prime<00:03:25.290> numbers<00:03:26.070> so<00:03:26.460> basically<00:03:26.820> 24

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
they also prime numbers so basically 24

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.130 
they also prime numbers so basically 24
equals<00:03:27.750> 2<00:03:28.140> times<00:03:28.170> 2<00:03:28.700> times<00:03:29.700> 2<00:03:29.880> times<00:03:30.390> 3<00:03:30.750> as<00:03:30.960> I've

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
equals 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 as I've

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.930 
equals 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 as I've
written<00:03:31.290> here<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.520> actually

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
written here and that is actually

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.540 
written here and that is actually
writing<00:03:33.300> 24<00:03:33.990> as<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.170> product<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.740> prime<00:03:35.040> factors

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
writing 24 as a product of prime factors

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.210 
writing 24 as a product of prime factors
a<00:03:35.730> very<00:03:36.180> important<00:03:36.720> sentence<00:03:37.230> because<00:03:37.680> that's

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
a very important sentence because that's

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.270 
a very important sentence because that's
what<00:03:38.400> they<00:03:38.550> asked<00:03:38.820> for<00:03:39.000> in<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:40.110> GCSE<00:03:40.740> often<00:03:41.100> as

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
what they asked for in the GCSE often as

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.780 
what they asked for in the GCSE often as
a<00:03:41.460> give<00:03:42.150> 24<00:03:43.080> or<00:03:43.320> whatever<00:03:43.590> as<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:44.190> product<00:03:44.580> of

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
a give 24 or whatever as a product of

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.520 
a give 24 or whatever as a product of
its<00:03:44.940> prime<00:03:45.210> factors<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:45.990> that<00:03:46.140> means<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.440> have

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
its prime factors so that means you have

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.290 
its prime factors so that means you have
to<00:03:46.560> use<00:03:46.920> this<00:03:47.040> factor<00:03:47.430> tree<00:03:47.700> break<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.120> down

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
to use this factor tree break it down

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.960 
to use this factor tree break it down
and<00:03:48.600> do<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.410> basically<00:03:49.800> and<00:03:50.160> sometimes<00:03:50.820> they

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
and do that basically and sometimes they

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.020 
and do that basically and sometimes they
ask<00:03:51.150> for<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:52.680> product<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.310> powers<00:03:53.490> of<00:03:53.850> prime

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
ask for the product of powers of prime

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.660 
ask for the product of powers of prime
factors<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:54.780> writing<00:03:55.440> 24<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.220> product<00:03:56.610> a

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
factors so writing 24 is a product a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.420 
factors so writing 24 is a product a
part<00:03:56.970> of<00:03:57.120> its<00:03:57.330> of<00:03:57.630> its<00:03:58.140> power<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.620> prime

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
part of its of its power the prime

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.790 
part of its of its power the prime
factors<00:03:59.970> would<00:04:00.480> be<00:04:00.720> writing<00:04:01.110> it<00:04:01.410> like<00:04:01.440> this

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
factors would be writing it like this

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.590 
factors would be writing it like this
because<00:04:02.040> 2<00:04:02.370> times<00:04:02.400> 2<00:04:02.760> times<00:04:02.910> 2<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:03.180> just<00:04:03.450> T

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
because 2 times 2 times 2 is just T

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.540 
because 2 times 2 times 2 is just T
cubed<00:04:04.020> so<00:04:04.530> it's<00:04:04.650> just<00:04:04.830> a<00:04:04.950> short<00:04:05.220> way<00:04:05.400> of

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
cubed so it's just a short way of

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.190 
cubed so it's just a short way of
writing<00:04:06.000> this<00:04:06.030> thing<00:04:06.300> you<00:04:06.960> write<00:04:07.170> that

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
writing this thing you write that

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.300 
writing this thing you write that
instead<00:04:07.710> so<00:04:08.190> anyway<00:04:08.490> so<00:04:08.550> we<00:04:08.850> broken<00:04:09.120> down<00:04:09.600> or

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
instead so anyway so we broken down or

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.150 
instead so anyway so we broken down or
numbers<00:04:11.310> or<00:04:11.490> 12<00:04:11.820> 18<00:04:12.270> and<00:04:12.390> 24<00:04:12.870> into<00:04:13.350> its<00:04:13.560> prime

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
numbers or 12 18 and 24 into its prime

I've<00:04:16.470> listed<00:04:16.710> is<00:04:17.040> product<00:04:17.700> for<00:04:17.850> pipe<00:04:18.060> powers

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
I've listed is product for pipe powers

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.950 
I've listed is product for pipe powers
of<00:04:19.109> prime<00:04:19.380> factors<00:04:19.799> as<00:04:19.920> well<00:04:19.950> underneath<00:04:20.960> and

of prime factors as well underneath and

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.280 
of prime factors as well underneath and
then<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.320> stick<00:04:22.620> those<00:04:23.330> prime<00:04:24.330> factors<00:04:24.960> in

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
then you stick those prime factors in

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.500 
then you stick those prime factors in
rows<00:04:26.190> like<00:04:26.669> this<00:04:27.030> yeah

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
rows like this yeah

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.020

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
factors go there and what you do as you

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.540 
factors go there and what you do as you
might<00:04:38.430> notice<00:04:38.670> is<00:04:39.660> put<00:04:40.500> them<00:04:40.620> in<00:04:40.740> nice<00:04:40.980> columns

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
might notice is put them in nice columns

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.420 
might notice is put them in nice columns
of<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.450> same<00:04:42.660> numbers<00:04:43.080> so<00:04:43.290> I<00:04:43.320> try<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.710> complete

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
of the same numbers so I try to complete

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.190 
of the same numbers so I try to complete
the<00:04:44.640> column<00:04:44.910> of<00:04:44.970> two's<00:04:45.210> they<00:04:45.480> try<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.020> complete

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
the column of two's they try to complete

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.590 
the column of two's they try to complete
the<00:04:46.800> column<00:04:47.070> of<00:04:47.190> 3s<00:04:47.490> there<00:04:47.820> it's<00:04:48.270> not<00:04:48.390> always

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
the column of 3s there it's not always

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.030 
the column of 3s there it's not always
possible<00:04:48.900> because<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:49.470> might<00:04:49.650> not<00:04:49.770> have

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
possible because you might not have

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.330 
possible because you might not have
enough<00:04:50.220> cheese<00:04:50.580> for<00:04:50.640> example<00:04:51.390> in<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.960> 18<00:04:52.350> to

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
enough cheese for example in the 18 to

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.680 
enough cheese for example in the 18 to
complete<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.820> column<00:04:54.060> of<00:04:54.150> two's<00:04:54.360> there

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
complete the column of two's there

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.190 
complete the column of two's there
that's<00:04:55.080> quite<00:04:55.350> obvious<00:04:55.500> and<00:04:56.630> once<00:04:57.630> I've<00:04:57.930> done

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
that's quite obvious and once I've done

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.500 
that's quite obvious and once I've done
that<00:04:58.260> I<00:04:59.750> I<00:05:00.750> can<00:05:01.230> see<00:05:01.530> that<00:05:02.180> wherever<00:05:03.180> there's<00:05:03.420> a

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
that I I can see that wherever there's a

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.360 
that I I can see that wherever there's a
complete<00:05:03.810> column<00:05:04.290> of<00:05:04.410> two's<00:05:04.650> I<00:05:04.890> put<00:05:05.070> it<00:05:05.160> to<00:05:05.190> the

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
complete column of two's I put it to the

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.430 
complete column of two's I put it to the
complete<00:05:06.180> con<00:05:06.360> of<00:05:06.480> the<00:05:06.570> three<00:05:06.810> is<00:05:06.870> about<00:05:07.140> three

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
complete con of the three is about three

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.920 
complete con of the three is about three
there<00:05:07.770> and<00:05:07.980> so<00:05:08.640> wherever<00:05:09.480> I've<00:05:09.750> got<00:05:09.900> a

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
there and so wherever I've got a

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.410 
there and so wherever I've got a
complete<00:05:10.260> columns<00:05:10.620> I<00:05:10.800> put<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.330> number<00:05:12.330> above

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
complete columns I put the number above

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.020 
complete columns I put the number above
it<00:05:12.780> that<00:05:12.810> belongs<00:05:13.320> to<00:05:13.650> that<00:05:13.920> column<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.430> so

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
it that belongs to that column and so

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.030 
it that belongs to that column and so
hcf<00:05:16.020> is<00:05:16.320> just<00:05:16.560> a<00:05:16.710> multiple<00:05:17.400> or<00:05:18.650> those<00:05:19.650> two

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
hcf is just a multiple or those two

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.850 
hcf is just a multiple or those two
numbers<00:05:20.730> time<00:05:21.150> together<00:05:21.420> so<00:05:21.990> two<00:05:22.350> times<00:05:22.380> three

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
numbers time together so two times three

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.600 
numbers time together so two times three
is<00:05:22.890> six<00:05:23.600> ok<00:05:24.600> now<00:05:24.990> hcf<00:05:25.530> is<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.740> lot<00:05:26.010> more<00:05:26.160> simple

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
is six ok now hcf is a lot more simple

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.970 
is six ok now hcf is a lot more simple
wherever<00:05:26.970> there<00:05:27.540> is<00:05:27.570> a<00:05:27.690> number<00:05:27.870> at<00:05:28.200> all<00:05:28.440> forget

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
wherever there is a number at all forget

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.620 
wherever there is a number at all forget
if<00:05:29.100> there's<00:05:29.280> a<00:05:29.370> complete<00:05:29.760> column<00:05:30.120> or<00:05:30.240> not<00:05:30.390> I

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
if there's a complete column or not I

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.540 
if there's a complete column or not I
just<00:05:31.050> times<00:05:31.350> those<00:05:31.620> numbers<00:05:31.980> together<00:05:32.100> so

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
just times those numbers together so

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.670 
just times those numbers together so
there's<00:05:33.090> a<00:05:33.180> couple<00:05:33.390> of<00:05:33.570> teased<00:05:33.780> a<00:05:33.990> purty<00:05:34.500> tho

there's a couple of teased a purty tho

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.380 
there's a couple of teased a purty tho
those<00:05:34.890> twos<00:05:35.160> there<00:05:35.460> but<00:05:35.670> you<00:05:35.880> know<00:05:35.910> three<00:05:36.330> is

those twos there but you know three is

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.360 
those twos there but you know three is

there a bit three there there's a single
three<00:05:38.730> they're<00:05:38.940> still<00:05:39.240> put<00:05:39.480> three<00:05:39.750> there<00:05:39.990> a

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
three times three times two gives me 72

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.270 
three times three times two gives me 72
which<00:05:54.930> is<00:05:55.170> the<00:05:55.320> LCM<00:05:55.950> for<00:05:56.640> 12<00:05:57.600> 18<00:05:58.110> and<00:05:58.410> 24<00:05:58.950> and

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
which is the LCM for 12 18 and 24 and

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.840 
which is the LCM for 12 18 and 24 and
that's<00:06:00.150> that<00:06:00.330> so<00:06:00.720> just<00:06:01.260> in<00:06:01.410> case<00:06:01.620> you<00:06:02.580> don't

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
that's that so just in case you don't

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.910 
that's that so just in case you don't
have<00:06:02.970> say<00:06:03.360> three<00:06:03.750> numbers<00:06:04.140> you<00:06:04.560> know<00:06:04.680> you<00:06:04.770> just

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
have say three numbers you know you just

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.650 
have say three numbers you know you just
have<00:06:05.190> to<00:06:05.310> have<00:06:05.340> at<00:06:05.550> least<00:06:05.610> two<00:06:06.060> numbers<00:06:06.480> to

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
have to have at least two numbers to

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.800 
have to have at least two numbers to
find<00:06:06.900> the<00:06:06.990> hco<00:06:07.410> hcf<00:06:08.310> and<00:06:08.520> LCM<00:06:08.940> for<00:06:09.600> them

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
find the hco hcf and LCM for them

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.730 
find the hco hcf and LCM for them
because<00:06:10.760> hcs<00:06:11.760> sounds<00:06:12.120> for<00:06:12.270> highest<00:06:13.050> common

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
because hcs sounds for highest common

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.200 
because hcs sounds for highest common
factor<00:06:13.770> right<00:06:14.490> so<00:06:14.760> you<00:06:14.820> have<00:06:14.970> to<00:06:15.120> have

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
factor right so you have to have

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.420 
factor right so you have to have
something<00:06:15.990> common<00:06:16.530> between<00:06:16.710> at<00:06:17.130> least<00:06:17.160> two

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
something common between at least two

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.010 
something common between at least two
numbers<00:06:17.850> you<00:06:17.970> kind<00:06:18.180> of<00:06:18.270> common<00:06:18.630> number

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
numbers you kind of common number

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.650 
numbers you kind of common number
between<00:06:19.530> just<00:06:19.950> one<00:06:20.160> number<00:06:20.310> itself<00:06:20.820> right<00:06:21.150> so

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
between just one number itself right so

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.590 
between just one number itself right so
say<00:06:21.900> I<00:06:23.360> forget<00:06:24.360> this<00:06:24.630> thing<00:06:24.960> here<00:06:25.350> ok<00:06:26.600> so

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
say I forget this thing here ok so

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.650 
say I forget this thing here ok so
there's<00:06:28.170> only<00:06:28.700> 12<00:06:29.700> and<00:06:30.000> 18<00:06:30.180> though<00:06:30.600> i'm

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
there's only 12 and 18 though i'm

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.300 
there's only 12 and 18 though i'm
talking<00:06:31.020> about<00:06:31.050> i<00:06:31.200> want<00:06:31.380> to<00:06:31.500> find<00:06:31.740> i<00:06:31.920> want<00:06:32.190> to

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
talking about i want to find i want to

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.640 
talking about i want to find i want to
find<00:06:32.490> out<00:06:32.670> the<00:06:32.700> highest<00:06:33.150> common<00:06:33.450> factor<00:06:33.650> for

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
find out the highest common factor for

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.330 
find out the highest common factor for
just<00:06:35.580> 12<00:06:35.910> and<00:06:36.240> 18<00:06:36.360> and<00:06:36.870> the<00:06:37.200> LCM<00:06:37.680> 4<00:06:37.860> 12<00:06:38.070> and<00:06:38.130> 18

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
just 12 and 18 and the LCM 4 12 and 18

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.670 
just 12 and 18 and the LCM 4 12 and 18
ok<00:06:39.180> that<00:06:39.630> I<00:06:39.660> mean<00:06:39.840> so<00:06:40.050> then<00:06:40.200> you<00:06:40.290> got<00:06:40.470> these

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
ok that I mean so then you got these

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.210 
ok that I mean so then you got these
teen<00:06:40.950> on

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
teen on

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.460 
teen on
which<00:06:41.490> means<00:06:41.850> I<00:06:42.210> don't<00:06:42.480> have<00:06:42.720> this<00:06:43.140> row

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
which means I don't have this row

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.030 
which means I don't have this row
anymore<00:06:44.060> okay<00:06:45.060> and<00:06:45.590> what<00:06:46.590> else<00:06:46.650> does<00:06:47.010> it

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
anymore okay and what else does it

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.420 
anymore okay and what else does it
change<00:06:47.370> well<00:06:49.160> I've<00:06:50.160> got<00:06:50.220> still<00:06:50.880> to<00:06:51.510> complete

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
change well I've got still to complete

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.770 
change well I've got still to complete
columns<00:06:53.430> a<00:06:53.640> complete<00:06:54.000> column<00:06:54.300> of<00:06:54.420> two<00:06:54.570> in<00:06:54.720> a

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
columns a complete column of two in a

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.240 
columns a complete column of two in a
complete<00:06:55.140> column<00:06:55.410> three<00:06:55.680> so<00:06:55.830> that<00:06:55.950> doesn't

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
complete column three so that doesn't

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.220 
complete column three so that doesn't
change<00:06:56.310> so<00:06:56.910> the<00:06:57.030> hcf<00:06:57.450> is<00:06:57.600> two<00:06:57.810> or<00:06:57.900> two<00:06:58.020> times

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.230 
change so the hcf is two or two times

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.740 
change so the hcf is two or two times
three<00:06:58.530> to<00:06:58.800> six<00:06:59.100> okay<00:06:59.970> but<00:07:00.360> does<00:07:00.540> anything

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750 
three to six okay but does anything

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.890 
three to six okay but does anything
change<00:07:00.930> for<00:07:01.440> the<00:07:01.530> LCM<00:07:02.010> well<00:07:02.520> that<00:07:03.090> tues<00:07:03.480> gone

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
change for the LCM well that tues gone

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.200 
change for the LCM well that tues gone
so<00:07:04.410> that<00:07:04.560> means<00:07:04.770> that<00:07:05.010> too<00:07:05.280> is<00:07:05.430> gone<00:07:05.700> but

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
so that means that too is gone but

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.420 
so that means that too is gone but
otherwise<00:07:06.480> that<00:07:06.930> three<00:07:07.230> we<00:07:07.680> gave<00:07:07.890> that<00:07:07.920> three

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
otherwise that three we gave that three

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.120 
otherwise that three we gave that three
those<00:07:09.060> threes<00:07:09.450> games<00:07:09.720> at<00:07:09.900> three<00:07:10.230> that<00:07:10.590> too<00:07:10.860> can

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.130 
those threes games at three that too can

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.520 
those threes games at three that too can
give<00:07:11.370> that<00:07:11.400> T<00:07:11.790> still<00:07:12.120> and<00:07:12.420> those<00:07:12.930> tears<00:07:13.260> give

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 
give that T still and those tears give

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.550 
give that T still and those tears give
that<00:07:13.710> too<00:07:13.950> so<00:07:14.400> the<00:07:15.270> difference<00:07:15.780> is<00:07:16.140> that<00:07:16.200> the

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 
that too so the difference is that the

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.980 
that too so the difference is that the
LCM<00:07:16.950> is<00:07:17.040> an<00:07:17.160> hour<00:07:17.280> 2<00:07:17.490> times<00:07:17.790> 2<00:07:18.030> times<00:07:18.300> 3<00:07:18.600> times<00:07:18.630> 3

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990 
LCM is an hour 2 times 2 times 3 times 3

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:26.270 
LCM is an hour 2 times 2 times 3 times 3
which<00:07:19.440> is<00:07:19.920> now<00:07:20.570> 36<00:07:21.570> can<00:07:21.870> I<00:07:21.900> write<00:07:22.200> that<00:07:23.750> 36<00:07:25.280> and

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 
which is now 36 can I write that 36 and

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.730 
which is now 36 can I write that 36 and
that's<00:07:26.520> it<00:07:26.670> really<00:07:26.880> that's<00:07:27.810> the<00:07:28.020> that's<00:07:28.380> how

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 
that's it really that's the that's how

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.820 
that's it really that's the that's how
to<00:07:28.800> find<00:07:29.130> out<00:07:29.340> the<00:07:29.490> hcf<00:07:29.940> and<00:07:30.120> LCM<00:07:30.600> of<00:07:30.870> different

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:31.830 
to find out the hcf and LCM of different

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.220 
to find out the hcf and LCM of different
numbers
