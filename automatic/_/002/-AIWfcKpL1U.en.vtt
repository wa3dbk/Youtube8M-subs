kind of clean up their ship if you will
and<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:02.670> caused<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.909> bit<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.329> stir<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:03.780> then

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
and that caused a bit of a stir but then

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.440 
and that caused a bit of a stir but then
kind<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.229> just<00:02:04.439> went<00:02:04.619> away<00:02:04.969> and<00:02:05.969> so

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
kind of just went away and so

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.279 
kind of just went away and so
essentially<00:02:07.170> now<00:02:07.350> if<00:02:07.649> Disney<00:02:08.190> purchases

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
essentially now if Disney purchases

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.820 
essentially now if Disney purchases
maker<00:02:10.289> then<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:12.260> lot<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.500> you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830

they they have an interactive division
which<00:04:48.570> they<00:04:48.720> can<00:04:48.870> then<00:04:48.900> offer<00:04:49.200> partnerships

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
which they can then offer partnerships

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.450 
which they can then offer partnerships
or<00:04:50.130> offer<00:04:50.310> promotions<00:04:50.640> to<00:04:51.180> their<00:04:51.330> users<00:04:51.510> right

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
or offer promotions to their users right

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.380 
or offer promotions to their users right
and<00:04:53.460> then<00:04:53.670> give<00:04:53.940> them<00:04:54.120> a<00:04:54.180> higher<00:04:54.540> rpm<00:04:56.090> /<00:04:57.090> you

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
and then give them a higher rpm / you

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.970 
and then give them a higher rpm / you
know<00:04:57.510> which<00:04:57.660> is<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:57.810> think<00:04:57.900> rpm<00:04:58.470> is<00:04:58.560> basically

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
know which is I think rpm is basically

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.590 
know which is I think rpm is basically
per<00:04:59.160> thousand<00:04:59.610> views<00:04:59.640> you<00:04:59.940> get<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.090> set<00:05:00.480> amount

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
per thousand views you get a set amount

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.500 
per thousand views you get a set amount
of<00:05:00.810> money<00:05:00.930> per<00:05:01.020> thousand<00:05:01.530> views<00:05:01.700> and<00:05:02.700> then<00:05:03.090> you

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
of money per thousand views and then you

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.780 
of money per thousand views and then you
get<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.140> different<00:05:04.260> you<00:05:04.740> know<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:05.070> copy<00:05:05.610> you

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
get the different you know a copy you

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.650 
get the different you know a copy you
know<00:05:05.880> think<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.120> said<00:05:06.300> they<00:05:06.390> can<00:05:06.480> bring<00:05:06.570> over

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
know think I said they can bring over

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
it you know you know those kind of

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.360 
it you know you know those kind of
things<00:06:07.740> and<00:06:08.010> that's<00:06:08.130> what<00:06:08.250> I'm<00:06:08.340> thinking

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
things and that's what I'm thinking

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.520 
things and that's what I'm thinking
might<00:06:08.790> might<00:06:09.000> be<00:06:09.120> happening<00:06:09.300> so<00:06:10.050> it<00:06:10.320> just

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
might might be happening so it just

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.690 
might might be happening so it just
makes<00:06:10.680> sense<00:06:10.890> if<00:06:11.100> you<00:06:11.160> think<00:06:11.190> about<00:06:11.370> it<00:06:11.520> from

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
makes sense if you think about it from

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.750 
makes sense if you think about it from
that<00:06:11.820> like<00:06:12.030> Disney<00:06:12.360> killed<00:06:12.930> off<00:06:13.110> a<00:06:13.950> lot<00:06:14.490> in<00:06:14.640> a

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
that like Disney killed off a lot in a

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.630 
that like Disney killed off a lot in a
quarter<00:06:15.690> of<00:06:15.720> its<00:06:15.900> total<00:06:16.080> workforce<00:06:16.380> and<00:06:16.920> then

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
quarter of its total workforce and then

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.390 
quarter of its total workforce and then
they're<00:06:17.790> purchasing<00:06:18.270> another<00:06:18.600> workforce

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
they're purchasing another workforce

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.160 
they're purchasing another workforce
that<00:06:20.400> they<00:06:20.790> don't<00:06:20.970> have<00:06:21.030> to<00:06:21.180> necessarily<00:06:21.390> do

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
that they don't have to necessarily do

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.750 
that they don't have to necessarily do
anything<00:06:22.590> for<00:06:22.800> or<00:06:22.980> do<00:06:23.190> anything<00:06:23.370> they<00:06:23.550> want<00:06:23.580> to
