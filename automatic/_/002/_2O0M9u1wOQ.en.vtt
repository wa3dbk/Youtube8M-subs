00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hi my name is gabriel de java 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.859
 technologies in this video we're going to do 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:12.059
 a little review of this separator 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:17.220
 lcd and gorilla glass or the brand is 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:21.359
 gonzÃ¡lez 946 de skins operator that 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.070
 means screen separator like 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.010
 we can see here we have the button 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.880
 on and off here with these 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.920
 buttons we can configure the 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.050
 temperature that we are going to use to 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.930
 can separate 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.750
 the glass of the screen here as 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.149
 we can see we have the place where 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.370
 we would put the screen in this case 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.110
 we have the cranks usually this 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.600
 everything comes unarmed and then 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.309
 obviously one has to arm it here 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.460
 as we can see we could get to 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.070
 put the cell rather the screen 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.290
 obviously that in this case we have the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.300
 cell that is whole would have to 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.370
 disarm it to be able to place it once 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.979
 that we put it we put the screen 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.010
 down and with this we should be able 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.850
 hold it 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.970
 for example here I have a glass of a s 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.000
 4 and here I have naut 1 and we are going to 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.460
 take this out and as we can see the s4 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.560
 obviously perfect that the s3 is 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.810
 a little smaller and should go 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.020
 perfect also basically one puts it 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.570
 so in this way I hold it and one 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.660
 I would have to be able to pass the video the thread 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.260
 over here as we can see also comes 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.030
 with these sticks here I do not know if you can 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.760
 get to detect in the camera but 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.310
 comes with a wire that is very finite 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.320
 then with this and wire what 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.620
 we do on the iphone for example in the 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.590
 iphone 5 we will have to pass the wire 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.880
 everything is like this below and take it off in 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.280
 the case of 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.770
 galaxy what to do once 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.680
 one left him for a minute two minutes 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.509
 It is heated until turn and 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.520
 try to take it off with a letter or 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.060
 from the side obviously because it's a 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.090
 do little more complicated because the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.480
 glass and the screen are attached as 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:20.220
 in this cradle what would be the picture of 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:23.310
 cellular later with the nou 2 also 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.640
 would enter thus the subject that I found in 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.370
 is 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.470
 machine is that for example in the 'notes 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.390
 they are a little bigger and it does not come 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.300
 in this framework if you want to do it 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.120
 for it to be sustained obviously is not going to 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.550
 enter the only way to be able to do it 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.970
 is that you put it like that and so should not 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.950
 have problems you could get to 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.760
 obviously keep a few minutes and 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.980
 later with him and you could not get it out or 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.400
 if not with the letter as I have shown you 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.260
 in other videos that you give sideways and 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.330
 there you can get it to take off so 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.180
 I do not see much difficulty but good 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.570
 depends on the work methodology that 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.350
 one wants to get to use as you 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.320
 I said earlier the machine is fine 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.510
 and that with these sticks and the thread one 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.570
 part comes with these spare parts that 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.500
 would be the metal thread this is the 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.239
 this one obviously to be able to 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.920
 replace it in the event that this thread 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.920
 is damaged or cut or 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.770
 then the actions of the machines 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.770
 you have 110 and 220 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.770
 then at the bottom it does not have 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.860
 much to look at has obviously the 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.350
 traditional ventilations and that would be 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.110
 all yes that is quite basic the 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.819
 machine is and simple I hope that you 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.190
 have liked this little review 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.959
 Any questions you have do it below 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.380
 in the comments and we'll see you until the 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.380
 next
