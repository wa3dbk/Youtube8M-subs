00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 hello people I'll show you today 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:14.580
 pocket like an mp alpha server we 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:17.760
 have programmed yourself and yes too 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.320
 play there you see that's already called that 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.920
 the ip is my epic mpi 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.699
 germany 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:33.809
 but that is what Germans think 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:36.719
 a German surfer at least once 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.870
 So if you want to do this server 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.700
 then you just have to click away extra 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.700
 does not give the name 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.610
 cpi the id keeps the soft light 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.660
 by heart that's why it stands here 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.440
 but I write it still the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.140
 comments and abort he stands here 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:08.430
 he stays the same as he is in common 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:12.479
 times a dialect and see the same as 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:20.670
 through as far as me what's your name 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:23.820
 So now the withered skin that is 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:30.360
 just still so 107 so hi 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:36.119
 come on my server our server 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.470
 So I put it right in front of me 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.600
 have programmed that runs but so far 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.490
 computer and there is singleplayer 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:49.409
 So commerce ago for example or web 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.860
 or something else old then it's done 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.689
 that we also have plate so packs 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.860
 plugins so portals for example but 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.689
 I do not rebuild 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.960
 maybe if someone comes in though 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.880
 how it works then I give the op 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.160
 those and then can help us 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.680
 these 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.720
 then only one portal to build 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.220
 Add plug-in that runs with money 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.100
 that here you can find individual plots 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:19.250
 can buy and fly it goes 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:25.040
 faster than to run 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:28.260
 So I'm the only one to blame 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.550
 then stop here Friborg begins 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.020
 That's why I kind of wanted paper 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.150
 portals make me a single one 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.070
 world for friborg but I have none 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.900
 I do not know how it works 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.760
 with the portals maybe always knows 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.610
 how it works then just swap here 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.550
 for example, diamonds against iron or 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.760
 or iron versus diamonds 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.780
 then there is the mine which is here 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:56.010
 because all the doctors are there 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.900
 down here and yes I'll give you the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.930
 two I sometimes quite short one himself 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.850
 imagine 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:08.250
 and yes I write you the port 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.300
 to be on the safe side, too 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.480
 again called server and the first of the 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.110
 next server comes in the troop 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.110
 we have agreed so 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.110
 then yes 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.209
 I can show you that too 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.209
 really works with those over the 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.209
 windows 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.160
 becomes 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:50.520
 equal I often prescribe me I 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:54.690
 I am only used to a computer now 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:57.870
 right in front of me and last factor is that 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.990
 just all works so in order if you 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.490
 come in the world then you have yes 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.350
 that we will lift the error 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.080
 all this will be a block further 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:20.609
 put behind or wait can go 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:22.410
 maybe it does too little and me 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.120
 would be happy if today one more 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.560
 then on the server complete the war 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.120
 also equal op I will also equal 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.860
 edit and then I'll show you 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.420
 very short for the server that works 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.060
 show computer incident at this time 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.320
 very short the camera 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:42.540
 I want that I cut together 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:43.830
 Show that's just us he quickly 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.430
 have the computer over the tv 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.960
 let run 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.960
 you can often see that the whole program 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.220
 should the number write then he will 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.270
 displayed as the test is running like that 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.430
 server is always up here also that 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.410
 two beatrix back and forth 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.430
 yes I can sometimes if you want one 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.510
 make video how to make the server 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.320
 and he has that from the video 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.320
 Thank you
