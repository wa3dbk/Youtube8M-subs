set<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.130> met<00:00:32.309> record<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.850> also<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.420> had<00:00:33.510> done

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
set to met record and also we had done

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.569 
set to met record and also we had done
something<00:00:33.870> no<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.380> has<00:00:34.590> done<00:00:34.770> since<00:00:34.950> 1900

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
something no one has done since 1900

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.450 
something no one has done since 1900
that<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.880> get<00:00:36.030> two<00:00:36.540> hits<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.110> strike<00:00:37.739> out<00:00:37.829> 11

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
that is get two hits and strike out 11

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.610 
that is get two hits and strike out 11
so<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.239> probably<00:00:39.510> heard<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.899> word<00:00:40.020> 11<00:00:40.469> like

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
so you probably heard the word 11 like

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.250 
so you probably heard the word 11 like
eight<00:00:40.860> times<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.940> past<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.480> 10<00:00:42.780> seconds

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
eight times in the past like 10 seconds

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.049 
eight times in the past like 10 seconds
so<00:00:43.649> let's<00:00:43.829> good<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.219> let's<00:00:44.399> talk<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> little<00:00:44.640> bit

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
so let's good to let's talk a little bit

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.790 
so let's good to let's talk a little bit
about<00:00:45.210> Matt<00:00:45.450> Harvey<00:00:45.780> here<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.410> he<00:00:46.590> gets

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
about Matt Harvey here so he gets

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.369 
about Matt Harvey here so he gets
promoted<00:00:46.980> because<00:00:47.910> Dillon<00:00:48.780> Gee<00:00:48.960> gets<00:00:49.200> hurt

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
promoted because Dillon Gee gets hurt

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.840 
promoted because Dillon Gee gets hurt
and<00:00:49.410> he<00:00:49.680> seems<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> best<00:00:50.460> candidate<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and he seems to be the best candidate to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.639 
and he seems to be the best candidate to
replace<00:00:51.000> him<00:00:51.329> not<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.140> because<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.410> Mets

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
replace him not really because I Mets

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.410 
replace him not really because I Mets
have<00:00:52.770> tons<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.160> other<00:00:53.280> options<00:00:53.789> they<00:00:54.149> really

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
have tons of other options they really

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.170 
have tons of other options they really
don't<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.079> know<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> rotation<00:00:56.489> hasn't<00:00:57.059> been

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
don't you know the rotation hasn't been

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.250 
don't you know the rotation hasn't been
really<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.449> problem<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.870> year<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.199> been

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
really the problem this year it's been

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.470 
really the problem this year it's been
the<00:00:58.739> relief<00:00:59.219> pitching<00:00:59.520> but<00:01:00.030> they've<00:01:00.180> had<00:01:00.359> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the relief pitching but they've had to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
the relief pitching but they've had to
have<00:01:00.660> guys<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.140> miguel<00:01:01.440> bautista<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
have guys like miguel bautista and the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.100 
have guys like miguel bautista and the
starting<00:01:02.820> rotation<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.390> know<00:01:03.690> they're

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
starting rotation so you know they're

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.080 
starting rotation so you know they're
running<00:01:04.530> out<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.710> options<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> Mets

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
running out of options so the Mets

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.940 
running out of options so the Mets
obviously<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.080> Zack<00:01:07.350> wheeler<00:01:07.740> and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
obviously they have Zack wheeler and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.340 
obviously they have Zack wheeler and
Matt<00:01:08.729> Harvey<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.360> really<00:01:09.750> good<00:01:09.960> pitching

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
Matt Harvey to really good pitching

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.710 
Matt Harvey to really good pitching
prospects<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:10.920> number<00:01:11.760> two<00:01:11.790> starters<00:01:12.299> Bowl<00:01:12.510> so

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
prospects as number two starters Bowl so

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.300 
prospects as number two starters Bowl so
in<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.900> few<00:01:13.110> years<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.560> Johann<00:01:13.830> Santa<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.189> still

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
in a few years of Johann Santa is still

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.640 
in a few years of Johann Santa is still
there<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.600> would<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> great<00:01:16.110> rotation<00:01:16.259> of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
there it would be a great rotation of

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.410 
there it would be a great rotation of
Johan<00:01:16.920> Santana<00:01:17.310> Zack<00:01:17.670> wheeler<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.270> Matt

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
Harvey if everything turns out the way

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.940 
Harvey if everything turns out the way
it<00:01:20.970> should<00:01:21.000> um<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.020> that's<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.259> really<00:01:22.530> good<00:01:22.680> top

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it should um so that's a really good top

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.920 
it should um so that's a really good top
three<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.400> rotation<00:01:23.479> but<00:01:24.479> really<00:01:24.750> Matt

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
improvement there i mean honestly if

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.540

they had a lot of options that call up I

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.250 
they had a lot of options that call up I
feel<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.210> they<00:02:45.330> would<00:02:45.450> just<00:02:45.630> cut<00:02:45.810> everyone

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
feel like they would just cut everyone

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.420 
feel like they would just cut everyone
and<00:02:46.410> then<00:02:46.500> call<00:02:46.710> a<00:02:46.740> bunch<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.130> guys<00:02:47.220> because

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
and then call a bunch of guys because

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.890 
and then call a bunch of guys because
they<00:02:47.730> really<00:02:47.970> can't<00:02:48.210> do<00:02:48.360> much<00:02:48.390> worse<00:02:48.750> than

they really can't do much worse than
what<00:02:48.960> they've<00:02:49.170> been<00:02:49.290> doing<00:02:49.350> we'll<00:02:49.920> leave<00:02:50.070> wise

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
what they've been doing we'll leave wise

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.830 
what they've been doing we'll leave wise
the<00:02:50.490> last<00:02:50.700> few<00:02:50.850> games<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.210> I<00:02:51.300> think<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.690> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
the last few games and I think in the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.150 
the last few games and I think in the
trade<00:02:52.320> deadline<00:02:52.440> they<00:02:52.740> will<00:02:52.890> acquire

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
trade deadline they will acquire

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.260 
trade deadline they will acquire
reliever<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.700> don't<00:02:53.850> think<00:02:53.970> it's<00:02:54.060> going<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.210> be

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
reliever I don't think it's going to be

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.730 
reliever I don't think it's going to be
a<00:02:54.360> big<00:02:54.570> move<00:02:54.750> but<00:02:54.870> they're<00:02:54.990> looking<00:02:55.290> at<00:02:55.380> backup

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
a big move but they're looking at backup

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.650 
a big move but they're looking at backup
catchers<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:56.250> relievers<00:02:57.150> we'll<00:02:57.510> see<00:02:57.630> how

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
catchers and relievers we'll see how

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.510 
catchers and relievers we'll see how
that<00:02:57.810> goes<00:02:57.990> hopefully<00:02:58.500> this<00:02:58.890> mess<00:02:59.070> seen<00:02:59.310> can

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
that goes hopefully this mess seen can

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.220 
that goes hopefully this mess seen can
figure<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.910> out<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.360> get<00:03:00.600> on<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.720> roll<00:03:00.990> again

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
figure it out and get on a roll again

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.720 
figure it out and get on a roll again
because<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.500> do<00:03:01.650> feel<00:03:02.040> for<00:03:02.220> them<00:03:02.370> they<00:03:02.550> had<00:03:02.700> a

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
because I do feel for them they had a

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.030 
because I do feel for them they had a
great<00:03:02.970> run<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.350> just<00:03:04.500> hasn't<00:03:04.650> worked<00:03:04.860> out

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
great run and it just hasn't worked out

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.040 
great run and it just hasn't worked out
the<00:03:05.220> past<00:03:05.430> few<00:03:05.940> weeks<00:03:06.180> but<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.450> think<00:03:06.750> they<00:03:06.840> can

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
the past few weeks but I think they can

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.540 
the past few weeks but I think they can
figure<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.440> out<00:03:07.500> they<00:03:07.710> still<00:03:07.950> have<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.340> pretty

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
figure it out they still have a pretty

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.250 
figure it out they still have a pretty
magical<00:03:08.760> team<00:03:09.240> in<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.480> sense<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:10.230> know

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
magical team in the sense that you know

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.930 
magical team in the sense that you know
they<00:03:10.470> found<00:03:10.770> ways<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.070> win<00:03:11.460> when<00:03:11.670> they<00:03:11.760> weren't

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
they found ways to win when they weren't

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.060 
they found ways to win when they weren't
expected<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.260> really<00:03:13.350> did<00:03:13.620> keep<00:03:13.830> up<00:03:13.950> in

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
expected to and it really did keep up in

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.470 
expected to and it really did keep up in
the<00:03:14.160> NL<00:03:14.400> East<00:03:14.520> they're<00:03:14.880> not<00:03:15.000> going<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.210> win<00:03:15.330> it

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
the NL East they're not going to win it

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.520 
the NL East they're not going to win it
obviously<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:15.900> don't<00:03:16.080> think<00:03:16.230> they'll<00:03:16.320> make<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
obviously I don't think they'll make the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.560 
obviously I don't think they'll make the
playoffs<00:03:16.700> that<00:03:17.700> terrible<00:03:18.060> stretch<00:03:18.360> will

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
playoffs that terrible stretch will

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.150 
playoffs that terrible stretch will
haunt<00:03:18.870> them<00:03:19.110> I<00:03:19.290> don't<00:03:19.650> even<00:03:19.740> know<00:03:19.920> if<00:03:20.010> they'll

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
haunt them I don't even know if they'll

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.920 
haunt them I don't even know if they'll
get<00:03:20.340> back<00:03:20.520> into<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.850> but<00:03:21.030> this<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.390> this<00:03:21.630> step

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
get back into it but this is this step

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.360 
get back into it but this is this step
in<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.170> right<00:03:22.290> direction<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.860> gives<00:03:23.010> Mets

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
in the right direction it gives Mets

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.610 
in the right direction it gives Mets
fans<00:03:23.610> some<00:03:24.210> hope<00:03:24.240> for<00:03:24.660> this<00:03:24.990> season<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.560> the

rest<00:05:41.759> of<00:05:41.880> the<00:05:41.940> year<00:05:42.060> for<00:05:42.210> the<00:05:42.300> New<00:05:42.419> York<00:05:42.599> Mets<00:05:42.900> I

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
rest of the year for the New York Mets I

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.959 
rest of the year for the New York Mets I
hope<00:05:43.229> him<00:05:43.409> the<00:05:43.620> best<00:05:43.800> so<00:05:44.490> let's<00:05:44.639> just<00:05:44.789> take<00:05:44.940> a

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:44.969 
hope him the best so let's just take a

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.370 
hope him the best so let's just take a
step<00:05:45.270> back<00:05:45.449> and<00:05:45.479> appreciate<00:05:45.780> it<00:05:46.139> because<00:05:46.229> I

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
step back and appreciate it because I

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.540 
step back and appreciate it because I
think<00:05:46.440> we<00:05:46.650> all<00:05:46.680> remember<00:05:47.159> when<00:05:47.280> Stephen

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
think we all remember when Stephen

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.920 
think we all remember when Stephen
Strasburg<00:05:47.759> had<00:05:48.120> his<00:05:48.240> debut<00:05:48.599> and<00:05:48.690> struck<00:05:48.840> out

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
Strasburg had his debut and struck out

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.200 
Strasburg had his debut and struck out
11<00:05:48.990> and<00:05:49.530> this<00:05:49.860> could<00:05:50.159> be<00:05:50.370> a<00:05:50.610> similar<00:05:51.030> situation

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
11 and this could be a similar situation

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.490 
11 and this could be a similar situation
I'm<00:05:51.630> not<00:05:51.810> saying<00:05:52.050> he's<00:05:52.169> going<00:05:52.320> to<00:05:52.380> be<00:05:52.469> a

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
I'm not saying he's going to be a

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.439 
I'm not saying he's going to be a
Stephen<00:05:52.770> Strasburg<00:05:53.219> at<00:05:53.340> all<00:05:53.490> but<00:05:54.090> in

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:54.449 
Stephen Strasburg at all but in

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:56.540 
Stephen Strasburg at all but in
completely<00:05:54.870> different<00:05:54.960> picture<00:05:55.320> but<00:05:55.680> I<00:05:55.889> think

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
completely different picture but I think

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.159 
completely different picture but I think
it's<00:05:56.699> a<00:05:56.820> historic<00:05:57.240> day<00:05:57.270> for<00:05:57.360> Mets<00:05:57.690> fans<00:05:57.750> and

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
it's a historic day for Mets fans and

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.870 
it's a historic day for Mets fans and
could<00:05:58.320> be<00:05:58.409> a<00:05:58.440> short<00:05:58.710> day<00:05:58.889> for<00:05:59.370> obviously<00:05:59.669> Matt

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
could be a short day for obviously Matt

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.310 
could be a short day for obviously Matt
Harvey<00:06:00.210> I<00:06:00.240> want<00:06:00.419> to<00:06:00.479> congratulate<00:06:00.780> him<00:06:01.199> and
