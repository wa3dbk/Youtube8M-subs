00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
started my next one of course that was

started my next one of course that was
to<00:00:14.130> gather<00:00:14.280> enough<00:00:14.670> obsidian<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:16.020> build<00:00:16.230> my

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
to gather enough obsidian to build my

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.400 
to gather enough obsidian to build my
portal<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.789> there<00:00:17.970> are<00:00:18.060> two<00:00:18.270> camps<00:00:19.199> of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
portal and there are two camps of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.130 
portal and there are two camps of
thought<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.160> how<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.490> best<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.900> first

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
thought on how to best do this the first

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.340 
thought on how to best do this the first
is<00:00:22.410> simply<00:00:23.400> bring<00:00:23.670> at<00:00:24.119> least<00:00:24.180> two<00:00:24.630> buckets<00:00:25.050> one

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
is simply bring at least two buckets one

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.640 
is simply bring at least two buckets one
for<00:00:25.590> lava<00:00:25.800> one<00:00:26.220> for<00:00:26.460> water<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.449> stack<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> black

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
for lava one for water and stack a black

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.589 
for lava one for water and stack a black
olava<00:00:29.070> then<00:00:29.519> dumped<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.939> block<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.269> water<00:00:30.420> on

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
olava then dumped a block of water on

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.939 
olava then dumped a block of water on
that<00:00:30.750> let<00:00:30.900> me<00:00:30.990> demonstrate<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.470> quickly

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
that let me demonstrate this quickly

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
here just dump this here that way you

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.130 
here just dump this here that way you
don't<00:00:37.739> need<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> diamond<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.760> pick<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.510> dig<00:00:39.989> away

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
don't need a diamond to pick to dig away

don't need a diamond to pick to dig away
your<00:00:40.739> obsidian<00:00:41.270> you<00:00:42.270> simply<00:00:42.660> gather<00:00:43.140> all<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
your obsidian you simply gather all the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.950 
your obsidian you simply gather all the
lava<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.010> you're<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.399> need<00:00:44.750> plop<00:00:45.750> it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
lava that you're going to need plop it

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.440 
lava that you're going to need plop it
down<00:00:46.129> on<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.399> spots<00:00:47.700> where<00:00:47.910> you're<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.329> to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
down on the spots where you're going to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.729 
down on the spots where you're going to
want<00:00:48.860> your<00:00:49.860> obsidian<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.730> go<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.559> see

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
want your obsidian to go and you can see

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.889 
want your obsidian to go and you can see
some<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.460> know<00:00:53.489> minor<00:00:53.969> problems<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.660> how

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
some you know minor problems with how

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.990 
some you know minor problems with how
this<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.590> work<00:00:55.739> mostly<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:56.760> it

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
this is going to work mostly because it

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.150 
this is going to work mostly because it
was<00:00:57.090> water<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.390> already<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.109> then<00:00:58.920> dumped

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
was water there already and then dumped

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.579 
was water there already and then dumped
a<00:00:59.340> block<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.879> water<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.300> top<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:04.019> result<00:01:04.350> is

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
a block of water on top the result is

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.530 
a block of water on top the result is
that<00:01:04.920> you've<00:01:05.309> gotten<00:01:05.549> obsidian<00:01:05.970> block<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
that you've gotten obsidian block in the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.940 
that you've gotten obsidian block in the
next<00:01:06.780> place<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.619> keep<00:01:07.770> repeating

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
next place and you just keep repeating

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.890 
next place and you just keep repeating
this<00:01:08.600> with<00:01:10.400> every<00:01:11.400> community<00:01:12.090> block<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.720> lava

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
this with every community block of lava

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.030 
this with every community block of lava
for<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.270> frame<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.570> need<00:01:15.750> which<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.380> for

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
for the frame that you need which is for

long find out which you know not
counting<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> overlapping<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> corners

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020

being which needle makes it a little
less<00:01:29.460> than<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:30.750> here's<00:01:30.930> my<00:01:30.990> point<00:01:31.140> as

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
less than that but here's my point as

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.550 
less than that but here's my point as
far<00:01:32.369> as<00:01:32.460> getting<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.790> diamond<00:01:33.090> pecos<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.960> you're

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
far as getting a diamond pecos if you're

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.530 
far as getting a diamond pecos if you're
going<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.040> find<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.430> place<00:01:35.549> where<00:01:36.329> there's

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
going to find a place where there's

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.990 
going to find a place where there's
water<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.409> there's<00:01:37.860> lava<00:01:38.070> where<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.850> can

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
water and there's lava where you can

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.999 
water and there's lava where you can
make<00:01:39.119> enough<00:01:39.420> obsidian<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.290> there<00:01:40.650> or

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
make enough obsidian just there or

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.399 
make enough obsidian just there or
gather<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.640> go<00:01:41.729> back<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:42.090> chance<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.140> pretty

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
gather it to go back up chance a pretty

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.359 
gather it to go back up chance a pretty
damn<00:01:43.680> high<00:01:44.810> they're<00:01:45.810> going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> find<00:01:46.369> three

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
damn high they're going to find three

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.600 
damn high they're going to find three
diamonds<00:01:47.790> right<00:01:47.909> there<00:01:48.590> nearby<00:01:49.610> diamonds

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.020 
too and if you're on the right layers
they<00:01:55.570> come<00:01:55.780> pretty<00:01:56.049> much<00:01:56.320> in<00:01:57.100> four<00:01:57.549> or<00:01:57.700> more

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
they come pretty much in four or more

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.580 
they come pretty much in four or more
regularly<00:01:59.100> and<00:02:00.570> they<00:02:01.570> are<00:02:01.689> rare<00:02:01.960> they're<00:02:02.409> not

regularly and they are rare they're not

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.980 
regularly and they are rare they're not
easy<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.890> find<00:02:03.100> but<00:02:03.969> if<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:04.270> are<00:02:04.479> at<00:02:04.719> a<00:02:04.750> point

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
easy to find but if you are at a point

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.889 
easy to find but if you are at a point
where<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.439> can<00:02:05.619> get<00:02:05.770> obsidian<00:02:06.189> from<00:02:07.149> pools<00:02:07.719> of

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
where you can get obsidian from pools of

where you can get obsidian from pools of
lava<00:02:08.009> chances<00:02:09.009> are<00:02:09.129> likely<00:02:09.459> that<00:02:09.610> if<00:02:09.700> you

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
if there is a lot of below it and this

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.180 
if there is a lot of below it and this
is<00:04:03.600> also<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.870> bad<00:04:04.020> example<00:04:04.200> because<00:04:04.560> lava<00:04:04.890> will

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
is also a bad example because lava will

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.280 
is also a bad example because lava will
flow<00:04:05.370> into<00:04:05.520> besides<00:04:05.910> there's<00:04:06.600> lava<00:04:06.840> below<00:04:07.140> it

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
flow into besides there's lava below it

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.730 
flow into besides there's lava below it
there's<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:07.530> chance<00:04:07.770> that<00:04:07.890> you'll<00:04:08.100> grab<00:04:08.430> the

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
there's a chance that you'll grab the

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.590 
there's a chance that you'll grab the
obsidian<00:04:10.740> before<00:04:11.070> falls<00:04:11.310> in<00:04:11.520> and<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:12.360> won't

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
obsidian before falls in and you won't

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.010 
obsidian before falls in and you won't
die<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:13.740> be<00:04:13.770> extra<00:04:14.160> safe<00:04:14.540> do<00:04:15.540> it<00:04:15.630> under<00:04:15.750> water

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
die to be extra safe do it under water

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.940 
die to be extra safe do it under water
and<00:04:17.270> then<00:04:18.270> if<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.510> dig<00:04:18.720> through<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.200> water

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
and then if you dig through the water

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.640 
and then if you dig through the water
will<00:04:20.220> flow<00:04:20.459> into<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:20.820> log<00:04:21.060> block<00:04:21.450> faster<00:04:22.380> than

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
will flow into the log block faster than

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.650 
will flow into the log block faster than
the<00:04:22.770> obsidian<00:04:23.280> block<00:04:23.550> falling<00:04:24.090> into<00:04:24.390> it<00:04:24.540> and

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
the obsidian block falling into it and

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.560 
the obsidian block falling into it and
you'll<00:04:25.290> pretty<00:04:26.010> much<00:04:26.130> every<00:04:26.670> time<00:04:26.850> save<00:04:27.330> your

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
you'll pretty much every time save your

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.100 
you'll pretty much every time save your
block<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.280> before<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.400> falls<00:04:29.550> in<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:29.820> law<00:04:30.110> and

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
block and before it falls in the law and

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.910 
block and before it falls in the law and
that's<00:04:31.470> your<00:04:31.650> trick<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:31.950> my<00:04:32.100> name<00:04:32.280> saying<00:04:33.920> so

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
that's your trick to my name saying so

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.340 
that's your trick to my name saying so
short<00:04:35.490> one<00:04:35.670> I<00:04:35.820> promised<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:37.140> know<00:04:37.260> I've

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
short one I promised and you know I've

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.980 
short one I promised and you know I've
already<00:04:37.530> gone<00:04:37.770> over<00:04:38.040> like<00:04:38.400> five<00:04:38.610> minutes<00:04:38.990> but

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
already gone over like five minutes but

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.540 
already gone over like five minutes but
that<00:04:40.200> is<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.500> two<00:04:40.890> schools<00:04:41.190> of<00:04:41.310> thought<00:04:41.370> on

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
that is the two schools of thought on

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.450 
that is the two schools of thought on
how<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.060> produce<00:04:42.840> your<00:04:43.200> gate<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.710> when<00:04:44.370> we

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
how to produce your gate and when we

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.030 
how to produce your gate and when we
come<00:04:44.610> back<00:04:44.840> for<00:04:45.840> our<00:04:45.960> next<00:04:46.110> video<00:04:46.470> I<00:04:46.740> will<00:04:46.770> have

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
come back for our next video I will have

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.460 
come back for our next video I will have
a<00:04:47.070> gate<00:04:47.310> right<00:04:47.640> here<00:04:47.700> no<00:04:48.240> reason<00:04:48.630> to<00:04:48.750> fancy<00:04:49.440> it

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
a gate right here no reason to fancy it

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.220 
a gate right here no reason to fancy it
up<00:04:49.560> any<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.100> we<00:04:50.190> will<00:04:50.340> go<00:04:50.460> through<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.760> nether

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
up any and we will go through the nether

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.760 
up any and we will go through the nether
and<00:04:52.230> hopefully<00:04:52.620> I'll<00:04:52.980> be<00:04:53.040> prepared<00:04:54.710> see<00:04:55.710> you

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
and hopefully I'll be prepared see you

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.070 
and hopefully I'll be prepared see you
next<00:04:55.920> time
