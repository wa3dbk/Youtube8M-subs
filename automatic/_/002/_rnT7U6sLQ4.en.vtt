00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:40.089 
before this happened what the worst

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:42.629 
before this happened what the worst
thing<00:06:40.210> in<00:06:40.449> my<00:06:40.599> life<00:06:40.810> would<00:06:41.080> be<00:06:41.110> it<00:06:42.039> would<00:06:42.279> be<00:06:42.310> to

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
thing in my life would be it would be to

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:45.899 
thing in my life would be it would be to
lose<00:06:42.699> a<00:06:42.819> child<00:06:42.940> to<00:06:43.449> lose<00:06:43.599> Sarah<00:06:43.919> I<00:06:44.919> now<00:06:45.610> know

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:45.909 
lose a child to lose Sarah I now know

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:49.379 
lose a child to lose Sarah I now know
that<00:06:46.020> there<00:06:47.020> is<00:06:47.169> one<00:06:47.349> thing<00:06:47.560> worse<00:06:47.740> and<00:06:48.389> that

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
that there is one thing worse and that

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.689 
that there is one thing worse and that
would<00:06:49.539> be<00:06:49.690> to<00:06:49.839> never<00:06:50.020> have<00:06:50.199> had<00:06:50.440> her<00:06:50.680> at<00:06:51.490> all

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:51.699 
would be to never have had her at all

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:58.200 
would be to never have had her at all
right<00:06:52.180> so<00:06:54.960> what<00:06:55.960> that<00:06:56.169> that<00:06:56.860> tells<00:06:57.610> me<00:06:57.940> is<00:06:58.180> that

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210 
right so what that that tells me is that

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.089 
right so what that that tells me is that
to<00:06:58.900> look<00:06:59.080> at<00:06:59.259> all<00:06:59.379> these<00:06:59.529> wonderful<00:06:59.770> things

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:00.099 
to look at all these wonderful things

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:02.879 
to look at all these wonderful things
that<00:07:00.639> she<00:07:00.849> did<00:07:01.060> accomplished<00:07:01.599> and<00:07:01.930> and<00:07:02.680> to

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
that she did accomplished and and to

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:06.869 
that she did accomplished and and to
enjoy<00:07:03.310> them<00:07:05.009> let<00:07:06.009> them<00:07:06.219> bring<00:07:06.370> you<00:07:06.520> happiness

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:06.879 
enjoy them let them bring you happiness

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:10.290 
enjoy them let them bring you happiness
and<00:07:07.479> so<00:07:08.199> it<00:07:08.919> makes<00:07:09.190> sense<00:07:09.310> that<00:07:09.610> Jan<00:07:09.969> will<00:07:10.150> make

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300 
and so it makes sense that Jan will make

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.689 
and so it makes sense that Jan will make
the<00:07:10.419> trip<00:07:10.599> to<00:07:10.750> Sochi<00:07:11.129> stand<00:07:12.129> in<00:07:12.400> the<00:07:12.490> halfpipe
