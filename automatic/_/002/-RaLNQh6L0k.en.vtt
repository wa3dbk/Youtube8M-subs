remember Kennywood have you ever

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.730 
remember Kennywood have you ever
wondered<00:00:08.880> why<00:00:09.200> rollercoasters<00:00:10.200> stay<00:00:10.559> on

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
wondered why rollercoasters stay on

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.129 
wondered why rollercoasters stay on
their<00:00:11.010> track<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.670> why<00:00:12.030> people<00:00:12.660> can<00:00:12.900> hang

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
their track and why people can hang
