that for her to use on her and she was

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.380 
that for her to use on her and she was
like<00:05:27.780> no<00:05:28.020> it's<00:05:28.800> too<00:05:29.070> great<00:05:29.400> it's<00:05:29.700> just<00:05:30.060> not

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
like no it's too great it's just not

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.750 
like no it's too great it's just not
going<00:05:30.660> to<00:05:30.720> work<00:05:30.900> so<00:05:31.169> I've<00:05:32.100> had<00:05:32.400> it<00:05:32.550> for

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
going to work so I've had it for

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.420 
going to work so I've had it for
probably<00:05:32.880> about<00:05:33.300> 6<00:05:33.660> or<00:05:33.780> 7<00:05:33.840> months<00:05:34.140> and<00:05:34.590> I<00:05:35.100> think

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
probably about 6 or 7 months and I think

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.680 
probably about 6 or 7 months and I think
right<00:05:35.850> now<00:05:36.000> this<00:05:36.180> would<00:05:36.360> be<00:05:36.450> a<00:05:36.479> good

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
right now this would be a good

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.510 
right now this would be a good
opportunity<00:05:36.960> for<00:05:37.530> me<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.710> try<00:05:37.950> to<00:05:37.979> use<00:05:38.310> it

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
opportunity for me to try to use it

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.010 
opportunity for me to try to use it
instead<00:05:38.700> of<00:05:38.940> going<00:05:39.180> out

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
instead of going out

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.659

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
your hair if I run out of hair while I

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.300 
your hair if I run out of hair while I
do<00:05:44.759> my<00:05:44.970> full<00:05:45.300> locks<00:05:45.569> at<00:05:45.930> any<00:05:46.319> case<00:05:46.560> I<00:05:46.800> just<00:05:46.860> put

do my full locks at any case I just put

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.860 
do my full locks at any case I just put
a<00:05:48.050> additional<00:05:49.220> squirt<00:05:50.220> of<00:05:50.520> the<00:05:51.000> ink<00:05:51.210> into<00:05:51.539> the

adding additional drops or squirts to
the<00:06:12.030> solution<00:06:12.569> will<00:06:13.020> get<00:06:13.409> you<00:06:13.620> a<00:06:13.830> more<00:06:14.099> darker

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
the solution will get you a more darker

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.809 
the solution will get you a more darker
opaque<00:06:15.270> color<00:06:15.770> on<00:06:16.770> the<00:06:17.069> right<00:06:17.250> we<00:06:17.430> have<00:06:17.460> a<00:06:17.610> more

more true pink using it on dark hair it

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.920 
more true pink using it on dark hair it
will<00:06:24.330> alter<00:06:24.599> the<00:06:25.729> undertone<00:06:26.729> not<00:06:27.240> necessarily

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
will alter the undertone not necessarily

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.439 
will alter the undertone not necessarily
the<00:06:28.259> color<00:06:28.560> when<00:06:29.250> I<00:06:29.280> mean<00:06:29.550> undertone<00:06:30.030> as<00:06:30.300> you

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:30.449 
the color when I mean undertone as you

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:32.480 
the color when I mean undertone as you
