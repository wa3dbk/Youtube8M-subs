I<00:00:06.029> think<00:00:06.629> he<00:00:06.720> just<00:00:06.930> trusts<00:00:07.319> about<00:00:07.500> in<00:00:07.649> a

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
I think he just trusts about in a

I<00:00:18.030> say<00:00:18.810> Keating<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> bonus

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.000 

who<00:00:23.840> the<00:00:24.020> brake<00:00:24.200> fluid<00:00:24.230> in<00:00:24.650> this<00:00:24.770> vehicle

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
who the brake fluid in this vehicle

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.900 
who the brake fluid in this vehicle
looks<00:00:25.250> like<00:00:25.520> one<00:00:25.760> big<00:00:26.029> LG<00:00:26.330> plan<00:00:27.910> camera

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
looks like one big LG plan camera

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.630 
looks like one big LG plan camera
doesn't<00:00:29.180> quite<00:00:29.510> pick<00:00:29.840> it<00:00:30.020> up<00:00:30.140> but<00:00:30.740> that's<00:00:31.460> just

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
doesn't quite pick it up but that's just

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.850 
doesn't quite pick it up but that's just
algae<00:00:32.119> colored<00:00:32.530> now<00:00:35.260> you<00:00:36.260> should<00:00:36.440> show<00:00:36.650> how

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
algae colored now you should show how

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.910 
algae colored now you should show how
thick<00:00:37.129> and<00:00:37.280> gooey<00:00:37.489> that<00:00:37.760> brake<00:00:37.970> fluid<00:00:38.300> was<00:00:38.920> yes

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
thick and gooey that brake fluid was yes

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.570 
thick and gooey that brake fluid was yes
look<00:00:40.250> at<00:00:40.309> that

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
look at that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.460 
look at that
good<00:00:40.910> musing<00:00:41.239> back<00:00:41.480> I<00:00:41.600> just<00:00:41.780> wiped<00:00:41.989> it<00:00:42.170> up<00:00:42.320> with

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
good musing back I just wiped it up with

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:53.610 
good musing back I just wiped it up with
it<00:00:42.800> rag<00:00:45.040> there's<00:00:46.040> just<00:00:46.309> very<00:00:46.519> viscous

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.760 

I<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:55.600> wondering<00:00:55.960> why<00:00:56.110> when<00:00:56.320> I<00:00:56.410> took<00:00:56.470> off

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
I was wondering why when I took off

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.310 
I was wondering why when I took off
brake<00:00:57.190> line<00:00:57.430> at<00:00:57.610> the<00:00:57.700> back<00:00:57.910> only<00:00:58.690> few<00:00:58.960> drips<00:00:59.200> of

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
brake line at the back only few drips of

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.620 
brake line at the back only few drips of
fluid<00:00:59.620> came<00:00:59.830> out<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.130> that<00:01:00.220> was<00:01:00.310> it<00:01:00.450> so<00:01:01.450> how

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
fluid came out and that was it so how

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.530 
fluid came out and that was it so how
cool<00:01:01.900> the<00:01:02.500> master<00:01:02.890> was<00:01:03.100> but<00:01:03.970> both<00:01:04.180> of<00:01:04.210> these

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
cool the master was but both of these

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.650 
cool the master was but both of these
were<00:01:04.780> fully<00:01:04.989> deployed<00:01:05.940> so<00:01:06.940> that<00:01:07.270> means<00:01:07.450> it

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
were fully deployed so that means it

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.870 
were fully deployed so that means it
caused<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.380> lot<00:01:08.530> of<00:01:08.650> pressure<00:01:08.920> in<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.370> master

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
caused a lot of pressure in the master

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.510 
caused a lot of pressure in the master
cylinder<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:10.560> couldn't<00:01:11.560> gravity<00:01:12.310> bleed

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
cylinder and couldn't gravity bleed

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.780 
cylinder and couldn't gravity bleed
that's<00:01:12.970> what<00:01:13.119> they<00:01:13.240> use<00:01:13.330> it<00:01:13.479> for<00:01:13.510> is<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:13.840> stop

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
that's what they use it for is to stop

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.100 
that's what they use it for is to stop
oxygen<00:01:15.790> from<00:01:15.940> getting<00:01:16.000> into<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.660> fluid

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
oxygen from getting into the fluid

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.080 
oxygen from getting into the fluid
so<00:01:17.890> as<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.190> fluid<00:01:18.460> level<00:01:18.729> drops<00:01:18.940> these

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
so as the fluid level drops these

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.109 
so as the fluid level drops these
supposed<00:01:19.479> to<00:01:19.570> pop<00:01:19.750> out<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.979> someone<00:01:21.729> hasn't

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
supposed to pop out that someone hasn't

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.080 
supposed to pop out that someone hasn't
put<00:01:22.390> them<00:01:22.479> back<00:01:22.630> in<00:01:23.369> they<00:01:24.369> supposed<00:01:24.729> to<00:01:24.850> fold

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
put them back in they supposed to fold

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.109 
put them back in they supposed to fold
them<00:01:25.240> down<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:25.540> yes<00:01:26.430> they'll<00:01:27.430> pop<00:01:27.640> out<00:01:27.880> as

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
them down that yes they'll pop out as

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.889 
them down that yes they'll pop out as
the<00:01:28.869> low<00:01:29.740> pressure<00:01:30.300> pulls<00:01:31.300> on<00:01:31.540> right

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
the low pressure pulls on right

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.999 
the low pressure pulls on right
hemisphere<00:01:32.410> pressure<00:01:32.920> will<00:01:33.100> push<00:01:33.340> them<00:01:33.580> down

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
hemisphere pressure will push them down

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.490 
hemisphere pressure will push them down
yes<00:01:36.009> better<00:01:39.690> well<00:01:40.690> it<00:01:40.780> looks<00:01:40.899> a<00:01:40.990> bit<00:01:41.020> cleaner

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
yes better well it looks a bit cleaner

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.080 
yes better well it looks a bit cleaner
in<00:01:41.590> there<00:01:41.740> yeah<00:01:44.520> well<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.670> drums<00:01:45.910> were

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
in there yeah well the drums were

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.090 
in there yeah well the drums were
machinable<00:01:46.690> so<00:01:46.960> I<00:01:47.200> didn't<00:01:47.619> have<00:01:47.680> to<00:01:47.830> replace

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
machinable so I didn't have to replace

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.450 
machinable so I didn't have to replace
them<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.509> they're<00:01:49.630> all<00:01:49.750> on<00:01:49.780> tall<00:01:50.500> bled<00:01:50.770> all

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
them so they're all on tall bled all

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.950 
them so they're all on tall bled all
adjusted<00:01:51.970> nicely

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.940 

just<00:01:57.620> perfect<00:01:59.020> get<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.049> nice<00:02:00.290> solid<00:02:00.560> brake

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
just perfect get a nice solid brake

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.370 
just perfect get a nice solid brake
pedal<00:02:01.310> now<00:02:01.750> who's<00:02:02.750> going<00:02:02.930> to<00:02:02.990> flush<00:02:03.200> the

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
pedal now who's going to flush the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.590 
pedal now who's going to flush the
Front's<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.920> replace<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.729> brake<00:02:04.940> hoses<00:02:05.330> at

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
Front's and replace the brake hoses at

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.300 
Front's and replace the brake hoses at
the<00:02:05.690> same<00:02:05.900> time

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.880 

well<00:02:10.970> back<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.170> old<00:02:12.200> 202<00:02:12.800> again<00:02:13.400> and

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
well back to the old 202 again and

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.280 
well back to the old 202 again and
didn't<00:02:15.890> really<00:02:16.069> go<00:02:16.220> away<00:02:16.459> for<00:02:16.760> long<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:17.600> want<00:02:18.230> to

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
didn't really go away for long I want to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.990 
didn't really go away for long I want to
do<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.560> points<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.069> condenser<00:02:19.610> because<00:02:19.730> it's

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
do the points and condenser because it's

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.260 
do the points and condenser because it's
starting<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.420> misfire<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.930> bit<00:02:21.200> at<00:02:21.319> idle<00:02:21.680> and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
starting to misfire a bit at idle and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.870 
starting to misfire a bit at idle and
under<00:02:23.270> load<00:02:23.890> one<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.040> plagues<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:25.670> leads

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
under load one of the plagues and leads

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.250 
under load one of the plagues and leads
to<00:02:26.000> but<00:02:26.330> we'll<00:02:26.450> start<00:02:26.660> with<00:02:26.750> points<00:02:27.140> and

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
to but we'll start with points and

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.559 
to but we'll start with points and
condemns<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:27.890> see<00:02:28.010> if<00:02:28.100> that<00:02:28.250> fixes<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.760> it

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
condemns in and see if that fixes it it

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.470 
condemns in and see if that fixes it it
seems<00:02:29.780> like<00:02:29.989> a<00:02:30.020> condenser<00:02:30.620> issue<00:02:30.770> it's<00:02:31.010> doing

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
seems like a condenser issue it's doing

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.670 
seems like a condenser issue it's doing
and<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:33.080> gotta<00:02:34.069> pull<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.459> radiator<00:02:34.970> out<00:02:35.150> again

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
and I gotta pull this radiator out again

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.790 
and I gotta pull this radiator out again
that's<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.860> bit<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.750> things<00:02:38.750> going<00:02:39.650> to

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
that's a bit of a things going to

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.500 
that's a bit of a things going to
start<00:02:40.069> leaking<00:02:40.690> because<00:02:41.690> down<00:02:42.500> there<00:02:43.180> look<00:02:44.180> a

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
start leaking because down there look a

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.530 
start leaking because down there look a
little<00:02:45.080> bit<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.290> coolant<00:02:45.650> bleep<00:02:45.860> each<00:02:46.540> hasn't

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
little bit of coolant bleep each hasn't

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.130 
little bit of coolant bleep each hasn't
dripped<00:02:47.750> yet<00:02:47.959> by<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.230> looks<00:02:48.410> of<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.650> but

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
dripped yet by the looks of it but

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.310 
dripped yet by the looks of it but
coagulated<00:02:51.140> they're<00:02:51.350> bad<00:02:51.950> soldered<00:02:52.790> joint

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
coagulated they're bad soldered joint

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.009 
coagulated they're bad soldered joint
that's<00:02:54.320> just<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.650> pain<00:02:54.890> in<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.100> ass<00:02:56.019> pretty

yeah well let's pinion police then we
can<00:03:22.370> now<00:03:22.519> better<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:22.910> do<00:03:23.030> why<00:03:23.209> don't<00:03:23.269> you<00:03:23.480> choke

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
can now better to do why don't you choke

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.810 
can now better to do why don't you choke
on<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:24.769> be<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:27.530> can<00:03:27.829> see<00:03:28.040> down<00:03:28.250> there

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
on it you be you can see down there

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.600 
on it you be you can see down there
it<00:03:29.540> hasn't<00:03:29.720> dripped<00:03:30.079> off<00:03:30.260> other<00:03:31.220> sort<00:03:31.579> of

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
it hasn't dripped off other sort of

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.460 
it hasn't dripped off other sort of
drift<00:03:31.880> off<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.180> cap<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:32.540> start<00:03:32.810> with<00:03:33.049> but<00:03:33.320> have

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
drift off the cap to start with but have

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.800 
drift off the cap to start with but have
a<00:03:33.500> good<00:03:33.709> look<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.209> no<00:03:35.209> that's<00:03:35.510> definitely

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
a good look and no that's definitely

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.590 
a good look and no that's definitely
coming<00:03:36.440> out<00:03:36.560> of<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.769> soldered<00:03:37.190> joint<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:38.480> when

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
coming out of the soldered joint so when

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.300 
coming out of the soldered joint so when
I<00:03:38.630> get<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:38.959> out<00:03:39.079> we'll<00:03:39.290> have<00:03:39.320> a<00:03:39.470> better<00:03:39.829> look<00:03:40.130> at

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
I get it out we'll have a better look at

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.319 
I get it out we'll have a better look at
that<00:03:41.109> you<00:03:42.109> can<00:03:42.170> look<00:03:43.010> see<00:03:43.400> all<00:03:43.579> around<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:44.090> the

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
that you can look see all around it the

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.210 
that you can look see all around it the
solder<00:03:44.690> goes<00:03:44.870> up<00:03:45.049> and<00:03:45.230> down<00:03:45.290> it's<00:03:45.590> pretty<00:03:45.739> poor

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
solder goes up and down it's pretty poor

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.030 
solder goes up and down it's pretty poor
job<00:03:46.250> really<00:03:48.370> there's<00:03:49.370> a<00:03:49.430> bit<00:03:49.549> of<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:49.700> ship<00:03:51.040> but

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
job really there's a bit of a ship but

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.830 
job really there's a bit of a ship but
you<00:03:52.070> can't<00:03:52.459> get<00:03:52.640> quality<00:03:53.120> new<00:03:53.329> stuff<00:03:53.630> these

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
you can't get quality new stuff these

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.390 
you can't get quality new stuff these
days<00:03:54.489> so<00:03:55.489> this<00:03:55.880> does<00:03:56.090> not<00:03:56.120> surprise<00:03:56.480> me<00:03:56.720> at<00:03:56.989> all

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
well now I'll put the radiator out you

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
even there's just a tiny little pinhole

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.949 
even there's just a tiny little pinhole
there<00:04:12.420> just<00:04:13.420> coming<00:04:13.720> out<00:04:15.150> so<00:04:16.150> it's<00:04:16.180> not<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.720> lot
