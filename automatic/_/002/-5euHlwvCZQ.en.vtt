his in games that's a little bit more
here<00:01:20.610> sending<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.150> acceleration<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.960> sending

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
here sending on acceleration and sending

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.420 
here sending on acceleration and sending
on<00:01:22.409> sprint<00:01:22.710> speed<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.220> that's

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
on sprint speed so you know that's

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.940 
on sprint speed so you know that's
decent<00:01:23.790> overall<00:01:24.030> he<00:01:24.840> also<00:01:24.990> had<00:01:25.170> 77<00:01:25.560> strength

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
decent overall he also had 77 strength

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.560 
decent overall he also had 77 strength
and<00:01:26.189> 76<00:01:26.640> balance<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.180> pretty<00:01:27.360> difficult

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and 76 balance so it's pretty difficult

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.230 
and 76 balance so it's pretty difficult
to<00:01:27.840> push<00:01:28.020> off<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.409> ball<00:01:28.619> yes<00:01:29.220> 39<00:01:29.670> jumping<00:01:30.060> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
to push off the ball yes 39 jumping and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.330 
to push off the ball yes 39 jumping and
son<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.720> 78<00:01:31.380> heading<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:31.890> hence<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.250> reason

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
son is 78 heading so hence the reason

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.130 
son is 78 heading so hence the reason
why<00:01:32.610> he<00:01:32.729> has<00:01:32.850> sent<00:01:33.060> eight<00:01:33.299> heading<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
why he has sent eight heading and the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.600 
why he has sent eight heading and the
