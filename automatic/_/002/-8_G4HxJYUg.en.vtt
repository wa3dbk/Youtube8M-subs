 Hello! Very good everyone I am Cascales and today I bring you a video on how to use our 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.019
 wii mote or our Wii U Pro controller on a Mac 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.939
 Surely many times you've thought "Fuck, I'd really like to play this game, 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.080
 because I never had it or because I want to relive old times, but play with the keyboard 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.080
 it's disgusting "Well you know that you can play with our controls, both play, 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.850
 xbox like Wii. 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.599
 In my case I'm going to focus on the Wii and how to use it on a Mac, which is what 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.950
 I use usually. There are a lot of tutorials on youtube to use it on PC, so 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.730
 I'm not going to explain them, because as you know I do not have a PC, however if you had any 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.420
 Doubt, you tell me that I will do everything possible to help. 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.129
 To start the most important thing is that you have bluetooth on your Mac, it is the way in which 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:52.920
 the controls are communicated. 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.710
 We are going to install two third-party applications, for this it is important that in Settings, Security 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.649
 and privacy, you have the option to allow applications downloaded from any 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.680
 site. 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.539
 Well, the first thing you're going to download is the Open Emu, it's the best emulator I've seen 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:14.439
 for Mac. It works for a lot of consoles, Nes, SNES, Game Boy, Advance, Atari, Sega 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.399
 Saturn ... and in all we can configure the controls of the command. 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.509
 You enter the page itself and you download it has no science, because it has no loss. 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.039
 The good thing about this emulator is that once you download it and start playing games, the same 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.249
 program sorts it according to which platform it is and puts the corresponding cover. 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:37.209
 That is a pijada, but it is appreciated and makes it much more visual. 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:42.109
 Already in itself the emulator lets us connect a wii mote, which already facilitates us a lot 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.560
 the task, what happens is that for some games of Snes especially, the two buttons 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.359
 of wii mote fall short and you need a command in conditions. To configure a 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:58.599
 Pro controller we will download wjoy that allows us to connect any Wii Remote 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:12.440
 You go to Google and put Wjoy, the first thing that comes out and download the latest version and directly you download 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.900
 It has very few options. We are interested in 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.739
 Begin Discovery which is to find the command you want to synchronize, simply 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.780
 press this option and the second press the Sync button of your command, for those who do not know it is 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.610
 the red button, in some wii mote is out in others is where the batteries and in 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.659
 the case of pro control is behind 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.599
 I've only seen one problem with the app and that is that when you synchronize your command with this application 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.650
 If you want to use it again on your console you have to re-synchronize it and it's a 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.180
 little pain. 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.090
 Once synchronized we will get into the emulator's adjustment menu, inside the own 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.099
 game and there we configure the command. It's so simple that I doubt you have a problem. 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.409
 And now you only have to enjoy all the games you want. I leave you a description 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.870
 the page that I have been using all my life. It has all the classics and without having to 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.670
 register or anything. 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.390
 I hope you liked this video. You already know, like if it was useful for you, share it 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.140
 with your friends, subscribe if you are not yet and comment. 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.499
 Thank you very much everyone for watching this video, We are already more than 30! Let's see if we can grow 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:19.790
 a little more. Regards and until next time.
