photography for Lytro this is all new
technology<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> lot<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.090> us<00:00:30.179> photographers

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
technology to a lot of us photographers

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.049 
technology to a lot of us photographers
and<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.070> second<00:00:32.520> generation<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and this is the second generation the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.319 
and this is the second generation the
new<00:00:33.329> model<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.410> saw<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> little<00:00:35.579> square

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
new model we all saw the little square

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.119 
new model we all saw the little square
light<00:00:36.899> row<00:00:37.079> when<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.350> first<00:00:37.500> came<00:00:37.710> out<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
light row when it first came out and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.310 
light row when it first came out and
this<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.760> lot<00:00:38.969> different<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:39.570> tell<00:00:39.930> people

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
this is a lot different but tell people

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.830 
this is a lot different but tell people
what<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.280> all<00:00:41.430> about<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.690> light

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
what is this all about so the light

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.750 
what is this all about so the light
field<00:00:43.079> camera<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.800> produces<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> very

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
field camera it produces a very

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.279 
field camera it produces a very
different<00:00:45.300> image<00:00:45.539> than<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:46.079> conventional

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
different image than a conventional

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.410 
different image than a conventional
camera<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.399> conventional<00:00:47.879> camera<00:00:48.239> will

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
camera the conventional camera will

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.360 
camera the conventional camera will
capture<00:00:49.110> three-dimensional<00:00:49.950> data<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
capture three-dimensional data in the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.459 
capture three-dimensional data in the
field<00:00:50.579> into<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> single<00:00:51.629> plane<00:00:51.930> which<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.320> what

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
field into a single plane which is what

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.049 
field into a single plane which is what
we're<00:00:52.590> used<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.460> kind<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.730> actually

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
we're used to this kind of actually

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.330 
we're used to this kind of actually
captures<00:00:54.420> three-dimensional<00:00:55.260> data<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.250> you

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
captures three-dimensional data so you

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.729 
captures three-dimensional data so you
can<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> file<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.690> being<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.260> deep

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
can think of the file as being a deep

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.040 
can think of the file as being a deep
file<00:00:59.129> right<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.300> lot<00:01:00.870> of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
file right it's it's a lot of

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.299 
file right it's it's a lot of
information<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.680> there<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.160> can

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
information in there and then you can

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.979 
information in there and then you can
move<00:01:02.460> around<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> bunch<00:01:03.840> of

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
move around in there with a bunch of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.690 
move around in there with a bunch of
different<00:01:04.080> deliverables<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.159> are<00:01:05.489> very

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
different deliverables that are very

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.950 
different deliverables that are very
unique<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.270> people<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.689> never<00:01:06.840> seen

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
unique that people have never seen

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.710 
unique that people have never seen
before<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.520> totally<00:01:09.060> changes<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
before so this totally changes the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.630 
before so this totally changes the
concept<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.500> depth<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.950> field<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.610> a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
concept of depth of field for a

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.570 
concept of depth of field for a
photographer<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.930> does<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.740> does<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
photographer it does it does that the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
photographer it does it does that the
field<00:01:14.790> still<00:01:15.060> exists<00:01:15.630> right<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.200> doesn't

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
field still exists right that doesn't

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.350 
field still exists right that doesn't
change<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.040> actually<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.000> think<00:01:18.150> about

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
change and actually if you think about

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.270 
change and actually if you think about
depth<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.780> field<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.530> understand<00:01:20.009> like

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
depth of field you can understand like

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.859 
depth of field you can understand like
field<00:01:20.520> photography<00:01:21.000> very<00:01:21.180> well<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.750> are<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
field photography very well there are a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.929 
field photography very well there are a
lot<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.020> similarities<00:01:22.680> very<00:01:23.280> interesting<00:01:23.820> and

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
lot of similarities very interesting and

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.789 
lot of similarities very interesting and
there<00:01:24.090> there<00:01:24.420> are<00:01:24.600> specific<00:01:25.140> tools<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.680> you

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
there there are specific tools that you

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.859 
there there are specific tools that you
provide<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.790> help<00:01:27.030> people<00:01:27.210> understand<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
provide to help people understand that

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.600 
provide to help people understand that
when<00:01:28.049> they're<00:01:28.229> capturing<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.799> image<00:01:29.070> that's

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
when they're capturing the image that's

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.340 
when they're capturing the image that's
correct<00:01:30.000> one<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.329> big<00:01:30.479> challenges<00:01:30.750> when

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
correct one of the big challenges when

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
correct one of the big challenges when
using<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:32.189> light-filled<00:01:32.729> camera<00:01:33.150> is

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
using a light-filled camera is

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.179 
using a light-filled camera is
understanding<00:01:34.110> where's<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.530> front<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
understanding where's the front of the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.399 
understanding where's the front of the
light<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> reflexil<00:01:36.240> range<00:01:36.509> where<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
light of the reflexil range where is the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.109 
light of the reflexil range where is the
back<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.799> range<00:01:38.189> because<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.909> need<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
back of that range because you need to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.580 
back of that range because you need to
fill<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.420> range<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.869> information<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.500> get

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
fill that range with information to get

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.410 
fill that range with information to get
a<00:01:40.650> good<00:01:40.799> interactive<00:01:41.189> photograph<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.119> we<00:01:42.270> do

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
a good interactive photograph so we do

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.539 
a good interactive photograph so we do
provide<00:01:42.570> tools<00:01:43.170> there's<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.799> light<00:01:44.340> Pro

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
provide tools there's the light Pro

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.280 
provide tools there's the light Pro

right<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.200> kind<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.500> looks<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.740> focus

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
right and it kind of looks like focus

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.429 
right and it kind of looks like focus
peaking<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.700> other<00:01:57.030> cameras<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.200> kind

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
peaking on other cameras that that kind

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.530 
peaking on other cameras that that kind
of<00:01:58.530> set<00:01:59.040> up<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.430> screen<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.450> just

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
of set up on the screen it is it's just

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.120 
of set up on the screen it is it's just
like<00:02:00.810> focus<00:02:01.110> peaking<00:02:01.259> near<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.710> far<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:01.979> then

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
like focus peaking near and far and then

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.249 
like focus peaking near and far and then
there's<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.340> focus<00:02:02.579> histogram<00:02:03.240> or<00:02:03.479> depth

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
there's a focus histogram or depth

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.940 
there's a focus histogram or depth
histogram<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:05.640> see

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
histogram so you can see

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.999 
histogram so you can see
in<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.369> histogram<00:02:08.360> type<00:02:08.780> manner<00:02:08.990> how<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.530> image

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
in a histogram type manner how the image

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.040 
in a histogram type manner how the image
you<00:02:10.399> know<00:02:10.490> where<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.789> areas<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.360> diversity<00:02:11.599> in

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
you know where the areas of diversity in

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.380 
you know where the areas of diversity in
the<00:02:12.080> jar<00:02:12.319> let's<00:02:13.280> talk<00:02:13.489> about<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:14.000> finished

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
the jar let's talk about the finished

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.839 
the jar let's talk about the finished
image<00:02:14.569> that<00:02:14.930> comes<00:02:15.110> out<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.319> this<00:02:15.500> is<00:02:15.770> is<00:02:16.010> it

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
image that comes out of this is is it

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.660 
image that comes out of this is is it
what<00:02:17.360> kind<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:17.660> finished<00:02:18.050> images<00:02:18.670> can

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
what kind of finished images can

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.729 
what kind of finished images can
photographers<00:02:20.630> produce<00:02:21.080> using<00:02:21.620> this

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
photographers produce using this

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.530 
photographers produce using this
technology<00:02:22.130> how<00:02:22.520> big<00:02:22.849> what<00:02:23.300> kind<00:02:23.480> of

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
technology how big what kind of

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.910 
technology how big what kind of
resolution<00:02:23.810> how<00:02:24.140> does<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.350> compare

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
resolution how does that compare

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.530 
resolution how does that compare
okay<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:25.220> resolution<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.060> different<00:02:26.390> with

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
okay so resolution is different with

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.970 
okay so resolution is different with
this<00:02:26.690> camera<00:02:26.900> because<00:02:27.410> we're<00:02:27.800> capturing

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
this camera because we're capturing

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.430 
this camera because we're capturing
three-dimensional<00:02:28.910> data<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.750> file<00:02:29.989> is<00:02:30.140> 50

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
three-dimensional data so the file is 50

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.960 
three-dimensional data so the file is 50
megabytes<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.069> that<00:02:31.430> would<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.819> would<00:02:31.910> say

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
megabytes and that would you would say

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.280 
megabytes and that would you would say
okay<00:02:32.239> that's<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.450> great<00:02:32.569> file<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:32.870> can<00:02:33.080> make<00:02:33.260> a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
okay that's a great file I can make a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.320 
okay that's a great file I can make a
huge<00:02:33.620> print<00:02:34.010> right<00:02:34.400> but<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.790> represents

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
huge print right but that represents

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.809 
huge print right but that represents
three<00:02:35.510> dimensional<00:02:35.959> data<00:02:36.110> so<00:02:36.830> when<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:37.670> have

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
three dimensional data so when you have

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.280 
three dimensional data so when you have
the<00:02:37.910> light<00:02:38.060> field<00:02:38.360> if<00:02:38.599> you<00:02:38.720> slice<00:02:39.019> through

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
the light field if you slice through

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.870 
the light field if you slice through
however<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:39.800> want<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.069> cut<00:02:40.250> through<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.550> which

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
however you want to cut through it which

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.729 
however you want to cut through it which
you<00:02:41.239> can<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.660> many<00:02:41.780> different<00:02:42.019> ways<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.620> make

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
you can in many different ways and make

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.070 
you can in many different ways and make
many<00:02:43.280> different<00:02:43.610> effects<00:02:43.880> output<00:02:44.690> is<00:02:44.810> still

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
many different effects output is still

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.590 
many different effects output is still
like<00:02:45.380> TIFF<00:02:45.860> or<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:46.040> JPEG<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:47.000> would<00:02:47.209> be<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.360> four

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
like TIFF or a JPEG that would be a four

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.900 
like TIFF or a JPEG that would be a four
megapixel<00:02:48.110> file<00:02:48.319> okay<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.160> but<00:02:49.489> then<00:02:49.700> the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
megapixel file okay so but then the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.240 
megapixel file okay so but then the
beauty<00:02:50.299> of<00:02:50.330> this<00:02:50.600> still<00:02:51.019> image<00:02:51.170> is<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.620> can<00:02:51.890> do

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
beauty of this still image is I can do

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.580 
beauty of this still image is I can do
multiples<00:02:52.880> so<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.750> could<00:02:53.900> do<00:02:53.959> one<00:02:54.110> focused<00:02:54.470> on

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
multiples so you could do one focused on

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.160 
multiples so you could do one focused on
you<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:55.160> could<00:02:55.310> do<00:02:55.430> one<00:02:55.640> focused<00:02:56.239> on<00:02:56.390> me<00:02:56.660> you

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
you you could do one focused on me you

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.420 
you you could do one focused on me you
doing<00:02:57.470> with<00:02:57.590> both<00:02:57.739> of<00:02:57.860> us<00:02:57.950> sharp<00:02:58.190> in<00:02:58.370> the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
doing with both of us sharp in the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.009 
doing with both of us sharp in the
background<00:02:58.790> sharp<00:02:59.060> both<00:02:59.420> of<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.690> sharp<00:02:59.900> the

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
background sharp both of the sharp the

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.440 
background sharp both of the sharp the
background<00:03:00.410> soft<00:03:00.709> we<00:03:01.310> could<00:03:01.430> be<00:03:01.549> f-16<00:03:02.090> on<00:03:02.269> us

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
background soft we could be f-16 on us

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.259

f1<00:03:03.049> on<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.290> background<00:03:03.739> we<00:03:04.430> could<00:03:04.640> do<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.150> like

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
f1 on the background we could do it like

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.640 
f1 on the background we could do it like
