a little bit of a race for second that
first<00:02:10.979> turn<00:02:11.190> was<00:02:11.459> crucial<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.180> the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
first turn was crucial and the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.380 
first turn was crucial and the
good<00:02:12.950> years<00:02:13.219> from<00:02:13.489> he<00:02:13.670> might<00:02:13.849> go<00:02:14.030> Panthers

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
good years from he might go Panthers

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.660

have<00:02:14.840> come<00:02:15.079> out<00:02:15.230> strong<00:02:15.590> right<00:02:15.890> now<00:02:15.920> but<00:02:16.459> there

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
have come out strong right now but there

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.670 
have come out strong right now but there
are<00:02:16.730> two<00:02:16.939> turns<00:02:17.269> left<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.659> these<00:02:18.200> two<00:02:18.439> tunes

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
are two turns left and these two tunes

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.920 
are two turns left and these two tunes
would<00:02:18.859> also<00:02:19.099> be<00:02:19.430> crucial<00:02:19.879> to<00:02:19.909> making<00:02:20.390> sure<00:02:20.599> you

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930
