00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.029
 travelers on the intercity between roosendaal and zwolle 

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:05.240
 Tuesday morning surprised by a bomb report 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.510
 the train traffic to and from the forest stopped immediately after the report 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.179
 the man walked into the train to have activated explosives on arrival at den 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.480
 Bosch employees arrested the NS employees and handed them over to the 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.720
 law enforcement 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.390
 the man has been insured 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.140
 number provided not issued the first time 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.999
 I am sorry that the did not get it 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.460
 only with words 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.689
 but yes sir who was abused with so was he to drain I love the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.689
 Dutch load the technical defect bin 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.110
 construction boarding the train 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.520
 then there was a passenger who is on the pvv against the plans of the walk for a moment 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.380
 more 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.700
 it was also quickly ns staff at 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.590
 today found for all those sirens 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.700
 the police were on the way the police was very bulletproof 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.700
 got the British soldier very quickly last night 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 afterwards robe recommended to leave this 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.770
 he sat on a terrace in the square 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.700
 and all of a sudden I saw people watching and the man got out of painacker witteman 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.440
 be late 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.300
 I will not get out of the car with five police officers 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.330
 the radio was removed at an auction of nsl 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.440
 and I know where that man 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.970
 yes you are going to see a man arresting what I think actually right away 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.440
 indeed there will be such a bomb alert again 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.150
 according to the first reports explosive were indeed found in the train 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.450
 but this was later by the police Beverwijk our denied and so 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.240
 the report to us at the center was received by governments about 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.299
 the control room that indeed something would have been hit can be hit by people who 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.190
 seen something that was going on last Saturday 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.130
 anyway that's too quickly confirmed by an employee of the ns of easter 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.430
 they must of course did research once again wake up there are there 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.010
 two tracking dogs and one special and specialized in explosives too 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.780
 recognize 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.049
 those that are freely translated means an increase in the red signal fire master 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.250
 of course we just have the bomb scouts and the people from the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.960
 explosives clearance service and the regular staff that he is working on the 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.049
 talk to people 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.959
 all premises within a radius of 250 meters were evacuated and this area became 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.260
 trimmed with ribbons 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.819
 hundreds of travelers then stranded at the central station of den bos 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.769
 it was very busy and everyone wondering if it was not to buildings 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.079
 where everyone before he has been really easy 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.589
 just before 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:31.639
 I have to go to Nijmegen 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.639

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:37.449
