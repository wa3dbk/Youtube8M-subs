00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.219
 it is quite enough time the mere 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:57.019

00:02:52.219 --> 00:03:00.409
 the blue sign says not to pass seeds nor 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.599

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.810
 A) Yes 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.600
 and then you can not record in that part 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.150
 there there I hid something the camera the 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.810

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.520

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.710
 suckers and things like they have 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.100
 all the authority and all that because then neither 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.100
 fart 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:42.150
 and there we go there we are in the USA 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.570
 there is what we are going to enter are some 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.970
 boxes and things like that and one thing that yes 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.390
 I wanted to comment is that in the USA 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.569
 practically in each 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.830
 in each corner and a lot of semi cars 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:01.340
 new or things like that 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.560
 if it is if it is very past there is more 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.450
 advance will be seen in the video according to 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.970
 I think so 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.590
 well there are little games under the bridge 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.690
 and crossing that bridge and practically 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.920
 you're there in all the shops there says 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.920
 welcome to texas 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.040
 you are welcome 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.510
 well there already already we touched the green in 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.510
 the traffic light and things like that 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.220
 and a highway 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.000
 and virtually every city ​​in 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.070
 USA 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.070
 they seem the same to me I do not know why 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:46.360
 something weird that 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.870
 but good 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.610
 I think that if it's more advanced about the 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.610
 cars of those that I tell you 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:04.029
 look there is a lot of cars and then 

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:09.280
 the other side was another and then we 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:11.980
 is another, that is, there are too many 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.850
 too shamelessly I do not know why but 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.850
 good 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.060
 to what follows in the walt bar mir me 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.900

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.409

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:32.159

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.670

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:44.120

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:46.449

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.819
 American 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.240
