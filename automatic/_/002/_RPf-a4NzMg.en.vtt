00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 because this master of emotional ecology 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.340
 we are aware that in certain 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.950
 moment of our life is important 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.139
 that we choose to conform for every problem 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.809
 or be part of the ecology solution 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.000
 emotional proposes to be part of this 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.189
 solution that we have to build 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.260
 together from the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.930
 research we do and its 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.699
 implementation of the different 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.039
 tools of the metaphors of the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.700
 stories of the resources of the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.210
 questionnaires of the systems that 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.120
 we are improving and applying we see that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.980
 be useful it is important that what 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.170
 we share with other people during 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.850
 six years we put it to the test in our 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.100
 own organization forming our 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.379
 own professionals and if it reveals a 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.600
 really useful tool from 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.949
 there we already propose the ecology master 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.350
 emotional 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.930
 this master has basically two axes 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.480
 important 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.010
 of objective on the one hand the own 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.050
 growth of the professional who 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.460
 participates in it during these two years 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:10.390
 this person is going to live is going to explore 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.800
 your own inner territories is going to 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.770
 update your resources your sources of 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.170
 energy is going to analyze what the climate is 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.930
 emotional as the car manages all 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.560
 these resources will review how are your 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.900
 links in some way will perform 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.020
 a process of personal growth and 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.540
 The time will know what is the proposal 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.090
 in an already profound way of ecology 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.720
 emotional so that in the second year 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.330
 all this can be basically 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.540
 applied the second year is going to be done 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.080
 a work already of co-creation of 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.940
 realization of material designs 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.009
 so that each of the professionals 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.700
 whatever the system in which 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.399
 participate can create something that improves it 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.950
 always on the basis that he will work with 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.930
 people will work to train and 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.060
 to give them tools for management 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.850
 of this affective world in such a way that 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.890
 make a good team between the mind the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.920
 emotion and the action that is going to be done 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.130
 in each of these ecosystems 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.720
 This is our basic objective in the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.970
 divisions that we raise from the master's 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.520
 emotional ecology we observe that 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.120
 a large variety of people participate 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.600
 coming from very varied disciplines 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.910
 psychologists teachers teachers 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.140
 child education teachers 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.000
 social educators or workers 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:41.180
 social philosophers philologists people 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.120
 who work with the body dance the 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.200
 body expression 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.290
 physical education teachers musicians 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.239
 dance 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.879
 professionals who come from fields 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.209
 diverse as could also be the 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.640
 scope of economics business management 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.980
 human resources coach 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.879
 very diverse professionals 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.110
 an important world that we see that 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.879
 they especially value this master's 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.049
 world of health doctors and nurses 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.970
 people who are working with 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.860
 chronically ill with care 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.990
 palliative 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.240
 actually I would say that all those 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.880
 people who work with people who 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.130
 sometimes accompanied by landscapes 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.020
 difficult as it may be the health of the 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.970
 illness but also those 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.280
 people who work with people to 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.990
 get the best out of themselves to 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.570
 accompany them in the process of improvement 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.590
 person is a 210-hour program 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:44.800
 distributed in two years each course consists of 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.560
 of some theoretical modules in which 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.840
 let's work the following the first 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.260
 course that is always a weekend 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.290
 once a month the student will know 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.150
 the four areas four large areas of 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.090
 the emotional ecology territories 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.040
 climate energy and links in addition to the 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.110
 first metaphors and effort of the 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.510
 emotional ecology and what will it work 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.650
 very much linking it with one's life what 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.290
 what we call psychology and everyday life 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.160
 throughout these sessions the student 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.780
 will receive some letters to present 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.910
 the subject that will correspond to the 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.970
 next session and he will turn to 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.460
 make a return post session in 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.370
 form of report deepening and 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.680
 linking the concepts with one's own 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.110
 life or with what observes what happens in 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.500
 the world 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.450
 this interaction is going to be followed by a 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.030
 tutor a tutor who all year long goes to 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.920
 accompany him and he will give you feedback 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.530
 everything that he is doing during the 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.280
 course finish the first year with a job 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.350
 which is an individual project of some 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.960
 of the topics discussed that are linked 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.420
 with the interests of the student himself 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.300
 second course is already a course in which 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.900
 we already intend to work a lot with the 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.420
 design theme design application and 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.020
 facilitation also of groups or of 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.820
 projects the student from the 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.910
 different applications of ecology 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:17.030
 emotional in the family in the company in 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.370
 the hospitals in education in the field 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.340
 in which he decides to work is going to 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.750
 transport all these concepts of 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.600
 Emotional ecology and tools 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.030
 learned to make their own 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.490
 design of intervention or project to 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.340
 unfold will be accompanied by everything 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.190
 our team is going to expose you to your 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.960
 comrades will build with them and will 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.650
 to receive the full support of the team 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.570
 trainers 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.380
 emotional ecology so that your 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.240
 final project resulting 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.639
 really cover the expectations that the 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.410
 student had when he started this master 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.300
 We encourage you to participate in this network of 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:00.820
 Emotional ecology professionals 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.820
 current and future until very soon
