what<00:00:40.550> it<00:00:40.640> turned<00:00:40.820> out<00:00:40.880> to<00:00:41.030> be<00:00:41.060> until<00:00:41.870> the

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
what it turned out to be until the

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.510 
what it turned out to be until the
internal<00:00:42.290> temperature<00:00:42.380> is<00:00:42.770> about<00:00:43.040> a<00:00:43.100> hundred

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
fifty degrees then I took it I turned

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.469 
crust on there from all the spices and
herbs<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.079> put<00:01:58.289> on<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.329> then<00:02:00.329> what<00:02:00.450> I

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
herbs and I put on there and then what I

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.050 
herbs and I put on there and then what I
also<00:02:00.570> do<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.350> with<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.850> leftover<00:02:04.490> broth<00:02:05.490> from

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
also do is with the leftover broth from

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.380 
also do is with the leftover broth from
the<00:02:06.530> from<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.679> roasting<00:02:08.310> I'll<00:02:08.759> take<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the from the roasting I'll take that and

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.580 
the from the roasting I'll take that and
I'll<00:02:09.450> make<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.690> into<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> beef<00:02:10.110> stock<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:11.550> it

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
I'll make it into a beef stock so it

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.570 
I'll make it into a beef stock so it
just<00:02:13.590> turns<00:02:13.769> out<00:02:13.860> with<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.220> can<00:02:14.340> use<00:02:14.430> that

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
just turns out with so you can use that

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.180 
just turns out with so you can use that
for<00:02:14.700> later<00:02:14.910> purposes<00:02:15.620> okay

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.890 

they<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.580> slice<00:02:20.880> it

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.620 

there

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
there

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.860 
there
why<00:02:28.750> solution<00:02:29.380> like<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.530> said

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.180 

to<00:02:35.870> make<00:02:35.990> it

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
to make it

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.360 
to make it
whatever<00:02:37.550> so<00:02:37.820> I<00:02:37.850> do

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
whatever so I do

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.009 
whatever so I do
you<00:02:39.459> know<00:02:39.580> apportion<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.209> off<00:02:40.510> into<00:02:40.840> the

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
you know apportion it off into the

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.630 
you know apportion it off into the
plastic<00:02:41.650> bags

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
plastic bags

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.480 
plastic bags
I<00:02:42.700> do<00:02:43.300> have<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.750> food<00:02:44.200> saver

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
I do have a food saver

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.480 
I do have a food saver
and<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:47.030> also<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.630> very<00:02:47.990> very<00:02:48.350> good<00:02:48.740> way<00:02:49.160> to

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
and that is also a very very good way to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.180 
and that is also a very very good way to
save<00:02:50.210> your<00:02:50.480> your<00:02:50.840> meat<00:02:51.350> now<00:02:51.560> this<00:02:51.770> is<00:02:51.950> how<00:02:52.160> it

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
save your your meat now this is how it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.920 
save your your meat now this is how it
looks<00:02:52.490> when<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.820> comes<00:02:53.000> out<00:02:53.210> you<00:02:53.510> can't<00:02:53.720> get

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
looks when it comes out you can't get

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.390 
looks when it comes out you can't get
much<00:02:54.080> better<00:02:54.470> than<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:54.680> that's<00:02:55.040> for<00:02:55.280> darn

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
much better than that that's for darn

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.780 
much better than that that's for darn
sure

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
sure

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.090 
sure
and<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.840> it's<00:02:56.990> a<00:02:57.110> little<00:02:57.230> bit<00:02:57.380> on<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.860> little

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
and so it's a little bit on the a little

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.260 
and so it's a little bit on the a little
bit<00:02:58.190> on<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.310> rare<00:02:58.460> side<00:02:58.490> which<00:02:58.910> is<00:02:59.060> good

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
bit on the rare side which is good

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.440 
bit on the rare side which is good
because<00:02:59.390> we<00:02:59.480> like<00:02:59.720> it<00:02:59.750> that<00:02:59.900> way<00:03:00.050> and<00:03:00.640> so<00:03:01.640> we're

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
because we like it that way and so we're

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.840 
because we like it that way and so we're
just<00:03:02.480> going<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.780> continue<00:03:03.380> slicing<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.250> then

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
just going to continue slicing and then

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.790 
just going to continue slicing and then
what<00:03:05.120> we'll<00:03:05.270> do<00:03:05.480> at<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.900> point<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.410> this<00:03:06.620> is

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
what we'll do at that point is this is

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.170 
what we'll do at that point is this is
one<00:03:11.800> about<00:03:12.800> seven<00:03:13.280> slices<00:03:13.490> there<00:03:13.910> I'll<00:03:14.000> do<00:03:14.150> a

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
one about seven slices there I'll do a

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.650 
one about seven slices there I'll do a
little<00:03:14.390> bit<00:03:14.480> more<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:18.970> then<00:03:19.970> I<00:03:20.000> can<00:03:20.390> maybe

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
little bit more and and then I can maybe

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.840 
little bit more and and then I can maybe
and<00:03:21.050> so<00:03:21.620> they<00:03:21.740> would<00:03:21.860> just<00:03:22.040> continue<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.580> slice

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
and so they would just continue to slice

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.309 
and so they would just continue to slice
it<00:03:23.090> and

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
it and

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.539 
it and
and<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.650> course<00:03:25.890> you're<00:03:26.010> not<00:03:26.099> you<00:03:26.250> put<00:03:26.370> into

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
and of course you're not you put into

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.850 
and of course you're not you put into
the<00:03:26.730> UH<00:03:26.879> into<00:03:27.120> baggies<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.379> want<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.709> make

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
the UH into baggies and you want to make

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.199 
the UH into baggies and you want to make
sure<00:03:29.189> that<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.640> do<00:03:29.849> that<00:03:31.489> so<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.700> take<00:03:32.939> it<00:03:32.970> out

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
sure that you do that so you take it out

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.729 
sure that you do that so you take it out
me<00:03:33.360> put<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.659> into<00:03:33.870> your<00:03:33.959> bag<00:03:34.140> easy<00:03:34.319> this<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.590> a

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
me put it into your bag easy this is a

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.830 
me put it into your bag easy this is a
bunk<00:03:35.040> baggy<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.760> kind<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.120> like<00:03:36.299> these<00:03:36.480> it's

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
bunk baggy and I kind of like these it's

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.780 
bunk baggy and I kind of like these it's
the<00:03:36.900> freezer<00:03:37.260> one<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:37.860> will<00:03:37.920> protect<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.730> a

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
the freezer one so it will protect it a

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.309 
the freezer one so it will protect it a
little<00:03:38.970> bit<00:03:39.090> better<00:03:39.209> but<00:03:39.930> if<00:03:40.049> you're<00:03:40.170> using

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
little bit better but if you're using

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.630 
little bit better but if you're using
your<00:03:40.560> food<00:03:40.739> saver<00:03:41.010> that's<00:03:41.250> also<00:03:41.489> going<00:03:41.579> to

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
your food saver that's also going to

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.860 
your food saver that's also going to
protect<00:03:41.819> because<00:03:42.120> it'll<00:03:42.329> suck<00:03:42.569> out<00:03:42.720> all<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
protect because it'll suck out all the

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.440 
protect because it'll suck out all the
air<00:03:43.220> but<00:03:44.220> make<00:03:44.400> sure<00:03:44.430> that<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.849> put<00:03:45.060> on<00:03:45.209> here

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
air but make sure that you put on here

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.360 
air but make sure that you put on here
that<00:03:46.200> what<00:03:46.409> it<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.530> in<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.860> date<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.099> you<00:03:47.220> put

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
that what it is in the date that you put

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.300 
that what it is in the date that you put
it<00:03:47.459> in<00:03:47.579> so<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.930> way<00:03:49.349> you<00:03:49.409> know<00:03:49.799> exactly

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
it in so that way you know exactly

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.539 
it in so that way you know exactly
what's<00:03:50.579> in<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:51.920> baggie<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.250> date<00:03:53.430> that

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
what's in that baggie and the date that

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.039 
what's in that baggie and the date that
it<00:03:53.640> went<00:03:53.790> in<00:03:53.849> so<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.180> keep<00:03:54.359> the<00:03:54.540> optimum

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
it went in so you keep the optimum

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.660 
it went in so you keep the optimum
freshness<00:03:55.500> so<00:03:55.709> so<00:03:56.310> we're<00:03:56.459> just<00:03:56.489> gonna

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
freshness so so we're just gonna

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.149 
freshness so so we're just gonna
continue<00:03:56.879> putting<00:03:57.329> this<00:03:57.510> up<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.680> is

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
continue putting this up and that is

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.099 
continue putting this up and that is
lunch<00:03:59.430> meat<00:03:59.640> it's<00:03:59.849> very<00:04:00.150> simple<00:04:00.629> very<00:04:00.959> easy

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
lunch meat it's very simple very easy

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.129 
lunch meat it's very simple very easy
and<00:04:02.090> it's<00:04:03.090> not<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.599> doesn't<00:04:03.629> have<00:04:03.870> any

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
and it's not it doesn't have any
