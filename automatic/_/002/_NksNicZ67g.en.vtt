00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.679
 take a karen leaf bend the hm2 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.250
 opened the next country must be very 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.900
 precise it is necessary to pray that this 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.880
 tip six times on the center line 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.240
 while keeping the tip down to 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.240
 right 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.559
 you get this form and you see 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:50.400
 that there remains a space here does the same 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.400
 thing on the other side 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.140
 open it all 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.760
 now you must have those prices there 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.000
 with a shape of a and a small space 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.000
 in water 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.590
 redo the 1st prize then unfolded 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:42.229
 redo the second and then over 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:43.640
 first to get this form it takes 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.729
 pay this part along this 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.729
 line 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.130
 you get one to the pointu 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.540
 reopen the fold you just made 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.540
 and then and the inward 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.689
 close 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.720
 you now have the shape of a 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.970
 triangle which is the tip of the top on 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.970
 the center of the bottom line like this 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.600
 and 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.890
 c 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.359
 now you have to bend the tip in 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.549
 the other way while getting that this 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:47.209
 length 6 is equal with seven lengths 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:47.209
 which goes beyond here is a fold 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.129
 then it takes foot 7.6 that of the bottom towards 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.129
 this side 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.720
 then bend the tip in the other direction 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.670
 in the same way by letting the 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:14.590
 same length simply following 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:17.730
 this line makes a fold does the same 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.730
 thing on this side 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.330
 you now have the shape of your 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.330
 star 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.090
 it only has to close it 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.040
 put this part there under this part 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.040
 there to hold everything 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.300
 you have finished
