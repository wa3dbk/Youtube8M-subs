00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.170

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.080

 hair and slightly raised at the root and here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.870
 This will be such an iron necessarily 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.510
 I wrote down thermal protection specially 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.719

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.789
 blondes some kind of very cool 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.309
 I really liked the clamps 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.969
 Now further you will see what they are for. 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.710
 are needed 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.019
 and they need to do here 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.119
 such here by the way this is already too 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.520
 option cheat if you are with such 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.130
 lambs go to bed the morning you 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.260
 will be cool curls but we have the essence of 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.939
 friend we divided in my eight 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.869
 parts 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:21.240
 hair in order to twist the curls and 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.070
 each layer we will wind in 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.939
 different side here is the first layer we have 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.460
 wrapping goes to face the second layer will be 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.390
 from the face and this will help this way 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.200
 will help to make very beautiful voluminous 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.900
 curls and they they will not get off in one 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.640
 big curl if it would be if it 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.070
 there was a cheat one way 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.070
 so we twist the first layer to face 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.880
 [music] 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.880
 but 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:15.319
 but 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:18.409
 and the top strands we twist from the face 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.209
 get a very romantic image 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:23.730
 by the way there are some more secrets about 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.640
 whom the guys and I told me 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.829
 designed it in an article that you can 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.720

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.709

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:54.440
 [music]

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.589
 [music] 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:57.909
 myself 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:57.909
 [music] 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:29.620

 look at my pretty face i'm very 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.410
 pleased with the results of staining and 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.410
 curls that I later straighten by the way 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.260
 This is the oil that I also have at home 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:45.160
 and I often use it for tips 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.380
 I think they told men and 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.630
 all in all it's the final touches and 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.750
 a little bit we straighten the curls so as not to 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.260
 were more natural and accordingly 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:01.479
 and immediately goes moisturizing oil 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:03.580
 tips are laid out strands and all 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.680
