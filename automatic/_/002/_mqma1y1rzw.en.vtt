00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hi my name's Steve Hughes and in this

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.619 
hi my name's Steve Hughes and in this
short<00:00:02.639> tutorial<00:00:02.760> I'm<00:00:03.090> gonna<00:00:03.179> show<00:00:03.240> you<00:00:03.449> how<00:00:03.600> we

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
short tutorial I'm gonna show you how we

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.570 
short tutorial I'm gonna show you how we
can<00:00:03.929> create<00:00:04.200> or<00:00:04.710> how<00:00:04.859> we<00:00:04.920> could<00:00:05.100> model<00:00:05.400> the

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
can create or how we could model the

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.210 
can create or how we could model the
knurl<00:00:05.930> the<00:00:06.930> small<00:00:07.200> diamond<00:00:07.589> cut<00:00:07.830> here<00:00:08.069> that

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
knurl the small diamond cut here that

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.190 
knurl the small diamond cut here that
we've<00:00:08.309> seen<00:00:08.519> on<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.760> end<00:00:08.910> I'm<00:00:09.719> going<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.929> model

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
we've seen on the end I'm going to model

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.499 
we've seen on the end I'm going to model
this<00:00:10.349> in<00:00:10.650> Maya<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.550> I'm<00:00:12.000> going<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.179> start<00:00:12.389> with

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
this in Maya and I'm going to start with

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.200 
this in Maya and I'm going to start with
a<00:00:12.570> cylinder<00:00:12.929> rotated<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:13.980> Z<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.700> can<00:00:14.940> work<00:00:15.089> on

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
a cylinder rotated in Z so I can work on

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.060 
a cylinder rotated in Z so I can work on
it<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.389> little<00:00:15.540> easier<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:16.590> need<00:00:16.740> some<00:00:16.920> more

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
it a little easier we need some more

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.830 
it a little easier we need some more
detail<00:00:17.460> as<00:00:17.730> well<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.420> I'm<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.690> change

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
detail as well so I'm going to change

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.570 
detail as well so I'm going to change
the<00:00:18.990> subdivisions<00:00:19.619> along<00:00:19.800> its<00:00:19.980> height<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.279> six

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
the subdivisions along its height to six

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.970 
the subdivisions along its height to six
so<00:00:21.300> we've<00:00:21.449> got<00:00:21.600> some<00:00:21.779> extra<00:00:22.199> information<00:00:22.320> here

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
so we've got some extra information here

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.460 
so we've got some extra information here
that<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.400> start<00:00:23.670> modeling<00:00:24.060> now<00:00:25.050> drop<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.410> a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
that we can start modeling now drop to a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.230 
that we can start modeling now drop to a
front<00:00:25.740> view<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.699> select<00:00:26.970> all<00:00:27.210> of

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
front view so that I can select all of

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.179 
front view so that I can select all of
the<00:00:27.420> faces<00:00:27.570> very<00:00:28.080> quickly<00:00:28.380> through<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
the faces very quickly through the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.700 
the faces very quickly through the
center<00:00:29.580> there<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:29.939> what<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.810> want<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.260> do<00:00:31.439> is

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
center there and what we want to do is

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.069 
center there and what we want to do is
create<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.340> diamond<00:00:32.880> shape<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.899> can

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
create a diamond shape that we can

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.520 
create a diamond shape that we can
extrude<00:00:34.640> however<00:00:35.870> obviously<00:00:36.870> we<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.260> small

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
extrude however obviously we have small

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
extrude however obviously we have small
squares<00:00:37.950> at<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.190> moment<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:39.030> could<00:00:39.239> use

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
squares at the moment and we could use

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.420 
squares at the moment and we could use
edit<00:00:39.660> polygons<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.320> split<00:00:40.590> polygon<00:00:40.770> tool<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
edit polygons to split polygon tool and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.639 
edit polygons to split polygon tool and
start<00:00:41.850> cutting<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.420> our<00:00:42.570> shape<00:00:42.899> but<00:00:43.530> that

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
start cutting up our shape but that

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.260 
start cutting up our shape but that
would<00:00:43.800> take<00:00:43.980> quite<00:00:44.129> some<00:00:44.430> time<00:00:44.489> especially

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
would take quite some time especially

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.580 
would take quite some time especially
when<00:00:45.539> my<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.750> will<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.350> us

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
when my I will do it for us

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.380 
when my I will do it for us
under<00:00:46.980> polygons<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.210> click

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
under polygons you can just click

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.020 
under polygons you can just click
triangulate<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:50.010> all<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> edges

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
triangulate now I have all of the edges

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.360 
triangulate now I have all of the edges
that<00:00:51.180> we<00:00:51.300> need<00:00:51.510> however<00:00:52.500> what<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.340> a

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
that we need however what we have is a

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.310 
that we need however what we have is a
sawtooth<00:00:54.149> where<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> goes<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.230> then

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
sawtooth where it goes up and then

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.229 
sawtooth where it goes up and then
straight<00:00:55.649> down<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.430> we're<00:00:56.550> after<00:00:56.699> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
straight down and what we're after is

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.910 
straight down and what we're after is
more<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.600> seesaw<00:00:57.989> shape<00:00:58.289> where<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.590> goes<00:00:58.710> up

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
more of a seesaw shape where it goes up

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.720 
more of a seesaw shape where it goes up
down<00:00:59.370> up<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.120> down<00:01:00.710> again<00:01:01.710> very<00:01:02.070> quick<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.550> do

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
down up and down again very quick to do

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.939 
down up and down again very quick to do
just<00:01:03.510> drop<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.899> perspective<00:01:04.110> view<00:01:04.470> what

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
just drop to the perspective view what

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.200 
just drop to the perspective view what
we're<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> do<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.460> select<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> edges

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
we're going to do is select the edges

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.480 
we're going to do is select the edges
and<00:01:06.299> I'm<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> select<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.990> edges<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and I'm going to select the edges on the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.000 
and I'm going to select the edges on the
second<00:01:09.180> row<00:01:09.330> press<00:01:09.750> shift<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> select<00:01:10.500> each<00:01:10.830> of

second row press shift to select each of

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.730 
second row press shift to select each of
those<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> fourth<00:01:12.510> row<00:01:12.869> because

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
those and on the fourth row because

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.990 
those and on the fourth row because
these<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> edges<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.700> want<00:01:14.939> to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
these are the edges that we want to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.080 
these are the edges that we want to
reverse<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.710> I'm<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:16.979> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.159> go<00:01:18.000> around

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
reverse so I'm just going to go around

and click shift select on each of these

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.359 
and click shift select on each of these
edges<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.990> careful<00:01:22.350> when<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
drag the mouse other ways you could

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.649 
drag the mouse other ways you could
select<00:01:26.130> through<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> object<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.270> select

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
select through the object and select

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.149 
select through the object and select
some<00:01:27.810> edges<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.290> you're<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.680> after<00:01:31.040> this<00:01:32.040> is

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
some edges that you're not after this is

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.770 
some edges that you're not after this is
probably<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> longest<00:01:32.790> part<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.509> whole

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
probably the longest part of the whole

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.200 
probably the longest part of the whole
modeling<00:01:34.140> process<00:01:37.400> just<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.520> few<00:01:38.729> more<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> do

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
modeling process just a few more to do

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.260 
modeling process just a few more to do
now

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.830 

last<00:01:46.270> view<00:01:50.640> let's<00:01:51.640> do<00:01:51.760> a<00:01:51.790> quick<00:01:52.030> check<00:01:52.060> yeah<00:01:52.690> we

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
last view let's do a quick check yeah we

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.660 
last view let's do a quick check yeah we
got<00:01:52.990> one<00:01:53.170> face<00:01:53.470> or<00:01:53.800> rather<00:01:54.040> one<00:01:54.220> edge<00:01:54.370> that<00:01:54.580> we

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
got one face or rather one edge that we

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.150 
got one face or rather one edge that we
don't<00:01:54.850> want<00:01:55.090> there<00:01:56.760> that<00:01:57.760> looks<00:01:58.030> like<00:01:58.300> it<00:01:59.160> okay

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
don't want there that looks like it okay

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.700 
don't want there that looks like it okay
and<00:02:00.400> we<00:02:00.729> go<00:02:00.850> up<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:01.120> edit<00:02:01.270> polygons<00:02:01.840> flip

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
and we go up to edit polygons flip

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.780 
and we go up to edit polygons flip
triangle<00:02:03.190> edge<00:02:03.660> now<00:02:04.660> we<00:02:04.720> have<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:06.400> seesaw

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
triangle edge now we have the seesaw

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.790 
triangle edge now we have the seesaw
shape<00:02:06.820> that<00:02:07.210> we're<00:02:07.330> after<00:02:07.479> okay<00:02:08.440> let's<00:02:08.679> drop

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
shape that we're after okay let's drop

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.370 
shape that we're after okay let's drop
back<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.190> front<00:02:09.520> view<00:02:09.640> again<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:11.080> it's<00:02:11.230> still

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
back to a front view again so it's still

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.080 
back to a front view again so it's still
not<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.560> diamond<00:02:12.040> it's<00:02:12.310> still<00:02:12.520> just<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.790> seesaw

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
not a diamond it's still just a seesaw

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.229 
not a diamond it's still just a seesaw
shape<00:02:13.170> but<00:02:14.170> if<00:02:14.410> we<00:02:14.590> select<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.920> vertices<00:02:15.250> here

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
shape but if we select the vertices here

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.180 
shape but if we select the vertices here
and<00:02:17.070> here<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.510> then<00:02:19.510> we<00:02:19.720> click<00:02:20.260> eetu<00:02:20.860> bring<00:02:21.070> up

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
and here and then we click eetu bring up

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.550 
and here and then we click eetu bring up
the<00:02:21.310> rotate<00:02:21.670> tool<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.930> probably<00:02:23.230> can't<00:02:23.470> see

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
the rotate tool you probably can't see

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.130 
the rotate tool you probably can't see
that<00:02:23.709> so<00:02:24.130> let's<00:02:24.430> move<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.910> over<00:02:25.020> we're<00:02:26.020> going

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
that so let's move that over we're going

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.170 
that so let's move that over we're going
to<00:02:26.230> rotate<00:02:26.350> in<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.800> y-direction<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.670> then

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
to rotate in the y-direction and then

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.680 
to rotate in the y-direction and then
just<00:02:28.600> eyeball<00:02:29.020> it<00:02:29.050> here<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.860> can<00:02:30.010> see<00:02:30.690> we've

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
just eyeball it here you can see we've

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.460 
just eyeball it here you can see we've
now<00:02:31.720> created<00:02:32.080> all<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.470> diamond<00:02:32.800> shapes<00:02:34.470> we

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
now created all of the diamond shapes we

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.320 
now created all of the diamond shapes we
have<00:02:35.650> create<00:02:35.950> small<00:02:36.220> triangles<00:02:36.730> however<00:02:37.000> and

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
have create small triangles however and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.440 
have create small triangles however and
what<00:02:37.510> we're<00:02:37.630> after<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.530> more<00:02:39.400> solid<00:02:40.060> square

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
what we're after is a more solid square

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.390 
what we're after is a more solid square
shape<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.350> I'm<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:41.709> going<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:41.980> select<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
shape so I'm just going to select the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.340 
shape so I'm just going to select the

all those edges press delete and they're
gone<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:55.420> we<00:02:55.510> do<00:02:55.630> have<00:02:55.810> rather<00:02:56.049> elongated

gone and we do have rather elongated
diamonds<00:02:58.209> at<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.360> moment<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.049> I'm<00:02:59.230> going<00:02:59.380> to

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
diamonds at the moment so I'm going to

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.830 
diamonds at the moment so I'm going to
select<00:02:59.590> these<00:02:59.830> faces<00:03:00.299> press<00:03:01.299> R<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.600> bring<00:03:01.750> up

select these faces press R to bring up

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.870 
select these faces press R to bring up
the<00:03:01.959> scale<00:03:02.230> tool<00:03:02.530> scale<00:03:03.040> them<00:03:03.220> in<00:03:03.370> until

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
the scale tool scale them in until

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.720 
the scale tool scale them in until
they're<00:03:04.060> more<00:03:04.360> of<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.540> square<00:03:04.750> shape<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.730> now

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
they're more of a square shape and now

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.360 
they're more of a square shape and now
we<00:03:06.790> can<00:03:07.120> extrude<00:03:07.570> those<00:03:07.780> edges<00:03:08.190> now<00:03:09.190> if<00:03:09.250> you're

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
we can extrude those edges now if you're

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.520 
we can extrude those edges now if you're
go<00:03:09.459> in<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.640> channel<00:03:10.000> box<00:03:10.150> you'll<00:03:10.780> find<00:03:11.110> that

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
go in the channel box you'll find that

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.350 
go in the channel box you'll find that
we<00:03:11.709> have<00:03:11.860> keep<00:03:12.070> faces<00:03:12.459> together<00:03:12.760> set<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.180> 1

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
we have keep faces together set to 1

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.690 
we have keep faces together set to 1
we've<00:03:14.170> put<00:03:14.320> in<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.500> 0<00:03:14.769> we<00:03:15.010> can<00:03:15.190> change<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.640> to

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
we've put in a 0 we can change that to

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.539 
we've put in a 0 we can change that to
off<00:03:16.000> that<00:03:16.720> now<00:03:16.870> allows<00:03:17.170> us<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.650> use<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.250> scale

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
off that now allows us to use the scale

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.060 
off that now allows us to use the scale
option<00:03:19.060> if<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.080> drop<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.320> a<00:03:20.470> perspective<00:03:20.769> view

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
option if I drop to a perspective view

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.300 
option if I drop to a perspective view
again<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:21.670> scale<00:03:22.299> for<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.720> extrude<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.830> you

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
again a scale for the extrude and you

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.380 
again a scale for the extrude and you
can<00:03:24.459> see<00:03:24.640> here<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:24.970> we<00:03:25.239> now<00:03:25.390> have<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:27.090> nice<00:03:28.090> set

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
can see here that we now have a nice set

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.630 
can see here that we now have a nice set
you<00:03:28.750> have<00:03:28.840> two<00:03:29.049> choices<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.530> could<00:03:30.010> scale<00:03:30.610> it

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
you have two choices you could scale it

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.910 
you have two choices you could scale it
down<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.209> single<00:03:31.420> point<00:03:31.709> personally<00:03:32.709> I<00:03:32.769> like

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
down to a single point personally I like

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.699 
down to a single point personally I like
to<00:03:32.950> like<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.519> leave<00:03:33.670> part<00:03:34.150> of<00:03:34.269> a<00:03:34.360> flat<00:03:34.570> surface

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
to like to leave part of a flat surface

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.170 
to like to leave part of a flat surface
so<00:03:35.709> that<00:03:35.739> when<00:03:36.160> you're<00:03:36.370> rendering<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:37.030> might

so that when you're rendering you might

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.840 
so that when you're rendering you might
