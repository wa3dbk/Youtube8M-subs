00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.110
 two 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.890
 you always appreciate a delicious cake 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.910
 strawberries with cream that's why today I want 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.610
 share tea 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.770
 my own recipe so that you can 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.560
 you do in your house and sweeten in the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.460
 life to your loved ones what we're going to 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.489
 to make is first a vanilla sponge cake 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.870
 placing eggs in the blender 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.870
 sponge sugar 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.159
 we already have the egg to the point of ribbon 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.109
 I show how nice that is 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.450
 so you know exactly what I mean 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:19.259
 with that from the point of the ribbon 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.770
 look nothing else this air is just the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.710
 that will give it softness and fluffiness 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.259
 to our cake because we're not going to 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.140
 add no additives or powder to 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.060
 bake or baking or anything then 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.060
 a little bit of flour 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.120
 I have a well-greased mold and 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.120
 floured 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.010
 which I'm going to fill with my mix 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.509
 and just like that, we take it to the oven 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.060
 180 degrees around 20 minutes 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.619
 or until we touch it and come back 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.729
 our footprints as if it were a 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.729
 mattress this I'm going to unmold 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.860
 to be able to cool it 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.980
 create more lincoln to beat 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.980
 a good amount and beat 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.560
 look nothing but beauty of cream I am 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.870
 super fan because it's delicious because 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.410
 ride very well and because the poles 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.130
 they are really spectacular I'm going to 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.040
 slice my cake in two look at nothing 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.570
 more than tender and how soft it is 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.690
 this cake selected some strawberries and 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.900
 I'm going to cut several to put around 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.650
 of my cake 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.650
 cream 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.280
 and I put weights 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.280
 all around 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.420
 I put another bit of cream 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:33.349
 I put my second layer with a shower 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.670
 and a disposable sleeve finished off 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.670
 decorate everything above 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.260
 so pretty creampie 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.780
 and this strawberry cake with cream is 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.270
 ready I hope you repeat it but 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.840
 obviously with lincoln cream we'll see 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.840
 the next
