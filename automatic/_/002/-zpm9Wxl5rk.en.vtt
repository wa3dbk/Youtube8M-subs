00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:15.480
 Hello my friends I have something for you 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.710
 tell such an information 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.990
 so to speak 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.400
 something will change on mine 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.099
 channel namely model houses or resp 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.320
 the models will only be available in the future 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.510
 models are not pisten housing sea yes 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.960
 but there will still be runways 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.219
 do not give in this form anymore 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:44.670
 I'll be up to it again in the future 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.450
 normal world tree slopes become homes 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.670
 look like houses or me but or 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.370
 but I build them in caves or in the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.710
 Pure earth whatever it will be like 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.690
 said runway homes continue to exist 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.520
 will continue to give models like 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.600
 the mobile phone the car or the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.640
 pack of cigarettes 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.049
 I'll think of a lot here 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.979
 I've got even a few things 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.580
 rebuilt 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.380
 yes, they will be one or the other 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.960
 Maybe the model will become one too 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.390
 or have other function but not 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.860
 more in the extent as I said slopes 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.590
 most are actually slopes 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:25.259
 Homes are and models are supposed to be models 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:27.570
 be however a last model becomes 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.250
 it will become a runway house 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.740
 I always want to show this one here 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.689
 I did not build that here 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.650
 All I need is the runway systems 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.670
 with a yes i have yamaha ps he times 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.829
 asked for it 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.780
 He also wants to build something like that 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.030
 First of all, he shows that too 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.310
 yes and he has proven he can do so 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.799
 something he has built a nintendo ds here 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.399
 and I want to be very original 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:04.320
 let's say that song back there 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:07.950
 not so let load so that 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.760
 yamaha built psr here and we build it 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.290
 As a result, systems become one and the same 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.140
 the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.269
 were last slopes house in this art 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.099
 it will continue to be given 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.980
 of course and I will too 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.579
 continue with yamaha ps he together a pub 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.560
 It will be houses build models too 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.599
 But as I said models will be in 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.489
 stay models for the future that's it 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.400
 last model what a simultaneously 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.480
 We'll take a look at it 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.370
 what has been done so far so far 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.379
 Jammer scolded the display can 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.549
 you turn on that means that 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:48.170
 then turns to nice 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:51.919
 It takes a bit to get all this done 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:56.780
 so hello yes exactly 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:59.419
 yamaha hello okay as I said that can 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.680
 to turn it on you do it over here 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:06.409
 this occurs plates on the knob tirol 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.000
 yes that looks like y probably 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:12.769
 for yamaha psr 200 the y 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.189
 That's still printing at Nintendo 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.129
 Well let's go in and have a look 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:21.129
 that time 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.129
 Yes 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.030
 that's the three times three door way 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.540
 Here we have already started one 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.840
 we have a little bit of equipment here 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.240
 started to build the kitchen that is 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.130
 the kitchen is basically already built 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.010
 is not quite finished yet see here 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.780
 we do not have to get in there yet we want 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.190
 look at the one switch or with the one 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.200
 make a button or whatever 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.970
 or maybe we build right ones too 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.280
 track systems that blocks themselves 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.790
 we do not change that yet 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.090
 all 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.780
 and here is something very special 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:01.920
 spices puree jammer head powder 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:06.600
 lousy spice parsley phosphorus yes 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.090
 clear force we all need yes 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.230
 times really funny ideas apropos comic 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:17.010
 Ideas yes, imagine jammers headset 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.380
 is broken yes his parents say no you 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.780
 do not get a new rush then you sit 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.300
 at least not so often s.pc what makes 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:31.380
 Jammer he takes a ladder board 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:33.330
 and then build yourself a micro with 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.230
 that was micro record this was 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.030
 impossible 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.420
 So you have that's terrible 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.610
 Well, then my headset still went 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.770
 broken then there is the ear of my ear 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.180
 canceled what did I do then I 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.770
 I took two chopsticks and I have 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.760
 the whole thing is happening and my own 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.400
 headset again 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.230
 yes and then I thought about something 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.520
 I guess I would be there if it were 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.470
 headset would break 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.110
 he would probably not take chopsticks 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.670
 but always speaks of packing 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.370
 he would probably get one here 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:06.140
 Take a toilet brush and then have me like that 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.370
 The thought came to me so the thought 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.830
 people when he has such a cellphone in hand 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.460
 have and you just want in the moment 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.590
 where you make phone calls where you are 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.600
 both hands for needs then say that 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.600
 would look on you phone I need you 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.390
 take a short break what would you have to 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.230
 say he would say 'you, I had to 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:31.350
 short in the toilet stuck 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.250
 okay then we have here we do 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.130
 just continue 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.370
 then we have such a reach here 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.310
 built 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.630
 yes there it goes to the living room and there 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.580
 is then the dining area 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.140
 Let's go through the doors normally 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.440
 not like yamaha that goes through the 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.570
 I reach it so we do it 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.370
 times to here as I said, we are still 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.380
 not quite finished there is still a lot 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.540
 it will be more to build on it 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.880
 give space 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.470
 yes, there we will be 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.450
 light system is still being built i see 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.070
 I have already prepared lamps here 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.419
 that is not quite finished yet 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.140
 TV will be something then 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.590
 that should be done with a button 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.570
 be turned on 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.820
 yes there we will have a button 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.470
 build on it and maybe another 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.260
 small pest system with that at all 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.690
 I do not know yet 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:23.580
 maybe it's just down or something 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:27.630
 Well, here we have already the yes 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:30.180
