00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.850
 Y 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.580
 let's proceed to take a piece of 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.310
 meat I will throw out is to introduce a 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.810
 food inside another 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.380
 usually the wicking is done with strips 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.350
 of fat because its original function is 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.570
 that of contributing grease to pieces that are 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.150
 lean and they do not have that they do not have 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.030
 However, the fuselage is also 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.460
 can do with some vegetable or with 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.950
 some other food 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.290
 with which we want to provide a flavor 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.930
 characteristic to the piece for it in 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.470
 the wick that is a hollow needle in 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.850
 inside and with a spring 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.550
 we introduce the product to wick in 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.309
 this case the bacon 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.309
 and we introduce the wick into the meat 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.070
 once the wick is put into the meat 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.560
 we squeeze 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.560
 the spring towards the inside of the piece 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.260
 we are extracting 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.520
 the dora wick 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.009
 thus 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.369
 the fat has remained inside the 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.369
 piece 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.110
 if there were any 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.020
 somewhere outside the room the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.310
 we would cut in this way we have thrown 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.310
 a piece of meat
