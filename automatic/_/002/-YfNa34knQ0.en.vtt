00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.699 
it's just really weird I don't know if
it's<00:03:35.610> all<00:03:35.700> for<00:03:35.820> Jack<00:03:36.150> dollars<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:36.690> general<00:03:37.530> or

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
it's all for Jack dollars in general or

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.850 
it's all for Jack dollars in general or
just<00:03:38.690> scorpion<00:03:39.690> spear<00:03:40.080> but<00:03:40.500> what<00:03:40.740> I'm

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
just scorpion spear but what I'm

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.300 
just scorpion spear but what I'm
thinking<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:41.459> one<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:42.200> jade<00:03:43.200> special<00:03:43.740> moves<00:03:43.950> is

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
thinking is one of jade special moves is

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.640 
thinking is one of jade special moves is
she<00:03:44.760> turns<00:03:45.060> green<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.690> pretty<00:03:46.140> much<00:03:46.320> any

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
she turns green and pretty much any

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.830 
she turns green and pretty much any
projectile<00:03:47.340> just<00:03:47.670> goes<00:03:48.300> right<00:03:48.540> through<00:03:48.570> her

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
projectile just goes right through her

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.050 
projectile just goes right through her
body<00:03:49.020> so<00:03:49.830> here<00:03:50.040> there's<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.280> glitch<00:03:50.640> when<00:03:50.970> you

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
body so here there's a glitch when you

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.420 
body so here there's a glitch when you
go<00:03:51.209> against<00:03:51.540> super<00:03:51.840> character<00:03:52.350> that<00:03:52.920> she's

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
go against super character that she's

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.670 
go against super character that she's
immune<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:53.910> either<00:03:54.600> that's<00:03:55.020> a<00:03:55.200> glitch<00:03:55.440> or

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
immune to that either that's a glitch or

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.380 
immune to that either that's a glitch or
she<00:03:55.920> just<00:03:56.130> does<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.400> because<00:03:56.730> she's<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:56.940> badass

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
she just does it because she's a badass

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.140 
she just does it because she's a badass
and<00:03:57.840> she<00:03:58.530> does<00:03:58.740> pretty<00:03:59.100> much<00:03:59.250> kick<00:03:59.520> my<00:03:59.700> ass<00:03:59.880> by

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.520 
and she does pretty much kick my ass by
the<00:04:00.209> way<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.570> that's<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.810> pretty<00:04:01.260> sweet

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530
