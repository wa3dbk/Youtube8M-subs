stop<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.680> kalpana<00:00:23.160> chawla<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.240> just

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
stop the kalpana chawla so I just

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.730 
stop the kalpana chawla so I just
thought<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.660> elite<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.930> would<00:00:25.109> loose<00:00:25.439> my<00:00:25.500> hip

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
thought in elite I would loose my hip

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.230 
thought in elite I would loose my hip
out<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.130> because<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.550> does<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:27.180> that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
out on because it does have that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.960 
out on because it does have that
sandstorm<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.590> automatically<00:00:29.400> does<00:00:29.609> break

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
sandstorm so it automatically does break

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.299 
sandstorm so it automatically does break
his<00:00:30.090> sash<00:00:30.300> next<00:00:30.720> turn<00:00:30.840> obviously<00:00:31.380> but<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.859> could

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
his sash next turn obviously but I could

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.910 
his sash next turn obviously but I could
set<00:00:32.460> up<00:00:32.489> curses<00:00:32.969> anyways<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.290> that's<00:00:34.530> exactly

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
set up curses anyways so that's exactly

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.139 
set up curses anyways so that's exactly
what<00:00:35.040> I'm<00:00:35.100> gonna<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> fact<00:00:35.940> he's

does go forward these sticky webs and I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.619 
does go forward these sticky webs and I
just<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.430> know<00:00:44.489> went<00:00:44.940> ahead<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
just you know went ahead and go for the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.900 
just you know went ahead and go for the
curse<00:00:45.809> now<00:00:46.320> galvan<00:00:46.680> chola<00:00:46.950> also<00:00:47.309> has<00:00:47.489> access

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
curse now galvan chola also has access

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.700 
curse now galvan chola also has access
to<00:00:47.940> energy<00:00:48.090> ball<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:48.660> what<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.410> will<00:00:49.559> take

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
to energy ball but what this will take

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.229 
to energy ball but what this will take
that<00:00:49.829> really<00:00:50.039> nicely<00:00:50.219> because<00:00:50.489> boogers<00:00:51.030> is

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that really nicely because boogers is

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.279 
that really nicely because boogers is
especially<00:00:51.899> offensive<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:53.690> finally<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
especially offensive so finally the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.170 
especially offensive so finally the
sandstrom<00:00:55.710> does<00:00:55.980> hit<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.460> goblin<00:00:56.850> Joe<00:00:57.000> so

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
sandstrom does hit the goblin Joe so

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.880 
sandstrom does hit the goblin Joe so
he's<00:00:57.360> no<00:00:57.510> longer<00:00:57.840> protected<00:00:58.260> by<00:00:58.320> focus<00:00:58.739> sash

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
he's no longer protected by focus sash

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.279 
he's no longer protected by focus sash
he's<00:00:59.460> gonna<00:00:59.699> do<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> hard<00:01:00.420> switch<00:01:00.690> obviously

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
he's gonna do a hard switch obviously

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.660 
he's gonna do a hard switch obviously
because<00:01:01.530> he<00:01:01.649> doesn't<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.920> canteen<00:01:02.489> full

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
because he doesn't have canteen full

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.219 
because he doesn't have canteen full
switch<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.210> I'm<00:01:03.690> pretty<00:01:03.840> sure<00:01:04.019> he<00:01:04.110> doesn't

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
switch so I'm pretty sure he doesn't

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.299 
switch so I'm pretty sure he doesn't
gonna<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.650> energy<00:01:04.949> ball

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
gonna have energy ball

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.429 
gonna have energy ball
now<00:01:05.519> he's<00:01:05.610> gonna<00:01:05.670> go<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> Aerodactyl<00:01:06.450> now

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
now he's gonna go in the Aerodactyl now

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.990 
now he's gonna go in the Aerodactyl now
he<00:01:07.500> could<00:01:07.920> go<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> mega<00:01:08.460> evolution<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
he could go for the mega evolution and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.850 
he could go for the mega evolution and
you<00:01:09.210> know<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.450> some<00:01:09.630> crazy<00:01:09.930> damage<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.710> this

choice affects Hydra comp might hurt a
little<00:02:14.500> bit<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.220> know<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.549> am<00:02:15.849> especially

little bit but you know I am especially

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.860 
little bit but you know I am especially
defensive<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:18.269> think<00:02:19.269> that<00:02:19.480> was<00:02:19.599> like<00:02:19.690> my

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
defensive so I think that was like my

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.309 
defensive so I think that was like my
fifth<00:02:20.560> or<00:02:21.069> fourth<00:02:21.129> curse<00:02:21.879> now<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:22.900> he<00:02:23.019> does<00:02:23.170> go

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
fifth or fourth curse now so he does go

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.170 
fifth or fourth curse now so he does go
for<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.709> scold<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.580> um

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
for the scold and um

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.600 
for the scold and um
turns<00:02:26.019> out<00:02:26.170> he<00:02:26.470> gets<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.830> lucky<00:02:27.220> burn<00:02:27.370> and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
turns out he gets that lucky burn and

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.199 
turns out he gets that lucky burn and
one<00:02:27.790> try<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:29.080> kind<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.379> does<00:02:30.030> hurt<00:02:31.030> me<00:02:31.180> a

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
one try so that kind of does hurt me a

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.190 
one try so that kind of does hurt me a
little<00:02:31.420> bit<00:02:31.799> but<00:02:32.799> even<00:02:33.099> if<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.299> am<00:02:34.480> burned<00:02:34.720> this

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
little bit but even if I am burned this

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.819 
little bit but even if I am burned this

protecta after you know mega evolution

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.080 
protecta after you know mega evolution
to<00:04:18.660> get<00:04:18.810> that<00:04:18.959> speed<00:04:19.140> boost<00:04:19.609> which<00:04:20.609> is<00:04:20.760> really

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
to get that speed boost which is really

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.670 
to get that speed boost which is really
unnecessary<00:04:21.299> because<00:04:21.720> I'm<00:04:22.019> at<00:04:22.140> like<00:04:22.290> minus

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
five speed I really don't know why he

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.750 
five speed I really don't know why he
needs<00:04:24.420> to<00:04:24.510> go<00:04:24.630> for<00:04:24.870> another<00:04:24.930> protect<00:04:25.550> but<00:04:26.550> I

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
needs to go for another protect but I

heal<00:04:34.770> myself<00:04:34.920> so<00:04:35.510> he<00:04:36.510> does<00:04:36.660> get<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:36.900> speed

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
heal myself so he does get that speed

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.010 
heal myself so he does get that speed
boost<00:04:37.350> um<00:04:37.620> really<00:04:38.400> is<00:04:38.640> unnecessary<00:04:39.540> but

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
boost um really is unnecessary but

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.750 
boost um really is unnecessary but
whatever<00:04:40.620> he's<00:04:41.070> gonna<00:04:41.160> go<00:04:41.310> for<00:04:41.460> these<00:04:41.520> sky

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
does has you know have access to energy

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.930 
does has you know have access to energy
ball<00:05:09.900> but<00:05:10.620> turns<00:05:10.770> out<00:05:10.890> he<00:05:10.950> has<00:05:11.040> hex<00:05:11.340> which<00:05:11.610> is

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
ball but turns out he has hex which is

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.280 
ball but turns out he has hex which is
actually<00:05:12.300> even<00:05:12.360> better<00:05:12.570> than<00:05:12.780> energy<00:05:12.990> ball

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
actually even better than energy ball

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.340 
actually even better than energy ball
since<00:05:13.950> I<00:05:14.070> am<00:05:14.100> burn<00:05:14.430> I<00:05:14.669> do<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:15.900> know<00:05:16.020> take<00:05:16.320> it

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
since I am burn I do you know take it

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.650 
since I am burn I do you know take it
not<00:05:17.010> too<00:05:17.220> well<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:18.120> um

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
not too well and um

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
hex you know obviously gets that boost

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.370 
hex you know obviously gets that boost
attack<00:05:21.330> from<00:05:21.630> you<00:05:21.900> know<00:05:22.020> status<00:05:22.560> alignment<00:05:23.010> so

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
attack from you know status alignment so

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.080 
attack from you know status alignment so
I<00:05:24.410> want<00:05:25.070> to<00:05:25.130> fund<00:05:25.250> this<00:05:25.340> slack<00:05:25.580> off<00:05:25.730> anyways

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090

just to see what this qinger will do we

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.940 
just to see what this qinger will do we
know<00:05:29.270> for<00:05:29.480> a<00:05:29.510> fact<00:05:29.630> it's<00:05:29.840> not<00:05:29.960> a<00:05:29.990> mega<00:05:30.230> Ginga<00:05:30.620> so

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
know for a fact it's not a mega Ginga so

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.070 
know for a fact it's not a mega Ginga so

it's fine
then<00:05:33.080> keep<00:05:33.260> using<00:05:33.380> hex<00:05:33.650> and<00:05:33.920> it's<00:05:34.880> actually

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
then keep using hex and it's actually

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.430 
then keep using hex and it's actually
going<00:05:35.510> to<00:05:35.660> do<00:05:35.840> a<00:05:35.870> little<00:05:36.020> bit<00:05:36.110> more<00:05:36.260> than<00:05:36.380> a

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440
