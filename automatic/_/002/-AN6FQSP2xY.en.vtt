00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.430
 only a sequence of images that will 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.140
 entering the rhythm of the music then 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.909
 Do you want to make a similar sticker? 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.530
 with this pro your channel you only need 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.880
 of a sequence of illegal images and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.590
 a song that has a good beat 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.450
 marked should you be in any 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.040

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.170

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.630

 there are people who do it using the contact 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.080
 on the wall but I think it's kind of 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.210
 strange and this one myself painted to 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.280
 to make a wall of twelve is super simple 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.409

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.090
