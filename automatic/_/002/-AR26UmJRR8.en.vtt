00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.170 
fighting that misfire all day it's got
good<00:00:42.750> compression<00:00:43.170> good<00:00:44.010> spark<00:00:44.430> it's<00:00:44.969> got

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
good compression good spark it's got

good compression good spark it's got
fuel<00:00:46.039> the<00:00:47.039> valves<00:00:47.489> are<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.789> opening<00:00:48.270> and

fuel the valves are all opening and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.389 
fuel the valves are all opening and
shutting<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:48.960> they<00:00:49.110> should<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.620> everything's

shutting as they should be everything's
working<00:00:50.879> right<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.420> still<00:00:51.629> got<00:00:51.780> that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
working right but it still got that

misfire<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.710> same<00:00:52.920> cylinder<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:54.510> only

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
misfire on the same cylinder the only

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.670 
misfire on the same cylinder the only
thing<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.079> noticed<00:00:55.640> was<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:58.559> only

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
thing I noticed was that it the only

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.010 
thing I noticed was that it the only
thing<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.070> noticed<00:00:59.489> was<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.789> when<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> pulled

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
thing I noticed was that when I pulled

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.349 
thing I noticed was that when I pulled
the<00:01:01.079> intake<00:01:01.500> off<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.980> absolutely<00:01:02.640> wreaked<00:01:03.090> of

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the intake off it absolutely wreaked of

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.480 
the intake off it absolutely wreaked of
stale<00:01:03.660> gas<00:01:04.519> but<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:07.170> know<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.439> probably<00:01:08.189> sat

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
stale gas but you know it probably sat

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.330 
stale gas but you know it probably sat
for<00:01:08.520> two<00:01:08.939> years<00:01:09.560> which<00:01:10.560> normally<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.100> mean

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
for two years which normally I mean

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.230 
for two years which normally I mean
wouldn't<00:01:11.640> make<00:01:12.000> gas<00:01:12.299> unusable<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:13.760> would<00:01:14.760> be

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
wouldn't make gas unusable but would be

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.390 
wouldn't make gas unusable but would be
curious<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.259> why<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.619> missing<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.130> one

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
curious as to why it's missing on one

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.859 
curious as to why it's missing on one
cylinder<00:01:17.790> instead<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.299> all<00:01:18.630> six<00:01:19.140> at<00:01:20.040> any<00:01:20.280> rate

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
cylinder instead of all six at any rate

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.109 
cylinder instead of all six at any rate
I'm<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> show<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.320> how<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:23.130> check<00:01:24.060> for

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
I'm going to show you how to check for

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.350 
I'm going to show you how to check for
codes<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.140> particular<00:01:25.770> car<00:01:26.119> you<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.330> see

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
codes on this particular car you can see

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.109 
codes on this particular car you can see
the<00:01:27.780> odometer<00:01:28.110> there<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:29.759> gonna<00:01:29.909> do

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the odometer there and what I'm gonna do

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.580 
the odometer there and what I'm gonna do
is<00:01:30.299> I'm<00:01:30.420> going<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.570> turn<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.930> key<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> on

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
is I'm going to turn the key to the on

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.640 
is I'm going to turn the key to the on
off<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.909> off<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.600> off<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:35.450> okay<00:01:36.500> it's<00:01:37.500> gonna

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
off on off on off on okay it's gonna

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
off on off on off on okay it's gonna
come<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.100> that's<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.759> mileage<00:01:39.210> number<00:01:39.600> okay

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
come up that's the mileage number okay

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.609 
come up that's the mileage number okay
then<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.060> again<00:01:42.740> one<00:01:43.740> two<00:01:44.579> three<00:01:45.619> and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
then you do it again one two three and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.429 
then you do it again one two three and
it<00:01:46.770> should<00:01:47.280> yep<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.600> see<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.869> comes<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.290> as

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
it should yep you can see it comes up as

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.569 
it should yep you can see it comes up as
a<00:01:49.470> P<00:01:50.000> 1684<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:54.170> then<00:01:55.170> done<00:01:55.500> that's<00:01:56.280> what<00:01:56.460> it

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
a P 1684 and then done that's what it

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.200 
a P 1684 and then done that's what it
says<00:01:56.850> there<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:58.159> 1684<00:01:59.159> code<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.850> tells<00:02:00.060> you

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
says there the 1684 code just tells you

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.580 
says there the 1684 code just tells you
that<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.479> battery<00:02:00.810> has<00:02:00.960> been<00:02:00.990> unhooked

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
that the battery has been unhooked

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.889 
that the battery has been unhooked
within<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> last<00:02:02.280> 50<00:02:03.000> starts<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.600> once<00:02:03.750> it

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
within the last 50 starts so once it

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.899 
within the last 50 starts so once it
gets<00:02:04.079> started<00:02:04.350> 50<00:02:04.890> times<00:02:05.130> it'll<00:02:05.460> clear<00:02:05.700> that

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
gets started 50 times it'll clear that

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.050 
gets started 50 times it'll clear that
code<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.129> see<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.520> not<00:02:08.700> throwing

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
code so as you can see it's not throwing

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.450 
code so as you can see it's not throwing
any<00:02:09.179> codes<00:02:09.539> but

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
any codes but

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:21.640 
any codes but
here<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.750> how<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.230> runs<00:02:18.940> actually<00:02:20.470> other<00:02:21.470> than

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
here is how it runs actually other than

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.210 
here is how it runs actually other than
that<00:02:21.980> miss<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:26.380> sounds<00:02:27.380> pretty<00:02:27.560> good<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.070> know

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
that miss it sounds pretty good you know

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.860 
that miss it sounds pretty good you know
and<00:02:29.090> like<00:02:29.990> I<00:02:30.020> said<00:02:30.170> other<00:02:30.530> than<00:02:30.740> that<00:02:30.920> miss<00:02:31.870> you

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
and like I said other than that miss you

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.890 
and like I said other than that miss you
can<00:02:33.050> even<00:02:33.200> see<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.650> motors<00:02:34.750> shaking<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.810> little

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
can even see the motors shaking a little

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.990 
can even see the motors shaking a little
bit

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
bit
