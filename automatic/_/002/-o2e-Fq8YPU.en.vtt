00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.099
 i 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.250
 I am a photographer who has never 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.990
 had a fascination for the change of 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.789
 camera the work of a hasselblad 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.949
 both a study and the street from 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.920
 many years ago at a given time 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.780
 if I realized that to move to a 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.000
 digital technology was a lot more 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.700
 cheap I found it more comfortable I thought 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.470
 that things were going the other way and I 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.870
 I bought a reflex camera one of the 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.379
 good one of the good ones is known 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.059
 and for me the reflex camera that I bought 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.039
 they have been an absolutely useful camera 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.679
 in an absolutely useful study in 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.359
 places where I did not move but not at all 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.640
 when when I took her down the street 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.989
 with fantastic quality I realized 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.539
 the state losing a penchant for 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.979
 photography at least on the street 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.129
 so while it's a camera a lot 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.629
 smaller and cheaper much more 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.429
 manageable because what I'm feeling 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.899
 is that these little cameras are 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.339
 giving a quality that really is 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.329
 overwhelming in both video and 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.970
 Photography 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.649
 write a need more really me 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.020
 I think the cameras these little me 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.729
 I see a certain future talk about everything is 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.799
 absurd but that a certain future in which 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.439
 photography by aenor may go with 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.850
 which of what I carry what I 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.430
 I'm on the street is a camera that 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.289
 I can put in your pocket and with which 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.030
 I take pictures that maybe fit in a 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.840
 exhibition I am from the generation is 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.610
 that we go with efe without me with max and 40 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.890
 objectives and that we were going to the sites and 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.070
 our back hurt from the backpack 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.750
 we activated that already happened and I think you 're 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.720
 an absolutely wonderful world is not 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.759
 next to which a pocket camera is 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.740
 an extraordinary camera is a little the 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.179
 world that is maybe because I saw a 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.530
 photography from a point of view in the 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.780
 only people I made those are the good 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.000
 images and the tool you have 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.770
 well, good 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.290
 I am think that the technology that in 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.870
 this moment least of the friend of the 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.570
 friend how much we have left, I do not like 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.000
 large with wu lares for example 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.120
 for a maximum its 35 millimeters the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.940
 camera 35 and those of the lens could be 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.160
 reach a short goal for the 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.990
 portrait of everyone I do not like to give a little 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.240
 in that range it is not cesc and that for a 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.520
 side and on the other me with a 50 millimeter 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.040
 or just earlier since it has now 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.830
 entered into that zoom dynamic because 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.360
 I am much more comfortable the games have 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.640
 an absolutely extraordinary quality 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.010
 once again the cars maybe touched 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.600
 maybe but I think that with his model is 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.120
 an absolutely prodigious mind I 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.610
 I think we need to say that not over 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.200
 quality because nothing is left over but 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.920
 We have enough quality to not 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.780
 complain about the continuous light 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.960
 but he used flash for the first few next 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.090
 comfortable 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.460
 but hey maybe you could use more 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.440
 watts of light in light we continue to the 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.850
 leds that come I think it's the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.860
 revolution is falling and Aaron 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.120
 authentic revolution 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.890
 the leds I think they can be a 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.260
 inexhaustible source of satisfactions in 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.590
 lighting I believe that I believe that 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.780
 every photographer should carry a 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.819
 a small notebook with a pencil and a 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.019
 ballpoint pen I think the photographs what 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.069
 that count can not count 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.170
 words that is also the wonder 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.060
 say like that but I do believe that in this 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.890
 moment the photograph is being 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.360
 crying out to please us 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.830
 put feet of photos we want 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.440
 information of the world we also want 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.840
 know that the world can be explained 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.819
 also proved and I believe that a 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.090
 photographer who takes notes is a photographer 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.510
 it has a plus it has goes with 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.510
 advantage
