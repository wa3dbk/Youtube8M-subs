inches<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:29.970> my<00:00:30.060> waist<00:00:30.090> area<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.590> they<00:00:32.460> were<00:00:32.669> for

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
inches on my waist area so they were for

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.790 
inches on my waist area so they were for
your<00:00:33.000> stomach<00:00:33.270> definitely<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.500> as<00:00:34.620> far<00:00:34.739> as

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
your stomach definitely but as far as

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.350 
your stomach definitely but as far as
the<00:00:34.920> rest<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.160> your<00:00:35.280> body<00:00:35.430> i<00:00:35.610> haven't<00:00:36.030> seen<00:00:36.120> rly

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the rest of your body i haven't seen rly

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.619 
the rest of your body i haven't seen rly
any<00:00:36.480> difference<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.320> changed<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:39.600> my

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
any difference and it changed so here my

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.920 
any difference and it changed so here my
weight<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.530> still<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.190> same<00:00:41.660> but<00:00:42.660> i<00:00:42.719> think

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
weight is still the same but i think

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.209 
weight is still the same but i think
it's<00:00:43.079> because<00:00:43.200> i<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.710> been<00:00:43.890> doing<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
it's because i have been doing like a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.540 
it's because i have been doing like a
lot<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.640> strength<00:00:45.270> exercises<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:46.440> squats

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
lot of strength exercises like squats

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.970 
lot of strength exercises like squats
and<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:48.420> know<00:00:48.539> weightlifting<00:00:49.410> stuff<00:00:49.710> like

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and you know weightlifting stuff like

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.430 
and you know weightlifting stuff like
that<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.750> muscle<00:00:52.110> weighs<00:00:52.230> more<00:00:52.260> than

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that so you know muscle weighs more than

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.500 
that so you know muscle weighs more than
fat<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.980> that's<00:00:53.129> probably<00:00:53.309> why<00:00:53.640> i<00:00:54.000> watch

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
fat so that's probably why i watch

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.220 
fat so that's probably why i watch
anyway<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.640> i<00:00:56.640> recommend<00:00:57.180> these<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:57.960> want

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
anyway but i recommend these if you want

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.599 
anyway but i recommend these if you want
you<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.469> lose<00:00:58.590> weight<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:59.070> your<00:00:59.190> stomach
