based on a very traditional telly type
of<00:00:24.180> instrument<00:00:24.840> what<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:25.619> did

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
of instrument what we did

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.259 
of instrument what we did
design-wise<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.650> instrument<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.429> it's

design-wise to this instrument is it's

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.729 
design-wise to this instrument is it's
really<00:00:30.480> hard<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:32.690> to<00:00:33.690> change<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.410> style

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
really hard to to change the style

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.130 
really hard to to change the style
guitar<00:00:35.160> because<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:35.910> traditional<00:00:36.180> so

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
guitar because it's so traditional so

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.560 
guitar because it's so traditional so
what<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.590> did<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.520> bring<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> up

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
what we did is just bring in the up

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.869 
what we did is just bring in the up
about<00:00:39.930> about<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.469> quarter<00:00:40.950> inch<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.309> both<00:00:41.520> sides

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
about about a quarter inch on both sides

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.600 
about about a quarter inch on both sides
and<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:43.200> result<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.430> this

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and the result of that was that this

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.420 
and the result of that was that this
cutaway<00:00:45.149> became<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> bit<00:00:46.079> more<00:00:46.430> pronounced

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
cutaway became a bit more pronounced

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.029 
cutaway became a bit more pronounced
actually<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.870> feel<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> get<00:00:49.469> from<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.829> is

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
actually and the feel I get from it is

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.069 
actually and the feel I get from it is
almost<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:50.789> an<00:00:51.000> exaggeration<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
almost like an exaggeration of the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.049 
almost like an exaggeration of the
original<00:00:52.559> concept<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.309> not<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.640> much<00:00:53.789> that

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
original concept it's not so much that

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.959 
original concept it's not so much that
it's<00:00:54.270> changed<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.800> literally<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it's changed it literally the the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.520 
it's changed it literally the the
character<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.570> guitar<00:00:57.930> seems<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.410> be

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
character that guitar seems to be

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.310 
character that guitar seems to be
exaggerated<00:00:59.370> it<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.449> course<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> bolt-on

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
exaggerated it of course is a bolt-on

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.390 
exaggerated it of course is a bolt-on
neck<00:01:01.379> guitar<00:01:02.420> with<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> maple<00:01:03.660> fingerboard<00:01:04.400> we

neck guitar with a maple fingerboard we

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.870 
neck guitar with a maple fingerboard we
use<00:01:05.549> offset<00:01:05.850> dots<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:07.140> make<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.880> somewhat

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
use offset dots to make it somewhat

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.240 
use offset dots to make it somewhat
unique<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:10.080> has<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.619> string<00:01:10.979> through<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
unique this has the string through the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.120 
unique this has the string through the
body<00:01:11.600> bridge<00:01:12.600> setup<00:01:12.990> which<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.409> again<00:01:13.860> gives

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
body bridge setup which this again gives

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.280 
body bridge setup which this again gives
you<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.430> tremendous<00:01:15.060> string<00:01:15.600> attack<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
you this tremendous string attack and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.969 
you this tremendous string attack and
sustain<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.100> we've<00:01:17.939> combined<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.540> with<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
sustain and we've combined that with a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the in the bridge position and then

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.020 
the in the bridge position and then
we've<00:01:28.170> combined<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.710> with<00:01:28.860> two<00:01:29.100> lip<00:01:29.759> stick

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030

it's almost a little bit nasal which is

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.920 
it's almost a little bit nasal which is
nice<00:01:41.990> it's<00:01:42.590> also<00:01:43.210> committed<00:01:44.210> with<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.360> 5<00:01:44.660> way

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
nice it's also committed with a 5 way

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.140 
nice it's also committed with a 5 way
switch<00:01:44.960> so<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.040> can<00:01:46.250> get<00:01:46.400> those<00:01:46.580> sort<00:01:46.850> of<00:01:46.910> out

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
switch so you can get those sort of out

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.719 
switch so you can get those sort of out
of<00:01:47.330> phase<00:01:47.540> tones<00:01:48.200> as<00:01:48.500> well<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:49.010> this<00:01:49.520> is

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
of phase tones as well and this is

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.680 
of phase tones as well and this is
another<00:01:49.970> guitar<00:01:50.470> where<00:01:51.910> we<00:01:52.910> have<00:01:53.119> a<00:01:53.450> back

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
another guitar where we have a back

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.270 
another guitar where we have a back
headstock<00:01:54.320> rather<00:01:54.619> than<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:54.890> straight

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
headstock so all of those string

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.210 
headstock so all of those string
performance<00:01:58.280> benefits<00:01:59.680> most<00:02:00.680> players<00:02:01.010> really

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
performance benefits most players really

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.070 
performance benefits most players really

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.590 
appreciate it again more attack more
sustain<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.860> just<00:02:04.460> a<00:02:04.610> generally<00:02:05.030> more<00:02:05.180> punchy

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600
