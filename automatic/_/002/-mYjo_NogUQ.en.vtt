00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.770
 today we are going to learn how to make a pendrive this job of 1 8 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.229
 today to windows 7 and windows vista 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:10.609
 for that we need 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.699
 for example 1 7 banished 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.689
 and we enter 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.380
 the command line per cmd 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.380
 we do not use the dix application 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.529
 this application what will allow us to create partitions exist 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.810
 many applications like to be this 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.460
 but from the simplest really 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.759
 and enough 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:32.990
 entertaining 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.170
 what we are going first 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.720
 he said that they are commenting machine 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.789
 this case everything said commented 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:40.940
 the disc 0 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.050
 with can see that the first of 149 days that 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.310
 the disk the netbook 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.639
 quinn with which I am working now 

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:50.120
 indicated uu 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.230
 that is four leagues that is the pen of the unfairly 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.380
 what connected 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.880
 for good in our this work of windows 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.570
 It should be noted that the minimum size 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.570
 for example for this and by extension of 32 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.489
 would be 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.040
 32 valls forgiveness would be four days 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.090
 we do not hesitate in now it is simply selected that disc 1 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.720
 perfect cross electric 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.640
 in the selected 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.660
 i now the matter a small continent cleaning 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.410
 cleaning indicated 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.810
 Now what I'm going to do is create a primary partition where they're going to 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.360
 locate the files 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.030
 of the installer for that the train thing 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.030
 partition 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.910
 there that product totally repartition 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.230
 primary 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.590
 and now I'm going to do it just 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.730
 select this primary partition to be able to work 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.460
 out there so he's elected 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.740
 partizan 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.740
 for example a single request following mind 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.980
 this ilp is the number the partition 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.230
 I'm going to put an asset mark 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.230
 when one goes for that are the order to beat 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:15.279
 one side the partition has the d mark as active 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.609
 in what does not allow that from there they have gone as goats 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:19.709
 from this side 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.109
 and now what happened is simply 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.409
 directly 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.589
 to format 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:27.710
 shape 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.939
 fs 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.529
 It does not matter 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:31.569
 32 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:32.819
 because they should 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.029
 and well-being in that format 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:36.509
 there begins 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:38.709
 a long process 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.809
 formatting 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:44.759
 that then we're going to pass assigned to that request 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.479
 already with the night a guard 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:48.690
 and copy 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.049
 just that date 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.799
 there is like in yahoo formatted just ours will have this end 100% 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.360
 evidently 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.360
 we achieved and now it is signed by that was not like that 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.659
 what happens the same with arguments 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.260
 several firefighters unit the teacher the official 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.049
 as you can see here 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.339
 also commonly trigger a slow agony 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:15.749
 hidden from the assembly 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:19.159
 i our windows will show the san roque takes off when riding 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:21.169
 other criminal 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.489
 as the Canaanite b 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.239
 in this case 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.109
 4 regarding the task we have with shots to solve the crisis 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:33.769
 What are we going to do now? 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.619
 it is just 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.069
 use 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.179
 a program to ride another made as a breed the image of a car that 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:43.949
 have stopped 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:45.919
 this 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.879
 to mount a magnetism 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.409
 in a virtual unit 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.069
 can use any application there is a conflict affirmed 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.579
 opportune 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.529
 I in this case did not want 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:03:59.979
 ultra made 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.209
 a poem 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.249
 where wants what be 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:05.310
 on the menu a paradise 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.219
 and the son 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.219
 mount the fulminant 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.019
 it is perfectly mounted 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.900
 and I go back to m 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.829
 and as they remember 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.739
 oberto managed to show great team also have 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.169
 in that sense 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.400
 the pp 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.759
 that I will have that we just created 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.210
 any day ready to receive the files of the olp 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.090
 and to be able to be a creator 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.740
 an initiate from any computer 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.650
 and the dt 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.740
 we assemble the windows pc unit windows case developer preview 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.449
 it is not then to copy the files of the 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.680
 but we need to do it with a special command by inia the anna command 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.550
 jansson lancia 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.129
 asked about politicians live 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.960
 that will not allow us a safer copy 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.430
 and indicates just for the actions 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.430
 with the copilot and make all the ads 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.789
 sadly 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.370
 that there is a reader 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.560
 who still and open to the best floor image coach 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.819
 behind a car a statement 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:15.660
 tell him that all countries 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.870
 all the files that are here 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.129
 for that it hurts 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:21.889
 with all the extension 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.110
 any name with any extension 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.539
 have been stockpiled 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.139
 my penis 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.689
 who knows 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:32.770
 but 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.770
 before I copy I'm just adding no 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:39.629
 of parameters don felipe cÃ¡ceres 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:41.050
 / gs 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.330
 / p 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.249
 which are two parameters that 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:48.710
 so the copy including directories 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.620
 and its territory 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.449
 and also with folders that are with or asia 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:56.349
 that's what these formats do 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:59.930
 and I'm going to give it / efe to show me 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.970
 the name and the complete route of a whole party that is copying from the foot 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.659
 alte 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:09.020
 then ive enter 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.020
 and start to directly copy everything that these people 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.120
 we had previously seen on a usual day so much mounts the image 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.499
 the heat of windows 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:22.089
 and is copying with can see an inca flechita file 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.169
 what a copy of the 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.169
 alte with the same format of the same name 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:31.150
 to be able to achieve
