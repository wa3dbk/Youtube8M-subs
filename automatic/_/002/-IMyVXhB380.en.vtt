the middle of the back field that he

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.770 
the middle of the back field that he
looked<00:04:30.000> like<00:04:30.120> he<00:04:30.270> can't<00:04:30.510> you<00:04:30.630> know<00:04:30.660> it's

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.530 
you know just very very and the other
thing<00:04:37.230> is<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.530> thought<00:04:37.710> that<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:38.820> tackling

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
thing is I thought that the tackling

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.960 
thing is I thought that the tackling
angles<00:04:39.930> were<00:04:40.139> great<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.710> they<00:04:41.340> really<00:04:41.370> ran

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
angles were great and they really ran

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.210 
angles were great and they really ran
through<00:04:42.300> people<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:42.720> mean<00:04:42.870> they<00:04:43.380> tackled<00:04:43.950> so

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
through people I mean they tackled so

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.980 
through people I mean they tackled so
much<00:04:44.400> better<00:04:44.669> today<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.480> they<00:04:45.600> did<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:45.870> the

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
much better today and they did it the

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.810 
much better today and they did it the
Sun<00:04:46.200> Bowl<00:04:46.410> you<00:04:46.830> can't<00:04:47.070> even<00:04:47.220> compare<00:04:47.460> him<00:04:47.760> it

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820
