this<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.759> kit<00:01:44.759> Bosch

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
this is a kit Bosch

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.490 
this is a kit Bosch
roundhouse<00:01:46.250> Overland<00:01:47.250> coaches

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.410 

yeah<00:01:51.500> what<00:01:51.740> am<00:01:51.860> i<00:01:51.980> into<00:01:52.490> my<00:01:52.610> layout<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:53.060> Duluth

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
yeah what am i into my layout is Duluth

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.970 
yeah what am i into my layout is Duluth
so<00:01:53.630> I<00:01:53.690> thought<00:01:53.900> well<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:54.140> should<00:01:54.440> have<00:01:54.620> an<00:01:54.710> award

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
so I thought well I should have an award

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.280 
so I thought well I should have an award
dock<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.520> then<00:01:55.640> Walters<00:01:56.480> came<00:01:56.720> out<00:01:56.870> with<00:01:57.080> one

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
dock and then Walters came out with one

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.250 
dock and then Walters came out with one
so<00:01:57.620> this<00:01:58.520> or<00:01:58.700> dock<00:01:58.910> sits<00:01:59.210> at<00:01:59.420> Duluth<00:01:59.840> on<00:02:00.080> my

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
so this or dock sits at Duluth on my

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.260 
so this or dock sits at Duluth on my
layout<00:02:01.870> and<00:02:02.870> some<00:02:03.740> bridges<00:02:04.220> that<00:02:04.490> go<00:02:04.700> across

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
layout and some bridges that go across

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.499 
layout and some bridges that go across
the<00:02:05.780> tracks<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:07.220> Rick's<00:02:07.520> product<00:02:08.179> matched

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
the tracks the Rick's product matched

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.260 
the tracks the Rick's product matched
this<00:02:08.840> quite<00:02:09.200> well<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.520> what<00:02:10.670> now<00:02:10.820> sits<00:02:11.120> on

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
this quite well and so what now sits on

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.960 
this quite well and so what now sits on
my<00:02:11.420> layout<00:02:11.600> I<00:02:14.560> wanted<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.650> have<00:02:15.860> some<00:02:16.310> modern

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
my layout I wanted to have some modern

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.150 
my layout I wanted to have some modern
boxcars<00:02:17.600> so<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:17.870> had<00:02:18.050> some<00:02:18.230> decals<00:02:18.590> made<00:02:18.950> up

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
boxcars so I had some decals made up

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.460 
boxcars so I had some decals made up
even<00:02:19.910> though<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.180> original<00:02:20.330> railroad<00:02:21.170> didn't

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
even though the original railroad didn't

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.130 
even though the original railroad didn't
have<00:02:21.680> these<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.700> thought<00:02:23.600> it'd<00:02:23.750> have<00:02:23.959> them

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
have these I I thought it'd have them

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.470 
have these I I thought it'd have them
let's<00:02:24.680> let's<00:02:24.980> try<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.250> trip<00:02:25.550> over<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:25.850> layout<00:02:26.239> by

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
let's let's try a trip over to layout by

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.150 
let's let's try a trip over to layout by
starting<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.930> Minneapolis<00:02:27.260> here's<00:02:28.070> a

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.490 
fit one end so we just have a run around
that<00:04:50.039> means<00:04:50.340> that<00:04:50.759> after<00:04:51.180> engines<00:04:52.050> like<00:04:52.259> this

that means that after engines like this

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.879 
that means that after engines like this
