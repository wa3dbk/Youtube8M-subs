you have more of an open world how does
it<00:00:45.210> work<00:00:45.499> in<00:00:46.499> lego<00:00:47.010> batman<00:00:47.219> three<00:00:47.519> we<00:00:47.760> have

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
it work in lego batman three we have

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.489 
it work in lego batman three we have
basically<00:00:48.239> staff<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.929> the<00:00:48.989> watchtower<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:49.499 
basically staff and the watchtower and

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:50.719 
basically staff and the watchtower and
from<00:00:49.739> though<00:00:49.889> it's<00:00:50.069> almost<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.519> a<00:00:50.549> bicycle

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
from though it's almost like a bicycle

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:52.610 
from though it's almost like a bicycle
wheel<00:00:51.120> where<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.600> spoke<00:00:51.929> off<00:00:52.139> into<00:00:52.409> all<00:00:52.499> these

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
wheel where we spoke off into all these

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.680 
wheel where we spoke off into all these
different<00:00:52.829> locations<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.729> we<00:00:54.179> go<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> all<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
different locations so we go to all the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.849 
different locations so we go to all the
places<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.049> would<00:00:55.139> expect<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.499> go<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:55.769> the

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
places you would expect to go like the

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.759 
places you would expect to go like the
Batcave<00:00:56.249> the<00:00:56.760> holidays<00:00:57.420> they<00:00:58.170> don't<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.499> and

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
Batcave the holidays they don't do and

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.279 
Batcave the holidays they don't do and
then<00:00:59.399> most<00:01:00.030> awesomely<00:01:00.479> we<00:01:00.719> go<00:01:00.839> off<00:01:00.959> into<00:01:01.109> space

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
then most awesomely we go off into space

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.289 
then most awesomely we go off into space
so<00:01:01.649> we've<00:01:01.769> actually<00:01:01.889> got<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.369> the<00:01:02.969> lantern

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
so we've actually got that the lantern

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:04.850 
so we've actually got that the lantern
worlds<00:01:03.569> which<00:01:03.690> form<00:01:03.899> part<00:01:03.959> of<00:01:04.170> our<00:01:04.320> hub<00:01:04.500> worlds

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
worlds which form part of our hub worlds

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.410

at the end of the day not a spoiler and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.710 
at the end of the day not a spoiler and
but<00:02:10.820> all<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.000> other<00:02:11.120> characters<00:02:11.270> are<00:02:11.600> there

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
but all the other characters are there

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.760 
but all the other characters are there
just<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.930> help<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.230> because<00:02:12.410> we<00:02:12.500> wanted<00:02:12.710> to

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
just to help it because we wanted to

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.380 
just to help it because we wanted to
give<00:02:12.920> every<00:02:13.220> single<00:02:13.490> other<00:02:13.550> character<00:02:14.030> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
give every single other character the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.880 
give every single other character the
moment<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.900> spotlight<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.290> shine<00:02:15.590> as<00:02:15.740> well

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
moment in the spotlight to shine as well

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.470 
moment in the spotlight to shine as well
so<00:02:16.100> it's<00:02:16.220> not<00:02:16.340> just<00:02:16.400> Batman<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:16.880> Robin<00:02:17.120> it's

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
so it's not just Batman and Robin it's

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.060 
so it's not just Batman and Robin it's
Justice<00:02:17.930> League<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.560> Legion<00:02:18.740> of<00:02:18.950> Doom

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
showed you it in the price I started

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.590 
showed you it in the price I started
yeah<00:03:37.470> it's<00:03:37.680> kind<00:03:37.920> of<00:03:37.980> like<00:03:38.130> it's<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.000> disco<00:03:39.390> suit

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
so when he goes into a dark area we need

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.860 
so when he goes into a dark area we need
to<00:03:41.490> light<00:03:41.640> him<00:03:41.760> up<00:03:41.850> it's<00:03:42.060> it's<00:03:42.300> very<00:03:42.570> joke

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
to light him up it's it's very joke
