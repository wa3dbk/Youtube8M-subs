00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.179
 we will need me for this dessert 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.800
 will need plain gelatin indifferent 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.880

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.490
 spoons plain sugar plain sugar 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.859
 you will also need strawberry raspberries 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.170
 can add banana kiwi that is 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.800
 absolutely any fruit that you 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.590
 like 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.110
 I decided to do it with such here 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.399
 berries and one of the main ingredients 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.180
 it will be our drinking yoghurt also 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.579
 we need molds and everything 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.250
 first i need to prepare 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.829
 I have gelatin here such plates 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.559
 glasses if you have powder gelatin then 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.620
 it's okay, I have 20 grams here 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.270
 gelatin spread in a container which 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.670
 you can then put on gas 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:13.860
 gelatin soak in some water to soften 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:17.070
 for 10 minutes pour a glass of water here and 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.500
 leave to soak and preferably 57 minutes 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.000
 remove the side just as we 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.700
 prepare everything he will have 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.030
 almost ready now proceed to 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.360
 yogurt we have yogurt for wild berries 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:36.659
 and I will need three of these 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:41.159
 mugs can be made with sour cream 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.450
 milk but in our family there are people 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.409
 few of which 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.500
 let's say such an allergy 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:02:00.590
 so milk they fit and - yogurt 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:00.590
 so 1 and 3 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:12.769
 now add 3 4 tablespoons 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.910
 sugar and vanilla sugar on 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.140
 eye so for smell and for taste somewhere 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.849
 tablespoon 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.670
 now the most important thing we need to stir 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.099
 sugar yogurt to dissolve sugar 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.280
 completely so that it is not that it is not 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:42.670
 was seen now prepare the berries I 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:46.040
 I will cut the strawberries I will cut . 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.440
 I think I will cut the points in order 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:03:03.920
 decorate our dessert and the rest strawberries 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:03:06.290
 I will cut cubes here such here not 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.790
 very small or very large such 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.579
 so average you like something like 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.310
 large strawberries and desserts in principle 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:16.400
 can be tied up and and very large can 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.340
 see for yourself I think the cubes will be 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.290
 itself it just will alternate 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.370
 Marinka with strawberries do not pull 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.720
 approximately if you run them when 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.720
 Christie on the same size 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:40.329
 slice and I shift the strawberries to marinka 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.030
 back to gelatin 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.370
 we already have it a little on its side like this 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.689
 here is my wish and records 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.400
 gelatin blame 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.620
 and now I need this gelatin 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.290
 completely dissolve and i will take advantage 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:02.060
 gas 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:05.599
 we put on a slow fire and she right now 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.859
 instantly dissolve and be 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.769
 homogeneous mass 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:12.169
 the most important thing is not to boil it that is 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.689
 as soon as the gelatin is dissolved you see 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.880
 that the mass of you is uniform right away 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:19.370
 turn off that is, we don't need hot 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.120
 gelatin it must be you so warm 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:28.580
 eating warm look here he instantly 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:34.009
 begin to dissolve right before my eyes 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:36.440
 stir it off gas 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.970
 see completely gelatin dissolved 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.750
 homogeneous mass 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.870
 and she is not and is not hot and barely barely 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.789
 warm that is, everything is ready now gelatin 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.500
 which we have vanished I 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:58.849
 add a little trick to yoga and 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:05:01.159
 at the same time stir but now 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.990
 perhaps the most pleasant thing in this dozens 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:10.300
 we will sort everything into such here 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:13.969
 molds on the bottom I put strawberries then 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:18.190
 raspberry and fill it all 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.190
 gelatin yogurt 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.790
 one and a half on volyushke will be enough and 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:37.260
 so i do with all the molds 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:37.260
 add strawberries and small 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.530
 I decorate a glass with a slice of strawberry 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.870
 Now such beauty turns out now all 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.970
 I send this beauty to the fridge 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.569
 two hours she's with us for two hours all 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:59.330
 freezes and you can eat beautiful and 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:01.729
