00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
right first off this is the nikon af-s

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.200 
right first off this is the nikon af-s
18<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.519> 55<00:00:11.849> vr<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:13.099> it<00:00:14.099> DX<00:00:14.370> lens<00:00:14.700> which<00:00:14.940> means

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
18 to 55 vr is it DX lens which means

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.670 
18 to 55 vr is it DX lens which means
that<00:00:15.509> it's<00:00:15.750> designed<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.560> work<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.680> of

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
that it's designed to work with the of

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.080 
that it's designed to work with the of
smaller<00:00:20.580> size<00:00:20.910> sensors<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:22.439> i'll<00:00:22.560> first<00:00:22.769> stop

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
smaller size sensors so i'll first stop

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.400 
smaller size sensors so i'll first stop
yeah<00:00:24.090> your<00:00:24.240> switches<00:00:24.600> here<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.320> know

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
yeah your switches here like you know

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.279 
yeah your switches here like you know
what<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.680> means<00:00:26.390> automatic<00:00:27.390> manual<00:00:27.599> focus

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
what that means automatic manual focus

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.450 
what that means automatic manual focus
and<00:00:30.199> vibration<00:00:31.199> reduction<00:00:31.340> use<00:00:32.340> this

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
and vibration reduction use this

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.970 
and vibration reduction use this
manually<00:00:32.880> focus<00:00:33.170> flip<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> switch<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.739> use

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
manually focus flip the switch and use

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.860 
manually focus flip the switch and use
this<00:00:35.219> right<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:38.820> that's<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.120> some<00:00:39.600> people

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
this right here so that's it some people

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.810 
this right here so that's it some people
don't<00:00:40.020> know<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.190> manually<00:00:41.550> focus

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
don't know that you can manually focus

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.940 
don't know that you can manually focus
it<00:00:42.149> they<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.300> think<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.350> got<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> switch

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
it they just think it's got the switch

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.220 
it they just think it's got the switch
and<00:00:44.190> they<00:00:44.280> don't<00:00:44.430> know<00:00:44.520> where<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.730> do<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:44.910> at

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
and they don't know where to do it at

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.090 
and they don't know where to do it at
anyways<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.789> always<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:48.000> these<00:00:48.180> uh<00:00:49.100> UV

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989

here's a old stay with the nikons first
this<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.760 

a<00:01:11.560> nikon<00:01:12.510> f<00:01:14.040> 72<00:01:15.040> 240<00:01:15.930> which<00:01:16.930> is<00:01:17.140> a<00:01:17.170> four<00:01:17.560> point

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
a nikon f 72 240 which is a four point

a nikon f 72 240 which is a four point
five<00:01:17.980> five<00:01:18.280> six<00:01:19.740> click<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.860> lens<00:01:21.070> hood<00:01:21.630> so

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
five five six click the lens hood so

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.360 
five five six click the lens hood so
this<00:01:24.520> is<00:01:24.550> that<00:01:24.880> land<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.890> really<00:01:27.100> good<00:01:27.190> i

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
this is that land it's really good i

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.460 
this is that land it's really good i
like<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:27.880> it<00:01:28.060> takes<00:01:28.360> really<00:01:28.990> good<00:01:29.110> pictures

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
like it it takes really good pictures

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.120 
like it it takes really good pictures
it's<00:01:29.950> nice<00:01:30.369> and<00:01:30.700> clear<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.060> crisp<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
it's nice and clear and crisp the

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.980 
it's nice and clear and crisp the
low-light<00:01:33.610> it<00:01:33.910> does<00:01:34.180> kind<00:01:34.510> of<00:01:34.660> get<00:01:34.840> a<00:01:34.869> little

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
low-light it does kind of get a little

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.380 
low-light it does kind of get a little
iffy<00:01:35.440> a<00:01:35.860> little<00:01:36.400> bit<00:01:36.550> more<00:01:36.700> than<00:01:36.880> regular<00:01:37.090> line

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
iffy a little bit more than regular line

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.840 
iffy a little bit more than regular line
is<00:01:37.540> that's<00:01:37.900> just<00:01:38.050> because<00:01:38.729> opening<00:01:39.729> is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
is that's just because opening is

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.859 
is that's just because opening is
smaller<00:01:40.740> f-stops<00:01:42.300> 5.6<00:01:43.300> when<00:01:43.479> you're<00:01:43.600> zoomed

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
smaller f-stops 5.6 when you're zoomed

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.880 
smaller f-stops 5.6 when you're zoomed
in<00:01:43.990> all<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.229> ways<00:01:44.350> Louis<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:47.320> I<00:01:47.500> mean<00:01:47.740> it's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
in all the ways Louis what I mean it's

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.340 
in all the ways Louis what I mean it's
good<00:01:48.070> i<00:01:48.100> got<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.550> mainly<00:01:48.850> focus<00:01:48.880> it<00:01:49.420> on<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.720> d60

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
good i got to mainly focus it on the d60

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.150 
good i got to mainly focus it on the d60
to<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.649> n<00:01:50.860> 65<00:01:51.460> folks<00:01:51.970> is<00:01:52.210> really<00:01:52.600> fast<00:01:53.160> faster

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
to the n 65 folks is really fast faster

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.639 
to the n 65 folks is really fast faster
than<00:01:54.340> any<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:54.880> lenses<00:01:55.210> on<00:01:55.390> here<00:01:55.660> this<00:01:56.470> is

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
than any of the lenses on here this is

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.040 
than any of the lenses on here this is
the<00:01:56.680> fastest<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:58.570> is<00:01:58.720> second<00:01:59.820> who<00:02:00.820> knows<00:02:01.050> hi

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
the fastest this is second who knows hi

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.730 
the fastest this is second who knows hi
I<00:02:02.440> guess<00:02:02.890> which<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.910> AFS<00:02:04.330> does<00:02:04.690> work<00:02:04.960> on<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.619> n

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
I guess which the AFS does work on the n

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.740 
I guess which the AFS does work on the n
65<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:08.259> we'll<00:02:08.770> go<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:08.950> this<00:02:09.100> one<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:10.360> one's<00:02:10.630> a

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
65 so we'll go to this one this one's a

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.110 
65 so we'll go to this one this one's a
tamron<00:02:12.300> 8228<00:02:13.300> baby<00:02:14.459> which<00:02:15.459> is<00:02:15.670> kind<00:02:15.910> of<00:02:15.970> like

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
tamron 8228 baby which is kind of like

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.300 
tamron 8228 baby which is kind of like
felt<00:02:16.989> like<00:02:17.080> kit<00:02:17.290> lens<00:02:17.500> how<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.830> moves<00:02:18.070> like

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
felt like kit lens how it moves like

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.670 
felt like kit lens how it moves like
that<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:19.540> doesn't<00:02:19.600> have<00:02:19.930> this<00:02:20.080> lens<00:02:20.350> hood

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
that it doesn't have this lens hood

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.810 
that it doesn't have this lens hood
built<00:02:21.190> into<00:02:21.459> their<00:02:21.640> eye<00:02:23.430> lens<00:02:24.430> hoods<00:02:24.670> this

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
built into their eye lens hoods this

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.220 
built into their eye lens hoods this
small<00:02:25.060> it's<00:02:25.180> not<00:02:25.299> doing<00:02:25.570> multiple<00:02:25.930> hey<00:02:26.080> it's

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
small it's not doing multiple hey it's

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.000 
small it's not doing multiple hey it's
open<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.480> that's<00:02:28.600> that<00:02:28.780> one<00:02:29.049> I<00:02:29.290> haven't<00:02:29.830> gotten

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
open so that's that one I haven't gotten

everything a camera and everything so I

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.860 
everything a camera and everything so I
mean<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:37.720> wasn't<00:02:38.019> surprised<00:02:38.350> by<00:02:38.530> anything<00:02:38.799> so

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
mean I wasn't surprised by anything so

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.900 
mean I wasn't surprised by anything so
alright<00:02:40.870> this<00:02:41.049> one<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:41.650> was<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> little<00:02:42.670> bit<00:02:42.790> more

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
alright this one I was a little bit more

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:51.050 
alright this one I was a little bit more
surprised<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.799> tamron<00:02:46.829> 70-300<00:02:48.870> macro

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
surprised this is a tamron 70-300 macro

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.809 
surprised this is a tamron 70-300 macro
with<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.180> lens<00:02:52.390> hood

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.610 

so<00:02:56.819> this<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:58.790> which<00:02:59.989> when<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.080> get<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.410> in

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
so this is it which when you get it in

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.979 
so this is it which when you get it in
the<00:03:02.040> macro<00:03:02.250> mode<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.790> gets<00:03:02.940> kind<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.209> big<00:03:03.420> long

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
the macro mode it gets kind of big long

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.490 
the macro mode it gets kind of big long
I'm<00:03:04.260> not<00:03:04.349> really<00:03:04.950> heavy<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.880> gets<00:03:06.030> longer<00:03:06.500> kind

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
I'm not really heavy it gets longer kind

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.030 
I'm not really heavy it gets longer kind
of<00:03:07.970> it's<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.209> way<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.480> things<00:03:09.770> sometimes<00:03:10.770> I

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
of it's in the way of things sometimes I

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.449 
of it's in the way of things sometimes I
guess<00:03:11.220> for<00:03:11.459> what<00:03:11.849> it<00:03:11.940> does<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.300> can<00:03:12.360> get<00:03:12.540> one

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
guess for what it does you can get one

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.910 
guess for what it does you can get one
it's<00:03:14.459> it's<00:03:15.030> okay<00:03:15.390> puts<00:03:16.200> macro<00:03:16.680> lens<00:03:18.920> it

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
it's it's okay puts macro lens it

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.559 
it's it's okay puts macro lens it
doesn't<00:03:20.190> have<00:03:20.250> any<00:03:20.430> cigs<00:03:20.700> that's<00:03:21.120> good<00:03:21.300> I

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
doesn't have any cigs that's good I

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.080 
doesn't have any cigs that's good I
don't<00:03:22.349> like<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.500> say<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.980> much<00:03:23.160> anyway<00:03:24.060> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
don't like to say that much anyway the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.870 
don't like to say that much anyway the
focus<00:03:24.599> is<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:25.200> know<00:03:25.349> probably<00:03:26.310> right<00:03:26.640> here

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
focus is you know probably right here

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.600 
focus is you know probably right here
looking<00:03:27.209> through<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.200> edges<00:03:29.069> table

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
looking through it to the edges table

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.370 
looking through it to the edges table
maybe<00:03:31.730> four<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.750> macro<00:03:34.200> kind<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.530> stuff

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
maybe four of the macro kind of stuff

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:45.110 
maybe four of the macro kind of stuff
there's<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.560> opening<00:03:43.730> just<00:03:44.730> show<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:44.940> a
