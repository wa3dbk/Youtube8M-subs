00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.220
 an award-winning research 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.680
 Nobel prize has revealed the main 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.380
 cause of aging the human eye 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.870
 can not see the answer and it's something that 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.150
 it's called telomeres the telomeres are 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.010
 facts of repetitive DNA sequences 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.440
 which become the 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.020
 protective covers or terminations of 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.330
 our chromosomes its function is 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.310
 protect our DNA when we are born 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.140
 our telomeres are long but 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.329
 as time goes on they begin to 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.980
 cut themselves do it so much that our 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.260
 telomeres fray similar to 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.149
 end of a shoelace and our 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.729
 trip called cellular aging 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.679
 begins when the telomeres become 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.559
 very short our cells can no longer 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.600
 carry out its essential functions 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.329
 they begin to self-destruct and finally 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.609
 die scientists call this 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.679
 apoptosis process the cells 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.120
 die is one thing but when 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.609
 cells just stop working 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.579
 they can generate dangerous radicals 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:05.019
 free and inflammatory molecules that 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.750
 they essentially damage nearby cells 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.390
 then how do we fight this process 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.039
 called cellular aging has been 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.899
 proven to be a certain nutrient 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.880
 naturally improves the enzyme that 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.969
 it is needed to lengthen the telomeres 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.700
 shorts thus increasing healthy living 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.319
 of our cells thousands of studies 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.299
 show the connection between the 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:28.479
 short telomeres and the natural process 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:32.439
 of cellular aging 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.750
 fascinating is that this is the only 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.780
 substance known in the history of the 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.530
 humanity capable of doing this get ready 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.020
 for the future 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.020
 cell aging ends here 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.069
 technology that intensifies youth 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.069
 exclusive of plain
