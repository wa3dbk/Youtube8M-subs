00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.470
 there control of rotations 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.650
 220 volts 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.669
 it's still magnitude cause 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.009
 in e 39 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.549
 39 13 I did not think much 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.620
 an hour once these brochures tons of water 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.920
 even if at that time that tells us the card massoud pension 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.039
 so employees of a revenue spinning when chauving quests 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:23.810
 are moderate 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.810
 there seems of course 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.119
 Everyone knows it 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.119
 I was happy at all 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.659
 e 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:37.720
 for 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.450
 in the Atlantic 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.770
 not really the brothel for reloading 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.340
 in this party is outdated 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.989
 but about 200 frames 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.180
 just for the money the report to 2007 him that started 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.150
 to move a little bit 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.170
 could it be the case if the cpu 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.530
 on the verge of tears we speak 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.680
 relay 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.940
 you have to take the cpu for m 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.820
 on the other hand not 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.510
 we know we do not put any 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.510
 these circuits are not excluded hard drive 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.480
 I do not know it 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.400
 how to pray 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.400
 chain 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.320
 it's very rough 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.480
 the satellite 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.590
 at the moment 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.590
 prostitution 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.980
 a little see life back 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.210
 at 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.480
 prices may vary 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.190
 the spirits he is laureate of color the sick 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.030
 contacted the theme is attached to the windshield 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.550
 twelve most important 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.550
 let's look 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 he had left the league 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.680
 we do not have much 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.049
 for the voters of m 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.460
 and the price of real estate 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.460
 it'll be worse 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.189
 the thing that explodes 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:17.129
 my 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.199
 of the agreement can 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:22.199
 I did the same 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.800
 whether it's the nets 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.589
 firstly cramps 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:29.899
 and then on 50 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:30.989
 before watching 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.249
 it is true that we are for presentations 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.599
 and it's only fair 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.319
 poutine the speakers 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.519
 the map opposite 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.870
 a bit with a little time after a hook this average 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.079
 the plate there 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.500
 at the door this is only part discount
