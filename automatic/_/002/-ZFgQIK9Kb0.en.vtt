00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 what an honor now with the guest of this newspaper we welcome the Belgian 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.390
 cÃ©dric and gerber hello hello welcome so you just got 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.880
 a pretty important price took their disappointment press photo award in the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.809
 news reporting category you worked on compost a 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.919
 subject also quite delicate 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.939
 delicate news and less important loss for belgium indeed 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.039
 I was interested therefore by the deadline of October 2008 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.489
 who are the duo donation santons of the country 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.789
 to belgium by the leopold king them and I wanted to know how what the 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.930
 situation was on the spot later on and especially you are 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.500
 went to meet the rebels I believe 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.370
 so that's his second part the report actually if we discovered in 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.320
 this moment precisely the fruit of your work which are the images that have 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.070
 been taken in tourism this story lasted seven weeks between the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.940
 months of June and the month of July to qualify 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.830
 and I started in tourism with a Belgian NGO called aviation 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.160
 without borders that allow me to move 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.710
 because the roads were cut either by bad weather or by the 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.830
 presence of rebels often different militias who are present 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.760
 on the spot 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.780
 so is it also very important to say is that you 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.650
 work as an independent 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.070
 so eventually you financed yourself your work we get to hold on to 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.119
 to live dede of this job it is difficult to live from this job 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.920
 mc things that are actually done with the time they take per cent 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.000
 a number of years to come to understand what are the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.980
 mechanisms how to finance power but different actors in place 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.030
 to be able to operate with news organizations either with objectives 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.060
 can still finance photojournalism just now 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.320
 it's very difficult to be able to do it with the press the press price but 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.940
 exactly why choose to be independent photographer 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.170
 it's really a desire to maybe not be dictated the 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.770
 how we work like that when we work for a 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.940
 news agency absolutely picture at the base a journalist training but 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.330
 i was discouraged that patrick remark with jean-luc ditch is enticing 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.600
 between goods and services tps and to get rid of a form and alex 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.970
 and very quickly I realized that the formats that was 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.220
 imposed and is 7% by the press radios the television press 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.800
 did not fit what I wanted to do with documentary 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.640
 be able to take the time to understand 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.590
 adeline can spend time with people and especially to be totally 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.899
 independent of not depending on an editorial requirement during the 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.080
 months because it is or we will also discover 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.020
 while other photos you realized that in Palestine% according to you 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.390
 this question can be a bit difficult but what makes the 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.800
 quality a good photo what makes a good photo a photo that can 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.009
 to be awarded a prize as it was 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.669
 but I think already started 1 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.389
 very well we can without the good question a good photo epa a beautiful 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:27.910
 Photo 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.350
 there is a big difference% a good photo in my opinion must be able to do it 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.400
 match the international level first as the graphic quality 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.939
 and the emotion of the Germans 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.099
 well, here 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.859
 so we discovered some photos taken in Palestine it's true that 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.310

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.019
 your reward thank you very much
