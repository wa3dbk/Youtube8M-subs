 quantity it's not that much 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.110
 but in the end not because it will 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.940

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.550
 salt because they have homework and 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.020
 after we put a nice tip tower 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.579

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:13.799
 little black pudding we made at the furia time 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.240
 that's enough we cut in party animal and not 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.899

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.950
 we just want the dance to protect 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.479
 the salt of aggression a little too fast 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.520
 because otherwise it will change 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.400
 color here we come here we are 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.660
 serve well like that 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.910
 common point they do not spend 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.900
 through a frame yes finally there is the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:48.020
 room temperature it's delicately 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:49.340
 we are delicate so be careful 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.530
 follow well that you have it's very 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:02:00.650
 very complicated very elite scene contest 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.820
 respondent but twice non-nickel and 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.470
 Now you just need the 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.500
 cover completely with salt is 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.970
 slow we have to let time act on 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.010
 a little bit like that it's going to take a 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.080
 about 7 to 8 hours this is the place 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.850
 was very and if I let the day is 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.800
 embarrassing not to have too much salt okay 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.670
 okay so on a little foie gras 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.680
 like that 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.959
 seven to eight o'clock and on the 12th round 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.620
 on the jackpot it would take ermotti 13 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.540
 maximum hours 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.340
 okay it's spread in the fridge 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.020
 filmed refrigerator is in oblivion 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.209
 for 13 hours then subject to be 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.740
 delivered between 8 and 13 hours 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.750
 we do not give more because after that 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.459
 too salty 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.440
 ended have subsidiaries or facts 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.060
 the Gaza Strip uses the 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.320
 difference of effective dependence this 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.560
 does not mean we're going to 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.269
 prepare for the next day or two days 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.690
 after the raid on a background of a vintage 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:51.019
 marinated in ground Here's what went 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.500
 so there foie gras prices start 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.209
 favorite ideas 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.360
 seven to eight hours before the salt is 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:03.470

 do not eat now I'm here I 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.250
 eat alone 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.170
 and you saw how it is to do 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.910
 a program arrived at salt without cooking 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.440
