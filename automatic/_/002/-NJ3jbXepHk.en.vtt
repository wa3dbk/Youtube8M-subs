00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:08.069
 Time to approve episode 1 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.099
 the bible of the devil 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.480
 Have you heard of this list? 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.090
 leader of the devil respects fiction is very 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.090
 more interesting than it is reality in 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.410
 the example is the story about 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.859
 sinister world league 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:32.040
 legend has it that in the 13th century in the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.469
 which today corresponds to the Czech Republic 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.840
 a monk was sentenced to death or 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.450
 to commit a serious infringement of the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.690
 monastery in which rules over river 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.890
 precisely of the priest to be walled 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.140
 alive in 14 to escape conviction 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.930
 a monk decided to do at home with his 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.270
 than your crime. 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.360
 be forgiven in exchange for what 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.390
 produce a copy of the bible and 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.780
 various other handwriting 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.540
 in one night such a feat did not 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.850
 it would be very very difficult to achieve 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.680
 nowadays with all the technology 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.700
 available 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.310
 so I can only imagine in the 3rd century as everything 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.299
 was done there with the use of 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.909
 ink feathers of loss or higher 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.880
 agreed whether a monk did not comply 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.869
 with the color of the dice what was obvious and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.540
 would be sentenced for producing this 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.000
 material promised in such a short time 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.299
 this would be a miracle that in turn 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.689
 thousands of pilgrims would fall and 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.399
 money for a monastery however a 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.070
 monk soon realized that never 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.380
 I could finish this false and there was 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.070
 proposed this money to make the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.180
 unthinkable a pact with the devil or 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.310
 service 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.540
 the prince of darkness not only asked the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.299
 CENAM Yucca soul that required to 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.960
 know your huge back I was 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:12.200
 included in the soul and the next day 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.200
 As promised the book was ready. 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.700
 given the volume and became known as the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.910
 beck follow of tooth books or the bible 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.610
 of the devil the code the end more than 20 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.130
 centimeters of height for a further 50 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.280
 in addition to living more than 20 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.959
 forget and weigh certain 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.349
 75 kg 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.599
 is the largest medieval manuscript 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:41.590
 What happened here, my parents are not 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.959
 made of calf skin and devil 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.769
 some famous bible pictures 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.830
 malignant 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.110
 how did you find a new old testament 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.110
 as well as a timetable that these 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.680
 doctors and an old and encyclopedias 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.380
 however several pages disappeared 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.140
 Some believe that missing texts 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.500
 for teaching and for 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.080
 have been read and therefore have been removed 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.620
 in addition during their various 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.750
 centuries of existence the cob granted 1 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.030
 hands several times 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.690
 fs survived with some damage 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.329
 irreversible to 1 100 which also 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.850
 could explain the disappearance of 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.489
 some firsts page 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.530
 according to experts the book 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.260
 really seems to have been written by 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.569
 a single person but instead of being 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.660
 produced in just one night 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.359
 the scribe bbb12 must have taken more than 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.410
 20 years to complete the work 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:47.350
 in addition a small dedication 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.410
 brothers or siblings the resource 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.350
 or brother was cloistered 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.959
 at the end of the manuscript to send some 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.000
 written on the alleged conviction of the 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.579
 mount 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.430
 thus the more likely is that if f dowry 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.519
 really has been condemned to closure 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.430
 and not to be walled up for life 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:13.569
 to dedicate itself fully to the production 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.819
 Copper Today The Devil's Bible Is 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.280

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:22.530
 sweden national in stockholm 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.470
 This was the first episode of the 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.879
 Truth time, do not forget to enjoy.
