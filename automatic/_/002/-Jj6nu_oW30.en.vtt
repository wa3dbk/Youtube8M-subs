the<00:00:56.180> first<00:00:56.420> thing<00:00:56.570> we're<00:00:56.690> going<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:56.870> do<00:00:57.020> is

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.229 
the first thing we're going to do is
we're<00:00:57.289> going<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:57.530> measure<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.039> the<00:00:58.789> handful

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
we're going to measure the the handful

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.090 
we're going to measure the the handful
you<00:00:59.390> need<00:00:59.600> to<00:00:59.750> know<00:00:59.930> how<00:01:00.199> much<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:00.590> handle<00:01:00.920> is

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
you need to know how much the handle is

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.189 
you need to know how much the handle is
because<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.670> whole<00:01:01.850> entire<00:01:02.180> paddle<00:01:02.809> needs<00:01:02.989> to

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
because the whole entire paddle needs to

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.980 
because the whole entire paddle needs to
be<00:01:03.350> again<00:01:03.680> ten<00:01:03.980> inches<00:01:04.309> longer<00:01:04.640> than<00:01:05.479> the

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
be again ten inches longer than the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.719 
be again ten inches longer than the
person's<00:01:06.409> head<00:01:06.799> higher<00:01:07.100> than<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.340> person's

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
person's head higher than the person's

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.210 
person's head higher than the person's
head<00:01:07.939> so<00:01:08.630> when<00:01:08.869> I<00:01:08.900> measure<00:01:09.200> this<00:01:09.530> it<00:01:09.740> turns<00:01:09.979> out

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
head so when I measure this it turns out

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.460 
head so when I measure this it turns out
that<00:01:10.490> from<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:11.360> base<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.900> handle<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.380> the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
that from the base of the handle to the

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.219 
that from the base of the handle to the
top<00:01:12.710> it's<00:01:12.979> about<00:01:13.220> two<00:01:13.520> inches<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.210> I'm<00:01:14.990> going

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
top it's about two inches so I'm going

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.289 
top it's about two inches so I'm going
to<00:01:15.320> measure<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.770> paddle<00:01:16.159> keep<00:01:16.850> in<00:01:17.030> mind

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
to measure the paddle keep in mind

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.420 
to measure the paddle keep in mind
however<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:18.200> grip<00:01:18.470> was<00:01:18.710> two<00:01:19.009> inches

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
however that the grip was two inches

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.960 
however that the grip was two inches
longer<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:20.299> I'm<00:01:20.450> going<00:01:20.689> to<00:01:20.810> go<00:01:20.900> to<00:01:20.960> five<00:01:21.320> six

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
longer so I'm going to go to five six

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.310 
longer so I'm going to go to five six
which<00:01:22.970> is<00:01:23.000> somewhere<00:01:23.360> around<00:01:23.420> there<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.259> I'm

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
which is somewhere around there and I'm

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.280 
which is somewhere around there and I'm
gonna<00:01:24.439> go<00:01:24.650> eight<00:01:25.280> inches<00:01:26.000> more<00:01:26.360> because<00:01:26.810> two

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
gonna go eight inches more because two

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.080 
gonna go eight inches more because two
inches<00:01:27.680> that<00:01:27.799> is<00:01:27.860> going<00:01:28.159> to<00:01:28.250> be<00:01:28.369> a<00:01:28.400> paddle<00:01:28.850> one

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.990 
you loosen it up so you can wrap the
tool<00:01:57.619> around<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:59.570> shaft<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:00.490> get<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:01.759> that

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
tool around the shaft and get it so that

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.789 
tool around the shaft and get it so that
it's<00:02:02.119> right<00:02:02.390> in<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.659> middle<00:02:02.689> of<00:02:03.079> these<00:02:03.350> two

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.800 

fitters<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.009> then<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:07.399> gradually<00:02:08.090> tighten

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
fitters and then you gradually tighten

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.990 
fitters and then you gradually tighten
it<00:02:08.929> up<00:02:09.099> you<00:02:10.099> don't<00:02:10.250> want<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.429> tighten<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.759> too

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
it up you don't want to tighten it too

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.089 
it up you don't want to tighten it too
much<00:02:11.030> because<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.780> carbon<00:02:12.200> fiber<00:02:12.590> will

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
much because the carbon fiber will

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.949 
much because the carbon fiber will
so<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.489> just<00:02:13.670> tighten<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.269> little<00:02:14.450> bit<00:02:14.719> and

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
so you just tighten it a little bit and

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.709 
so you just tighten it a little bit and
then<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.709> start<00:02:16.010> making<00:02:16.159> turns<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:17.090> can<00:02:17.269> hear

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:17.719 
then you start making turns you can hear

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.649 
then you start making turns you can hear
if<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.709> listen<00:02:19.069> closely<00:02:19.519> that<00:02:20.060> it's<00:02:20.180> actually

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
if you listen closely that it's actually

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.020 
if you listen closely that it's actually
cutting<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.950> can<00:02:22.129> see<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.639> I'm<00:02:22.730> making

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
cutting and you can see that I'm making

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.000 
cutting and you can see that I'm making
a<00:02:23.090> little<00:02:23.299> line<00:02:23.480> there<00:02:23.840> once<00:02:24.469> I<00:02:24.590> go<00:02:24.739> all<00:02:24.980> the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
a little line there once I go all the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.059 
a little line there once I go all the
way<00:02:25.219> around<00:02:26.170> then<00:02:27.170> I'm<00:02:27.290> going<00:02:27.469> to<00:02:27.530> just

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
way around then I'm going to just

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.899 
way around then I'm going to just
tighten<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.609> a<00:02:28.849> little<00:02:29.540> teeny<00:02:29.750> bit<00:02:29.930> more<00:02:30.909> go

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
tighten it a little teeny bit more go

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.869 
tighten it a little teeny bit more go
around<00:02:32.239> again<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.900> can<00:02:33.079> hear<00:02:33.319> it's<00:02:33.439> cutting

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
around again you can hear it's cutting

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.520 
around again you can hear it's cutting
again<00:02:34.879> try<00:02:35.180> not<00:02:35.359> to<00:02:35.510> tighten<00:02:35.750> too<00:02:36.049> much<00:02:36.079> just

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
again try not to tighten too much just

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.379 
again try not to tighten too much just
take<00:02:36.739> your<00:02:36.889> time<00:02:37.099> with<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.430> I'm<00:02:38.180> going<00:02:38.359> to

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
take your time with it I'm going to

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.849 
take your time with it I'm going to
tighten<00:02:38.780> one<00:02:38.989> more<00:02:39.230> time<00:02:39.939> go<00:02:40.939> around<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:42.739> this

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
tighten one more time go around and this

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:47.409 
tighten one more time go around and this
is<00:02:43.040> giving<00:02:43.370> me<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.579> nice<00:02:44.200> clean<00:02:45.200> cut<00:02:46.180> one<00:02:47.180> more

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:47.419

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
time again just take your time you don't

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.390 
time again just take your time you don't
want<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.959> do<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.409> quickly<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:52.040> have<00:02:52.219> it

want to do this quickly and have it
splinter<00:02:52.939> on<00:02:52.969> you<00:02:53.389> or<00:02:53.689> break<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.049> pole<00:02:54.260> in<00:02:54.379> the

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:54.469

splinter on you or break the pole in the
wrong<00:02:54.680> place<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:57.769> here<00:02:58.010> it's<00:02:58.129> cutting<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.989> I

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
wrong place and here it's cutting and I

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.610 
wrong place and here it's cutting and I
got<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.319> fairly<00:03:03.919> nice<00:03:04.250> clean<00:03:04.879> cut<00:03:05.239> there<00:03:05.620> okay

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
now I'm going to get my rubber piece and

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.809 
now I'm going to get my rubber piece and
I'm<00:03:08.719> gonna<00:03:08.840> slide<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.500> on<00:03:09.680> because<00:03:10.219> if<00:03:10.459> I<00:03:10.609> play

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
I'm gonna slide it on because if I play

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:11.979 
I'm gonna slide it on because if I play
it<00:03:10.849> I<00:03:11.090> won't<00:03:11.269> be<00:03:11.359> able<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.540> fit<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.870> on

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
it I won't be able to fit it on

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.659 
it I won't be able to fit it on
afterwards<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:12.709> I'm<00:03:12.799> going<00:03:12.949> to<00:03:12.980> slide<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.459> down

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:13.669 
afterwards so I'm going to slide it down

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.509 
afterwards so I'm going to slide it down
here<00:03:14.209> so<00:03:14.389> that<00:03:14.959> when<00:03:15.109> I<00:03:15.139> put<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.799> handle<00:03:16.400> on

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
here so that when I put the handle on

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.749 
here so that when I put the handle on
properly<00:03:17.299> with<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.750> epoxy<00:03:18.259> I'm<00:03:18.949> then<00:03:19.519> just

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:19.759 
properly with the epoxy I'm then just

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.659 
properly with the epoxy I'm then just
gonna<00:03:19.819> slide<00:03:20.269> this<00:03:20.509> back<00:03:20.780> up<00:03:21.019> into<00:03:21.229> place<00:03:21.669> now

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
gonna slide this back up into place now

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.399 
gonna slide this back up into place now
I'm<00:03:22.790> gonna<00:03:22.909> take<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.359> steel<00:03:23.599> wool<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:24.199> might

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
I'm gonna take the steel wool this might

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.289 
I'm gonna take the steel wool this might
be<00:03:24.650> this<00:03:24.859> feels<00:03:25.129> pretty<00:03:25.400> coarse<00:03:25.759> but<00:03:26.030> if<00:03:26.150> it

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
be this feels pretty coarse but if it

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.199 
be this feels pretty coarse but if it
weren't<00:03:26.509> very<00:03:26.840> coarse<00:03:27.199> what<00:03:28.009> I<00:03:28.040> would<00:03:28.250> do<00:03:28.430> is<00:03:28.819> I

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
weren't very coarse what I would do is I

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.059 
weren't very coarse what I would do is I
would<00:03:29.239> just<00:03:29.569> buff<00:03:29.780> this<00:03:30.019> up<00:03:30.259> a<00:03:30.409> little<00:03:30.560> bit<00:03:30.829> so

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
would just buff this up a little bit so

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.399 
would just buff this up a little bit so
the<00:03:31.189> epoxy<00:03:32.139> can<00:03:33.139> grab<00:03:34.419> the<00:03:35.419> handle<00:03:35.930> just<00:03:36.259> a

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
the epoxy can grab the handle just a

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:37.210 
the epoxy can grab the handle just a
little<00:03:36.650> bit<00:03:36.859> better

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
little bit better

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.999 
little bit better
so<00:03:38.150> what<00:03:38.359> explained<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.259> handle<00:03:39.769> for<00:03:39.979> a

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:40.009 
so what explained the handle for a

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:42.520 
so what explained the handle for a
minute<00:03:40.280> these<00:03:40.759> handles<00:03:41.329> have<00:03:41.659> a<00:03:41.959> shape<00:03:42.259> that

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
minute these handles have a shape that

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.259 
minute these handles have a shape that
actually<00:03:42.919> will<00:03:43.099> fit<00:03:43.430> your<00:03:43.669> hand<00:03:43.909> in<00:03:44.239> your

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
actually will fit your hand in your

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.899 
actually will fit your hand in your
finger<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.769> your<00:03:45.889> fingers<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.400> fatter<00:03:46.729> part

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
finger and your fingers the fatter part

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.569 
finger and your fingers the fatter part
always<00:03:47.900> goes<00:03:48.199> in<00:03:48.439> your<00:03:48.560> palm<00:03:48.859> and<00:03:49.220> then<00:03:49.430> your

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
always goes in your palm and then your

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.819 
always goes in your palm and then your
fingers<00:03:50.000> wrap<00:03:50.269> around<00:03:50.659> to<00:03:50.840> this<00:03:51.109> thinner<00:03:51.470> part

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
fingers wrap around to this thinner part

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.800 
fingers wrap around to this thinner part
this<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.220> kind<00:03:52.459> of<00:03:52.549> important<00:03:53.090> I'd<00:03:53.540> hate<00:03:53.750> for

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
this is kind of important I'd hate for

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.390 
this is kind of important I'd hate for
you<00:03:54.109> to<00:03:54.139> put<00:03:54.409> this<00:03:54.560> on<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.040> put<00:03:55.159> it<00:03:55.250> on

bottle<00:04:40.190> this<00:04:40.820> is<00:04:41.000> made<00:04:41.210> so<00:04:41.479> that<00:04:41.509> you<00:04:41.690> push<00:04:41.930> it

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
bottle this is made so that you push it

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.050 
bottle this is made so that you push it
down<00:04:42.139> and<00:04:42.560> it's<00:04:42.680> equal<00:04:43.100> parts<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.639> don't<00:04:43.880> need

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
down and it's equal parts you don't need

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.089 
down and it's equal parts you don't need
a<00:04:44.090> tremendous<00:04:44.630> amount<00:04:44.960> I'm<00:04:45.620> going<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:45.889> show

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
a tremendous amount I'm going to show

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.460 
a tremendous amount I'm going to show
you<00:04:46.160> how<00:04:46.430> much<00:04:46.610> we<00:04:46.669> really<00:04:47.150> need<00:04:47.419> so<00:04:48.380> I'm

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
you how much we really need so I'm

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.610 
you how much we really need so I'm
pressing<00:04:48.740> it<00:04:49.130> out<00:04:49.340> I<00:04:50.199> would<00:04:51.199> say<00:04:51.410> that's

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
pressing it out I would say that's

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.029 
pressing it out I would say that's
probably<00:04:52.039> more<00:04:52.460> than<00:04:52.520> enough<00:04:53.500> so<00:04:54.500> just<00:04:54.800> kind

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
probably more than enough so just kind

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.040 
probably more than enough so just kind
of<00:04:55.160> dry<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:55.430> off<00:04:55.669> and<00:04:56.500> then<00:04:57.500> put<00:04:57.770> your<00:04:59.020> lid<00:05:00.020> back

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
of dry it off and then put your lid back

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.990 
of dry it off and then put your lid back
on<00:05:00.620> right<00:05:00.889> away<00:05:02.979> okay<00:05:03.979> now<00:05:04.190> I<00:05:04.220> take<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.729> straw

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
on right away okay now I take the straw

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.550 
on right away okay now I take the straw
and<00:05:06.190> I<00:05:07.190> mix<00:05:07.460> it<00:05:07.580> all<00:05:07.729> together

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
and I mix it all together

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.080 
and I mix it all together
it<00:05:09.560> doesn't<00:05:09.949> make<00:05:10.039> epoxy<00:05:10.729> till<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.060> pieces

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
it doesn't make epoxy till the pieces

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.110 
it doesn't make epoxy till the pieces
two<00:05:14.090> compounds<00:05:14.840> are<00:05:14.930> mixed<00:05:15.320> together<00:05:15.500> I<00:05:16.120> think

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
two compounds are mixed together I think

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.000 
two compounds are mixed together I think
a<00:05:17.330> better<00:05:17.539> tool<00:05:17.900> to<00:05:18.320> mix<00:05:18.650> this<00:05:18.800> together

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
a better tool to mix this together

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.279 
a better tool to mix this together
really<00:05:19.490> quite<00:05:19.729> frankly<00:05:20.060> or<00:05:20.270> popsicle<00:05:20.990> sticks

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
really quite frankly or popsicle sticks

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.629 
really quite frankly or popsicle sticks
which<00:05:21.500> you<00:05:21.620> can<00:05:21.740> get<00:05:22.210> at<00:05:23.210> a<00:05:23.270> craft<00:05:23.479> store<00:05:24.050> or<00:05:24.639> at

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
this underneath just so it doesn't get

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.420 
this underneath just so it doesn't get
on<00:05:41.120> the<00:05:41.270> table<00:05:41.780> and<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:42.770> next<00:05:43.070> thing<00:05:43.250> we're

I don't get it all the way up to the
front<00:05:55.660> top<00:05:56.020> because<00:05:56.500> it's<00:05:56.680> going<00:05:56.770> to<00:05:56.830> get

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
front top because it's going to get

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.770 
front top because it's going to get
pushed<00:05:57.250> to<00:05:57.430> there<00:05:57.580> automatically<00:05:58.420> and<00:05:58.660> then

parallel that the handle is parallel
with<00:06:47.170> the<00:06:47.410> blade<00:06:47.710> and<00:06:48.310> what<00:06:48.460> I<00:06:48.490> do<00:06:49.380> is<00:06:50.380> I<00:06:50.620> slide

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
this up you have to hold the handle down

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.860 
this up you have to hold the handle down
and<00:06:54.750> slide<00:06:55.750> up<00:06:56.050> the<00:06:56.230> tape<00:06:56.470> the<00:06:56.770> rubber<00:06:57.010> and
