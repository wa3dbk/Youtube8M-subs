00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
so this is the review of the Honda

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.460 
so this is the review of the Honda
journal<00:00:04.740> or<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.879> Honda<00:00:06.480> metropolitan<00:00:07.319> if

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
journal or the Honda metropolitan if

journal or the Honda metropolitan if
you're<00:00:07.649> from<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.859> US<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:09.170> few<00:00:10.170> remarks<00:00:10.559> on<00:00:12.290> why

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
you're from the US a few remarks on why

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.919 
you're from the US a few remarks on why
I'm<00:00:13.530> making<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:14.070> really<00:00:15.059> it's<00:00:15.330> an<00:00:15.450> overview

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
I'm making this really it's an overview

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.540 
I'm making this really it's an overview
it's<00:00:16.109> not<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> review<00:00:16.770> it's<00:00:16.949> not<00:00:17.130> very<00:00:17.789> critical

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
it's not a review it's not very critical

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.980 
it's not a review it's not very critical
it<00:00:20.550> has<00:00:20.850> one<00:00:21.210> competitor<00:00:22.220> this<00:00:23.220> scooter<00:00:24.180> it

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
it has one competitor this scooter it

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.390 
it has one competitor this scooter it
it's<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.039> Yamaha<00:00:26.460> vino<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.349> the<00:00:28.349> Yamaha<00:00:29.039> Gino

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
it's the Yamaha vino and the Yamaha Gino

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.040 
it's the Yamaha vino and the Yamaha Gino
is<00:00:29.580> more<00:00:30.240> expensive<00:00:30.510> by<00:00:30.750> three<00:00:30.929> hundred

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
is more expensive by three hundred

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.290 
is more expensive by three hundred
dollars<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.619> think<00:00:31.650> more<00:00:32.340> or<00:00:32.430> less<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:33.090> there

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
dollars I think more or less but there

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.870 
dollars I think more or less but there
was<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> special<00:00:33.780> dis<00:00:34.140> fall<00:00:34.730> Honda<00:00:35.730> had<00:00:35.850> a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
was a special dis fall Honda had a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.340 
was a special dis fall Honda had a
special<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.480> they<00:00:36.540> took<00:00:36.690> off<00:00:36.840> another<00:00:37.079> three

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
special and they took off another three

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.830 
special and they took off another three
hundred<00:00:37.380> dollars<00:00:38.059> so<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> think<00:00:39.270> if<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.690> would

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
hundred dollars so I think if it would

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.910 
hundred dollars so I think if it would
have<00:00:39.960> cut<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.260> would<00:00:40.350> only<00:00:40.559> been<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> three

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
have cut that would only been a three

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.080 
have cut that would only been a three
hundred<00:00:41.129> dollar<00:00:41.250> difference<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.820> would<00:00:41.879> have

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
hundred dollar difference I would have

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.869 
hundred dollar difference I would have
bought<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.890> Yamaha<00:00:43.890> vino<00:00:44.160> because<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.399> had<00:00:44.579> one

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
bought the Yamaha vino because I had one

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.790 
bought the Yamaha vino because I had one
maybe<00:00:45.149> twelve<00:00:46.079> years<00:00:46.230> ago<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.649> was<00:00:46.710> very

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
maybe twelve years ago and it was very

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.360 
maybe twelve years ago and it was very
good<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:48.739> what's<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> difference<00:00:50.219> between

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
good so what's the difference between

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.110 
good so what's the difference between
this<00:00:50.820> bike<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.870> Yamaha<00:00:52.350> well<00:00:52.949> two<00:00:53.820> things

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
this bike and the Yamaha well two things

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.420 
this bike and the Yamaha well two things
one<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.989> Yamaha<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.590> liquid<00:00:55.890> cooled<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.309> this

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
one the Yamaha is liquid cooled and this

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.010 
one the Yamaha is liquid cooled and this
one<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.760> air<00:00:57.120> pool<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.570> that's<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.840> less

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
one here is air pool so that's a less

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.670 
one here is air pool so that's a less
sophisticated<00:00:58.230> system<00:00:59.190> and<00:01:00.079> also<00:01:01.079> there's<00:01:01.379> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
sophisticated system and also there's a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.880 
sophisticated system and also there's a
pump<00:01:02.250> for<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.270> gas<00:01:03.719> tank<00:01:03.989> whereas<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.680> one

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
pump for the gas tank whereas this one

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.300 
pump for the gas tank whereas this one
it<00:01:05.040> uses<00:01:05.250> gravity<00:01:06.350> also<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.380> think<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.920> don't

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
it uses gravity also I think I don't

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.250 
it uses gravity also I think I don't
know<00:01:08.549> why<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.060> seem<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.330> remember<00:01:09.450> having<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
know why but I seem to remember having a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.870 
know why but I seem to remember having a
little<00:01:10.470> bit<00:01:10.560> more<00:01:10.710> cargo<00:01:11.010> space<00:01:11.159> under<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
little bit more cargo space under the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.070 
little bit more cargo space under the
seat<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:13.439> Vino<00:01:14.090> however<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> $600<00:01:15.960> of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
seat in the Vino however the $600 of

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.920 
seat in the Vino however the $600 of
difference<00:01:16.350> made<00:01:16.530> me<00:01:16.650> buy<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.860> bike<00:01:17.930> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
difference made me buy this bike the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.070 
difference made me buy this bike the
suspension<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.670> extremely<00:01:20.670> soft<00:01:20.990> making<00:01:21.990> it

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
suspension is extremely soft making it

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.770 
suspension is extremely soft making it
very<00:01:22.229> comfortable<00:01:23.000> however<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.270> find<00:01:24.630> myself

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
very comfortable however I find myself

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.080 
very comfortable however I find myself
bottoming<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.070> suspension<00:01:26.520> which<00:01:26.850> makes

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
bottoming out the suspension which makes

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.060 
bottoming out the suspension which makes
the<00:01:27.270> bike<00:01:27.810> feel<00:01:28.110> cheap<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:29.520> fuel<00:01:30.180> economy

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
the bike feel cheap the fuel economy

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.410 
the bike feel cheap the fuel economy
despite<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.280> less<00:01:32.490> sophisticated<00:01:32.759> cooling

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
despite the less sophisticated cooling

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.100 
despite the less sophisticated cooling
system<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.460> excellent<00:01:35.540> about<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.720> liter<00:01:36.869> per

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
system is excellent about one liter per

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.800 
system is excellent about one liter per
50<00:01:37.409> kilometers<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.490> city<00:01:38.880> driving<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.570> that's

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
50 kilometers in city driving so that's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.140 
50 kilometers in city driving so that's
really<00:01:40.290> awesome<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.920> also<00:01:41.670> another<00:01:41.909> thing<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
really awesome and also another thing I

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.370 
really awesome and also another thing I
like<00:01:42.270> about<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.570> scooter<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.049> doesn't

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
like about this scooter and it doesn't

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.319 
like about this scooter and it doesn't
make<00:01:43.470> very<00:01:43.649> much<00:01:43.799> noise<00:01:44.130> I'm<00:01:44.759> gonna<00:01:44.939> start<00:01:45.210> it

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
make very much noise I'm gonna start it

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.580 
make very much noise I'm gonna start it
up<00:01:45.420> here<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.810> guys<00:01:45.930> can

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.249 

all<00:01:50.590> right<00:01:50.860> that's<00:01:51.220> lit<00:01:51.550> up

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.890 

not<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.100> lot<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.340> noise<00:01:55.659> even<00:01:56.659> when<00:01:56.810> you

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
not a lot of noise even when you

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.020 
not a lot of noise even when you
accelerate<00:01:57.380> there<00:01:57.799> isn't<00:01:58.159> a<00:01:58.220> lot<00:01:58.400> of<00:01:58.430> noise<00:01:58.729> so

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
accelerate there isn't a lot of noise so

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.719 
accelerate there isn't a lot of noise so
it's<00:01:59.299> really<00:01:59.689> a<00:01:59.720> it's<00:02:01.720> a<00:02:02.720> mature<00:02:02.930> scooter<00:02:03.729> if

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
it's really a it's a mature scooter if

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.310 
it's really a it's a mature scooter if
you<00:02:04.850> know<00:02:04.970> what<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.149> mean

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
you know what I mean

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.810 
you know what I mean
a<00:02:06.350> couple<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:06.950> things<00:02:07.100> that<00:02:07.159> they<00:02:07.340> distinguish

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
a couple of things that they distinguish

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.219 
a couple of things that they distinguish
themselves<00:02:07.970> these<00:02:08.390> little<00:02:08.690> hooks<00:02:08.840> here<00:02:09.110> these

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
themselves these little hooks here these

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.719 
themselves these little hooks here these
are<00:02:09.410> for<00:02:09.530> bags<00:02:09.709> I<00:02:09.860> find<00:02:10.039> those<00:02:10.130> very<00:02:10.369> useful

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
are for bags I find those very useful

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.150 
are for bags I find those very useful
when<00:02:10.819> you're<00:02:10.970> carrying<00:02:11.360> groceries<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.650> also

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
when you're carrying groceries and also

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.920 
when you're carrying groceries and also
there's<00:02:13.310> two<00:02:13.520> storage<00:02:14.120> bins<00:02:14.390> here<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.810> can

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
there's two storage bins here you can

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.360 
there's two storage bins here you can
easily<00:02:15.050> put<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.380> little<00:02:15.739> bottle<00:02:16.100> of<00:02:16.160> water

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
whatever apart from that it's very

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.509 
whatever apart from that it's very
similar<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.140> competition<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.890> has<00:02:21.920> pretty

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
similar to the competition it has pretty

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.770 
similar to the competition it has pretty
much<00:02:22.610> all<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.830> same<00:02:24.830> things<00:02:25.780> speedometer

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680

warning so there's a catalytic converter
in<00:02:33.769> back<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:35.319> I'm<00:02:36.319> very<00:02:36.560> satisfied<00:02:36.799> with<00:02:37.280> this

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
in back and I'm very satisfied with this

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.360 
in back and I'm very satisfied with this
with<00:02:38.239> this<00:02:38.390> bike<00:02:38.569> so<00:02:38.810> that's<00:02:39.049> pretty<00:02:39.680> much<00:02:40.040> the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
with this bike so that's pretty much the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.199 
with this bike so that's pretty much the
review<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:40.940> this<00:02:41.390> bike<00:02:42.040> another<00:02:43.040> thing<00:02:43.310> when

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
review of this bike another thing when

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.729 
review of this bike another thing when
you<00:02:44.299> ex<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.690> find<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.049> engine<00:02:45.200> maybe<00:02:45.530> it's<00:02:45.680> a

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
you ex I find the engine maybe it's a

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.490 
you ex I find the engine maybe it's a
bit<00:02:45.890> weaker<00:02:46.250> than<00:02:46.280> on<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.640> Yamaha<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:48.350> I<00:02:48.380> think

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
bit weaker than on the Yamaha so I think

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.259 
bit weaker than on the Yamaha so I think
there's<00:02:48.769> a<00:02:48.860> bit<00:02:48.980> more<00:02:49.010> fuel<00:02:49.489> economy<00:02:49.819> on<00:02:50.120> this

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
there's a bit more fuel economy on this

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.900 
there's a bit more fuel economy on this
one<00:02:50.480> thing<00:02:50.860> but<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:51.920> could<00:02:52.100> be<00:02:52.190> mistaken<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.760> mean

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
one thing but I could be mistaken I mean

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.090 
one thing but I could be mistaken I mean
I<00:02:53.000> had<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.360> Yamaha<00:02:53.660> maybe<00:02:53.930> 10<00:02:54.380> years<00:02:54.620> ago<00:02:54.799> and

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
I had that Yamaha maybe 10 years ago and

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.380 
I had that Yamaha maybe 10 years ago and
I<00:02:55.160> used<00:02:55.190> it<00:02:55.459> for<00:02:55.580> about<00:02:55.670> a<00:02:55.790> year<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.120> half<00:02:56.239> or

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
I used it for about a year and a half or

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.990 
I used it for about a year and a half or
two<00:02:56.420> years<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.620> really<00:02:58.040> good<00:02:58.190> vehicles<00:02:58.670> for

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
two years so really good vehicles for

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.800 
two years so really good vehicles for
going<00:02:59.930> in<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.109> city<00:03:00.260> got<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.280> cute<00:03:01.579> little

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
going in the city got a cute little

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.720 
going in the city got a cute little
pgm-fi<00:03:02.859> sticker<00:03:03.859> here<00:03:04.100> it<00:03:04.190> does<00:03:04.340> have<00:03:04.370> fuel

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
pgm-fi sticker here it does have fuel

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.590 
pgm-fi sticker here it does have fuel
infection

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
infection

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.640 
infection
fuel<00:03:06.440> injection<00:03:07.690> but<00:03:08.690> it's<00:03:08.989> two<00:03:09.290> valves<00:03:09.620> per

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
fuel injection but it's two valves per

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.199 
fuel injection but it's two valves per
cylinder<00:03:09.799> and<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:10.190> think<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.519> Yamaha<00:03:11.090> has

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
cylinder and I think the Yamaha has

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.759 
cylinder and I think the Yamaha has
three<00:03:11.420> valves<00:03:11.750> per<00:03:11.900> summer<00:03:12.109> so<00:03:12.320> I<00:03:12.350> think<00:03:12.530> the

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
three valves per summer so I think the

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.289 
three valves per summer so I think the
yam<00:03:12.920> was<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.160> little<00:03:13.459> bit<00:03:13.549> more<00:03:13.730> sophisticated

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
yam was a little bit more sophisticated

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.030 
yam was a little bit more sophisticated
than<00:03:14.480> this<00:03:14.630> one<00:03:14.840> but<00:03:14.959> it<00:03:15.079> costs<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.680> bit<00:03:15.859> less

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
than this one but it costs a bit less

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.630 
than this one but it costs a bit less
this<00:03:16.459> one<00:03:16.900> so<00:03:17.900> up<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.320> you<00:03:18.440> pick<00:03:18.890> yours<00:03:19.220> I<00:03:19.459> had<00:03:19.609> a

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
this one so up to you pick yours I had a

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.550 
this one so up to you pick yours I had a
great<00:03:19.820> experience<00:03:19.910> with<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.420> Yamaha<00:03:20.840> I<00:03:21.109> guess

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
great experience with the Yamaha I guess

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.430 
great experience with the Yamaha I guess
I<00:03:21.709> was<00:03:22.510> attracted<00:03:23.510> by<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.660> Honda<00:03:24.049> special

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
I was attracted by the Honda special

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.660 
I was attracted by the Honda special
which<00:03:24.560> is<00:03:24.680> why<00:03:24.859> I<00:03:24.890> bought<00:03:25.100> this<00:03:25.280> one<00:03:25.489> at<00:03:25.609> the

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
which is why I bought this one at the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.720 
which is why I bought this one at the
end<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:25.940> season<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:27.650> think<00:03:27.950> both<00:03:28.310> are<00:03:28.340> good

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
end of the season I think both are good

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.069 
end of the season I think both are good
and<00:03:28.940> I<00:03:29.000> think<00:03:29.060> probably<00:03:29.600> both<00:03:29.750> are<00:03:29.930> very

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
and I think probably both are very

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.470 
and I think probably both are very
reliable<00:03:30.769> both<00:03:31.549> don't<00:03:31.820> require<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.180> lot<00:03:32.450> of

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
reliable both don't require a lot of

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.099 
reliable both don't require a lot of
maintenance<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:34.450> like<00:03:35.450> this<00:03:35.600> video<00:03:35.900> if<00:03:36.019> you
