suspect<00:00:02.460> and<00:00:02.970> today<00:00:03.689> we're<00:00:03.929> going<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.140> be

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
suspect and today we're going to be

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.559 
suspect and today we're going to be
going<00:00:04.380> over<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.950> best<00:00:05.310> shot<00:00:05.549> gun<00:00:05.790> class<00:00:06.060> in<00:00:06.359> my

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
going over the best shot gun class in my

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.500 
going over the best shot gun class in my
opinion<00:00:06.980> so<00:00:07.980> in<00:00:08.189> black<00:00:08.400> ops<00:00:08.610> 2<00:00:08.760> there's<00:00:09.210> four

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
opinion so in black ops 2 there's four

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.959 
opinion so in black ops 2 there's four
shotguns<00:00:09.840> now<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.620> believe<00:00:11.219> there's<00:00:11.490> only<00:00:11.610> two

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
shotguns now I believe there's only two

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.749 
shotguns now I believe there's only two
viable<00:00:12.300> shotguns<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.320> let's<00:00:14.130> just<00:00:14.309> say<00:00:14.549> the

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
viable shotguns and let's just say the

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.660 
viable shotguns and let's just say the
other<00:00:14.910> two<00:00:15.269> are<00:00:15.299> not<00:00:15.839> up<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.230> par<00:00:16.670> they're

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
other two are not up to par they're

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.840 
other two are not up to par they're
garbage<00:00:18.000> no<00:00:18.630> but<00:00:18.980> because<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> black<00:00:20.369> ops<00:00:20.609> 2

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
garbage no but because the black ops 2

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.109 
garbage no but because the black ops 2
maps<00:00:21.090> are<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.840> not<00:00:22.710> rush<00:00:23.010> or<00:00:23.220> friendly<00:00:23.640> you're

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
maps are so not rush or friendly you're

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.730 
maps are so not rush or friendly you're
going<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> want<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.720> choose<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.930> shotgun<00:00:25.470> with

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
going to want to choose a shotgun with

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.849 
going to want to choose a shotgun with
the<00:00:26.070> most<00:00:26.369> range<00:00:26.820> possible<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.410> shotguns

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
the most range possible so the shotguns

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.359 
the most range possible so the shotguns
I'd<00:00:29.010> recommend<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.060> r870<00:00:30.840> or<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.560> KSG<00:00:31.920> and

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
I'd recommend is the r870 or the KSG and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.760 
I'd recommend is the r870 or the KSG and
in<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.239> class<00:00:33.510> setup<00:00:33.840> video<00:00:33.989> i'm<00:00:34.320> using<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
in this class setup video i'm using the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.600 
in this class setup video i'm using the
r870<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.540> let's<00:00:36.989> jump<00:00:37.230> into<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.649> set<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
r870 so let's jump into the set up the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.330 
r870 so let's jump into the set up the
shotgun<00:00:38.910> amusing<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.930> r870<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.920> i<00:00:41.100> only

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
shotgun amusing is the r870 and i only

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.860 
shotgun amusing is the r870 and i only
have<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.730> long<00:00:41.940> barrel<00:00:42.270> attachment<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.840> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
have the long barrel attachment to it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.900 
have the long barrel attachment to it
because<00:00:43.590> i<00:00:43.950> don't<00:00:44.129> really<00:00:44.250> think<00:00:44.550> any<00:00:44.820> other

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
because i don't really think any other

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.840 
because i don't really think any other
attachment<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.840> necessary<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.890> gun<00:00:47.160> even

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
attachment is necessary on this gun even

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.700 
attachment is necessary on this gun even
the<00:00:47.969> laser<00:00:48.210> sight<00:00:48.570> because<00:00:48.809> you're<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.620> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the laser sight because you're going to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.380 
the laser sight because you're going to
want<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.010> aim<00:00:50.250> down<00:00:50.489> sight<00:00:50.789> every<00:00:51.090> time<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
want to aim down sight every time you

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.779 
want to aim down sight every time you
use<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.719> shotgun<00:00:51.960> now<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.739> did<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> test<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.730> this

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
use the shotgun now I did a test on this

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.360 
use the shotgun now I did a test on this
and<00:00:54.149> as<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.350> see<00:00:55.379> when<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.010> million<00:00:56.250> out

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and as you can see when a million out

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.130 
and as you can see when a million out
site<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.969> spread<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.360> way<00:00:57.539> lower<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
site the spread is way lower and the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.319 
site the spread is way lower and the
accuracy<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.680> way<00:00:59.039> higher<00:00:59.340> than<00:00:59.370> hip<00:01:00.030> firing

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
accuracy is way higher than hip firing

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.319 
accuracy is way higher than hip firing
even<00:01:01.050> with<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.500> laser<00:01:01.680> sight<00:01:02.010> attachment<00:01:02.329> so

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
even with the laser sight attachment so

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.359 
even with the laser sight attachment so
for<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> perks<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.559> hardline<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
for the perks I have hardline and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.580 
for the perks I have hardline and
lightweight<00:01:05.909> now<00:01:06.659> light<00:01:07.080> weights<00:01:07.320> there

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
lightweight now light weights there

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.170 
lightweight now light weights there
obviously<00:01:07.799> because<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.760> want<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> move

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
obviously because you want to move

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.300 
obviously because you want to move
around<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.600> fast<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.890> want<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.189> get

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
around really fast and you want to get

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.039 
around really fast and you want to get
up<00:01:11.520> close<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:11.970> your<00:01:12.180> enemy's<00:01:12.540> face<00:01:12.780> before

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
up close to your enemy's face before

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.740 
up close to your enemy's face before
they<00:01:13.350> even<00:01:13.560> see<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.270> hardline

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
they even see you and I have hardline

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.480 
they even see you and I have hardline
because<00:01:16.080> i<00:01:16.110> didn't<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.710> find<00:01:17.009> black

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
because i didn't really find black

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.760 
because i didn't really find black
jacket<00:01:17.939> or<00:01:18.030> ghosts<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.720> necessary<00:01:19.320> you're

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
jacket or ghosts really necessary you're

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.469 
jacket or ghosts really necessary you're
going<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.009> be<00:01:20.130> moving<00:01:20.369> around<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:21.000> lot<00:01:21.240> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
going to be moving around a lot and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.510 
going to be moving around a lot and
you're<00:01:21.630> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> be<00:01:21.900> moving<00:01:22.259> around<00:01:22.380> fast<00:01:22.890> so

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you're going to be moving around fast so

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.950 
you're going to be moving around fast so
you're<00:01:23.759> not<00:01:23.880> likely<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.330> run<00:01:24.659> into<00:01:24.689> any

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
you're not likely to run into any

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.710 
you're not likely to run into any
grenades<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.729> next<00:01:26.759> part<00:01:27.180> i<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.540> is

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
grenades so the next part i have is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.749 
grenades so the next part i have is
toughness<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.400> because

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
toughness and I have this because

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.429 
toughness and I have this because
shotguns<00:01:30.210> are<00:01:30.299> highly<00:01:30.780> dependent<00:01:31.320> on

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
shotguns are highly dependent on

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.100 
shotguns are highly dependent on
accuracy<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.759> slightest<00:01:33.270> throw<00:01:33.570> off<00:01:33.750> can

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
accuracy so the slightest throw off can

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.380 
accuracy so the slightest throw off can
mean<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> hitmarker<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.670> you're<00:01:35.880> gonna<00:01:36.030> want<00:01:36.329> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
mean a hitmarker so you're gonna want to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
mean a hitmarker so you're gonna want to
have<00:01:36.509> toughness<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.049> help<00:01:37.470> keep<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.920> target

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
have toughness that help keep on target

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.300 
have toughness that help keep on target
and<00:01:38.659> for<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> last<00:01:39.960> perk<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.770> dexterity

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and for the last perk I have dexterity

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.630 
and for the last perk I have dexterity
now<00:01:42.090> that's<00:01:42.780> there<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.829> buildings<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
now that's there to go in buildings and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.550 
now that's there to go in buildings and
climate<00:01:44.970> ladders<00:01:45.390> faster<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.079> more

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
climate ladders faster but more

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.990 
climate ladders faster but more
importantly<00:01:47.100> since<00:01:47.430> you're<00:01:47.610> running<00:01:47.909> around

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
importantly since you're running around

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.639 
importantly since you're running around
a<00:01:48.270> lot<00:01:48.450> you're<00:01:48.840> going<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.079> want<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.320> have<00:01:49.470> that

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
a lot you're going to want to have that

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.550 
a lot you're going to want to have that
faster<00:01:50.130> recovery<00:01:50.310> time<00:01:50.880> now<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.720> concussion

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
faster recovery time now the concussion

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.499 
faster recovery time now the concussion
and<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.860> semtex<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.520> there<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.939> help<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.270> deal

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
and the semtex is there to help you deal

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.109 
and the semtex is there to help you deal
with<00:01:54.540> any<00:01:54.780> campers<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.579> anybody<00:01:56.579> that's<00:01:56.820> far

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
with any campers or anybody that's far

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.120 
with any campers or anybody that's far
away<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.600> know<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.960> there<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.560> can

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
away that you know is there and you can

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.249 
away that you know is there and you can
probably<00:01:59.520> use<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.700> secondary<00:02:00.329> over<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.869> but

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
probably use a secondary over this but

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.770 
probably use a secondary over this but
I'd<00:02:01.860> prefer<00:02:02.100> grenade<00:02:02.759> over<00:02:03.119> secondaries

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
I'd prefer grenade over secondaries

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.929 
I'd prefer grenade over secondaries
because<00:02:04.140> they're<00:02:04.500> generally<00:02:04.950> better<00:02:05.579> and

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
because they're generally better and

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.359 
because they're generally better and
more<00:02:06.180> fast-paced<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.170> they're<00:02:07.829> more<00:02:07.979> suited

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
more fast-paced and they're more suited

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.160 
more fast-paced and they're more suited
with<00:02:08.580> shotguns<00:02:09.119> anyways<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.720> mean<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.080> don't

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
with shotguns anyways I mean you don't

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.780 
with shotguns anyways I mean you don't
see<00:02:10.379> sandy<00:02:10.800> ravaged<00:02:11.250> pulling<00:02:11.700> out

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
see sandy ravaged pulling out

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.820 
see sandy ravaged pulling out
secondaries<00:02:12.450> d

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
secondaries d

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.250 
secondaries d
well<00:02:13.490> actually<00:02:13.850> shotguns<00:02:14.600> are<00:02:14.720> secondary<00:02:15.140> to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
well actually shotguns are secondary to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.410 
well actually shotguns are secondary to
model<00:02:15.590> 142<00:02:15.890> but<00:02:16.160> yeah<00:02:16.670> whatever<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:17.330> forget

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
model 142 but yeah whatever just forget

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.290 
model 142 but yeah whatever just forget
that<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.830> that's<00:02:19.250> pretty<00:02:19.520> much<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:19.760> for<00:02:20.000> the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
that so that's pretty much it for the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.150 
that so that's pretty much it for the
set<00:02:20.540> up<00:02:20.660> go<00:02:20.960> ahead<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.170> try<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.560> yourself<00:02:21.950> in

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
set up go ahead and try it yourself in

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.790 
set up go ahead and try it yourself in
it's<00:02:22.820> pretty<00:02:23.090> fun<00:02:23.390> class<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.870> use<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.380> at<00:02:24.650> the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
it's pretty fun class to use and at the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.830 
it's pretty fun class to use and at the
same<00:02:24.950> time<00:02:25.010> it's<00:02:25.400> really<00:02:25.970> really<00:02:26.330> effective

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
same time it's really really effective

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.110 
same time it's really really effective
the<00:02:27.590> shotguns<00:02:27.980> haven't<00:02:28.490> really<00:02:28.790> been<00:02:28.910> this

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
the shotguns haven't really been this

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.540 
the shotguns haven't really been this
good<00:02:29.330> since<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.870> model<00:02:30.260> for<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.620> spazz<00:02:30.950> 12<00:02:31.370> in

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
good since the model for to spazz 12 in

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.340 
good since the model for to spazz 12 in
you<00:02:32.090> can<00:02:32.270> see<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:32.630> game<00:02:32.870> plate<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.230> I'm

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
you can see in this game plate that I'm

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.470 
you can see in this game plate that I'm
getting<00:02:33.650> really<00:02:34.040> really<00:02:34.340> insane<00:02:34.790> kills<00:02:35.150> and

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
getting really really insane kills and

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.480 
getting really really insane kills and
the<00:02:35.930> range<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.230> definitely<00:02:36.920> better<00:02:37.070> than<00:02:37.250> the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
the range is definitely better than the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.460 
the range is definitely better than the
model<00:02:37.820> for<00:02:38.000> three<00:02:38.180> shotgun<00:02:38.570> so<00:02:38.780> if<00:02:39.230> you're

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
model for three shotgun so if you're

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.650 
model for three shotgun so if you're
still<00:02:39.650> doubting<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.190> shotguns<00:02:40.670> because<00:02:41.270> you

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
still doubting the shotguns because you

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.960 
still doubting the shotguns because you
hated<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.050> model<00:02:42.440> for<00:02:42.620> 3<00:02:42.860> seconds<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.460> you

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
hated the model for 3 seconds and you

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.640 
hated the model for 3 seconds and you
won't<00:02:44.150> be<00:02:44.240> disciplined<00:02:44.870> with<00:02:45.050> this<00:02:45.290> one<00:02:45.470> go

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650
