00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.880
 how to install the incredible game 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.250
 Spiderman for all operating system 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.190
 android what they have to do is 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.830
 go to these download link that I will leave 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.529
 in the description once they have 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.670
 downloaded will be three files left 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.320
 rar like these 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.620
 to sin the rar files connect it to 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.810
 its 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:38.190
 to your tablet or cell phone and stick them to the 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:40.890
 the file called gameloft what they 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.320
 will be when they decompress 23 art and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:50.120
 delete what you paste to your tablet or cell phone 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.950
 with android device to the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.610
 microsd card 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.610
 in this way 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.770
 the track I already have it stuck 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:11.930
 there is the game of the incredible man 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:15.470
 spider and is on the pike they install it and 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.439
 wallace android device but in the 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.430
 sd card in the internal card of the 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:25.909
 tablet here they install it where they want me 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.830
 I install it in downloads to find it 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.939
 faster 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.580
 and here it is and there it hits that I have 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.420
 track 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:43.670
 once this is done we go to our 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:46.150
 tablet and install the APEC 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.150
 ah 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.990
 here is the tablet we're going 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.820
 where we downloaded that is here the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.820
 records 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:12.040
 indoor links downloads and we look for the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.650
 most incredible track spider-man arrive at 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.600
 show it because I already have it and now what 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:23.310
 that I had once installed is this 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.310
 they will have some 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.629
 like this 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:32.599
 they open it and the game will run normally 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:35.060
 this is the first time if they are not your 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.189
 our dash board have to 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.980
 connect have to be connected to 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:42.889
 wifi and if it 's broken there's no 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.459
 problem if in the game you do not 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:48.739
 run they open it and they are closed by 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.200
 a some problem what they have to 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.459
 do is be my files and where have 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.829
 copied from the computer the data of 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.750
 game that is here in gameloft give you 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.720
 here they copy it 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:08.940
 and they're stuck 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:11.460
 to the sdk the tablet card and here 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.790
 in the root it hits you saying it and it comes out 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.550
 replace him they have replaced like that and there 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.580
 I'm saying because the first time 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.920
 I installed this or left error and I had almost 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.710
 that procedure so that the game does not 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.070
 can run normally then we open 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.070
 the game 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.390
 and we wait for him to load 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.560
 in the beginning the game with all 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:55.620
 normal 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.620
 and new data we skipped this 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.510
 my start there have to wait for 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.439
 charge and then I run the normally 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:17.070
 this was all and if they have more games than 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:20.120

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.120
