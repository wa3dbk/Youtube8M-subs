very<00:00:59.570> very<00:00:59.900> strong<00:01:00.550> unlooked-for<00:01:01.550> since<00:01:02.239> the

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
very very strong unlooked-for since the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
place so that you know when I hear

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.110 
place so that you know when I hear
things<00:01:06.710> on<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:06.979> radio<00:01:07.310> I<00:01:07.370> can't<00:01:07.729> remember

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120

where<00:01:08.270> I<00:01:08.300> last<00:01:08.600> heard<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.080> that<00:01:09.229> kind<00:01:09.500> of

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
where I last heard and that kind of

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.380 
where I last heard and that kind of
thing<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.010> that<00:01:10.220> everything<00:01:10.640> is<00:01:10.910> come<00:01:11.090> tied

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
thing and that everything is come tied

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.810 
thing and that everything is come tied
down<00:01:11.660> a<00:01:11.720> terrible<00:01:12.500> kind<00:01:12.740> of<00:01:12.830> clawing<00:01:13.310> network

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
down a terrible kind of clawing network

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.030 
down a terrible kind of clawing network
of<00:01:14.410> references<00:01:15.410> like<00:01:15.650> that<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.160> I<00:01:16.940> think<00:01:18.040> that

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
of references like that and I think that

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.480 
of references like that and I think that
landscape<00:01:20.030> is<00:01:20.240> just<00:01:20.479> a<00:01:20.570> very<00:01:20.750> useful<00:01:21.490> metaphor

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
landscape is just a very useful metaphor

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.420 
landscape is just a very useful metaphor
for<00:01:23.030> how<00:01:23.150> music<00:01:23.630> works<00:01:23.960> in<00:01:24.830> language<00:01:25.250> is

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
for how music works in language is

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.950 
for how music works in language is
another<00:01:25.700> one<00:01:25.910> that<00:01:25.940> it's<00:01:26.270> very<00:01:26.570> complicated

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
another one that it's very complicated

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.620 
another one that it's very complicated
for<00:01:27.470> reasons<00:01:27.770> we<00:01:27.890> know<00:01:28.040> to<00:01:28.670> employ<00:01:29.180> that<00:01:29.450> one

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
for reasons we know to employ that one

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.940 
for reasons we know to employ that one
place<00:01:30.410> is<00:01:30.680> very<00:01:30.920> good<00:01:31.100> because<00:01:32.680> none<00:01:33.680> of<00:01:33.710> us

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
place is very good because none of us

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.940 
place is very good because none of us
seized<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:35.000> same<00:01:35.240> location<00:01:35.479> in<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.410> same<00:01:36.680> way

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
seized the same location in the same way

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.830 
seized the same location in the same way
and<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:39.790> landscape<00:01:40.790> with<00:01:41.030> nobody<00:01:41.390> in<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:41.600> can

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
and the landscape with nobody in it can

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.249 
and the landscape with nobody in it can
lie<00:01:42.020> dormant<00:01:42.080> until<00:01:42.710> it's<00:01:43.630> visited<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:44.899> you

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
lie dormant until it's visited and you

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.690 
lie dormant until it's visited and you
know<00:01:45.380> in<00:01:45.440> various<00:01:45.830> ways<00:01:45.860> i<00:01:46.220> gloated<00:01:46.580> is

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
know in various ways i gloated is

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.120 
know in various ways i gloated is
changing<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.390> yet<00:01:48.050> it<00:01:48.170> can<00:01:48.320> change<00:01:48.500> I<00:01:48.740> think

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
changing and yet it can change I think

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.830 
changing and yet it can change I think
it<00:01:49.369> works<00:01:49.580> very<00:01:49.729> well<00:01:49.910> for<00:01:50.030> music<00:01:50.509> actually

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.060 
it works very well for music actually

because I mean I'm interested in in

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.410 
because I mean I'm interested in in
extracting<00:03:13.609> something<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.090> isn't<00:03:14.359> the

extracting something that isn't the

behavior Irish musical Barney's gamelan
I<00:03:18.859> used<00:03:19.700> actually<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.150> gamelan<00:03:20.569> notes<00:03:20.900> that

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
I used actually the gamelan notes that

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.559 
I used actually the gamelan notes that
the<00:03:21.409> kind<00:03:21.769> of<00:03:21.859> recurring<00:03:22.700> melodies<00:03:23.120> I<00:03:23.299> used

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
the kind of recurring melodies I used

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.110 
the kind of recurring melodies I used
them<00:03:23.719> in<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.900> kind<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.519> total<00:03:25.519> serum<00:03:25.790> ism

them in a kind of total serum ism

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.809 
them in a kind of total serum ism
actually<00:03:26.450> because<00:03:26.659> I<00:03:26.750> took<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.819> recurring

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
actually because I took the recurring

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.940 
actually because I took the recurring
patterns<00:03:29.389> of<00:03:29.599> notes<00:03:30.079> in<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.409> tunes<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:30.829> I

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
patterns of notes in the tunes that I

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.399 
patterns of notes in the tunes that I
knew<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.599> converted<00:03:32.599> them<00:03:32.659> into<00:03:32.750> numbers<00:03:33.290> and

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
knew and converted them into numbers and

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.770 
knew and converted them into numbers and
then<00:03:33.530> use<00:03:33.709> them<00:03:33.919> as<00:03:34.099> random<00:03:34.819> number<00:03:35.180> codes<00:03:35.450> so

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
then use them as random number codes so

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.460 
then use them as random number codes so
that<00:03:35.810> my<00:03:36.109> materials<00:03:36.680> came<00:03:37.459> back<00:03:38.030> in<00:03:38.359> a<00:03:39.079> similar

piece actually from the medium that he's

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.990 
piece actually from the medium that he's
working<00:04:18.109> in<00:04:18.500> so<00:04:18.769> an<00:04:19.220> element<00:04:19.609> of<00:04:19.669> what<00:04:19.820> goes

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
working in so an element of what goes

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.810 
working in so an element of what goes
into<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.299> string<00:04:20.539> quartet<00:04:20.720> should<00:04:21.260> be<00:04:21.610> kind<00:04:22.610> of

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
into a string quartet should be kind of

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.909 
into a string quartet should be kind of
discovered<00:04:23.510> from<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.320> fact<00:04:24.530> that<00:04:24.590> it's<00:04:24.800> a

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
discovered from the fact that it's a

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.219 
discovered from the fact that it's a
string<00:04:25.159> quartet<00:04:25.539> and<00:04:26.539> certainly<00:04:26.960> for

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
string quartet and certainly for

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.290 
string quartet and certainly for
students<00:04:27.949> i<00:04:28.039> think<00:04:28.220> that's<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.460> good<00:04:28.580> training

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
students i think that's a good training

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.589 
students i think that's a good training
i<00:04:29.599> think<00:04:30.130> you<00:04:31.130> know<00:04:31.280> one<00:04:31.699> should<00:04:32.000> discourage

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
i think you know one should discourage

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:36.360 
i think you know one should discourage
too<00:04:33.080> much<00:04:33.260> sort<00:04:33.530> of<00:04:33.590> abstract<00:04:34.479> importing<00:04:35.479> of

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
too much sort of abstract importing of

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.950 
too much sort of abstract importing of
you<00:04:37.370> know<00:04:37.520> stuff<00:04:38.060> and<00:04:38.330> then<00:04:38.449> just<00:04:38.720> sort<00:04:38.900> of

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
you know stuff and then just sort of

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.510 
you know stuff and then just sort of
putting<00:04:39.229> it<00:04:39.320> onto<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.620> quartet<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.250> think<00:04:40.430> that

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
putting it onto the quartet I think that

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.610 
putting it onto the quartet I think that
awareness<00:04:40.820> of<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.300> medium<00:04:41.690> it's<00:04:42.139> likely<00:04:42.380> to

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
awareness of the medium it's likely to

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.170 
awareness of the medium it's likely to
bring<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.889> instruments<00:04:43.039> and<00:04:43.669> the<00:04:43.729> medium<00:04:44.030> to

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
bring the instruments and the medium to

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.210 
bring the instruments and the medium to
life<00:04:44.590> obviously<00:04:45.590> you<00:04:45.650> get<00:04:45.740> more<00:04:45.949> experience

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
life obviously you get more experience

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.189 
life obviously you get more experience
there<00:04:46.550> other<00:04:46.669> ways<00:04:46.729> of<00:04:47.000> doing<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.330> and<00:04:47.840> I<00:04:47.990> think

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
there other ways of doing it and I think

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:49.810 
there other ways of doing it and I think
there<00:04:48.349> are<00:04:48.380> some<00:04:49.070> very<00:04:49.130> distinctive

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
there are some very distinctive

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.670 
there are some very distinctive
composers<00:04:50.389> who<00:04:50.930> for<00:04:51.620> example<00:04:53.139> discover<00:04:54.139> a<00:04:54.409> lot

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
composers who for example discover a lot

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.610 
composers who for example discover a lot
in<00:04:54.889> the<00:04:55.009> medium<00:04:55.430> that<00:04:55.669> they<00:04:55.849> write<00:04:56.300> for<00:04:56.720> and<00:04:57.050> I

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
in the medium that they write for and I

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.320 
in the medium that they write for and I
think<00:04:57.860> there<00:04:57.979> are<00:04:58.009> other<00:04:58.250> composers<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:59.210> this

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
think there are other composers and this

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.790 
think there are other composers and this
is<00:04:59.449> the<00:04:59.539> distinction<00:04:59.870> that<00:05:00.050> that<00:05:00.289> lecture<00:05:00.680> was

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
is the distinction that that lecture was

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.640 
is the distinction that that lecture was
about<00:05:01.070> I<00:05:01.220> think<00:05:01.430> there<00:05:01.550> are<00:05:01.580> other<00:05:01.849> composers

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
about I think there are other composers

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.280 
about I think there are other composers
who<00:05:03.040> very<00:05:03.690> strongly<00:05:06.600> carry<00:05:07.600> around<00:05:07.780> with<00:05:08.229> them

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
who very strongly carry around with them

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.120 
who very strongly carry around with them
a<00:05:08.620> set<00:05:08.979> of<00:05:09.160> apparatus<00:05:09.880> and<00:05:10.360> kind<00:05:10.600> of<00:05:11.130> visited

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
a set of apparatus and kind of visited

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.980 
a set of apparatus and kind of visited
home<00:05:12.310> to<00:05:12.460> each<00:05:12.610> median<00:05:13.150> and<00:05:13.330> another<00:05:13.720> worse

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
home to each median and another worse

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:22.740 
home to each median and another worse
for<00:05:14.259> that

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.810
