type<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.609> you're<00:00:17.850> comfortable<00:00:18.270> with<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.660> in

type that you're comfortable with and in

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.710 
type that you're comfortable with and in
my<00:00:19.350> experience<00:00:19.490> by<00:00:20.490> far<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.060> best<00:00:21.330> weapon<00:00:21.689> to

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
my experience by far the best weapon to

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.750 
my experience by far the best weapon to
use<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.170> game<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.830> fusion<00:00:23.279> rifles

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
use in the game is the fusion rifles

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.359 
use in the game is the fusion rifles
it's<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> very<00:00:24.930> different<00:00:25.199> weapon<00:00:25.769> because<00:00:26.220> you

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
it's a very different weapon because you

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.370 
it's a very different weapon because you
have<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.760> hold<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> r2<00:00:27.480> button<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.930> charge<00:00:28.199> it

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
have to hold the r2 button to charge it

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.800 
have to hold the r2 button to charge it
up<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.769> when<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.490> fully<00:00:29.670> charged<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.359> fires

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
up and when it's fully charged it fires

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.530 
up and when it's fully charged it fires
multiple<00:00:31.470> bullets<00:00:31.800> at<00:00:31.949> once<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.390> one

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
multiple bullets at once so the one

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.569 
multiple bullets at once so the one
negative<00:00:33.750> aspect<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.800> gun<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.430> you
