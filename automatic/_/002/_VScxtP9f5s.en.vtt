and this is going to stretch the stitch
up<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:33.300> create<00:02:34.300> our<00:02:34.330> tuck<00:02:34.720> stitch<00:02:36.300> okay<00:02:37.300> so

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
other strains are out and then we will

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:52.980 
other strains are out and then we will
continue<00:02:43.930> our<00:02:44.260> pattern<00:02:44.740> by<00:02:44.950> knitting<00:02:45.420> five

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
so we're going to repeat this sequence

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.610 
so we're going to repeat this sequence
until<00:02:55.510> we<00:02:55.630> reach<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.840> last<00:02:56.200> three<00:02:56.560> stitches

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
until we reach the last three stitches

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.680 
until we reach the last three stitches
in<00:02:57.100> our<00:02:57.490> row<00:02:59.910> or<00:03:00.910> when<00:03:01.060> we<00:03:01.180> reach<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.480> last

knitting into the stitch four rows below
so<00:04:30.540> I<00:04:30.570> think<00:04:30.720> before<00:04:30.990> I<00:04:31.200> was<00:04:31.440> getting<00:04:31.710> into<00:04:31.860> the

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.280 
so I think before I was getting into the
stitch<00:04:32.220> five<00:04:32.580> rows<00:04:32.940> below<00:04:33.150> so<00:04:33.900> let's<00:04:34.080> take<00:04:34.260> a

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
stitch five rows below so let's take a

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.050 
stitch five rows below so let's take a
look<00:04:34.440> at<00:04:34.590> this<00:04:34.680> we<00:04:34.860> want<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.100> go<00:04:35.220> into<00:04:35.520> the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
look at this we want to go into the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
look at this we want to go into the
stitch<00:04:36.270> that's<00:04:36.450> one<00:04:36.780> two<00:04:37.620> three<00:04:37.650> four<00:04:38.960> so<00:04:39.960> this

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
stitch that's one two three four so this

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.930 
stitch that's one two three four so this
is<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.440> stitch<00:04:40.680> that<00:04:40.710> I<00:04:41.010> want<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.670> be<00:04:41.790> knitting
