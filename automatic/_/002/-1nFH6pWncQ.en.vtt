00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.189
 and then people I'm here to talk 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.070
 about the game to go to the air 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.869
 which already gives its chapter 2 and today I go 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.750
 make a very big video only 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:19.880
 explaining some of the houses and then 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:24.310
 I'll make another video of the bulls. 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.310
 all game all game content 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.410
 let it in here 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.130
 create and lipsticks pool six classes 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.150
 cleric office has a lot to talk about have 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:50.620
 more defense points there she is more was 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.270
 a macbook is for bo bo made to others 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.670
 players 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.670
 It will be very good to attack. 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.480
 very good 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:12.870
 is the gunslinger gunslinger who is a 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.400
 woman with two handguns obvious that 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.280
 are 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.440
 their powers are very good and they have 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.950
 very good attack against defense but 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.680
 more with attack 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.940
 just like the shooter 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.530
 who does not have much to say that is 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.000
 basically a pistol the difference is 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.000
 he uses a one-handed weapon 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.980
 the clear tank that has more defense 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.980
 because he has a shield 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.800
 The warrior is what I have preference for. 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.080
 that I even played with him on the 21st 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.350
 and have to separate the best from the game 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.260
 for me the strongest and the armor and the 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.170
 Good thing is that it's a game that's very good. 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.010
 See you here have several types of 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.270
 hair the graphic is good 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:09.979
 now always hair there 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.979
 hair color type make 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.250
 and that's it, it's a very fast video and only 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.810
 will show some of the phases 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.630
 then I will show in detail all 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.700
 a part of the game as it is and then 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.700
 I'm going to build other games, that 's it 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.630
 I'll leave you there with the little girl. 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.319
 demonstration of how the game is and I will 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.319
 finish the video 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.800
 And do not forget here some day I go 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.110
 be bringing the gameplay to that 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.840
 game that I like a lot 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.600
 I'm going to close down here and see none. 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.480
 little good graphics and I 'm going to do another 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.870
 video showed gain gameplay gain from this 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.870
 game 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.500
