00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.099 

I've<00:00:05.879> talked<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.150> lot<00:00:06.240> about<00:00:06.390> filtration<00:00:06.779> on

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
I've talked a lot about filtration on

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.200 
I've talked a lot about filtration on
the<00:00:07.200> power<00:00:07.350> steering<00:00:07.770> system<00:00:08.189> well<00:00:08.790> it's<00:00:09.030> also

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
the power steering system well it's also

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.120 
the power steering system well it's also
important<00:00:09.719> on<00:00:09.780> other<00:00:09.960> systems<00:00:10.230> like<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.920> fuel

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
important on other systems like the fuel

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.009 
important on other systems like the fuel
system<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:12.000> we've<00:00:12.509> got<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.690> little<00:00:12.780> bit<00:00:12.929> of

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
system so we've got a little bit of

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.690 
system so we've got a little bit of
rough<00:00:13.170> idle<00:00:13.380> going<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.860> with<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.130> truck<00:00:14.370> and

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
rough idle going on with the truck and

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.860 
rough idle going on with the truck and
we<00:00:14.910> haven't<00:00:15.150> quite<00:00:15.240> got<00:00:15.509> through<00:00:15.690> all<00:00:15.780> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
we haven't quite got through all the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.450 
we haven't quite got through all the
Diagnostics<00:00:16.560> yet<00:00:16.770> but<00:00:17.160> one<00:00:17.250> thing<00:00:17.369> we're

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
Diagnostics yet but one thing we're

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.680 
Diagnostics yet but one thing we're
gonna<00:00:17.520> do<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.940> go<00:00:18.060> ahead<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.300> throw<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> fuel

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
gonna do is go ahead and throw a fuel

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.269 
gonna do is go ahead and throw a fuel
filter<00:00:18.840> on<00:00:19.170> now<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.710> know<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> lot<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.189> out

a couple of wrenches line wrenches work
best<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.349> don't<00:00:28.439> round<00:00:28.859> them<00:00:29.039> out<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.429> on

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
best you don't round them out and on

best you don't round them out and on
some<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.119> newer<00:00:30.269> stuff<00:00:30.359> they<00:00:30.720> got<00:00:30.869> you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
know quick release hoses and you can get

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.030 
know quick release hoses and you can get
some<00:00:33.300> real<00:00:33.480> simple<00:00:33.809> tools<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.710> and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
some real simple tools like this and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.190 
some real simple tools like this and
they'll<00:00:35.460> slip<00:00:35.730> over<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.059> line<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.079> can

piece of cake

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
piece of cake
now<00:00:42.480> what<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.690> does<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.649> keeps<00:00:44.129> all

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
now what that does is that keeps all

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.430 
now what that does is that keeps all
that<00:00:44.399> debris<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.059> things<00:00:45.450> from<00:00:45.960> moving<00:00:46.320> their

that debris and things from moving their
way<00:00:46.469> forward<00:00:47.010> into<00:00:47.520> some<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> more

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
way forward into some of the more

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
way forward into some of the more
high-dollar<00:00:48.660> stuff<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.440> your<00:00:49.620> injectors

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
high-dollar stuff like your injectors

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.310 
high-dollar stuff like your injectors
now<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> sort<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.390> neat<00:00:51.660> system<00:00:52.020> on

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
now this is a sort of a neat system on

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.439 
now this is a sort of a neat system on
this<00:00:52.500> vehicle<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.579> kind<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.850> bridge<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.090> gap

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
this vehicle it kind of bridge the gap

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.450 
this vehicle it kind of bridge the gap
between<00:00:54.530> throttle<00:00:55.530> body<00:00:55.680> injection<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
between throttle body injection and

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.310 
between throttle body injection and
multi-port<00:00:57.210> fuel<00:00:57.300> injection<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.170> think

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
multi-port fuel injection like you think

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.380 
multi-port fuel injection like you think
of<00:00:58.530> what<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.770> individual<00:00:59.280> injectors<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.270> on

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
of what the individual injectors up on

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.810 
of what the individual injectors up on
the<00:01:00.539> rail<00:01:00.750> now<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.219> what<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.489> got<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.699> the

the rail now this is what we got on the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.179 
the rail now this is what we got on the
truck<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:04.110> somewhat<00:01:04.860> called<00:01:05.070> the

truck here and it's somewhat called the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.300 
truck here and it's somewhat called the
spider<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.000> central<00:01:06.420> SFI<00:01:07.110> system<00:01:07.680> now<00:01:08.220> if

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
spider it's a central SFI system now if

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.039 
spider it's a central SFI system now if
you<00:01:08.400> look<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.180> mean<00:01:09.570> they're<00:01:09.689> tiny

you look in here I mean they're tiny

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.750 
you look in here I mean they're tiny
little<00:01:10.320> holes<00:01:10.590> tiny<00:01:10.920> little<00:01:11.040> orifices<00:01:11.549> with

trim<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.619> know<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.100> these<00:02:02.250> might<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.670> a

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
trim you know one of these might be a

little bit clogged or sticking and all
of<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.759> sudden<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:06.149> Bank<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.659> now<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.020> be

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
of a sudden this Bank is now going to be

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.109 
of a sudden this Bank is now going to be
running<00:02:07.290> richer<00:02:08.069> because<00:02:08.190> your<00:02:08.429> o2<00:02:08.550> sensor<00:02:08.729> is

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
running richer because your o2 sensor is

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.940 
running richer because your o2 sensor is
going<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.300> try<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.509> compensate<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.679> now<00:02:10.800> you're

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
going to try to compensate so now you're

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.010 
going to try to compensate so now you're
throwing<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.280> lot<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.459> extra<00:02:11.849> fuel<00:02:12.030> through

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
throwing a lot of extra fuel through

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.320 
throwing a lot of extra fuel through
in<00:02:13.200> out<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.650> tailpipe<00:02:13.860> which<00:02:14.370> now<00:02:14.880> it's<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.150> lot

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
in out the tailpipe which now it's a lot

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.300 
in out the tailpipe which now it's a lot
of<00:02:15.480> dollars<00:02:15.840> yeah<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.500> there's<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.770> lot<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:16.980> fuel

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
of dollars yeah so there's a lot of fuel

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.800 
of dollars yeah so there's a lot of fuel
economy<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.030> be<00:02:18.150> picked<00:02:18.360> up<00:02:18.570> by
