pretty cool yeah I got him when he was
three<00:02:28.940> years<00:02:29.030> old<00:02:29.420> from<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.620> lady<00:02:30.950> in

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
three years old from a lady in

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.540 
three years old from a lady in
Saskatchewan<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:33.200> she<00:02:33.890> was<00:02:34.070> trying<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.370> make

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
Saskatchewan that she was trying to make

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.550 
Saskatchewan that she was trying to make
a<00:02:34.580> barrel<00:02:34.970> horse<00:02:35.120> out<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.480> him<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:35.960> he<00:02:36.020> wasn't

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
a barrel horse out of him and he wasn't

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.160 
a barrel horse out of him and he wasn't
I<00:02:36.680> guess<00:02:37.130> cooperating<00:02:37.910> he<00:02:38.120> had<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.450> speed<00:02:38.780> but

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
I guess cooperating he had the speed but

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.320 
I guess cooperating he had the speed but
I<00:02:39.440> think<00:02:39.920> he<00:02:40.040> was<00:02:40.190> giving<00:02:40.370> her<00:02:40.580> some<00:02:40.820> problems

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
I think he was giving her some problems

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.490 
I think he was giving her some problems
bucking<00:02:42.260> her<00:02:42.350> off<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.590> little<00:02:42.920> bit<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:44.170> just<00:02:45.170> he

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
bucking her off a little bit and just he

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.470 
bucking her off a little bit and just he
has<00:02:45.950> always<00:02:46.220> been<00:02:46.520> a<00:02:46.580> little<00:02:46.820> bit<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.270> rebel

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480

he's got a huge personality and kind of

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.210 
he's got a huge personality and kind of
it's<00:02:51.800> his<00:02:52.340> way<00:02:52.520> or<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.760> highway<00:02:52.850> usually<00:02:53.810> but

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
it's his way or the highway usually but

him and I just kind of clicked we got
along<00:02:56.810> right<00:02:57.080> away<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:58.239> he<00:02:59.239> took<00:02:59.540> you

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
along right away and and he took you

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.990

know<00:03:00.320> I<00:03:00.350> hauled<00:03:00.739> him<00:03:00.920> for<00:03:01.160> quite<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.400> while<00:03:01.610> and

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
know I hauled him for quite a while and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.540 
know I hauled him for quite a while and
took<00:03:02.750> quite<00:03:02.989> a<00:03:03.050> while<00:03:03.140> training<00:03:03.650> him<00:03:03.950> but<00:03:04.220> I

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
took quite a while training him but I

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.940 
took quite a while training him but I
find<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.360> those<00:03:05.750> ones<00:03:06.050> that<00:03:06.350> take<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.709> little

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
find that those ones that take a little

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.070 
find that those ones that take a little
bit<00:03:07.220> extra<00:03:07.580> to<00:03:07.820> train<00:03:08.120> them<00:03:08.270> end<00:03:08.510> up<00:03:08.720> being<00:03:08.959> the

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
bit extra to train them end up being the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.130 
bit extra to train them end up being the
best<00:03:09.230> ones<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:11.030> know<00:03:11.209> where<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.510> stuff<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:11.989> on

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
best ones you know where it stuff it on

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.770 
best ones you know where it stuff it on
