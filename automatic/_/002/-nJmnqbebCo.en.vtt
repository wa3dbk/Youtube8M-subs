playing<00:01:19.530> again<00:01:19.860> with<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.280> TDM<00:01:20.670> rules<00:01:20.970> we've

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
playing again with the TDM rules we've

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.780 
playing again with the TDM rules we've
added<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.780> idea<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.229> once<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> kill

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
added this idea that once you get a kill

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.389 
added this idea that once you get a kill
you<00:01:24.420> become<00:01:24.750> cranked<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.560> start<00:01:25.830> speeding<00:01:26.189> up

your running all crazy and then you have

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.139 
your running all crazy and then you have
30<00:01:28.500> seconds<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.950> kill<00:01:29.189> another<00:01:29.399> enemy<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.000> if

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
the way we use UAV now they're called

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.950 
the way we use UAV now they're called
satcoms<00:04:06.340> this<00:04:06.820> has<00:04:06.970> a<00:04:07.000> different<00:04:07.360> element<00:04:07.450> as

them<00:04:10.240> put<00:04:10.570> them<00:04:10.690> off<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:10.930> side<00:04:11.140> and<00:04:11.320> then

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
them put them off to the side and then

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.840 
them put them off to the side and then
play<00:04:11.710> a<00:04:11.740> little<00:04:11.920> bit<00:04:12.100> more<00:04:12.220> defensive<00:04:12.670> mind

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850
