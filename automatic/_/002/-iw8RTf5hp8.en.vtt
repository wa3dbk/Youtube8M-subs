00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
hand literally is that it might be

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.509 
hand literally is that it might be
difficult<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.560> open<00:03:00.829> because<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.280> know

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
difficult to open because you know

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.670

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
pressing on the bar it can be a pain but

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.110 
pressing on the bar it can be a pain but
these<00:03:08.569> are<00:03:08.780> very<00:03:08.810> easy<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.470> open<00:03:09.650> like<00:03:10.579> I<00:03:10.609> said

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
these are very easy to open like I said

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.199 
these are very easy to open like I said
I<00:03:11.569> can<00:03:12.470> even<00:03:12.680> open<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.370> left-handed<00:03:14.090> or

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.229 
I can even open it left-handed or
right-handed<00:03:15.370> usually<00:03:16.370> frame<00:03:16.639> locks<00:03:16.909> can<00:03:17.209> be

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
right-handed usually frame locks can be

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.619 
right-handed usually frame locks can be
difficult<00:03:17.930> on<00:03:18.109> the<00:03:18.680> left<00:03:18.919> side<00:03:19.220> but<00:03:20.090> not<00:03:20.269> so

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
difficult on the left side but not so

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.680

actually listen to people that said some

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.030 
actually listen to people that said some
of<00:03:28.519> their<00:03:28.639> knives<00:03:28.849> were<00:03:29.120> getting<00:03:29.510> too<00:03:29.720> heavy

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
of their knives were getting too heavy

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.210

that<00:03:34.430> just<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.209> basic<00:03:35.690> design<00:03:36.109> from<00:03:37.060> just<00:03:38.060> how

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
that just the basic design from just how

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.189 
that just the basic design from just how
they<00:03:38.480> look

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
they look

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.890 
they look
I<00:03:39.340> like<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.519> drop<00:03:40.790> point<00:03:41.030> that's<00:03:41.359> extra<00:03:41.690> wide

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
I like the drop point that's extra wide

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.689 
I like the drop point that's extra wide
gives<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.379> good<00:03:42.590> curvature<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.459> it's<00:03:43.609> a

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
gives you good curvature and it's a

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.449 
gives you good curvature and it's a
strong<00:03:44.090> tip<00:03:44.599> I<00:03:44.930> like<00:03:45.440> that<00:03:45.650> they're<00:03:45.799> so<00:03:46.040> slim<00:03:46.430> I

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
strong tip I like that they're so slim I

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.729 
strong tip I like that they're so slim I
like<00:03:46.849> that<00:03:47.060> they're<00:03:47.239> less<00:03:47.569> than<00:03:47.599> three<00:03:48.230> ounces

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
like that they're less than three ounces

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.039 
like that they're less than three ounces
and<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.639> price<00:03:49.910> is<00:03:50.150> right<00:03:50.389> you<00:03:50.569> know<00:03:50.599> it'd<00:03:50.750> be

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
and the price is right you know it'd be

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.270 
and the price is right you know it'd be
hard<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:51.650> find<00:03:51.919> something<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.549> the<00:03:52.940> same<00:03:53.209> price

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
hard to find something of the same price

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.580 
hard to find something of the same price
that<00:03:55.359> works<00:03:56.359> as<00:03:56.599> well<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:58.069> deployment<00:03:58.459> is

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
that works as well and the deployment is

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.899 
that works as well and the deployment is
everything<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:00.709> could<00:04:00.739> want<00:04:01.099> from<00:04:01.519> a<00:04:01.639> frame

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
there was no problems with deployment I

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.580 
there was no problems with deployment I
would<00:04:06.799> say<00:04:07.010> as<00:04:07.159> a<00:04:07.190> usable<00:04:08.409> convenient<00:04:09.409> little
