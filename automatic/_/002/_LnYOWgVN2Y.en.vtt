anything well i thought i had another

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.249 
anything well i thought i had another
round<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.950> I<00:00:26.130> didn't<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.419> how<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.599> did<00:00:27.810> my<00:00:27.960> form

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
round and I didn't so how I did my form

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.769 
round and I didn't so how I did my form
go<00:00:28.500> well<00:00:29.489> there<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.970> little<00:00:30.390> bit<00:00:30.599> of

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
go well there was a little bit of

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.780 
go well there was a little bit of
anticipation<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.860> the<00:00:32.009> recoil<00:00:32.399> otherwise

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
anticipation of the recoil otherwise

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.270 
anticipation of the recoil otherwise
known<00:00:33.120> as<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.329> flinch<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.290> particular<00:00:34.500> dry

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
known as a flinch in that particular dry

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.369 
known as a flinch in that particular dry
press<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.940> that's<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:36.540> uncommon<00:00:37.079> especially

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
press and that's not uncommon especially

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.250 
press and that's not uncommon especially
as<00:00:37.890> we're<00:00:38.129> learning<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.730> new<00:00:38.760> rifle<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:40.140> we

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
as we're learning a new rifle and we

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.810 
as we're learning a new rifle and we
don't<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.710> don't<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> lot<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.219> experience

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
don't we don't have a lot of experience

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.819 
don't we don't have a lot of experience
with<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.090> recoil<00:00:42.539> essentially<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.649> your

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
with the recoil essentially what your

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.040 
with the recoil essentially what your
body<00:00:44.039> is<00:00:44.160> doing<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.730> anticipating<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> push

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
body is doing is anticipating the push

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.720 
body is doing is anticipating the push
that<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.440> feels<00:00:46.649> whenever<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.309> press<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
that it feels whenever you press the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.090 
that it feels whenever you press the
trigger<00:00:47.909> and<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.749> compensate<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:50.070> that

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
trigger and so to compensate for that

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.069 
trigger and so to compensate for that
your<00:00:50.399> body<00:00:50.609> gives<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.999> little<00:00:51.149> push<00:00:51.570> forward<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
your body gives a little push forward a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.470 
your body gives a little push forward a
little<00:00:52.199> movement<00:00:52.589> forward<00:00:53.159> to<00:00:53.730> balance<00:00:54.269> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
little movement forward to balance the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.989 
little movement forward to balance the
push<00:00:54.719> back<00:00:55.109> that<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.440> feels<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.859> recoil<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.579> so

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:56.999 
push back that it feels on recoil and so

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:58.489 
push back that it feels on recoil and so
there<00:00:57.179> are<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> couple<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.719> things<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.230> do

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
there are a couple of things that we do

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.219 
there are a couple of things that we do
to<00:00:58.859> get<00:00:59.339> out<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.760> flinching<00:01:00.569> mode<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
to get out of that flinching mode and

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.110 
to get out of that flinching mode and
again<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.190> happen<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.969> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
again it's going to happen really to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.450 
again it's going to happen really to
anybody<00:01:03.690> who<00:01:04.229> shoots<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.710> lot<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.159> shoots

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
anybody who shoots a lot and shoots

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.000 
anybody who shoots a lot and shoots
regularly<00:01:06.090> which<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.630> why<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.320> intersperse

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
regularly which is why we intersperse

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.910 
regularly which is why we intersperse
these<00:01:08.310> exercises<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.420> help<00:01:09.450> us<00:01:09.810> work<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
these exercises to help us work out of a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.430 
these exercises to help us work out of a
flinch<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.790> all<00:01:11.940> of<00:01:12.090> our<00:01:12.150> practice<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
flinch to all of our practice one of the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.260 
flinch to all of our practice one of the
things<00:01:13.620> that<00:01:13.799> really<00:01:14.010> helps<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.580> dry<00:01:14.970> fire

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
things that really helps is dry fire

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.940 
things that really helps is dry fire
okay<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> come<00:01:16.530> around<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.890> side

you're going to stay in a high ready
position<00:01:18.990> what<00:01:19.800> happens<00:01:20.160> is<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.610> lot<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.060> us

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
position what happens is a lot of us

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.960 
position what happens is a lot of us
will<00:01:21.750> end<00:01:22.110> our<00:01:22.440> practice<00:01:22.740> sessions<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.640> dry

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
will end our practice sessions with dry

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.610 
will end our practice sessions with dry
fire<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.690> now<00:01:24.930> you're<00:01:25.200> teaching<00:01:25.590> your

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
fire because now you're teaching your

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.620 
fire because now you're teaching your
body<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.220> when<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> bring<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.060> gun<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
body that when you bring the gun up and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.140 
body that when you bring the gun up and
press<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.990> trigger<00:01:28.170> nothing<00:01:29.130> happens<00:01:29.550> okay

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
press the trigger nothing happens okay

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.090 
press the trigger nothing happens okay
the<00:01:30.480> flinching<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.110> subconscious<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.950> may

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
the flinching is subconscious you may

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.560 
the flinching is subconscious you may
not<00:01:32.220> have<00:01:32.370> even<00:01:32.460> known<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.090> did<00:01:33.300> it<00:01:33.450> I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
not have even known that you did it I

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.570 
not have even known that you did it I
didn't<00:01:33.990> know<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.140> did<00:01:34.410> it<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.190> happens<00:01:35.460> a

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
didn't know I did it so that happens a

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.790 
didn't know I did it so that happens a
lot<00:01:35.760> where<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.180> our<00:01:36.450> body<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.020> simply<00:01:37.350> reacting

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
lot where we our body is simply reacting

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.560 
lot where we our body is simply reacting
and<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.070> don't<00:01:38.250> know<00:01:38.520> we're<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:38.970> conscious<00:01:39.450> of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and we don't know we're not conscious of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.720 
and we don't know we're not conscious of
that<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.380> again<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:40.890> why<00:01:41.100> dry<00:01:41.460> fire

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
that and so again that's why dry fire

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.430 
that and so again that's why dry fire
works<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.330> well<00:01:42.360> because<00:01:42.900> subconsciously

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
works so well because subconsciously

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.470 
works so well because subconsciously
your<00:01:43.890> body<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.280> learning<00:01:44.730> when<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.000> press<00:01:45.300> the

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
your body is learning when I press the

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.180 
your body is learning when I press the
trigger<00:01:45.630> nothing's<00:01:46.170> happening<00:01:46.620> so<00:01:46.950> go<00:01:47.070> ahead

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
trigger nothing's happening so go ahead

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.740 
trigger nothing's happening so go ahead
and<00:01:47.310> bring<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.640> gun<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:47.970> again<00:01:48.300> will<00:01:48.660> do

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and bring the gun up again will do

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.260 
and bring the gun up again will do

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.110 

it's<00:02:08.209> much<00:02:08.450> better<00:02:08.690> follow<00:02:09.410> through<00:02:09.700> good<00:02:10.700> run

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
it's much better follow through good run

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.110 
it's much better follow through good run

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
the bowl nice okay back down to a high

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.480 
the bowl nice okay back down to a high
ready<00:02:14.360> position<00:02:14.890> go<00:02:15.890> ahead<00:02:16.069> and<00:02:16.100> sling<00:02:16.340> your

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
ready position go ahead and sling your

ready position go ahead and sling your
rifle<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:18.230> other<00:02:18.350> thing<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:18.620> we<00:02:18.830> can<00:02:19.010> do<00:02:19.310> is

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
rifle the other thing that we can do is

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.370 
rifle the other thing that we can do is
intersperse<00:02:20.740> dummy<00:02:21.740> rounds<00:02:22.630> like<00:02:23.630> this<00:02:23.900> that

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
intersperse dummy rounds like this that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.780 
intersperse dummy rounds like this that
aren't<00:02:24.650> going<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:24.950> go<00:02:25.069> off<00:02:25.280> at<00:02:25.310> all<00:02:25.580> they're

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
aren't going to go off at all they're

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.479 
aren't going to go off at all they're
just<00:02:26.030> inert<00:02:26.800> intersperse<00:02:27.800> those<00:02:28.069> with<00:02:28.340> our

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
just inert intersperse those with our

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.699 
just inert intersperse those with our
live<00:02:28.730> rounds<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:29.750> we're<00:02:29.930> practicing<00:02:30.500> away

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
live rounds and so we're practicing away

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.110 
live rounds and so we're practicing away
and<00:02:30.890> all<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.190> sudden<00:02:31.400> we<00:02:31.489> come<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:31.910> dummy

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
and all of a sudden we come to the dummy

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.530 
and all of a sudden we come to the dummy
round<00:02:32.500> whereupon<00:02:33.500> we'll<00:02:33.860> get<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.040> click<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:35.390> we

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
round whereupon we'll get a click and we

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.270 
round whereupon we'll get a click and we
need<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.870> recognize<00:02:36.470> whether<00:02:36.739> or<00:02:36.950> not<00:02:37.040> that

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
need to recognize whether or not that

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.520 
need to recognize whether or not that
click<00:02:37.610> was<00:02:37.819> a<00:02:37.850> nice<00:02:38.270> smooth<00:02:38.660> press<00:02:39.050> or<00:02:39.350> whether

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
click was a nice smooth press or whether

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.410 
click was a nice smooth press or whether
it<00:02:39.709> was<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.830> bad<00:02:40.100> press<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:41.030> could<00:02:41.180> really

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
it was a bad press that you could really

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.300 
it was a bad press that you could really
test<00:02:41.660> your<00:02:41.780> form<00:02:42.110> in<00:02:42.290> your<00:02:42.380> body's<00:02:42.709> reactions

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
test your form in your body's reactions

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.370 
test your form in your body's reactions
when<00:02:43.940> you're<00:02:44.090> not<00:02:44.180> anticipating<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.080> just

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
when you're not anticipating it just

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.730 
when you're not anticipating it just
like<00:02:45.530> I<00:02:45.650> wasn't<00:02:45.890> before<00:02:46.190> yes
