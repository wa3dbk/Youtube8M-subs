00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 i 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.140
 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.150
 I bring you my first tutorial of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.730
 video game recommendations for pc 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.950
 the link of the games probably not 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.260
 I leave them or if I do, it made clear that 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.989
 they are friends because I do not have internet 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.090
 at home even if it seems sad this 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.900
 tutorial of uploaded from my work is 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.540
 excellent if I recommend these games 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.699
 it's because he knew about the cat and 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.430
 it seems that the best start with the top 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.829
 4 which on this occasion will be 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.290
 my favorites that are zombies and what 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.660
 better in the first person because they are 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.059
 good games very good and not you 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.430
 will occupy so much wave that is to say with few 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.740
 requirements as they go 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.320
 recommending more games especially from 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.390
 zombies and first person idea being 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.759
 a tom maior but today I bring you those that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.190
 I'm playing and said the club lay 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.170
 I start with position 4 that 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.800
 belongs to this very good game the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.500
 same is the house of the dead 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.600
 created by sher this game has its 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.000
 current story is about rescuing a 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.310
 girl called sofÃ­a good not so little girl 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.440
 but the important thing is that as it passes 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.810
 advancing that more types are coming out than 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.460
 they are visit likes it gets more good 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.680
 when you have to kill a prick 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.840
 vampire type of bird that I do not know what is the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.760
 The player's anger is when Sofia is 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.430
 hit and as yet did not hit the game 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.650
 I think he dies but it is and it is a game that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.990
 just use the mouse or mouse either 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.120
 to shoot and load the weapon you 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.250
 I recommend it is great ex in the 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.850
 position 3 I leave you this other game 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.550
 original which is so dynamic is a 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.460
 game so to speak as it does not go almost 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.070
 nothing of your pc but that does not want 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.320
 to say that it's bad is very good with this 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.420
 game you have fun killing nazis the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.790
 which may so you kill you are giving you 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.130
 points that you use to remove objects 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.040
 that hinder to go forward or also 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.080
 to buy better years is one hundred 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.430
 recommended hundred I play it and it's 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.530
 great extra 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.810
 they can also play online but not 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.390
 I have no idea how it is hehe you use 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.730
 the letter w to move forward and 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.609
 the letter s to go back to shoot 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.859
 you use the mouse click no wizards 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.200
 if you want to kill them if you do not have to 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.540
 zoom in and press the one key I'll 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.430
 I recommend is the most anticipated today is 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.530
 position 2 the fact of helping in the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.480
 position 2 does not mean it's worse 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.370
 that the 1 but I leave it here because it came out 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.430
 first of all the first one was created 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.209
 sorry in his explanation the game was 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.959
 called this game has a very story 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.730
 good when one is in your 12th degree a 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.129
 shock where you walk or of beans what do I know 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.139
 me and when you notice that they are going to energy 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.689
 electrical or appliances or functions 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:11.489
 between outsiders outside in their 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.439
 farm wants to invite you to eat you 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.750
 will allow me to go out to see and notice that they are 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:18.000
 zombies when he sees that he runs out to 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.919
 your rooftop to bring your stop eta or rifle and 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.989
 is dead to all those fucking zombies 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.939
 who are surrounding his house good 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.169
 I would continue counting but I do not want 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.169
 tell them the whole game 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.610
 It's great to use your genius to not 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.040
 lose you and finish all the missions and 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.340
 the most anticipated is that of position one 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.409
 good what is the zombie amount or should 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.360
 to be in this game is like the two of 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.000
 in front of you this game has its 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.860
 story just like the front 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.230
 although they are similar in the same 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.750
 weapons the same tricks and change 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.250
 some feet are equal does not mean 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.829
 that his story is the same 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.379
 this game brings a lot more zombies and their 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.120
 history be a hotel which you have to 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.040
 find a way out of there the 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.290
 dead people will not make your life easy 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.359
 but with your genius you can achieve it 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.819
 I'll tell you what happens next 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.040
 well I do not want to be a past but it's 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.170
 important that you know the difference 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.750
 after going through where not a fucking 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.579
 it's good people like posh several looks 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.859
 in a calm which is noted as very 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.260
 tired good it gets when you put a 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.690
 standing in the yard and the zombies start to 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.570
 fall like constant days that did not let 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:31.190
 what the evils for us but we have 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.190
 to run but I want 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:47.580
 in the city as if by specific magic 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.580
 towards the TV 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:53.770
 run and get to leeds cities it 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:55.539
 they put the good ones I recommend it and you 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.449
 I repeat if I leave league they will not be mine 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.370
 because I also did this tutorial for 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.919
 recommend games with few requirements 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.340
 that I have already played if any what 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.569
 supposedly time where they work 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.370
 searched by your own means and 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.860
 remember the little sister above 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.139
 also recommends me zombie games 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.050
 in the first person and that are light 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.470
 since my computer is not good at all 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.470
 hehehe
