there<00:00:10.800> are<00:00:10.950> two<00:00:11.250> ways<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.490> make<00:00:11.790> candy<00:00:12.300> cane

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
there are two ways to make candy cane

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.720 
there are two ways to make candy cane
dreadlocks<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.500> first<00:00:13.889> involves<00:00:14.549> taking

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
dreadlocks the first involves taking

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.910 
dreadlocks the first involves taking
your<00:00:15.000> two<00:00:15.179> colors<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.630> fiber<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.080> backcombing

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
your two colors of fiber and backcombing

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.760 
your two colors of fiber and backcombing
them<00:00:17.130> together<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:18.180> second<00:00:18.630> involves<00:00:19.410> back

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
them together the second involves back

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.490 
them together the second involves back
combing<00:00:20.039> our<00:00:20.400> two<00:00:20.820> colors<00:00:21.060> separately<00:00:21.900> let's

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
combing our two colors separately let's

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.609 
combing our two colors separately let's
begin<00:00:22.680> our<00:00:22.920> first<00:00:23.130> technique<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:28.230> main<00:00:28.410> goal

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
begin our first technique the main goal

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.019 
begin our first technique the main goal
of<00:00:28.650> your<00:00:28.830> back<00:00:28.980> combing<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.760> get<00:00:29.910> your

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
of your back combing is to get your

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.999 
of your back combing is to get your
consistency<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.019> your<00:00:31.140> stability<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.800> here

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
consistency and your stability in here

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.400 
consistency and your stability in here
without<00:00:32.210> merging<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.540> two<00:00:33.750> colors<00:00:34.140> together

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
without merging the two colors together

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.049 
without merging the two colors together
when<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.920> get<00:00:35.040> towards<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> ends

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
when you get towards the ends

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.729 
when you get towards the ends
they'll<00:00:36.480> probably<00:00:36.660> merge<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.260> little<00:00:37.469> bit<00:00:37.620> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
they'll probably merge a little bit and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.440 
they'll probably merge a little bit and
that's<00:00:37.860> okay<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.460> want<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.090> make<00:00:39.270> sure

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
that's okay you want to just make sure

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.350 
that's okay you want to just make sure
you're<00:00:39.600> keeping<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.020> main<00:00:40.260> body<00:00:40.730> separate<00:00:41.730> up

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
you're keeping the main body separate up

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.709 
you're keeping the main body separate up
in<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> interior<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.320> your<00:00:43.440> dread<00:00:44.539> for<00:00:45.539> this

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
in the interior of your dread for this

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.810 
in the interior of your dread for this
first<00:00:45.989> technique<00:00:46.260> your<00:00:46.890> candy<00:00:47.250> cane<00:00:47.399> pattern

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
first technique your candy cane pattern

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.790 
first technique your candy cane pattern
will<00:00:47.940> actually<00:00:48.390> emerge<00:00:48.750> when<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
will actually emerge when you do the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.180 
will actually emerge when you do the
sealing<00:00:50.280> process<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:52.469> second<00:00:52.949> technique

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
sealing process the second technique

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.459 
sealing process the second technique
creates<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.030> more<00:00:54.210> defined<00:00:54.629> candy<00:00:55.260> cane

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
creates a more defined candy cane

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.619 
creates a more defined candy cane
pattern<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.730> we<00:00:57.149> need<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.329> backcomb

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
pattern to do that we need to backcomb

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:07.960 
pattern to do that we need to backcomb
these<00:00:58.050> two<00:00:58.230> colors<00:00:58.670> independently

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.420 

make<00:01:08.600> sure<00:01:08.810> to<00:01:08.960> check<00:01:09.170> your<00:01:09.380> consistency<00:01:10.220> as

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
make sure to check your consistency as

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:22.990 
make sure to check your consistency as
you<00:01:10.760> back<00:01:10.970> home<00:01:11.240> this<00:01:11.420> fiber

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000 

with<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.210> color<00:01:24.480> complete<00:01:24.960> switch<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
with one color complete switch to the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:38.010 
with one color complete switch to the
other<00:01:26.130> color

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.050 

once<00:01:38.860> you've<00:01:39.040> completed<00:01:39.220> your<00:01:39.549> backcombing

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
once you've completed your backcombing

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.450 
once you've completed your backcombing
take<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.020> two<00:01:41.170> colors<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:41.710> swirl<00:01:42.250> them

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
take the two colors and swirl them

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.730 
take the two colors and swirl them
together<00:01:42.960> you're<00:01:43.960> going<00:01:44.079> to<00:01:44.140> twist<00:01:44.380> one

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
together you're going to twist one

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.590 
together you're going to twist one
around<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.460> other<00:01:45.610> until<00:01:46.119> you<00:01:46.149> get<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.479> the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
around the other until you get to the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.550 
around the other until you get to the
end<00:01:50.490> once<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:51.670> get<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.060> end<00:01:52.320> back<00:01:53.320> home

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
end once you get to the end back home

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:02.530 
end once you get to the end back home
the<00:01:53.710> two<00:01:53.860> fibers<00:01:54.100> together

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.780 

this<00:02:03.170> will<00:02:03.380> help<00:02:03.500> merge<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.980> two<00:02:04.130> fibers<00:02:04.520> so

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
this will help merge the two fibers so

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.260 
this will help merge the two fibers so
that<00:02:04.820> they<00:02:05.000> don't<00:02:05.120> unravel<00:02:07.060> we're<00:02:08.060> going<00:02:08.180> to

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
that they don't unravel we're going to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.100 
that they don't unravel we're going to
do<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.450> same<00:02:08.690> at<00:02:08.960> the<00:02:09.380> top<00:02:10.510> to<00:02:11.510> push<00:02:11.720> those<00:02:11.900> two

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
do the same at the top to push those two

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.300 
do the same at the top to push those two
fibers<00:02:12.320> together<00:02:14.530> from<00:02:15.530> there<00:02:15.740> you're<00:02:16.220> ready

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
fibers together from there you're ready

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.410 
fibers together from there you're ready
to<00:02:16.520> seal<00:02:16.730> your<00:02:16.880> dreadlocks

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
to seal your dreadlocks

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.330 
to seal your dreadlocks
this<00:02:18.200> gives<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:18.530> two<00:02:18.710> different<00:02:18.860> techniques

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
this gives you two different techniques

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.870 
this gives you two different techniques
to<00:02:19.760> create<00:02:19.970> your<00:02:20.150> candy<00:02:20.450> cane<00:02:20.600> dreads
