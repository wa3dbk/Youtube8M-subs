yeah I'm try it and it doesn't work for
everybody<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.880> it'll<00:01:30.119> eventually<00:01:30.270> wear<00:01:30.899> off

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
everybody and it'll eventually wear off

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.410 
everybody and it'll eventually wear off
but<00:01:31.499> you<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.340> keep<00:01:32.549> trying<00:01:32.789> it<00:01:33.060> if

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
but you can you can keep trying it if
