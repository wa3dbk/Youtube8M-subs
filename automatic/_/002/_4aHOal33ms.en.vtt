00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
a little bit of time and B is not going

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.410 
a little bit of time and B is not going
to<00:01:18.829> be<00:01:18.920> seen<00:01:19.310> by<00:01:19.340> everybody<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:19.940> I<00:01:20.060> get<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.270> lot

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
is mainly supposed to be factoring but

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.649 
is mainly supposed to be factoring but
this<00:01:39.590> way<00:01:39.770> I<00:01:39.799> could<00:01:40.190> post<00:01:40.729> a<00:01:40.970> short<00:01:41.060> Q&amp;A

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
then everybody could see those might cut

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.490 
then everybody could see those might cut
down<00:01:46.430> on<00:01:46.640> repeats<00:01:47.119> give<00:01:47.390> people<00:01:47.659> who<00:01:47.930> hadn't

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.740 
putting some playlists together I put a
new<00:03:39.140> one<00:03:39.320> up<00:03:39.500> which<00:03:40.340> is<00:03:40.489> a<00:03:40.519> playlist<00:03:41.180> of<00:03:41.450> all<00:03:41.600> my

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
new one up which is a playlist of all my

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.180 
new one up which is a playlist of all my
product<00:03:42.170> reviews<00:03:42.500> that<00:03:42.620> I've<00:03:42.709> done<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:43.040> date

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
product reviews that I've done to date

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.979 
product reviews that I've done to date
so<00:03:43.459> that<00:03:43.609> might<00:03:43.790> help<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.209> if<00:03:44.390> you<00:03:44.480> like<00:03:44.720> some

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
so that might help you if you like some

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.720 
so that might help you if you like some
of<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.230> recent<00:03:45.739> discussion<00:03:46.549> about

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
of the recent discussion about

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.220 
of the recent discussion about
sophisticated<00:03:47.390> finishes<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:47.930> might<00:03:48.079> find

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
sophisticated finishes you might find

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.770 
sophisticated finishes you might find
some<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.500> those<00:03:48.650> other<00:03:48.920> ones<00:03:49.160> helpful<00:03:49.640> and<00:03:49.850> I

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
some of those other ones helpful and I

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.900 
some of those other ones helpful and I
will<00:03:51.140> probably<00:03:51.680> work<00:03:51.920> on<00:03:52.190> adding<00:03:52.549> some

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
will probably work on adding some

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.819 
will probably work on adding some
playlists<00:03:53.329> over<00:03:53.660> time<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.380> think<00:03:54.620> I'm

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
playlists over time so I think I'm

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.110 
playlists over time so I think I'm
targeting<00:03:55.220> these<00:03:55.310> more<00:03:55.609> to<00:03:55.790> some<00:03:55.970> of<00:03:56.030> the

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
targeting these more to some of the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.050 
targeting these more to some of the
newer<00:03:56.329> subscribers<00:03:57.049> who<00:03:57.560> maybe<00:03:58.190> want<00:03:58.579> to<00:03:58.730> get

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
newer subscribers who maybe want to get

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.449 
newer subscribers who maybe want to get
a<00:03:59.090> certain<00:03:59.390> kind<00:03:59.750> of<00:03:59.870> glimpse<00:04:00.200> into<00:04:00.500> some<00:04:01.370> of
