00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.130 
and we should have died so quickly but
we<00:01:53.830> just<00:01:54.040> survived<00:01:54.460> so<00:01:54.760> long<00:01:54.790> and<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:55.870> was<00:01:55.990> just

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
we just survived so long and it was just

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.800 
we just survived so long and it was just
really<00:01:56.320> funny<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:57.010> like<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.120> battle<00:01:58.420> started

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
really funny and like the battle started

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.350 
really funny and like the battle started
in<00:01:58.960> one<00:01:59.140> place<00:01:59.410> and<00:01:59.680> moved<00:02:00.070> across<00:02:00.970> like

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
in one place and moved across like

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.940 
in one place and moved across like
several<00:02:01.660> different<00:02:02.080> region<00:02:02.410> I<00:02:02.560> like<00:02:02.830> about

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
several different region I like about

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.950 
several different region I like about
what<00:02:03.190> will<00:02:03.340> probably<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:04.150> big<00:02:04.300> weapons<00:02:04.780> I

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
what will probably the big weapons I

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.730 
what will probably the big weapons I
played<00:02:08.700> probably<00:02:09.700> on<00:02:10.390> average<00:02:10.869> maybe<00:02:11.170> five

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
played probably on average maybe five

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.090 
played probably on average maybe five
five<00:02:12.460> or<00:02:12.580> six<00:02:12.760> hours<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.150> day<00:02:13.860> but<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:14.920> only

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
five or six hours a day but I only

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.770 
five or six hours a day but I only
played<00:02:15.370> about<00:02:15.400> five<00:02:15.790> days<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.030> week<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.540> when<00:02:16.750> I

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
played about five days a week so when I

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.060 
played about five days a week so when I
would<00:02:17.020> play<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.350> would<00:02:17.470> be<00:02:17.590> for<00:02:17.740> like<00:02:17.890> eight

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
would play it would be for like eight

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.510 
would play it would be for like eight
hour<00:02:18.250> sessions<00:02:18.840> longest<00:02:19.840> ever<00:02:19.960> played<00:02:20.260> was<00:02:20.520> I

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
hour sessions longest ever played was I

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.730 
hour sessions longest ever played was I

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
from noon to like two in the morning or

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.120 
from noon to like two in the morning or
something<00:02:27.940> once<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.570> say<00:02:29.470> about<00:02:29.740> four<00:02:30.010> or<00:02:30.040> five

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
something once I say about four or five

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.340

can play that in for less than a

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.540
