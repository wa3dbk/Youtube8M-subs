power I'm talking about batteries yeah
I'm<00:00:16.960> talking<00:00:17.380> about<00:00:17.440> those<00:00:17.830> things<00:00:18.160> that<00:00:18.400> make

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
I'm talking about those things that make

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.320 
I'm talking about those things that make
portable<00:00:19.410> electronics<00:00:20.550> possible<00:00:21.550> I<00:00:21.789> mean

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
portable electronics possible I mean

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.270 
portable electronics possible I mean
everything<00:00:22.930> portable<00:00:23.410> runs<00:00:23.590> on<00:00:23.770> the<00:00:23.860> battery

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.280 
everything portable runs on the battery

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.100 
everything portable runs on the battery
I<00:00:24.520> mean<00:00:24.760> I<00:00:24.820> got<00:00:24.970> a<00:00:25.000> watch<00:00:25.270> here<00:00:25.630> this<00:00:25.870> watch

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
I mean I got a watch here this watch

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.010 
I mean I got a watch here this watch
runs<00:00:26.500> on<00:00:26.680> a<00:00:26.710> battery<00:00:26.880> my<00:00:27.880> phone<00:00:28.300> runs<00:00:28.690> on<00:00:28.900> the

runs on a battery my phone runs on the
battery<00:00:29.700> even<00:00:30.700> this<00:00:30.850> electronic<00:00:31.660> flyswatter

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
battery even this electronic flyswatter

portable<00:00:34.750> power<00:00:35.050> is<00:00:35.469> very<00:00:36.070> useful<00:00:36.850> get<00:00:37.600> out<00:00:37.780> of

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
portable power is very useful get out of

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.400 
portable power is very useful get out of
here

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
here

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.590 
here
so<00:00:38.860> how<00:00:39.010> exactly<00:00:39.220> is<00:00:39.700> it<00:00:40.000> that<00:00:40.030> a<00:00:40.210> battery

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
so how exactly is it that a battery

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.800 
so how exactly is it that a battery
operates<00:00:41.440> it's<00:00:41.980> very<00:00:42.190> simple<00:00:42.810> essentially

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
operates it's very simple essentially

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.680 
operates it's very simple essentially
you've<00:00:44.320> got<00:00:44.560> yourself<00:00:45.130> a<00:00:45.430> container<00:00:46.329> that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
you've got yourself a container that

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.460 
you've got yourself a container that
split<00:00:47.440> into<00:00:47.710> two<00:00:48.190> sections<00:00:48.820> so<00:00:49.360> one<00:00:49.930> side<00:00:50.260> of

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
split into two sections so one side of

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.310 
split into two sections so one side of
your<00:00:50.620> battery<00:00:50.800> undergoes<00:00:51.579> oxidation<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:53.140> is

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
your battery undergoes oxidation this is

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.710 
your battery undergoes oxidation this is
called<00:00:53.590> the<00:00:53.739> anode<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.880> electrons<00:00:55.510> that<00:00:55.660> are

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
called the anode the electrons that are

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.139 
called the anode the electrons that are
lost<00:00:55.810> with<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.440> oxidation<00:00:56.890> come<00:00:57.579> out<00:00:57.790> of<00:00:58.059> the

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
lost with the oxidation come out of the

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.060 
lost with the oxidation come out of the
negative<00:00:58.540> end<00:00:58.660> of<00:00:58.720> the<00:00:58.780> battery<00:00:59.230> into<00:00:59.829> a

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
negative end of the battery into a

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.000 
negative end of the battery into a
device<00:01:00.520> to<00:01:00.760> power<00:01:01.180> it<00:01:01.510> and<00:01:01.720> then<00:01:02.260> into<00:01:02.890> the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
device to power it and then into the

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.069 
device to power it and then into the
positive<00:01:03.700> end<00:01:03.910> of<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.119> battery<00:01:04.239> where

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
positive end of the battery where

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:06.929 
positive end of the battery where
they're<00:01:05.229> gained<00:01:05.590> by<00:01:05.890> something<00:01:06.250> inside<00:01:06.759> the

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
they're gained by something inside the

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.880 
they're gained by something inside the
battery<00:01:07.329> and<00:01:07.689> that's<00:01:07.810> called<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.259> cathode

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
battery and that's called the cathode

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.030 
battery and that's called the cathode
all<00:01:09.430> batteries<00:01:10.240> or<00:01:10.509> should<00:01:10.720> I<00:01:10.840> say<00:01:11.140> voltaic

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
all batteries or should I say voltaic

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.670 
all batteries or should I say voltaic
cells<00:01:12.610> because<00:01:13.330> a<00:01:13.360> battery<00:01:13.810> is<00:01:14.080> really<00:01:14.470> made

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
cells because a battery is really made

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.490 
cells because a battery is really made
up<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:15.100> multiple<00:01:15.729> cells<00:01:16.390> all<00:01:16.750> just<00:01:17.229> hooked

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
up of multiple cells all just hooked

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.010 
up of multiple cells all just hooked
together<00:01:17.920> for<00:01:18.460> example<00:01:18.970> this<00:01:19.120> is<00:01:19.299> a<00:01:19.330> six<00:01:19.720> volt

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
together for example this is a six volt

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.740 
together for example this is a six volt
battery<00:01:20.500> made<00:01:21.010> of<00:01:21.159> four<00:01:21.520> one<00:01:22.000> in<00:01:22.119> the<00:01:22.210> handful

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
battery made of four one in the handful

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.440 
battery made of four one in the handful
voltaic<00:01:23.470> cells<00:01:23.950> why<00:01:24.610> they<00:01:24.820> call<00:01:25.030> voltaic

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
voltaic cells why they call voltaic

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.680 
voltaic cells why they call voltaic
cells<00:01:25.840> because<00:01:26.440> they<00:01:26.590> produce<00:01:26.799> false<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.820> unit

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
cells because they produce false a unit

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.590 
cells because they produce false a unit
of<00:01:28.810> electro-motive<00:01:29.650> force<00:01:30.190> or<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:31.119> ability

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
of electro-motive force or the ability

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.080 
of electro-motive force or the ability
to<00:01:31.780> force<00:01:32.080> electrons<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.979> go<00:01:33.159> from<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.610> anode

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
to force electrons to go from the anode

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.390 
to force electrons to go from the anode
to<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.420> cathode<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:35.710> purpose<00:01:36.189> of<00:01:36.340> the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
to the cathode the purpose of the

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.850 
to the cathode the purpose of the
voltaic<00:01:36.760> cell<00:01:37.180> is<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:37.600> use<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.860> spontaneous

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
voltaic cell is to use a spontaneous

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.760 
voltaic cell is to use a spontaneous
redox<00:01:39.159> reaction<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.510> create<00:01:40.990> electrical

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
redox reaction to create electrical

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.399 
redox reaction to create electrical
current<00:01:42.220> why<00:01:42.610> so<00:01:43.119> we<00:01:43.270> can<00:01:43.450> power<00:01:43.659> portable

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
current why so we can power portable

this<00:01:47.619> go<00:01:47.920> are<00:01:48.310> carried<00:01:48.970> out<00:01:49.119> in<00:01:49.180> two<00:01:49.630> separate

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
this go are carried out in two separate

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.690 
this go are carried out in two separate
containers<00:01:50.350> that<00:01:50.979> are<00:01:51.070> called<00:01:51.340> half<00:01:51.820> cells

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700

the oxidation half cell contains a metal

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.440 
the oxidation half cell contains a metal
electrode<00:01:58.259> which<00:01:59.259> we<00:01:59.470> call<00:01:59.770> the<00:02:00.009> anode<00:02:00.610> or<00:02:00.909> the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
electrode which we call the anode or the

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
more active of the two metals that

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.520 
more active of the two metals that
you're<00:02:06.340> using<00:02:06.579> with<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.329> solution<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:08.140> the

you're using with a solution of the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.059 
you're using with a solution of the
metal<00:02:08.890> ion<00:02:09.429> for<00:02:09.970> example<00:02:10.539> if<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.439> electron<00:02:11.950> is

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
metal ion for example if the electron is

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.460 
metal ion for example if the electron is
same<00:02:12.519> then<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.269> solution<00:02:13.780> would<00:02:13.930> be<00:02:13.989> zinc

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
same then the solution would be zinc

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.640 
same then the solution would be zinc
nitrate<00:02:14.819> now<00:02:15.819> this<00:02:16.209> is<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> spectator<00:02:16.900> ion<00:02:17.230> why

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
nitrate now this is a spectator ion why

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.630

the less active metal if the metals we

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.910 
the less active metal if the metals we

lose electrons those electrons will get

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.380 
lose electrons those electrons will get
pulled<00:04:26.510> through<00:04:26.840> the

pulled through the
which<00:04:28.720> uses<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:29.440> electrical<00:04:30.010> current<00:04:30.460> then

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
which uses the electrical current then

the electrons will be gained by the

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.750 
the electrons will be gained by the
cathode<00:04:34.000> so<00:04:34.510> electrons<00:04:35.140> always<00:04:35.830> go<00:04:36.160> from

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
cathode so electrons always go from

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.060 
cathode so electrons always go from
anode<00:04:37.510> to<00:04:38.260> cathode<00:04:39.210> always<00:04:40.320> so<00:04:41.320> to<00:04:41.380> sum<00:04:41.860> this

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
anode to cathode always so to sum this

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.760 
anode to cathode always so to sum this
up<00:04:42.340> if<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:43.120> two<00:04:43.360> electrodes<00:04:44.020> are<00:04:44.290> made<00:04:44.320> out<00:04:44.650> of

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
up if the two electrodes are made out of

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.350 
up if the two electrodes are made out of
magnesium<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.850> zinc<00:04:47.070> because<00:04:48.070> magnesium<00:04:48.850> is

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
magnesium and zinc because magnesium is

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.140 
magnesium and zinc because magnesium is
the<00:04:49.390> more<00:04:49.840> active<00:04:50.440> metal<00:04:50.890> it's<00:04:51.490> going<00:04:51.880> to<00:04:52.000> be

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
the anode it will be what loses

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.300 
the anode it will be what loses
electrons<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.990> zinc<00:04:56.410> will<00:04:56.710> be<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.010> metal

electrons the zinc will be the metal

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.990 
electrons the zinc will be the metal
