a sheet tray and they're going to go in
the<00:01:06.030> oven<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:07.350> want<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> crostini<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.520> be<00:01:08.640> a

the oven so we want the crostini to be a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.820 
the oven so we want the crostini to be a
little<00:01:08.939> bit<00:01:09.090> toasted<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:09.840> not<00:01:09.990> super<00:01:10.500> super

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
little bit toasted but not super super

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.899 
little bit toasted but not super super
hard<00:01:10.860> when<00:01:11.340> they<00:01:11.430> come<00:01:11.610> out<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.880> oven

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
hard when they come out of the oven

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.060 
hard when they come out of the oven
because<00:01:12.689> they<00:01:12.840> will<00:01:13.020> continue<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.470> get<00:01:13.860> a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
because they will continue to get a

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.190 
because they will continue to get a
little<00:01:14.549> bit<00:01:14.700> more<00:01:14.970> crisp<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.140> start

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
little bit more crisp and so if we start

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.289 
little bit more crisp and so if we start
out<00:01:16.470> with<00:01:16.500> them<00:01:16.740> crisp<00:01:17.009> by<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.729> end<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.270> just

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
out with them crisp by the end it's just

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
out with them crisp by the end it's just
going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> crumble<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> big<00:01:19.799> fat<00:01:19.979> mess

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
going to crumble and be a big fat mess

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.670

when<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.460> try<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.670> bite<00:01:20.880> into<00:01:21.030> them<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
when we try to bite into them so just a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.820 
when we try to bite into them so just a
little<00:01:23.280> bit<00:01:23.810> when<00:01:24.810> they<00:01:24.840> start<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.350> toast<00:01:25.560> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
sort of break down quite a bit so

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.089 
sort of break down quite a bit so
they're<00:02:05.820> nice<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.270> soft<00:02:06.799> okay<00:02:07.799> let's<00:02:08.009> check

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
they're nice and soft okay let's check

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.740 
they're nice and soft okay let's check
our<00:02:08.459> crostini<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.119> see<00:02:09.390> how<00:02:09.539> they're<00:02:09.690> doing

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
our crostini and see how they're doing

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.400 
our crostini and see how they're doing
so<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.280> first<00:02:12.030> we're<00:02:12.270> going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.420> put<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
so for the first we're going to put the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.250 
so for the first we're going to put the
mascarpone<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:14.190> cheese<00:02:14.760> now<00:02:15.420> mascarpone<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.990> is

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
mascarpone a cheese now mascarpone a is

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.160 
mascarpone a cheese now mascarpone a is
an<00:02:16.650> Italian<00:02:17.130> cream<00:02:17.430> cheese<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.240> it's<00:02:18.450> it's

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
an Italian cream cheese so it's it's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.830 
an Italian cream cheese so it's it's
like<00:02:19.770> cream<00:02:20.220> cheese<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.300> can<00:02:21.510> be<00:02:21.630> used

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
like cream cheese in that it can be used

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.990 
like cream cheese in that it can be used
in<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.290> savory<00:02:22.470> or<00:02:22.890> sweet<00:02:22.920> way<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.670> doesn't

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
in a savory or sweet way but it doesn't

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.640 
in a savory or sweet way but it doesn't
have<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.150> flavor<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.930> our<00:02:25.200> cream<00:02:25.620> cheese

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
have the flavor that our cream cheese

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.410 
have the flavor that our cream cheese
does<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.500> key<00:02:28.650> ingredient<00:02:28.800> in

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
does so this is the key ingredient in

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.300 
does so this is the key ingredient in
tiramisu<00:02:30.420> cream<00:02:30.770> we're<00:02:31.770> get<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.070> would<00:02:32.220> be

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
tiramisu cream we're get that would be

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.220 
tiramisu cream we're get that would be

where they belong right on top of the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.030 
where they belong right on top of the
bread<00:03:18.030> instead<00:03:18.270> up<00:03:18.450> falling<00:03:18.780> off<00:03:18.900> all<00:03:19.080> over<00:03:19.110> so

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
bread instead up falling off all over so

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.640 
bread instead up falling off all over so
it's<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.340> good<00:03:20.459> way<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.700> sort<00:03:21.300> of<00:03:21.420> adhere<00:03:22.050> the
