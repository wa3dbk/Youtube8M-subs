00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
electrical and water so you actually

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.930 
electrical and water so you actually
create<00:01:05.750> your<00:01:06.020> own<00:01:06.080> kitchenette<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:06.940> how

create your own kitchenette and how

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.760 
create your own kitchenette and how
would<00:01:08.000> is<00:01:08.240> this<00:01:08.450> right<00:01:09.140> next<00:01:09.410> to<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.530> pontoon

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
would is this right next to the pontoon

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.190 
would is this right next to the pontoon
and<00:01:10.160> right<00:01:10.370> next<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.760> pool<00:01:10.910> I<00:01:11.210> think<00:01:12.020> let's

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
and right next to the pool I think let's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.600 
and right next to the pool I think let's
take<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.410> look<00:01:12.590> at<00:01:12.650> that<00:01:12.710> point<00:01:13.010> okay

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
take a look at that point okay

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.120 
take a look at that point okay
so<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> imagine<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.110> area<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:16.980> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
so I imagine that this area is going to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.850 
so I imagine that this area is going to
be<00:01:17.220> perfect<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> summer<00:01:18.150> well<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.560> just
