January<00:00:58.140> 71<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.789> we<00:01:00.359> figure<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.989> when<00:01:01.320> all

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
January 71 so we figure that when all

January 71 so we figure that when all
the<00:01:01.559> parts<00:01:01.859> are<00:01:02.100> stashed<00:01:02.340> away<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:05.869> that

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the parts are stashed away that the that

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.899 
the parts are stashed away that the that
it<00:01:06.990> was<00:01:07.140> taken<00:01:07.470> apart<00:01:07.740> around<00:01:08.580> when<00:01:08.760> that

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
it was taken apart around when that

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.660 
it was taken apart around when that
newspaper<00:01:09.360> was<00:01:09.510> printed<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:12.680> what<00:01:13.680> happened

apart and they had a lot of parts
chromed<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:25.430> but<00:01:26.430> everything<00:01:26.909> was<00:01:27.060> totally

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
a lot of assembly in the last couple

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.330 
a lot of assembly in the last couple
months<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.860> bike<00:01:32.390> having<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.479> identify

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
months on this bike having to identify

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.060 
months on this bike having to identify
each<00:01:36.049> each<00:01:37.049> piece<00:01:38.659> through<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.439> internet<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
each each piece through the internet and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.090

records<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.060> parts<00:01:42.930> catalog<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.860> ended

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
records and parts catalog that we ended

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.170 
records and parts catalog that we ended
up<00:01:44.130> getting<00:01:44.630> but<00:01:45.630> as<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.470> see<00:01:46.970> this<00:01:47.970> is

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
up getting but as you can see this is

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.300 
up getting but as you can see this is
pretty<00:01:48.420> much<00:01:48.560> like<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.680> say<00:01:49.860> there's<00:01:50.070> quite<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
pretty much like I say there's quite a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.719 
pretty much like I say there's quite a
few<00:01:50.369> parts<00:01:50.970> here<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.420> are<00:01:51.540> assembled<00:01:51.990> again

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
few parts here that are assembled again

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.270 
few parts here that are assembled again
but<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.500> pretty<00:01:55.500> much<00:01:55.590> had<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.920> go<00:01:56.100> through

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
but I I pretty much had to go through

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.280 
but I I pretty much had to go through
and<00:01:56.490> figure<00:01:56.790> out<00:01:56.850> what<00:01:57.299> every<00:01:57.659> single<00:01:58.049> part

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
and figure out what every single part

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.310 
and figure out what every single part
was<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:59.729> figure<00:02:00.060> out<00:02:00.210> how<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.810> put<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.170> back

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
was to figure out how to put it back

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.499 
was to figure out how to put it back
together<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.860> every<00:02:02.490> single<00:02:02.880> nut<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.299> bolt

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
together and every single nut and bolt

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.260 
together and every single nut and bolt
and<00:02:03.750> where<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.140> went<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.790> there<00:02:05.790> was<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> lot<00:02:06.149> of

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
and where it went and there was a lot of

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.190 
and where it went and there was a lot of
new<00:02:06.390> parts<00:02:07.009> they<00:02:08.009> were

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
new parts they were

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.199 
new parts they were
the<00:02:08.530> muffler's<00:02:09.099> I<00:02:09.280> just<00:02:09.489> showed<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:09.849> second

the muffler's I just showed you a second

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.009 
the muffler's I just showed you a second
ago<00:02:10.239> where<00:02:11.129> we're<00:02:12.129> pretty<00:02:12.970> brand<00:02:13.450> new<00:02:13.690> enough

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
ago where we're pretty brand new enough

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.589 
ago where we're pretty brand new enough
in<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.290> bag<00:02:14.590> but<00:02:15.280> they<00:02:15.459> had<00:02:15.700> gotten<00:02:15.940> water<00:02:16.269> on

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
for for all those years and so each one

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.699 
for for all those years and so each one
of<00:02:27.819> these<00:02:27.910> pieces<00:02:28.209> had<00:02:28.599> to<00:02:28.690> be<00:02:28.780> identified

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
of these pieces had to be identified

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.440 
of these pieces had to be identified
I<00:02:29.739> still<00:02:30.250> got<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.400> whole<00:02:30.610> nother<00:02:30.760> bench<00:02:31.090> over

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
light I assembled it all and put it all

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.850 
light I assembled it all and put it all
up<00:02:40.569> in<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.810> bag<00:02:41.019> so<00:02:41.319> it<00:02:41.380> doesn't<00:02:41.560> get<00:02:41.680> dirty

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
up in a bag so it doesn't get dirty

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.160 
up in a bag so it doesn't get dirty
these<00:02:42.730> parts<00:02:43.120> used<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.480> be<00:02:43.599> actually<00:02:44.140> just

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
these parts used to be actually just

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.190 
these parts used to be actually just
painted<00:02:45.130> but<00:02:45.880> somebody<00:02:46.150> had<00:02:46.299> chromed<00:02:46.900> these

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200

was<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.879> engine<00:04:32.240> itself<00:04:32.569> so<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.919> very<00:04:34.129> first

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
was the engine itself so the very first

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.980

bike back all together in order so I

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.379 
bike back all together in order so I
could<00:04:42.199> start<00:04:43.099> the<00:04:43.310> thing<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:43.699> see<00:04:43.909> if<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:44.150> ran

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
could start the thing and see if it ran

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.619 
could start the thing and see if it ran
