hey<00:00:12.030> guys<00:00:12.179> Caleb<00:00:12.570> here<00:00:12.690> at<00:00:12.750> these<00:00:12.900> larvae

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
hey guys Caleb here at these larvae

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.780 
hey guys Caleb here at these larvae
 today<00:00:13.920> we're<00:00:14.099> looking<00:00:14.190> at<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> slider

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
 today we're looking at a slider

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.439 
 today we're looking at a slider
from<00:00:15.150> F<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.750> V<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.680> called<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.270> s100<00:00:18.300> a

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
from F and V and it is called the s100 a

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.810 
from F and V and it is called the s100 a
and<00:00:19.289> they<00:00:19.619> make<00:00:19.800> several<00:00:20.220> different<00:00:20.400> sliders

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
and they make several different sliders

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.880 
and they make several different sliders
so<00:00:21.119> I'll<00:00:21.180> be<00:00:21.300> putting<00:00:21.539> all<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.320> links<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.680> them

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
so I'll be putting all the links to them

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.400 
so I'll be putting all the links to them
on<00:00:23.130> my<00:00:23.160> website<00:00:23.430> under<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.000> video<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:25.260> this

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
on my website under this video but this

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.170 
on my website under this video but this
particular<00:00:25.619> one<00:00:25.949> comes<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.490> around<00:00:26.789> three

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
particular one comes in around three

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.330 
particular one comes in around three
hundred<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.539> sixty<00:00:27.900> dollars<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.859> at<00:00:29.160> this

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
hundred and sixty dollars and at this

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.310 
hundred and sixty dollars and at this
point<00:00:29.609> I've<00:00:29.880> reviewed<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.510> lot<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.990> different

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
point I've reviewed a lot of different

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.360 
point I've reviewed a lot of different
sliders<00:00:31.850> I've<00:00:32.850> reviewed<00:00:33.180> ones<00:00:33.480> from<00:00:33.690> Canova

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
sliders I've reviewed ones from Canova

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.389 
sliders I've reviewed ones from Canova
gear<00:00:35.370> contact<00:00:36.829> there's<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:38.010> bunch<00:00:38.280> of

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
gear contact there's a bunch of

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.670 
gear contact there's a bunch of
different<00:00:38.640> ones<00:00:38.700> camera<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> name<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
different ones camera are just to name a

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.030 
different ones camera are just to name a
few<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.489> one<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.910> similar<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> lot<00:00:43.890> of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
few and this one is similar to a lot of

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.680 
few and this one is similar to a lot of
the<00:00:44.309> canova<00:00:44.579> sliders<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.300> find<00:00:45.510> out

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the canova sliders that you can find out

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.020 
the canova sliders that you can find out
there<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.710> exception<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:47.940> is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
there with one exception this one is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.810 
there with one exception this one is
built<00:00:48.300> much<00:00:48.899> better<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.530> my<00:00:49.559> opinion<00:00:49.800> when<00:00:50.700> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
built much better in my opinion when it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.000 
built much better in my opinion when it
comes<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> machining<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
comes to the machining and the just the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.950 
comes to the machining and the just the
quality<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> actual<00:00:53.940> aluminum<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.660> metal

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
quality of the actual aluminum and metal

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.779 
quality of the actual aluminum and metal
the<00:00:55.260> carriage<00:00:55.739> everything<00:00:56.340> about<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.730> is

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the carriage everything about it is

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.720 
the carriage everything about it is
completely<00:00:57.539> metal<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.859> found<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.489> is

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
completely metal and I found that it is

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.819 
completely metal and I found that it is
really<00:01:00.270> really<00:01:00.510> smooth<00:01:00.870> I've<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.590> couple

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
really really smooth I've a couple

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.860 
really really smooth I've a couple
things<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.070> didn't<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:02.670> much<00:01:03.180> then

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
things I didn't like as much then

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.149 
things I didn't like as much then
there's<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.110> lot<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.379> things<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.619> do<00:01:04.680> really<00:01:04.920> like

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
there's a lot of things I do really like

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.670 
there's a lot of things I do really like
so<00:01:05.400> let's<00:01:06.390> start<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> lock<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
so let's start with the lock you have a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.550 
so let's start with the lock you have a
nice<00:01:07.890> lock<00:01:08.400> knob<00:01:08.640> right<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.560> that's

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
nice lock knob right here and that's

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.800 
nice lock knob right here and that's
going<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.890> obviously<00:01:11.159> unlock<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.330> carriage

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
going to obviously unlock the carriage

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.380 
going to obviously unlock the carriage
and<00:01:13.049> allow<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.500> move<00:01:13.680> freely<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.820> found<00:01:15.270> it

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
and allow it to move freely I found it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.940 
and allow it to move freely I found it
was<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> lot<00:01:15.689> easier<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:16.259> smoother<00:01:16.680> shots

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
was a lot easier to get smoother shots

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.270 
was a lot easier to get smoother shots
on<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.400> than<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.060> canova<00:01:19.040> something<00:01:20.040> about

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
on this than the canova something about

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.859 
on this than the canova something about
you<00:01:20.490> know<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> four<00:01:21.210> ball<00:01:21.420> bearings<00:01:21.840> that

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
you know the four ball bearings that

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.620 
you know the four ball bearings that
they<00:01:22.080> use<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.740> unit<00:01:23.100> make<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.790> very<00:01:24.030> easy

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
they use on this unit make it very easy

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.800 
they use on this unit make it very easy
to<00:01:24.990> manually<00:01:25.470> get<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.680> nice<00:01:25.950> slide<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:27.659> one

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
to manually get a nice slide the one

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.690 
to manually get a nice slide the one
thing<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.049> didn't<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.400> little

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
thing I didn't like is the little

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.969 
thing I didn't like is the little
locking<00:01:30.180> unit<00:01:30.479> here<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.619> different

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
locking unit here it's just different

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.440 
locking unit here it's just different
than<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> lot<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.579> other<00:01:32.729> ones<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.090> lot<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.270> other

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
than a lot of other ones a lot of other

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.420 
than a lot of other ones a lot of other
ones<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.170> keep<00:01:34.409> tightening<00:01:34.650> till<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.100> stops

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
ones you keep tightening till it stops

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.940 
ones you keep tightening till it stops
and<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.030> doesn't<00:01:36.329> move<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.720> one<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.259> mean

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and then it doesn't move this one I mean

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.950 
and then it doesn't move this one I mean
here<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.460> moving<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.119> turn<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.750> little

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
here it's moving I turn it just a little

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.130 
here it's moving I turn it just a little
bit<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.979> locked<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.450> temptation<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
bit it's locked so the temptation is to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.389 
bit it's locked so the temptation is to
keep<00:01:43.439> turning<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:43.890> because<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.250> will

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
keep turning this because this will

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.460 
keep turning this because this will
continue<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.939> turn<00:01:45.119> even<00:01:45.570> after<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.110> locked

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
continue to turn even after it's locked

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.620 
continue to turn even after it's locked
and<00:01:46.770> there<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> very<00:01:48.860> somewhat<00:01:49.860> fragile<00:01:50.630> I

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
and there is a very somewhat fragile I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.710 
and there is a very somewhat fragile I
guess<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.409> nylon<00:01:52.920> or<00:01:53.100> plastic<00:01:53.729> quarter

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
guess this is nylon or plastic quarter

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.630 
guess this is nylon or plastic quarter

and<00:01:56.850> loosen<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.509> because<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:58.649> not<00:01:58.710> made

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
and loosen it and because it's not made

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.649 
and loosen it and because it's not made
of<00:01:59.130> metal<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.700> little<00:01:59.939> fragile<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.509> mine

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
of metal it's a little fragile so mine

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.660 
of metal it's a little fragile so mine
is<00:02:00.689> bent<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.200> little<00:02:01.229> bit<00:02:01.439> because<00:02:01.740> again<00:02:02.640> I

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
is bent a little bit because again I

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.639 
is bent a little bit because again I
felt<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.479> kept<00:02:03.689> needing<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.079> turn<00:02:04.320> when

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
felt like it kept needing to turn when

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.109 
felt like it kept needing to turn when
it<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:05.009> didn't<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.670> careful<00:02:05.969> about

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
it really didn't so be careful about

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.089 
it really didn't so be careful about
that<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.719> there<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> reason<00:02:07.649> it's<00:02:07.979> not

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
that and there is a reason it's not

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.180 
that and there is a reason it's not
metal<00:02:08.580> because<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.390> don't<00:02:09.660> want<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.190> screw

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
metal because we don't want to screw

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.340 
metal because we don't want to screw
down<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.700> damn<00:02:12.000> it

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
down and damn it

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.370 
down and damn it
the<00:02:12.530> side<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.490> slider<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.780> idea<00:02:15.080> here

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
the side of the slider so the idea here

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.870 
the side of the slider so the idea here
is<00:02:15.410> that<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.890> tightens<00:02:16.190> down<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.550> keeps<00:02:16.700> it

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
is that it tightens down and keeps it

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.520 
is that it tightens down and keeps it
from<00:02:17.000> moving<00:02:17.060> but<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.930> doesn't<00:02:18.230> damage<00:02:18.350> your

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
from moving but it doesn't damage your

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.450 
from moving but it doesn't damage your
slider<00:02:18.950> at<00:02:19.160> all

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
slider at all

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.490 
slider at all
so<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:20.030> knobs<00:02:20.240> are<00:02:20.570> really<00:02:20.900> nice<00:02:21.080> on<00:02:21.350> this

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
so the knobs are really nice on this

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.980 
so the knobs are really nice on this
unit<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.520> I<00:02:22.760> found<00:02:23.000> them<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.360> be<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.870> know

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
unit and I found them to be you know

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.240 
unit and I found them to be you know
easier<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.530> use<00:02:24.680> than<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.860> lot<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.130> other

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
easier to use than a lot of other

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.860 
easier to use than a lot of other
smaller<00:02:25.670> ones<00:02:25.850> out<00:02:26.000> there<00:02:26.150> they're<00:02:26.360> very<00:02:26.540> you

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
smaller ones out there they're very you

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.240 
smaller ones out there they're very you
know<00:02:26.900> have<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.320> nice<00:02:27.580> plastic<00:02:28.580> knob<00:02:28.760> here<00:02:30.250> the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
know have a nice plastic knob here the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.070 
know have a nice plastic knob here the
carriage<00:02:31.610> can<00:02:31.880> just<00:02:32.390> feels<00:02:32.570> like<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:32.870> holds

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
carriage can just feels like it holds

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.020 
carriage can just feels like it holds
more<00:02:33.320> weight<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:34.070> doesn't<00:02:34.340> flex<00:02:34.640> as<00:02:34.820> much

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
more weight and it doesn't flex as much

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.420 
more weight and it doesn't flex as much
the<00:02:35.210> entire<00:02:35.480> unit<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.800> really<00:02:37.100> like<00:02:37.250> that

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
the entire unit and I really like that

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.510 
the entire unit and I really like that
you<00:02:37.640> have<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.820> nice<00:02:38.350> bubble<00:02:39.350> on<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.920> side<00:02:40.160> here

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
you have a nice bubble on the side here

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.460 
you have a nice bubble on the side here
for<00:02:40.790> leveling<00:02:41.210> everything<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:42.230> then<00:02:42.410> the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
for leveling everything and then the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.870 
for leveling everything and then the
other<00:02:42.620> thing<00:02:42.800> you'll<00:02:42.890> notice<00:02:42.950> if<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.460> spin<00:02:43.760> this

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
other thing you'll notice if I spin this

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.750 
other thing you'll notice if I spin this
around<00:02:44.060> here<00:02:44.630> is<00:02:45.050> that<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.560> slider<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:46.160> offset

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
around here is that the slider is offset

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.160 
around here is that the slider is offset
and<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:46.970> actually<00:02:47.150> should<00:02:47.480> spin<00:02:47.720> my<00:02:47.840> camera

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
and I actually should spin my camera

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.780 
and I actually should spin my camera
around<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.710> just<00:02:48.830> wanted<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.310> have<00:02:49.550> you<00:02:49.580> guys

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
around I just wanted to have you guys

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.090 
around I just wanted to have you guys
see<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.150> lock<00:02:50.360> but<00:02:51.170> if<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.320> spin<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.680> like<00:02:51.710> this

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
see the lock but if I spin it like this

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.280 
see the lock but if I spin it like this
you'll<00:02:52.820> actually<00:02:52.850> notice<00:02:53.300> that<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.900> plate

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
you'll actually notice that the plate

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.980 
you'll actually notice that the plate
here<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.650> offset<00:02:55.130> it's<00:02:55.250> not<00:02:55.430> directly<00:02:56.060> under

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
here is offset it's not directly under

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.690 
here is offset it's not directly under
the<00:02:57.140> slide<00:02:57.380> it's<00:02:57.590> slightly<00:02:57.920> off<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.400> side

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
the slide it's slightly off to the side

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.210 
the slide it's slightly off to the side
and<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.570> reason<00:02:59.900> for<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.080> is<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.680> camera

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
and the reason for that is a camera

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.030 
and the reason for that is a camera
alignment<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:01.940> puts<00:03:02.180> less<00:03:02.450> stress<00:03:02.870> right<00:03:03.800> on

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
alignment it puts less stress right on

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.370 
alignment it puts less stress right on
the<00:03:04.220> main<00:03:04.450> area<00:03:05.450> especially<00:03:05.630> since<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.200> lot<00:03:06.350> of

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
the main area especially since a lot of

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.200 
the main area especially since a lot of
the<00:03:06.500> time<00:03:06.680> your<00:03:07.130> camera<00:03:07.460> might<00:03:07.640> be<00:03:07.790> like<00:03:07.940> this

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
the time your camera might be like this

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.290 
the time your camera might be like this
where<00:03:08.690> all<00:03:08.960> the<00:03:09.110> weight<00:03:09.290> is<00:03:09.500> off<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:10.790> one<00:03:10.820> side

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
where all the weight is off to one side

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.760 
where all the weight is off to one side
so<00:03:11.330> it's<00:03:11.690> nice<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.870> have<00:03:12.110> this<00:03:12.230> offset<00:03:12.650> and

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
so it's nice to have this offset and

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.320 
so it's nice to have this offset and
it's<00:03:12.860> also<00:03:13.010> just<00:03:13.190> easier<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:13.580> see<00:03:13.880> everything

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
it's also just easier to see everything

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.540 
it's also just easier to see everything
you<00:03:14.480> can<00:03:14.660> mean<00:03:15.620> really<00:03:15.890> work<00:03:16.100> with<00:03:16.220> everything

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
you can mean really work with everything

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.040 
you can mean really work with everything
it<00:03:16.730> doesn't<00:03:16.880> interfere<00:03:17.180> with<00:03:17.630> your<00:03:17.720> tripod

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
it doesn't interfere with your tripod

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.690 
it doesn't interfere with your tripod
knobs<00:03:18.500> that's<00:03:18.830> something<00:03:19.100> else<00:03:19.190> I've<00:03:19.370> noticed

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
knobs that's something else I've noticed

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.590 
knobs that's something else I've noticed
about<00:03:19.850> a<00:03:20.030> lot<00:03:20.390> of<00:03:20.510> sliders<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:21.640> your<00:03:22.640> knobs<00:03:23.120> and

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
about a lot of sliders is your knobs and

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.960 
about a lot of sliders is your knobs and
your<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:24.350> know<00:03:24.380> points<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.310> adjustment<00:03:25.670> end

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
your you know points of adjustment end

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.630 
your you know points of adjustment end
up<00:03:26.420> interfering<00:03:27.110> with<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.950> slider<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.550> the

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
up interfering with the slider and the

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.210 
up interfering with the slider and the
slider<00:03:28.930> interferes<00:03:29.930> with<00:03:30.320> it<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:30.650> also<00:03:30.890> have

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
slider interferes with it I also have

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.860 
slider interferes with it I also have
the<00:03:31.370> bag<00:03:31.580> here<00:03:31.850> with<00:03:32.000> me<00:03:32.180> it's<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.450> nice<00:03:32.600> bag

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870

fits<00:03:33.290> really<00:03:33.470> well<00:03:33.590> another<00:03:34.280> criticism<00:03:34.670> I

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
fits really well another criticism I

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.600 
fits really well another criticism I
would<00:03:35.210> have<00:03:35.450> though<00:03:35.720> is<00:03:35.960> that<00:03:36.410> with<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.340> feet

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
would have though is that with the feet

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.850 
would have though is that with the feet
which<00:03:37.820> we're<00:03:38.000> about<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.210> attach<00:03:38.660> you<00:03:39.620> can't

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
which we're about to attach you can't

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
inside of the slider for holding

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.450 
inside of the slider for holding
everything<00:03:50.810> so<00:03:51.230> in<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.770> slider<00:03:52.010> here<00:03:52.280> I'm

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
everything so in the slider here I'm

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.880 
everything so in the slider here I'm
holding<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.940> two<00:03:53.120> knobs<00:03:53.360> for<00:03:54.110> attaching<00:03:54.650> the

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
holding the two knobs for attaching the

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.320 
holding the two knobs for attaching the
legs<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.520> slider<00:03:55.790> that's<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.210> other

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
legs to the slider that's the other

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.750 
legs to the slider that's the other
thing<00:03:56.570> I<00:03:56.780> would<00:03:56.900> like<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.380> see<00:03:57.560> is<00:03:57.770> a<00:03:58.130> way<00:03:58.700> to

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
thing I would like to see is a way to

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.450 
thing I would like to see is a way to
keep<00:03:59.210> the<00:03:59.450> knobs<00:03:59.690> with<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.440> feet<00:04:00.710> because<00:04:01.370> I

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
keep the knobs with the feet because I

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.830 
keep the knobs with the feet because I
can<00:04:01.610> see<00:04:01.820> where<00:04:02.000> you<00:04:02.090> could<00:04:02.240> easily<00:04:02.420> lose

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
can see where you could easily lose

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.080 
can see where you could easily lose
these<00:04:03.140> two<00:04:03.170> things<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:04.010> be<00:04:04.400> in<00:04:04.490> trouble<00:04:04.910> so

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
these two things and be in trouble so

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.020 
these two things and be in trouble so
we'll<00:04:05.600> set<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.900> bag<00:04:06.080> down<00:04:06.320> and<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:09.320> feet<00:04:10.030> have

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
we'll set the bag down and the feet have

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.630 
we'll set the bag down and the feet have
little<00:04:11.690> grooves<00:04:12.230> so<00:04:12.500> they<00:04:12.740> locked<00:04:13.070> really

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
little grooves so they locked really

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.180 
little grooves so they locked really
nicely<00:04:14.060> down<00:04:14.330> onto<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:14.930> slider<00:04:15.200> so<00:04:15.950> I'm<00:04:16.010> going

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
nicely down onto the slider so I'm going

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.010 
nicely down onto the slider so I'm going
to<00:04:16.250> try<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.400> do<00:04:16.640> this<00:04:16.760> here<00:04:17.030> hold<00:04:17.480> this<00:04:17.630> one<00:04:17.840> guy

sticking<00:05:04.240> out<00:05:04.390> as<00:05:04.570> much<00:05:04.870> so<00:05:05.560> that<00:05:05.710> you<00:05:05.830> have<00:05:06.040> a

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
sticking out as much so that you have a

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.880 
sticking out as much so that you have a
nice<00:05:06.610> compact<00:05:07.480> you<00:05:07.900> know<00:05:07.990> end<00:05:08.200> to<00:05:08.380> your<00:05:08.530> slider

nice compact you know end to your slider

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.580 
nice compact you know end to your slider
so<00:05:09.250> really<00:05:10.150> like<00:05:10.330> that<00:05:10.570> about<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:11.320> slider

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
so really like that about the slider

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.980 
so really like that about the slider
itself<00:05:12.070> so<00:05:12.880> I<00:05:12.910> got<00:05:13.060> a<00:05:13.090> couple<00:05:13.330> shots<00:05:13.570> with<00:05:13.810> this

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
itself so I got a couple shots with this

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.050 
itself so I got a couple shots with this
and<00:05:14.290> actually<00:05:14.950> went<00:05:15.250> on<00:05:15.340> my<00:05:15.460> balcony<00:05:15.670> because

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
and actually went on my balcony because

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.670 
and actually went on my balcony because
I<00:05:16.180> saw<00:05:16.330> we<00:05:16.450> had<00:05:16.570> a<00:05:16.600> beautiful<00:05:17.020> sunset<00:05:17.410> and<00:05:17.440> it's

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
I saw we had a beautiful sunset and it's

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.740 
I saw we had a beautiful sunset and it's
the<00:05:17.800> winter<00:05:18.070> time<00:05:18.340> here<00:05:18.640> in<00:05:18.700> Chicago<00:05:19.210> so

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
the winter time here in Chicago so

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.800 
the winter time here in Chicago so
that's<00:05:19.960> not<00:05:20.350> all<00:05:20.710> that<00:05:21.090> common<00:05:22.090> because<00:05:22.630> we

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
that's not all that common because we

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.590 
that's not all that common because we
have<00:05:23.050> terrible<00:05:23.500> weather<00:05:24.210> but<00:05:25.210> I<00:05:25.240> took<00:05:25.420> it<00:05:25.510> out

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
have terrible weather but I took it out

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.060 
have terrible weather but I took it out
there<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:26.050> I<00:05:26.110> did<00:05:26.260> a<00:05:26.290> couple<00:05:26.620> different<00:05:26.860> shots

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
there and I did a couple different shots

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.850 
there and I did a couple different shots
and<00:05:27.400> one<00:05:27.640> thing<00:05:27.850> that<00:05:27.970> I<00:05:28.000> really<00:05:28.330> liked<00:05:28.540> was

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
and one thing that I really liked was

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.800 
and one thing that I really liked was
actually<00:05:29.860> switching<00:05:30.610> the<00:05:30.790> slider<00:05:31.090> so<00:05:31.450> it<00:05:31.600> was

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
actually switching the slider so it was

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.470 
actually switching the slider so it was
in<00:05:32.050> line<00:05:32.440> with<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:32.980> tilt<00:05:33.280> on<00:05:33.550> my<00:05:33.670> tripod<00:05:34.120> and

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
in line with the tilt on my tripod and

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.750 
in line with the tilt on my tripod and
did<00:05:34.930> kind<00:05:35.170> of<00:05:35.200> a<00:05:35.320> reveal<00:05:35.740> shot<00:05:36.010> where<00:05:36.580> I<00:05:36.610> was

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
did kind of a reveal shot where I was

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.660 
did kind of a reveal shot where I was
diagonally<00:05:37.540> revealing<00:05:38.260> with<00:05:39.010> the<00:05:39.160> camera<00:05:39.490> on

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
diagonally revealing with the camera on

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.580 
diagonally revealing with the camera on
the<00:05:39.910> slider<00:05:40.180> and<00:05:40.570> because<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:40.990> slider<00:05:41.200> was<00:05:41.350> so

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
the slider and because the slider was so

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.560 
the slider and because the slider was so
strong<00:05:41.950> it<00:05:42.160> just<00:05:42.190> worked<00:05:42.640> beautifully<00:05:43.360> there

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
strong it just worked beautifully there

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.440 
strong it just worked beautifully there
was<00:05:43.690> no<00:05:43.900> flex<00:05:44.320> I<00:05:44.590> didn't<00:05:45.130> feel<00:05:45.310> like<00:05:45.580> the

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
was no flex I didn't feel like the

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.390 
was no flex I didn't feel like the
slider<00:05:46.750> or<00:05:47.020> my<00:05:47.200> tripod<00:05:47.710> was<00:05:47.860> having<00:05:48.190> an<00:05:48.280> issue

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
slider or my tripod was having an issue

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.180 
slider or my tripod was having an issue
with<00:05:48.610> the<00:05:48.820> camera<00:05:49.270> weight<00:05:49.450> and<00:05:49.740> between<00:05:50.740> this

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
with the camera weight and between this

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.800 
with the camera weight and between this
end<00:05:51.430> of<00:05:51.520> the<00:05:51.580> slider<00:05:51.820> and<00:05:52.090> this<00:05:52.300> sentence<00:05:52.630> liar

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
end of the slider and this sentence liar

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.750 
end of the slider and this sentence liar
there's<00:05:53.110> almost<00:05:53.350> no<00:05:53.770> flex<00:05:54.130> this<00:05:54.340> thing<00:05:54.520> is<00:05:54.640> an

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
there's almost no flex this thing is an

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.330 
there's almost no flex this thing is an
absolute<00:05:55.270> animal<00:05:55.510> so<00:05:55.990> I<00:05:56.200> really<00:05:56.980> like<00:05:57.160> that

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
absolute animal so I really like that

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.840 
absolute animal so I really like that
about<00:05:57.520> FMV<00:05:58.450> is<00:05:58.570> sliders<00:05:59.550> they<00:06:00.550> do<00:06:00.610> have

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
about FMV is sliders they do have

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.160 
about FMV is sliders they do have
several<00:06:01.030> different<00:06:01.420> options<00:06:01.510> so<00:06:01.900> you<00:06:01.960> don't

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
several different options so you don't

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.930 
several different options so you don't
have<00:06:02.350> to<00:06:02.530> expend<00:06:03.010> you<00:06:03.370> know<00:06:03.490> five<00:06:03.910> hundred

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
have to expend you know five hundred

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.330 
have to expend you know five hundred
dollars<00:06:04.510> you<00:06:04.690> can<00:06:04.870> start<00:06:05.710> at<00:06:05.920> a<00:06:05.950> really

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
dollars you can start at a really

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.520 
dollars you can start at a really
reasonable<00:06:06.550> price<00:06:06.910> around<00:06:07.480> $200<00:06:08.170> and<00:06:08.380> work

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
reasonable price around $200 and work

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.710 
reasonable price around $200 and work
your<00:06:08.680> way<00:06:08.860> up<00:06:08.890> depending<00:06:09.670> on<00:06:09.730> the<00:06:09.910> weight

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
your way up depending on the weight

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.750 
your way up depending on the weight
usage<00:06:11.140> you're<00:06:11.320> going<00:06:11.530> to<00:06:11.620> be<00:06:11.710> using<00:06:12.100> one<00:06:12.550> other

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
usage you're going to be using one other

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.540 
usage you're going to be using one other
thing<00:06:12.940> I<00:06:13.090> will<00:06:13.150> say<00:06:13.780> is<00:06:14.050> that<00:06:14.860> this<00:06:15.040> slider<00:06:15.400> is

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
thing I will say is that this slider is

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.720 
thing I will say is that this slider is
a<00:06:15.700> little<00:06:16.590> noisier<00:06:17.590> than<00:06:17.800> other<00:06:18.130> sliders<00:06:18.490> out

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
a little noisier than other sliders out

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.670 
a little noisier than other sliders out
there<00:06:18.910> that<00:06:19.060> I've<00:06:19.180> worked<00:06:19.360> with<00:06:19.570> so<00:06:20.320> if<00:06:20.560> you're

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
there that I've worked with so if you're

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.720 
there that I've worked with so if you're
going<00:06:20.860> really<00:06:21.010> slow<00:06:21.250> you're<00:06:21.430> not<00:06:21.550> going<00:06:21.670> to

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.730 
going really slow you're not going to

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:22.860 
going really slow you're not going to
notice<00:06:21.850> it<00:06:22.060> but<00:06:22.240> if<00:06:22.330> you're<00:06:22.450> kind<00:06:22.630> of<00:06:22.660> going

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
notice it but if you're kind of going

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.890 
notice it but if you're kind of going
like<00:06:22.930> this<00:06:24.180> you<00:06:25.180> can<00:06:25.300> probably<00:06:25.450> hear<00:06:25.630> that<00:06:25.810> on

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
like this you can probably hear that on

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.920 
like this you can probably hear that on
my<00:06:25.990> mic<00:06:27.330> you're<00:06:28.330> going<00:06:28.510> to<00:06:28.630> have<00:06:28.720> a<00:06:28.750> little

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
my mic you're going to have a little

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.770 
my mic you're going to have a little
more<00:06:29.170> noise<00:06:29.350> so<00:06:29.830> if<00:06:30.340> you<00:06:30.550> do<00:06:30.760> a<00:06:30.790> lot<00:06:31.240> of<00:06:31.360> filming

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
more noise so if you do a lot of filming

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.040 
more noise so if you do a lot of filming
where<00:06:32.200> you're<00:06:32.560> having<00:06:32.770> to<00:06:32.950> use<00:06:33.160> a<00:06:33.190> mic<00:06:33.490> on<00:06:33.640> top

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
where you're having to use a mic on top

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.270 
where you're having to use a mic on top
camera<00:06:34.259> which<00:06:34.379> really<00:06:34.620> isn't<00:06:34.800> the<00:06:34.949> greatest

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
camera which really isn't the greatest

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.700 
camera which really isn't the greatest
to<00:06:35.340> begin<00:06:35.610> with<00:06:35.759> but<00:06:36.389> just<00:06:37.229> you're<00:06:37.440> gonna<00:06:37.500> want

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:38.689 
to begin with but just you're gonna want
to<00:06:37.740> keep<00:06:37.889> that<00:06:37.979> in<00:06:38.099> mind<00:06:38.250> you're<00:06:38.370> going<00:06:38.490> to<00:06:38.610> be

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:41.099 
having a little bit of operation noise

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.219
