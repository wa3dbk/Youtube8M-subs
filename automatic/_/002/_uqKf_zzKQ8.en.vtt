there's my jika jika power chord and you
know<00:00:54.890> instead<00:00:55.160> of<00:00:55.220> moving<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.610> shape<00:00:55.850> around

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.960 

which<00:01:02.680> is<00:01:02.829> cool<00:01:03.040> that's<00:01:03.399> a<00:01:03.489> good<00:01:03.640> technique

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
which is cool that's a good technique

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.640 
which is cool that's a good technique
but<00:01:04.210> today<00:01:04.780> we're<00:01:04.960> going<00:01:05.050> to<00:01:05.140> look<00:01:05.470> at<00:01:05.560> a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
but today we're going to look at a

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.430 
but today we're going to look at a
different<00:01:06.010> technique<00:01:06.370> which<00:01:06.580> is<00:01:06.700> keeping<00:01:07.440> the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
different technique which is keeping the

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.859 
different technique which is keeping the
lower<00:01:08.650> note<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.070> same<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.479> moving<00:01:10.780> the

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
lower note the same and moving the

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:18.370 
lower note the same and moving the
higher<00:01:11.050> note<00:01:11.320> so<00:01:11.650> for<00:01:11.830> example

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.069 

okay<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.439> we're<00:01:19.649> moving<00:01:19.740> back<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.280> forth<00:01:21.079> the

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
okay so we're moving back and forth the

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.240 
okay so we're moving back and forth the
higher<00:01:22.259> note<00:01:22.500> from<00:01:22.679> the<00:01:22.799> seventh<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
higher note from the seventh to the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.010

a perfect fourth interval you should get

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.060 
a perfect fourth interval you should get
used<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.600> these<00:03:37.720> interval<00:03:38.410> names<00:03:38.620> as<00:03:38.890> you're

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
used to these interval names as you're

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.030 
used to these interval names as you're
progressing<00:03:39.700> in<00:03:40.120> your<00:03:40.150> musical<00:03:40.570> journey<00:03:41.040> the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
progressing in your musical journey the

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.680 
progressing in your musical journey the
original<00:03:42.370> power<00:03:42.520> cord<00:03:42.880> we<00:03:42.970> call<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.270> perfect

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
original power cord we call that perfect

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:52.080 
original power cord we call that perfect
fifth<00:03:44.460> this<00:03:45.460> is<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.670> six<00:03:49.020> sharp<00:03:50.020> 15<00:03:50.730> flat<00:03:51.730> fifth

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
fifth this is a six sharp 15 flat fifth

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.620 
fifth this is a six sharp 15 flat fifth
and<00:03:52.990> then<00:03:53.110> forth<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:55.840> this<00:03:56.020> fourth<00:03:56.350> interval

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
and then forth so this fourth interval

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.180 
and then forth so this fourth interval
is<00:03:58.630> fourth<00:03:58.960> to<00:03:59.110> fifth<00:03:59.140> sound<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.830> I<00:03:59.890> think<00:04:00.130> a

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
is fourth to fifth sound and I think a

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:09.149 
is fourth to fifth sound and I think a
classic<00:04:00.640> rock<00:04:00.850> you<00:04:01.120> know<00:04:01.210> like<00:04:01.390> dire<00:04:01.900> straits

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.979 

if<00:04:09.489> Jimmy<00:04:09.819> Hendrix<00:04:10.180> used<00:04:10.299> that<00:04:10.510> kind<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.780> stuff

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
if Jimmy Hendrix used that kind of stuff

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.020 
if Jimmy Hendrix used that kind of stuff
a<00:04:11.019> lot<00:04:11.260> when<00:04:11.440> he<00:04:11.500> was<00:04:11.620> jamming

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.990 

so

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.390 

you<00:04:20.150> know<00:04:20.959> play<00:04:21.140> around<00:04:21.320> with<00:04:21.470> it<00:04:21.650> now<00:04:22.100> go<00:04:22.250> back

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
you know play around with it now go back

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.670 
you know play around with it now go back
one<00:04:22.700> more<00:04:22.880> fret<00:04:23.210> that's<00:04:23.660> a<00:04:24.020> major<00:04:24.320> third

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
one more fret that's a major third

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.270 
one more fret that's a major third
interval

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.129 

you<00:04:30.729> can<00:04:30.880> get<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.030> great<00:04:31.300> sound<00:04:31.630> going<00:04:31.840> from<00:04:32.020> the

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
you can get a great sound going from the

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:42.709 
you can get a great sound going from the
3rd<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.470> the<00:04:32.650> 4th

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:42.719 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:44.790 

you<00:04:43.719> can<00:04:43.840> play<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.110> chord<00:04:44.349> the<00:04:44.469> notes

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
you can play the chord the notes

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.420 
you can play the chord the notes
separately

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.470 

I<00:04:47.460> mean<00:04:48.050> going<00:04:49.050> back<00:04:49.170> one<00:04:49.500> more<00:04:49.620> frat<00:04:49.920> man<00:04:50.480> give

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
I mean going back one more frat man give

00:04:51.480 --> 00:05:01.460 
I mean going back one more frat man give
a<00:04:51.510> minor<00:04:51.810> third<00:04:52.080> interval

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.030 

go<00:05:01.919> back<00:05:02.160> one<00:05:02.400> more<00:05:02.550> fret<00:05:03.590> very<00:05:04.590> dissonant

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
go back one more fret very dissonant

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.280 
go back one more fret very dissonant
sound<00:05:05.310> right<00:05:05.550> so<00:05:05.790> it's<00:05:05.940> a<00:05:06.000> second<00:05:06.300> interval

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.750 

you<00:05:10.290> could<00:05:10.410> use<00:05:10.530> that<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.860> maybe<00:05:11.100> slide<00:05:11.370> into

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
you could use that to maybe slide into

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.630 
you could use that to maybe slide into
the<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:12.150> minor<00:05:12.360> third
