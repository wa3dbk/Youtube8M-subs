00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
which usually people don't use and it's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.540 
which usually people don't use and it's
something<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.800> i<00:00:52.890> wanted<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.219> try<00:00:53.309> and

random<00:00:53.820> because<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.180> see<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
random because as you can see the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.880 
random because as you can see the
combination<00:00:54.930> by<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.050> gun<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.739> map

combination by the gun and the map

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.500 
combination by the gun and the map
itself<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.399> pretty<00:00:56.610> unordinary<00:00:57.059> because

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
itself is pretty unordinary because

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.090 
itself is pretty unordinary because
usually<00:00:57.660> people<00:00:58.020> would<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.710> used<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.039> the

scorpion even such an open map like this

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.910 
scorpion even such an open map like this
because<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.079> gun<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.260> pretty<00:01:01.530> useful<00:01:01.649> for

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
because this gun is pretty useful for

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.319 
because this gun is pretty useful for
only<00:01:02.100> pretty<00:01:02.309> much<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> coach<00:01:02.789> cool<00:01:03.180> and

so obviously you guys know you guys get

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.670 
so obviously you guys know you guys get
it<00:02:27.420> right<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:27.690> they're<00:02:27.840> gonna<00:02:27.930> get<00:02:28.140> completely

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
it right so they're gonna get completely

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.840 
it right so they're gonna get completely
shitty<00:02:29.010> stats<00:02:29.280> not<00:02:29.490> cause<00:02:29.640> obviously

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
shitty stats not cause obviously

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.000 
shitty stats not cause obviously
treyarch<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.020> first<00:02:31.290> time<00:02:31.470> ever<00:02:31.650> for<00:02:31.830> some

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
treyarch but a first time ever for some

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.890 
treyarch but a first time ever for some
reason<00:02:32.340> they<00:02:32.430> implement<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:32.970> system<00:02:33.120> called

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
reason they implement this system called

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.690 
reason they implement this system called
skill<00:02:34.200> based<00:02:34.410> matchmaking<00:02:34.620> right<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.580> is

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
skill based matchmaking right this is

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.490 
skill based matchmaking right this is
only<00:02:35.850> based<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.390> black<00:02:36.660> ops<00:02:36.840> 2<00:02:37.020> this<00:02:37.200> has<00:02:37.350> been

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
only based on black ops 2 this has been

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.960 
only based on black ops 2 this has been
never<00:02:37.680> done<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:37.920> any<00:02:38.040> other<00:02:38.160> qualities<00:02:38.640> before

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
never done in any other qualities before

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.030 
never done in any other qualities before
so<00:02:39.090> obviously<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:40.050> system<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.500> not<00:02:40.680> abused

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
so obviously this system is not abused

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.530 
so obviously this system is not abused
by<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.160> lot<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.370> people<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:42.210> YouTube

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
by a lot of people in the YouTube

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.060 
by a lot of people in the YouTube
community<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:43.110> producing<00:02:43.500> gameplays<00:02:43.890> in

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
community of producing gameplays in

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.240 
community of producing gameplays in
itself<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.900> what<00:02:45.900> they<00:02:45.990> do<00:02:46.050> is<00:02:46.500> they

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
itself and to what they do is they

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.160 
itself and to what they do is they
obviously<00:02:47.370> then<00:02:48.150> once<00:02:48.360> they<00:02:48.510> lower<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.870> stats

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
obviously then once they lower the stats

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.870 
obviously then once they lower the stats
they<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.560> go<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:50.070> game<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.610> they<00:02:50.700> obviously

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
they to go to a game and they obviously

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.790 
they to go to a game and they obviously
you<00:02:51.420> guys<00:02:51.570> pretty<00:02:51.870> self-explanatory<00:02:52.230> they're

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
you guys pretty self-explanatory they're

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.990 
you guys pretty self-explanatory they're
gonna<00:02:52.890> end<00:02:53.130> up<00:02:53.220> with<00:02:53.310> players<00:02:53.550> with<00:02:53.730> similar

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
gonna end up with players with similar

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.250 
gonna end up with players with similar
stats<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.480> person<00:02:54.810> that's<00:02:54.930> killed

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
stats to the person that's killed

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.840 
stats to the person that's killed
himself<00:02:55.380> tons<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:55.920> times<00:02:56.100> get<00:02:56.370> shitty<00:02:56.580> stat

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
himself tons of times get shitty stat

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.120 
himself tons of times get shitty stat
and<00:02:57.060> therefore<00:02:58.050> what<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.650> matchmaking

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
and therefore what the matchmaking

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.950 
and therefore what the matchmaking
system<00:02:59.370> does<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.730> that--do<00:03:00.450> thing<00:03:00.780> the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
system does is that--do thing the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.630 
system does is that--do thing the
matchmaker<00:03:01.470> system<00:03:01.770> would<00:03:01.890> think<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.250> this

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
matchmaker system would think that this

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.160 
matchmaker system would think that this
player<00:03:02.910> with<00:03:03.210> shitty<00:03:03.420> stats<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.900> gonna<00:03:04.080> be

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
player with shitty stats is gonna be

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.200 
player with shitty stats is gonna be
pretty<00:03:04.290> bad<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.710> ends<00:03:04.920> up<00:03:05.010> putting<00:03:05.670> them<00:03:06.000> in<00:03:06.120> a

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
pretty bad so ends up putting them in a

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.330 
pretty bad so ends up putting them in a
player<00:03:06.450> with<00:03:07.050> with<00:03:07.410> shitty<00:03:07.770> with<00:03:08.070> shitty
