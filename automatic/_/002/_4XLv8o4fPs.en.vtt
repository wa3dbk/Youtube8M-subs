00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:09.150
 4 booths This time the schedule is Patch Patch Supercar Paris Hot Fix 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.830
 I will explain about the changes after 4 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.910
 Once the haejusimyeon'm not drinking the energy and buy you the speed you are ready 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.279
 4 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.069
 Then I picked up my sister and bought an ele 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:28.259
 You can buy energy 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:33.000
 Before your message tells you that energy is delivered to your garage . 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:37.890
 You must complete the copy. Yes, it takes about 1 minute before the message 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.750
 I have time to spare, and I have three cars 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:47.520
 You can dress up 4 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:50.730
 I will show you how to copy one by one to make it easier for you to understand 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:56.190
 I'll give you one . 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:59.970
 I take out my sister and go out to the alleyway. 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:06.149
 I'm going to kill you tomorrow and kill your sister. 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:11.399
 I'll go in. 4 Go in. If you get out of the car soon after the car, 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:17.310
 You can go to the internet with your mobile phone and purchase the Elegance 4 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:21.360
 And then you go into that blue circle where you can manage your car. 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.430
 You can copy the vehicle as usual 4 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.370
 And then the message that the energy was delivered to your garage 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.960
 on 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:35.930
 When the message comes up and you are in a garage in any state, 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.130
 I can not get out on a ride 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:44.990
 Everybody knows. Yeah. I can not get out. 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.700
 So if you take a car like this, 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.880
 Once you go 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.870
 Until you get a message that energy has been delivered to your garage 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.100
 You can wait 4 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:01.640
 Like the image in the image as the message it is open, after that I have delivered 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:07.550
 Please come back after the message 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:10.760
 We will continue to do, please repeat the copy in the same way 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:15.500
 These same allergies I bought a copy These examples 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:19.430
 After you go out and your energy in your garage has been delivered 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.490
 After the message opens, come back to the garage again. 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.690
 I'll make a copy 4 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:32.780
 And then, in the case of sales, 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:36.189
 First toss keoseuteomeo go something to sell when I cheer when ever BONNET 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:41.530
 I'll do it 4 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:43.780
 I can feel it a bit harder to do this with words like this 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.769
 In fact , 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.769
 I think it's very simple and easy to understand 4
