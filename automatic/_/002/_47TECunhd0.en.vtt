down onto the spool then I've tied a
blood<00:00:46.469> knot<00:00:46.680> under<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.100> spill<00:00:47.370> which<00:00:47.610> is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
blood knot under the spill which is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.440 
blood knot under the spill which is
pretty<00:00:47.940> easy

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
pretty easy

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.260 
pretty easy
most<00:00:49.170> people<00:00:49.379> know<00:00:49.469> how<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.590> do<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.610> now

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
most people know how to do that so now

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.470 
most people know how to do that so now
I've<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.449> got<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.750> wind<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.730> enough<00:00:53.730> line<00:00:54.000> so

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
I've just got to wind on enough line so

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.400 
I've just got to wind on enough line so
I<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.629> fit<00:00:54.960> 300<00:00:55.559> metres<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:58.850> 300<00:00:59.850> meter<00:00:59.940> spool

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
I can fit 300 metres a 300 meter spool

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.840 
I can fit 300 metres a 300 meter spool
onto<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.500> top<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.859> because<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.820> just

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
onto the top of that because if I just

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.640 
onto the top of that because if I just
put<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.210> 300<00:01:03.660> meters<00:01:03.899> straight<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.409> there

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
put that 300 meters straight on there

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.590 
put that 300 meters straight on there
it's<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.339> builds<00:01:05.670> only<00:01:05.729> gonna<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.090> half<00:01:06.270> full

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
it's this builds only gonna be half full

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.719 
it's this builds only gonna be half full
so<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:08.130> we're<00:01:08.250> gonna<00:01:08.310> do

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
put the mono backing on first and then

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.609 
put the mono backing on first and then
we'll<00:01:10.680> show<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.860> how<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.100> connect<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:12.439> but<00:01:13.439> for

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
we'll show you how to connect it but for

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.289 
we'll show you how to connect it but for
those<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.189> don't<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.939> had<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> tie

just quickly show you that now it's

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.120 
just quickly show you that now it's
rather<00:01:18.210> simple<00:01:18.479> run<00:01:19.439> your<00:01:19.560> line<00:01:19.710> down<00:01:19.920> through

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
rather simple run your line down through

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.890 
rather simple run your line down through
your<00:01:20.250> guides<00:01:21.020> then<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.170> around<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.590> spool<00:01:23.900> if

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
your guides then go around your spool if

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.620 
your guides then go around your spool if
your<00:01:25.110> line<00:01:25.290> pull<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.130> back<00:01:26.280> through<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.509> can

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
your line pull it back through you can

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.830 
your line pull it back through you can
go<00:01:27.750> around<00:01:27.810> twice<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:29.840> most

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
go around twice if you like but most

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.090 
go around twice if you like but most
likely<00:01:31.049> you're<00:01:31.290> never<00:01:31.439> gonna<00:01:31.590> see<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> bottom

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
likely you're never gonna see the bottom

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.340 
likely you're never gonna see the bottom
of<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> spool<00:01:32.490> anyway<00:01:32.869> so<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.110> to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
of the spool anyway so then we just to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.460 
of the spool anyway so then we just to
simply<00:01:34.710> tie<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.460> blood<00:01:35.790> knot<00:01:36.170> as<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.259> would<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
simply tie a blood knot as you would a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.120 
simply tie a blood knot as you would a
hook

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.200 

and<00:01:43.130> pull<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:43.369> down<00:01:43.399> tight<00:01:43.759> on<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.689> spill

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
and pull it down tight on the spill

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.060 
and pull it down tight on the spill
fling<00:01:47.210> then<00:01:47.360> really<00:01:47.689> tight<00:01:50.740> snip<00:01:51.740> your<00:01:51.830> tag

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
fling then really tight snip your tag

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
there first one to three hundred metres

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.240 
there first one to three hundred metres
per<00:02:11.330> line<00:02:11.599> and<00:02:11.810> then<00:02:12.530> attach<00:02:12.860> your<00:02:13.040> mono

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
per line and then attach your mono

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.030

backing<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.330> then<00:02:15.140> wind<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.590> on<00:02:15.680> until<00:02:15.920> you

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
backing and then wind it on until you

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.500 
backing and then wind it on until you
come<00:02:16.190> up<00:02:16.220> almost<00:02:16.670> at<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.880> top<00:02:17.030> of<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.239> spool

come up almost at the top of the spool

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.870 
come up almost at the top of the spool
then<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.650> transfer<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.250> back<00:02:19.400> over<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.790> the

then you transfer it back over to the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.729 
then you transfer it back over to the
other<00:02:20.000> reel<00:02:20.330> because<00:02:20.840> your<00:02:21.110> mono<00:02:21.290> backing

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
other reel because your mono backing

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:22.960 
other reel because your mono backing
will<00:02:21.860> then<00:02:22.010> go<00:02:22.160> on<00:02:22.310> first

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
will then go on first

do is simply just tie it double using a

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.319 
do is simply just tie it double using a
Spyder<00:03:16.069> hitch<00:03:16.280> doesn't<00:03:16.700> have<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.850> be<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.000> Bimini

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329

how you simply join your braid to your
backing<00:04:05.569> okay<00:04:06.569> now<00:04:07.230> we're<00:04:07.380> going<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.530> whine<00:04:07.769> it

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
backing okay now we're going to whine it

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.880 
backing okay now we're going to whine it
on<00:04:08.330> it's<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.420> matter<00:04:09.660> of<00:04:09.870> getting<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.290> not<00:04:10.739> on

the<00:04:10.980> reel<00:04:11.130> first<00:04:11.660> then<00:04:12.660> we<00:04:12.750> get<00:04:12.870> into<00:04:13.019> the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
the reel first then we get into the

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.729 
the reel first then we get into the
braid<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:14.040> what<00:04:14.160> we<00:04:14.280> want<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.519> do<00:04:15.530> put<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.560> glove

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739

strands pull into your reel and probably

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.810 
strands pull into your reel and probably
snap<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:38.520> off<00:04:38.700> so<00:04:39.510> it's<00:04:39.780> imperative<00:04:40.229> that<00:04:40.500> you
