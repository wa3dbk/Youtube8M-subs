00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
a TLS at the border so that the cami was

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.240 
a TLS at the border so that the cami was
a<00:00:27.660> little<00:00:27.930> bit<00:00:28.019> stronger<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.619> then<00:00:29.010> bake<00:00:29.220> for

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
a little bit stronger and then bake for

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.900 
a little bit stronger and then bake for
another<00:00:29.670> 15<00:00:31.040> where<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> body<00:00:32.520> I'm<00:00:32.790> gonna

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
another 15 where the body I'm gonna

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.490 
another 15 where the body I'm gonna
start<00:00:33.210> off<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.630> neck<00:00:33.809> roll<00:00:34.170> out<00:00:34.320> some

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
start off with the neck roll out some

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.380 
start off with the neck roll out some
polymer<00:00:34.890> clay<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.430> place<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.030> bottom

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
polymer clay and place it at the bottom

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.910 
polymer clay and place it at the bottom
middle<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.739> Cameo<00:00:39.410> remove<00:00:40.410> any<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
middle of the Cameo remove any of the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.920 
middle of the Cameo remove any of the
excess<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.489> flying<00:00:41.790> down<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.329> bottom<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
