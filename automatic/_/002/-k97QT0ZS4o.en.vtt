 low profile that no one knew when 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.230
 displaced why he appeared around here 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.930

 give a thousand explanations here is that 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.660
 look for an alternative I remember a 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.060
 old project that today I do not know how much the 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.800
 government first the fourth republic of 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.290
 a highway that connects on one side 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.900
 for another to find out where it is from and 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.850
 we went to work and effectively 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.420
