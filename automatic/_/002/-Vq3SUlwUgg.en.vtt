00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 We 're dialing 

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.870
 conclusion and we are not 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.460
 Mark 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.810
 So we have to talk to 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.740
 people are organizing is not 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.780
 happening 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.670
 We're coming back to hit this. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.099
 because a strong point that we have to 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.010
 ball stopped both offensively and 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.920
 defense and I'm sure he 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.020
 will fix this I feel betrayed 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.380
 I feel betrayed because no one spoke 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.289
 with me on the road you do not like 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.779
 situation 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.170
 I'll argue with them I do not like 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.969
 much of the marking on the individual marking 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.399
 not at the corner 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.350
 the mixed can still be one or two 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.120
 players individually marked but 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.280
 I prefer zone marking 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.059
 so this is a samsung you can discuss 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.149
 Of course but only when I when I 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.550
 two goals was my responsibility 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.930
 why the markup will be by zone and will 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.910
 continue being 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.770
 unless every team think it's a 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.449
 the most favorable situation for them 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.370
 this way we can 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.619
 be changing looking to do what I 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.869
 I think I should do with the group and its 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.390
 group I understand I'm going to end up 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.979
 coming out and if we understand we're going to give a lot 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.760
 well and probably last to make a 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.680
 great campaign on the page and see however 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.860
 still if the child see it actually 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.570
 he was a tool, it is true that the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.580
 rock and have had a little more 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.310
 careful to talk about the tactical part 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.159
 especially the commander who later did not 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.810
 speech and levit for a price sometimes be 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.970
 very sincere I think he sees as 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.369
 commander to the commander of the tg of 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.979
 ass has nothing get lucky once in 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.380
 when but to him and can not enlarge a 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.479
 and minimize the time after 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.759
 of conversations is an internal matter 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.189
 dirty clothes wash at home you know how 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.330
 the press is crazy to create a 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.700
 inch to the side 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.950
 now only the next, I was going to visit 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.930
 note that the aircraft did not think so 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.530
 can not or can not cut ball 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.010
 raised in the area the ball boot access 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.780
 our duty is agent news and 985 and 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.910
 Now we're going to analyze. I'm going to get it. 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.010
 two points to leave first 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.500
 I took culpi he spoke in treachery 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.820
 while bringing an end to a marriage that 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.950
 there is no turning back 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.270
 So this is no turning back, I 'm 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.790
 thinking that the crisis is there 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.190
 two months of salary arrears and now 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.710
 Come and speak in Matthew's betrayal and now 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.830
 I 'm going to give a car to give a 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.650
 Suggested by levir culpi levir culpi one 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.750
 time the magician landmarks rock landmarks rock no 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.030
 was well on the athletic was borrowed 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.830
 to America and it worked out well 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.290
 we're being sideways there if you 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.130
 want to give a punishment is have to drag 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.010
 queen mary to send the dog over 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.560
 I speak on the second now the rock one 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.420
 baita lateral has played a lot of ball where 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.670
 He missed a few passes but excelled in 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.530
 will and determination is the best 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.750
 right side of Brazil thinking about 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.700
 avoid of talking that kind of 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.200
 thing is the third company is not place 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.330
 to stay arguing that none of the 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.670
 company that is not exact and three games that 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.830
 do not win two wins a side from there and 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.480
 throw a grenade two losses in two 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.510
 games that do not win three games three 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.630
 games were two wins and even three 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.630
 games and 12 goals until then
