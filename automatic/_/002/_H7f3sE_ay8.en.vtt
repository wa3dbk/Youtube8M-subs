if<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.340> was<00:00:50.460> me<00:00:50.730> or<00:00:50.969> John<00:00:51.449> dog<00:00:51.750> who<00:00:51.960> actually

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
if it was me or John dog who actually

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.689 
if it was me or John dog who actually
came<00:00:52.350> up<00:00:52.410> with<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> idea<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.129> doing<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
came up with the idea of doing the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.660 
came up with the idea of doing the
cylinder<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.629> actually<00:00:54.960> rotated<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.920> wire

that went through the center of the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.860 
that went through the center of the
balls<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.149> would<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:00.539> make<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
balls that would actually make the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.969 
balls that would actually make the
imitation<00:01:01.260> dictating<00:01:01.920> membrane<00:01:02.280> link<00:01:03.979> these

imitation dictating membrane link these

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.429 
imitation dictating membrane link these
are<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.640> number<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.750> little<00:01:07.260> guys<00:01:07.409> that

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
are a number of the little guys that

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.080 
are a number of the little guys that
would<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> attack<00:01:08.430> from<00:01:08.700> Compsognathus

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
would be the attack from Compsognathus

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.020 
would be the attack from Compsognathus
in<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.840> shot<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.710> were<00:01:10.770> all<00:01:11.010> foam<00:01:11.280> latex<00:01:11.700> on

in the shot they were all foam latex on

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.289 
in the shot they were all foam latex on
a<00:01:12.170> small<00:01:13.170> under<00:01:13.560> structure<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.159> wire<00:01:14.580> again
