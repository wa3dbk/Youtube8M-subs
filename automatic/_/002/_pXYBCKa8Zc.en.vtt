00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:35.540
 from Paris 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.370
 having legal if the hammer you are sure 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.740
 totally hammer the chain that is 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.360
 completely upside down 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:29.530
 the guys they are there they are stupid on 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.520
 plays on resident evil the first of the name 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:38.600
 the one that made the fury and that of angie 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:43.000
 to play when I was tiny and 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.520
 you see this typewriter 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.440
 herself - at the time angel play there and 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.440
 belgians had it's on playstation yes 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.940
 actually and I did not have I had 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:59.330
 no memory card so no 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.660
 opportunity to save no I you 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.890
 I do not tell you the brothel that's at 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.560
 to say that every time I came to 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.440
 the sequence where there were the big 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.959
 green monster that was putting you in a 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.330
 the head and who beheaded you and belgians 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.190
 were good to start all over again 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.950
 zero 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.780
 here is a little anecdote we do not care 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.910
 so I did not take any gilles I took 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.580
 crisis because jill I had I 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.640
 a lot played with it at the time and I 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.170
 know a lot about the scenario while 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.310
 with laughs I know it's a bit more 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.440
 hard because it starts without weapons 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.360
 he just has a knife as you can 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.330
 see it so it's very 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.590
 difficult 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.590
 so I know that in mbaye to a zombie 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:03:01.799
 and can we use its advertised 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.519
 so what is emblem an agreement not 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.519
 the emblem of arms 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.849
 yeah so so I took crisis to the 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.550
 cool 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:26.370
 what is the emblem of a sword 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:32.730
 through the lock of a sword ok so 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:44.970
 we have an emblem examine an emblem 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:54.120
 of what but they do not say the emblem 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:55.920
 I do not think she would have 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.769
 with gilles we like gun at the beginning 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.370
 it's easier to run the 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:08.069
 zombie who has the punch that the cameras 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.600
 will make me crazy hockey and also the 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.330
 moves it's necessary to get used again 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.760
 a little bit at the camera management and he 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.150
 must change direction 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.820
 so we go there so I'll burrow 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.109
 a cinematic that will happen 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.109
 since I know the trick 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.950
 so I know that with a knife 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:49.690
 it's hot to kill a zombie I'm going 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:51.100
 try to search the guy this is the 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.090
 cassette that belonged to cannes is it 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.170
 I would have to put the score for 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:05:00.840
 view the body in the canal and 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.840
 was over the throat ok 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.240
 now I will bring you here 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.640
 to try to go to the room of 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.800
 background 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.260
 better informed or wesker ok we will 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.120
 see them esker now that we have the 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.910
 cassette it does not care a bit a 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:24.750
 small zoom by you stay where you are 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:29.670
 we are going to do our business we are going 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:32.880
 see them wesker for more 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.890
 adventure see what he tells us and the 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.440
 famous sequences with doors on 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:42.090
 true we will open many doors 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:45.680
 but that's what's good then me this 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.680
 that I love 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.090
 yeah guys 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.849
 put all alone my guy you're all 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.849
 only you are in the shit 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.180
 you understand why it was not necessary 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.180
 kill him with the knife or the other 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.990
 should not try because we have a 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.090
 colt but we like gun now 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:23.300
 this is what has been badly examined for 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:25.930
 see that of the stars many times the 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:32.289
 knife is not used for anything except 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:32.289
 apart from the team and 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.900
 but what is george the team is frozen 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:43.490
 unfastened but where 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:45.919
 so I moan the game in mode by mode 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.840
 so easy to hit with a knife 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:51.770
 it's longer to kill and so it's 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.810
 hot listen I'll leave you here 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.730
 I wanted to just any 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.460
 first video for it to be posted 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.960
 today is taken away that it takes 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.500
 time with upload so she will not 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.780
 last long 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.630
 on the other hand we find ourselves the same for 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.730
 following there will be episodes of 15 to 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:11.030
 20 minutes everyday and it will be a 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:13.640
 let's play the xplay hammer where there will be 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:17.740
 delirium of fear and bullshit 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.740
 our three guys tomorrow
