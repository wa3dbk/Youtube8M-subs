00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.250
 hello everyone and welcome to retro 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.590
 well we have some more data 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.210
 about cherne so freedom today it seems 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.590
 be that the colo colo magazine would like 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.570
 you know a Japanese magazine that 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.490
 always gives new news about 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.529
 new generations of pokemon and others and 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.329
 has shown the new trees of the 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.890
 pokémon legendarios de serna silver tal 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.079
 as I said and has also revealed the 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.460
 height and the weight of them here 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.470
 you have the image of budding the tree 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.690
 officer tell us that it's hernias measured a 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.399
 total of 3 meters and weighs a total of 215 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.950
 kilos I have compared it with other few in 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.350
 three generations and good are so high 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.210
 As long as you want, it's as long as you want and 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.010
 it weighs as much as lucy as you see this 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.600
 is a pokémon that is not at all short and 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.249
 It also has to be said that by weighing more 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.410
 of 200 clients who have many lives 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.300
 with a low kick since the attacks of 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.289
 weight like low kick jr shot when 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.879
 a little bit begins more than 200 200 kilos 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.019
 has a percentage per year of 120 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.489
 hundred I know we will take one 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.289
 bestiality of damage with these attacks 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.150
 that happens to him because he's fat, he looks at what 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.770
 has done 200 not have been so for having 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.030
 I would like to comment on the diet 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.470
 artwork that has been shown here in the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.820
 image as you see the truth is that what 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.620
 I find quite different from what 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.210
 shown in the video in the trailer 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.440
 it seems different because we have not seem 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.330
 that go to the same be more 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.160
 I do not know how we have it, I just say 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.360
 that do not look like anything I liked more 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.340
 the trailer but hey now 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.440
 now that we are going to have a game and so on 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.570
 to be able to compare it well as scenes 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.130
 in the video game well over and ventral 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.770
 It also has to be said that it weighs a lot 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.990
 203 kilos weighs a little less 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.610
 that gm more than anything because the flyer does not 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.350
 then to be able to fly has to 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.010
 think a little bit about 200 kilos or a 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.110
 little and it gives me a total of 58 meters look 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.690
 we go almost twice as much as Cherniyas already 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.670
 and see as I just said it weighs 203 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.960
 kilos so the rule of jr shot and 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.030
 of the low kick and still fulfilling 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.680
 but good as we assume that this 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.300
 pokémons was the flying guy there that 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.250
 say that low kick and the bullet 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.300
 takes away a little for being ineffective like that 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.190
 that is foolish to sound that is 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.720
 against him comparing him with other pokemon 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.580
 it's almost as long as luisa and so 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.840
 heavy as to resist the truth is that 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.250
 acquires the official angle yes that has 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.050
 I liked the image a lot, not like in the 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.340
 trailer here I really like the image of 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.290
 freedom I like almost more than that of 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.550
 cherne assemblies officially you have to 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.900
 say that by the color of the words 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.760
 It is so black that they are very much appreciated 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.500
 our image we can almost deduce that 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.750
 this pokemon will be flying in sinister 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.820
 sinister game I believe rather that 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.700
 it will be a sinister but good subscriber 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.590
 that does not say anything because it can not 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.000
 but you've almost certainly been 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.620
 little more elaborate without this is a type 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.660
 I like it a lot but good to see 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.099
 how the thing progresses well at the moment is 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.780
 is the function that is known about 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.730

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.110
