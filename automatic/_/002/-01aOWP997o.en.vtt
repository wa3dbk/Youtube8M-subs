and O'Reilly this morning they said they
could<00:01:00.420> turn<00:01:00.600> rotor<00:01:00.930> there<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.410> turn<00:01:01.590> rotors

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
could turn rotor there you turn rotors

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.230 
could turn rotor there you turn rotors
so<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.300> kick<00:01:03.539> my<00:01:03.690> rotors<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.229> there<00:01:05.240> they're

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
so I kick my rotors in there they're

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.760 
so I kick my rotors in there they're
like<00:01:06.390> oh<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.810> don't<00:01:06.840> turn<00:01:07.200> those<00:01:07.409> kind<00:01:07.710> of

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
like oh we don't turn those kind of

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.230 
like oh we don't turn those kind of
rotors<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.310> don't<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> adapter<00:01:09.000> for

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
rotors we don't have the adapter for

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.270

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
perfect but it's better than nothing at

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.870 
perfect but it's better than nothing at
this<00:02:14.880> point<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.270> time

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
can get a socket that will fit on there

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.490 
can get a socket that will fit on there
just<00:05:06.030> like<00:05:06.630> that<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:09.780> what<00:05:10.080> you<00:05:10.169> got<00:05:10.320> he's
