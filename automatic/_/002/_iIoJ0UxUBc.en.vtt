00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
up what level of pickaxe can break up

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.990 
up what level of pickaxe can break up
this<00:00:09.840> block<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:11.010> we're<00:00:11.130> going<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.309> go<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.429> item

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
this block so we're going to go to item

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.509 
this block so we're going to go to item
pickaxe<00:00:12.559> it's<00:00:13.559> right<00:00:13.710> there<00:00:13.769> double<00:00:14.309> click<00:00:14.370> on

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
that i forgot to say before is that when

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.090 
that i forgot to say before is that when
you<00:01:24.240> were<00:01:24.330> making<00:01:24.450> your<00:01:24.750> class<00:01:25.049> name<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.560> has

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you were making your class name it has

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.340 
you were making your class name it has
to<00:01:26.310> start<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.640> mod<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> score<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.259> it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
to start with mod on the score so it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.730 
to start with mod on the score so it
could<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.680> modern<00:01:29.579> score<00:01:29.939> AAA<00:01:30.619> but<00:01:31.619> it

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
could be like modern score AAA but it

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.649 
could be like modern score AAA but it
has<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.009> start<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.700> mod<00:01:33.030> underscore

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
has to start with mod underscore

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.429 
has to start with mod underscore
otherwise<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.170> will<00:01:34.229> not<00:01:34.290> work<00:01:34.970> all<00:01:35.970> right<00:01:36.439> now

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
otherwise it will not work all right now

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.039 
otherwise it will not work all right now
that<00:01:37.579> said<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.820> now<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.360> need<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> go<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:40.020> our
