00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
 then for example right now what 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.109
 let's see in this introductory video 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.960
 to finish is to administer the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.630
 adapter or place an ip thinking about 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.070
 This will be a server other than 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.740
 dns server domain controller 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.980
 any then you have to have in 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.460
 account the topic of good practices a 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.609
 good practice means performing from a 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.820
 way that will bring me advantages I do not 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.740
 will bring thinking about the networking part 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.829
 this much 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.530
 corrective support the idea is to be 0 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.780
 corrective support later but good is 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.460
 an issue such as security not 100% 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.190
 it is not fulfilled but in him that is 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.460
 looking for not with good practices 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:53.400
 well for example I will not place here 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:59.339
 one ip 192 points 168 points 2.2 per 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.730
 example 192.176 point 1 as door of 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.590
 link 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.590
 if it was a domain controller 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.060
 suppose we are going to place the mini p in 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.430
 the server dns 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.979
 and for example here I'm going to place 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.710
 talking about good practice if it's 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.600
 I'm going to have a domain I'm not going to 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.600
 want to make a this 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.490
 an implementation of a directory 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.490
 active by a company 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.050
 the local point company for example 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:42.210
 I have to specify the domain here and 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:44.450
 definitely because several this 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.280
 experience in various institutions 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.290
 private, including public, 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.580
 I considered this because supposedly 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.760
 how is domain controller going to 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.920
 recognize but the suffix is ​​important and 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.140
 also a windows service so that 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.540
 have to say here is that good 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.520
 it's going to be installed as a service but it's 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.390
 It is advisable to specify what is here in this 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.760
 case would be the same ip 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.289
 because because we can not 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.390
 give an account at the beginning, not at the beginning 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.300
 We can have 30 100 200 clients but 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.280
 what happens if it's 2,500 thousand or when it goes 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.800
 have scalability of the company and 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.000
 have to endure or have to dock 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.440
 and adapt to larger users 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.930
 they are major clients in this case 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.000
 then to do corrective support 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.000
 when an entire infrastructure is already 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.600
 constituted good is it is very difficult 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.069
 to have a 100% effectiveness 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.890
 in this corrective support that's why it's 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.080
 better than you think scalability in 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.110
 security from the beginning before 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.360
 have a lot of corrective support after and 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.050
 probably this fault are the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.050
 services that we can
