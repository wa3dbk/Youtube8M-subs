the<00:01:11.820> problem<00:01:12.210> becomes<00:01:12.300> magnified<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.440> Toyota

the problem becomes magnified for Toyota

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.770 
the problem becomes magnified for Toyota
because<00:01:14.160> it<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.850> recall<00:01:15.180> after<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> other

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
because it is one recall after the other

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.469 
because it is one recall after the other
and<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.530> think<00:01:16.800> that's<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.550> becomes<00:01:18.149> an<00:01:18.240> area

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
and I think that's that becomes an area

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.240 
and I think that's that becomes an area
of<00:01:18.570> concern<00:01:18.720> because<00:01:19.170> if<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.860> repeated

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250
