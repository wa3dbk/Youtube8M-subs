I<00:00:12.480> personally<00:00:13.080> ride<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.969> 20.75<00:00:14.969> it's<00:00:15.839> perfect

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
I personally ride a 20.75 it's perfect

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.160 
I personally ride a 20.75 it's perfect
for<00:00:16.260> me<00:00:16.500> because<00:00:16.529> i<00:00:17.190> ride<00:00:17.550> park<00:00:17.580> dirt<00:00:18.330> Burt<00:00:18.960> and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
for me because i ride park dirt Burt and

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.660 
for me because i ride park dirt Burt and
that's<00:00:19.740> perfect<00:00:20.130> some<00:00:20.279> guys<00:00:20.400> ride<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
that's perfect some guys ride the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.700 
that's perfect some guys ride the
shorter<00:00:20.939> bike<00:00:21.090> which<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.390> 20.5<00:00:21.660> for<00:00:22.289> park<00:00:22.529> it's

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
shorter bike which is 20.5 for park it's

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.710 
shorter bike which is 20.5 for park it's
easier<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.250> for<00:00:24.029> dirt<00:00:24.180> usually<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.570> guys

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
easier and for dirt usually the guys

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.080 
easier and for dirt usually the guys
like<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.930> slightly<00:00:25.439> longer<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.279> got<00:00:26.699> really<00:00:26.910> long

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
like a slightly longer I got really long

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.630 
like a slightly longer I got really long
legs<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.750> ride<00:00:28.710> all<00:00:28.859> those<00:00:28.980> things<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.340> 20

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
legs and I ride all those things so 20

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.070 
legs and I ride all those things so 20
and<00:00:29.760> three-quarters<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.599> perfect

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and three-quarters is the perfect

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.799 
and three-quarters is the perfect
compromise<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.859> also<00:00:32.130> rock<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.090> 8<00:00:33.270> inch<00:00:33.480> bars

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
compromise I also rock the 8 inch bars

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.260 
compromise I also rock the 8 inch bars
with<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.770> right<00:00:35.280> side<00:00:35.460> up<00:00:35.579> stem<00:00:35.850> gives<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.239> a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
with the right side up stem gives you a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.299 
with the right side up stem gives you a
little<00:00:36.420> bit<00:00:36.630> more<00:00:36.809> height<00:00:37.100> especially<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
little bit more height especially on the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.250 
little bit more height especially on the
vert<00:00:38.550> ramp<00:00:38.579> you've<00:00:39.120> got<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> bit<00:00:39.870> more<00:00:40.050> leverage

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
vert ramp you've got a bit more leverage

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.360 
vert ramp you've got a bit more leverage
to<00:00:40.530> pump<00:00:40.770> Forks<00:00:41.460> are<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.360> fit<00:00:43.230> taper<00:00:43.920> Forks

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
to pump Forks are the fit taper Forks

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.029 
to pump Forks are the fit taper Forks
they're<00:00:45.120> super<00:00:45.809> light<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.260> actually<00:00:46.739> think

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
they're super light I actually think

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.819 
they're super light I actually think
they<00:00:47.219> might<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.430> been<00:00:47.550> prototypes<00:00:48.239> that

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
they might have been prototypes that

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.350 
they might have been prototypes that
scrounged<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:49.920> from<00:00:50.160> somewhere<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:51.059> now

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
scrounged up from somewhere but now

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.910 
scrounged up from somewhere but now
everybody's<00:00:51.809> rockin<00:00:52.140> them<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.620> means

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
everybody's rockin them so that means

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.639 
everybody's rockin them so that means
our<00:00:53.010> real<00:00:53.219> good<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.230> profile<00:00:55.230> cranks

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
our real good I have the profile cranks

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.549 
our real good I have the profile cranks
I<00:00:55.739> run<00:00:56.070> 175<00:00:56.910> that's<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.539> nice<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.989> between<00:00:58.320> size

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
I run 175 that's a nice in between size

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.180 
I run 175 that's a nice in between size
as<00:00:59.010> well<00:00:59.210> super<00:01:00.210> short<00:01:00.420> dudes<00:01:00.660> Dale<00:01:00.930> rocca<00:01:01.260> 170

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
as well super short dudes Dale rocca 170

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.660 
as well super short dudes Dale rocca 170
and<00:01:02.840> you<00:01:03.840> know<00:01:03.930> real<00:01:04.260> tall<00:01:04.500> guys<00:01:04.680> will<00:01:04.920> do<00:01:05.309> 180

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and you know real tall guys will do 180

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.600 
and you know real tall guys will do 180
175<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.450> nice<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.840> between<00:01:07.200> compromise<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
175 is nice in between compromise and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.850 
175 is nice in between compromise and
then<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.820> also<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> 30<00:01:09.810> tooth<00:01:10.020> sprocket<00:01:10.380> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
then I also have a 30 tooth sprocket a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.929 
then I also have a 30 tooth sprocket a
run<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> 30<00:01:12.270> 10<00:01:12.540> gear<00:01:12.869> ratio<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.939> around

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
run on the 30 10 gear ratio and around

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.340 
run on the 30 10 gear ratio and around
the<00:01:15.030> 30<00:01:15.180> tooth<00:01:15.420> sprocket<00:01:15.630> because<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.170> like<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
the 30 tooth sprocket because I like the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.039 
the 30 tooth sprocket because I like the
brakes<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.580> chainstay<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.720> gives<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
brakes on the chainstay it gives it a

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.600 
brakes on the chainstay it gives it a
little<00:01:19.170> bit<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.439> room<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.189> chain<00:01:20.580> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
little bit more room for the chain to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.130 
little bit more room for the chain to
clear<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> brakes<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.600> you're<00:01:21.750> changed<00:01:22.049> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
clear the brakes if you're changed a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.990 
clear the brakes if you're changed a
little<00:01:22.530> bit<00:01:22.710> loose<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.040> all<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.340> starts<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> hit

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
little bit loose at all it starts to hit

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.420 
little bit loose at all it starts to hit
the<00:01:24.150> brake<00:01:24.360> brake<00:01:24.930> mounts<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:25.979> run<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the brake brake mounts so I run a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.219 
the brake brake mounts so I run a
slightly<00:01:27.000> bigger<00:01:27.240> sprocket<00:01:27.869> because<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.080> like

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
slightly bigger sprocket because I like

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.050 
slightly bigger sprocket because I like
breaks<00:01:28.530> down<00:01:28.710> there<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.310> ratio<00:01:29.520> works<00:01:29.880> out

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
breaks down there the ratio works out

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.969 
breaks down there the ratio works out
good<00:01:30.210> because<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.840> too<00:01:31.020> easy<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.560> it's

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
good because it's not too easy and it's

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.980 
good because it's not too easy and it's
not<00:01:32.189> too<00:01:32.369> hard<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.820> basically<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
not too hard and that basically the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.859 
not too hard and that basically the
bigger<00:01:34.320> rear<00:01:34.799> sprocket<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.729> harder<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.780> is

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
bigger rear sprocket is the harder it is

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.710 
bigger rear sprocket is the harder it is
pedal<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.640> generate<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.180> lot<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.390> speed

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
pedal so you generate a lot of speed

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.990 
pedal so you generate a lot of speed
without<00:01:39.930> maxing<00:01:40.530> out<00:01:40.619> going<00:01:41.490> pretty<00:01:41.640> fast<00:01:41.820> for

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
without maxing out going pretty fast for

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.149 
without maxing out going pretty fast for
core<00:01:42.390> pipe<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.869> run<00:01:44.329> 36<00:01:45.329> folks<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.860> front<00:01:47.100> in

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
core pipe I run 36 folks in the front in

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.219 
core pipe I run 36 folks in the front in
the<00:01:47.250> rear<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.700> those<00:01:48.540> are<00:01:48.570> regular<00:01:48.960> spokes

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the rear and those are regular spokes

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.190
