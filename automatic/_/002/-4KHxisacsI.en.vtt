00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:09.786
 Here we go! Tamagotchi! 

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:11.446
 Yah-tchi! 

00:00:16.086 --> 00:00:19.016
 Mametchi's surprising new invention ?! 

00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:29.386
 You can do it! Keep it up, big brother! 

00:00:32.686 --> 00:00:34.916
 Our project is a success, Chamametchi! 

00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:38.446
 I knew you could do it, big brother! It is really great! 

00:00:41.746 --> 00:00:44.146
 We really need something incredible this time! 

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:47.486
 Come on, we're going to show our new invention to Memetchi and Kuchipatchi. 

00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:49.286
 Let's show our new invention! 

00:00:49.846 --> 00:00:53.986
 I came up with this while practicing for the interschools science competition! 

00:00:54.016 --> 00:00:56.786
 I was making exercises at tower # 1 ... 

00:00:56.816 --> 00:01:00.316
 and then I thought "there is a better way" and I got this great idea! 

00:01:00.346 --> 00:01:01.916
 That was it in a nutshell. 

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:04.916
 I'm looking forward to it! 

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:06.216
 Me too tchi! 

00:01:06.786 --> 00:01:08.446
 Okay, we'll try. 

00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:12.416
 Wow! 

00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:13.186
 12 x 22 

00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:13.986
 75 x 30 

00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:15.346
 77 x 7 

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:14.686
 50/2 

00:01:15.386 --> 00:01:16.486
 46 - 38 

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:24.416
 It is a machine that prepares the exercises itself! Isn't that cool !? 

00:01:24.446 --> 00:01:26.416
 Yes, isn't that cool ?! 

00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:28.616
 Uh ... yes ... 

00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:32.446
 I prefer a machine that makes snacks-tchi. 

00:01:37.216 --> 00:01:38.416
 It was delicious... 

00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:45.186
 The life of a brilliant inventor is really lonely. 

00:01:46.446 --> 00:01:48.146
 Poor big brother ... 

00:01:57.886 --> 00:02:01.746
 Let's see ... I just have to solder this here ... 

00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:03.846
 Ray! Ray! 

00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:05.486
 Mametchi! 

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:08.786
 What is going on? 

00:02:08.986 --> 00:02:11.146
 Your invention is just super! 

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:12.216
 Huh?!? 

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:16.716
 It can make the most perfect curls I've ever seen! 

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:26.316
 Not only that, but it has also brought me all kinds of things to eat-tchi! 

00:02:26.686 --> 00:02:28.946
 You really are a genius, Mametchi! 

00:02:28.986 --> 00:02:30.746
 Yes, thanks tchi! 

00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:35.346
 I must have programmed it without even noticing it. 

00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:38.846
 It is frightening how much I underestimated myself! 

00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:42.316
 I'm so glad you feel better, big brother!
