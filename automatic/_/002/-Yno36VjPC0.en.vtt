hour<00:01:01.839> left<00:01:02.049> of<00:01:02.260> the<00:01:02.440> vampire<00:01:02.860> Squires

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.040 

didn't<00:01:36.980> see<00:01:37.130> what's<00:01:37.310> going<00:01:37.550> on<00:01:37.640> there<00:01:37.880> but<00:01:38.120> the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
didn't see what's going on there but the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.620 
didn't see what's going on there but the
horizon<00:01:39.680> just<00:01:39.800> drops<00:01:40.160> away<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:41.060> we<00:01:41.300> think<00:01:41.450> this

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
horizon just drops away so we think this

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.600 
horizon just drops away so we think this
is<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.870> the<00:01:42.380> river<00:01:42.590> white<00:01:42.890> hole

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
is the the river white hole

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:52.530 
is the the river white hole
let's<00:01:44.240> go<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:44.480> see<00:01:44.570> what<00:01:44.720> goes<00:01:44.900> on

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.530 

all<00:01:53.080> right<00:01:53.290> here

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
all right here

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.970 
all right here
it<00:01:54.870> was<00:01:54.990> all<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.260> way<00:01:55.350> across<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.800> river

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
it was all the way across the river

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.399 
it was all the way across the river
there's<00:01:56.220> no<00:01:56.340> way

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
there's no way

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.230 
there's no way
looks<00:01:57.830> like<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.040> kind<00:01:58.189> of<00:01:58.340> thing<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.549> fluffy

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
looks like the kind of thing a fluffy

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.880 
looks like the kind of thing a fluffy
liner<00:01:59.450> flow<00:01:59.810> you<00:02:00.020> might<00:02:00.170> kill<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.380> bunch<00:02:00.619> in<00:02:00.799> the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
liner flow you might kill a bunch in the

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.060 
liner flow you might kill a bunch in the
middle

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
middle

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.599 
middle
but<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.250> powder<00:02:02.490> board<00:02:02.730> is<00:02:03.030> here

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
but the powder board is here

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.359 
but the powder board is here
almost<00:02:04.090> certainly<00:02:04.420> gonna<00:02:04.659> get<00:02:04.869> sent<00:02:05.140> over

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.249 

blew<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.819> out<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> rough

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
blew it out of the rough

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.630 
blew it out of the rough
you<00:02:10.649> know<00:02:10.769> research

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
you know research

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.910 
you know research
there's<00:02:13.210> another<00:02:13.510> one<00:02:13.780> right<00:02:13.990> below<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:14.770> if

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
there's another one right below it so if

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.000 
there's another one right below it so if
you're<00:02:15.100> swimming<00:02:15.520> texture<00:02:15.880> borders<00:02:16.090> really

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
you're swimming texture borders really

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.250 
you're swimming texture borders really
so<00:02:18.159> basically<00:02:18.670> people<00:02:19.120> making<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.480> ballers<00:02:19.870> I

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
so basically people making the ballers I

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:56.590 
so basically people making the ballers I
am<00:02:20.530> that's<00:02:21.189> not<00:02:21.459> worth<00:02:21.760> it

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.830 

a<00:02:56.740> little<00:02:57.740> relaxation<00:02:58.270> we<00:02:59.270> just<00:02:59.510> gave<00:02:59.690> her

a little relaxation we just gave her

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.740 
a little relaxation we just gave her
some<00:02:59.900> beans<00:03:00.320> for<00:03:00.560> 15<00:03:01.430> kliks<00:03:01.820> or<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:02.240> the

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
some beans for 15 kliks or so the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.990 
some beans for 15 kliks or so the
high-pressure<00:03:03.200> rolled<00:03:03.620> in

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.460

traveled 175 kilometers down the river
my<00:03:23.530> body<00:03:23.740> feels<00:03:24.010> three<00:03:24.310> words<00:03:24.610> so<00:03:25.300> we<00:03:25.900> went<00:03:26.110> to

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
have gone up for the vamps because we

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.900
