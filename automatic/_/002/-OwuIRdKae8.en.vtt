different guys we have we have planned
packages<00:00:37.780> and<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.860> problem<00:00:39.610> is<00:00:39.760> with<00:00:39.880> them

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
packages and the problem is with them

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.430 
packages and the problem is with them
sometimes<00:00:40.540> you<00:00:40.719> really<00:00:40.870> don't<00:00:41.140> know<00:00:41.260> what

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
sometimes you really don't know what

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.780 
sometimes you really don't know what
they're<00:00:41.590> going<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:41.800> look<00:00:41.920> like<00:00:41.980> inside<00:00:42.550> of<00:00:42.700> a

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
they're going to look like inside of a

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.420 
they're going to look like inside of a
tank<00:00:42.969> you<00:00:43.239> know<00:00:43.360> you<00:00:43.420> have<00:00:43.660> really<00:00:43.989> no<00:00:44.170> idea

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
tank you know you have really no idea

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.740 
tank you know you have really no idea
it's<00:00:45.430> just<00:00:45.550> kind<00:00:45.760> of<00:00:45.820> hard<00:00:45.879> to<00:00:46.090> imagine<00:00:46.360> so

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
it's just kind of hard to imagine so

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.389 
it's just kind of hard to imagine so
what<00:00:46.899> ideas<00:00:47.230> I<00:00:47.350> went<00:00:47.530> ahead<00:00:47.590> and<00:00:47.739> took<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.070> mr.

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
what ideas I went ahead and took the mr.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.470 
what ideas I went ahead and took the mr.
mom<00:00:48.610> tanks<00:00:49.090> nano<00:00:49.570> package<00:00:50.110> tank<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.760> just<00:00:52.300> you

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
mom tanks nano package tank and just you

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.240 
mom tanks nano package tank and just you
know<00:00:52.539> escape<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.110> tank<00:00:53.350> with<00:00:53.559> it<00:00:53.739> and<00:00:54.070> then

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
know escape the tank with it and then

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.580 
know escape the tank with it and then
see<00:00:54.460> what<00:00:54.610> happened<00:00:55.059> and<00:00:55.210> see<00:00:56.079> if<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.289> have<00:00:56.440> to

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
see what happened and see if I have to

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.020 
see what happened and see if I have to
make<00:00:56.710> adjustments<00:00:56.890> or<00:00:57.460> now<00:00:57.579> but<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:57.850> actually

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
make adjustments or now but I actually

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.939 
make adjustments or now but I actually
think<00:00:58.360> that<00:00:58.629> it's<00:00:58.809> a<00:00:58.899> decent<00:00:59.350> package<00:00:59.800> and

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
think that it's a decent package and

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.790 
think that it's a decent package and
I'll<00:01:00.039> tell<00:01:00.219> you<00:01:00.280> why<00:01:00.399> it<00:01:00.579> says<00:01:00.820> first<00:01:01.510> off<00:01:01.800> i'm

grassy stuff is here in the bath
it's<00:02:18.430> usually<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.000> know<00:02:19.150> in<00:02:19.300> bigger<00:02:19.510> tanks

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
it's usually you know in bigger tanks

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.690 
it's usually you know in bigger tanks
it's<00:02:20.140> usually<00:02:20.500> like<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.680> mid<00:02:21.010> ground<00:02:21.310> maybe

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700

even<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.030> foreground<00:02:22.510> plant<00:02:23.010> but<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.250> tank

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
even a foreground plant but in this tank

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.520 
even a foreground plant but in this tank
it's<00:02:25.060> definitely<00:02:25.420> appropriate<00:02:25.990> for<00:02:26.500> a

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
it's definitely appropriate for a

it's definitely appropriate for a
background<00:02:27.130> plants<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.730> we're<00:02:27.850> going<00:02:27.970> to

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
background plants that we're going to

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.930 
background plants that we're going to
roll<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.360> narrow<00:02:28.570> leaf<00:02:28.840> sad<00:02:29.340> we<00:02:30.340> got<00:02:30.520> Dwarfs

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
roll the narrow leaf sad we got Dwarfs

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.970 
roll the narrow leaf sad we got Dwarfs
algae<00:02:31.360> over<00:02:31.570> here<00:02:31.780> that<00:02:31.960> I<00:02:32.080> incorporated<00:02:32.740> on

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
algae over here that I incorporated on

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.400 
algae over here that I incorporated on
this<00:02:33.190> side<00:02:33.460> and<00:02:33.730> then<00:02:34.570> right<00:02:34.840> in<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.140> middle

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
this side and then right in the middle

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.530 
this side and then right in the middle
to<00:02:35.680> break<00:02:36.250> out<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.640> two<00:02:36.820> rocks<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.390> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
to break out the two rocks is the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.540 
to break out the two rocks is the
ammonia<00:02:37.870> Graciella<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:38.920> you're<00:02:39.190> going<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.400> get

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
ammonia Graciella so you're going to get

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.250 
ammonia Graciella so you're going to get
