00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
the cookie sheet because I want to the

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.830 
the cookie sheet because I want to the
pool<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:28.980> put<00:02:29.129> them<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.840> countertop

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
pool and just put them on the countertop

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.520 
pool and just put them on the countertop
here<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.349> going<00:02:31.650> fine<00:02:32.840> let<00:02:33.840> me<00:02:33.930> pull<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
here is going fine let me pull the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.140 
here is going fine let me pull the
silicon<00:02:35.250> pan<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:35.700> don't<00:02:35.730> have<00:02:35.909> to<00:02:36.000> worry

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
silicon pan you don't have to worry

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.539 
silicon pan you don't have to worry
about<00:02:36.180> as<00:02:36.690> much<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.250> don't<00:02:38.340> need<00:02:38.519> a

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
about as much that you don't need a

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:39.860 
about as much that you don't need a
cooling<00:02:38.790> rack<00:02:38.909> battle<00:02:39.360> works<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:39.720> much

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
cooling rack battle works so much

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.740 
cooling rack battle works so much
because<00:02:40.230> antenna<00:02:41.069> gets<00:02:41.280> hot<00:02:41.579> for<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.480> cools

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
because antenna gets hot for it cools

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.420 
because antenna gets hot for it cools
faster<00:02:42.959> actually<00:02:43.640> never<00:02:44.810> know<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.409> when<00:02:46.739> it

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
faster actually never know and when it

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.280 
faster actually never know and when it
comes<00:02:47.640> time<00:02:47.909> to<00:02:47.970> remove<00:02:50.780> all<00:02:51.780> right<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
comes time to remove all right so the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.349 
comes time to remove all right so the
muffins<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:52.859> cooled<00:02:53.280> about<00:02:53.579> 20<00:02:53.940> minutes<00:02:54.269> so

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
muffins have cooled about 20 minutes so

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.559 
muffins have cooled about 20 minutes so
it's<00:02:55.370> time<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.640> reckoning<00:02:57.060> let's<00:02:57.299> see<00:02:57.420> how

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
it's time of reckoning let's see how

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.490 
it's time of reckoning let's see how
easy<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.870> come<00:02:58.200> out<00:02:59.750> and<00:03:00.750> great<00:03:01.170> what<00:03:01.379> you're

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
easy to come out and great what you're

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.920 
easy to come out and great what you're
left

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.290 

just<00:03:04.439> like<00:03:04.620> they're<00:03:04.829> just<00:03:04.859> popped<00:03:05.219> right

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.180 

so<00:03:10.840> here<00:03:10.990> we<00:03:11.080> are<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.260> few<00:03:11.350> seconds<00:03:11.830> later<00:03:12.070> a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
so here we are a few seconds later a

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.290 
so here we are a few seconds later a
