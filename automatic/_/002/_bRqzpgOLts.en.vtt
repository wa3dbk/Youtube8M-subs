that<00:01:15.190> little<00:01:15.570> wire<00:01:16.570> harness<00:01:17.050> right<00:01:17.290> here<00:01:22.620> well

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
that little wire harness right here well

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.380 
that little wire harness right here well
I<00:01:23.650> know<00:01:23.860> how<00:01:23.980> to<00:01:24.010> go<00:01:24.220> if<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.400> stock<00:01:24.700> went<00:01:24.970> off<00:01:25.150> I

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
I know how to go if the stock went off I

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.060 
I know how to go if the stock went off I
wanted<00:01:25.540> to<00:01:25.600> do<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.810> little<00:01:26.020> side-by-side<00:01:26.830> here

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
wanted to do a little side-by-side here

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.680 
wanted to do a little side-by-side here
for<00:01:27.340> you<00:01:27.430> guys<00:01:30.930> yeah<00:01:31.930> obviously<00:01:33.390> got<00:01:34.390> two

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
for you guys yeah obviously got two

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.690 
for you guys yeah obviously got two
extra<00:01:35.020> LEDs<00:01:35.620> here<00:01:35.950> on<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.750> Moto<00:01:37.750> dynamic<00:01:38.410> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
extra LEDs here on the Moto dynamic a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.810 
extra LEDs here on the Moto dynamic a
little<00:01:39.700> bit<00:01:39.850> different<00:01:40.300> of<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:40.600> sequence<00:01:41.080> I

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
little bit different of a sequence I

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.040 
little bit different of a sequence I
think<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:42.910> looks<00:01:43.090> much<00:01:43.270> nicer<00:01:43.510> we'll<00:01:43.840> see<00:01:43.990> how

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
think it looks much nicer we'll see how

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.600 
think it looks much nicer we'll see how
it<00:01:44.200> looks<00:01:44.350> once<00:01:44.530> it's<00:01:44.680> on<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:44.920> bike<00:01:45.070> though

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.469 

alright<00:01:48.610> and<00:01:48.729> then<00:01:48.820> you<00:01:48.880> gotta<00:01:49.030> get<00:01:49.180> all<00:01:49.330> your

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
alright and then you gotta get all your

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.070 
alright and then you gotta get all your
wiring<00:01:49.720> here<00:01:50.229> out<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.619> this<00:01:50.770> little<00:01:51.010> bootie

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
wiring here out of this little bootie

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.570 
wiring here out of this little bootie
mine's<00:01:53.080> got<00:01:53.290> a<00:01:53.350> lot<00:01:53.530> of<00:01:53.560> extra<00:01:53.860> connectors<00:01:54.430> in

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
mine's got a lot of extra connectors in

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.370 
mine's got a lot of extra connectors in
it<00:01:54.729> because<00:01:55.000> as<00:01:55.180> you<00:01:55.300> see<00:01:55.479> here<00:01:55.750> I've<00:01:55.869> got<00:01:55.900> this

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.920 

eliminator<00:01:59.380> kit<00:01:59.680> on<00:01:59.860> here<00:02:00.250> I<00:02:01.150> didn't<00:02:01.600> like<00:02:01.750> the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
eliminator kit on here I didn't like the

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.950 
eliminator kit on here I didn't like the
way<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.200> stock<00:02:03.180> taillights<00:02:04.180> stuck<00:02:04.540> out<00:02:04.750> here

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
way the stock taillights stuck out here

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.940 
way the stock taillights stuck out here
so<00:02:05.170> I<00:02:05.229> put<00:02:05.440> on<00:02:05.560> these<00:02:05.740> little<00:02:06.070> LEDs<00:02:07.950> myself

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
so I put on these little LEDs myself

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.360 
so I put on these little LEDs myself
here<00:02:09.250> they<00:02:10.179> work<00:02:10.390> they're<00:02:10.720> just<00:02:11.190> not<00:02:12.190> very

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
here they work they're just not very

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.470 
here they work they're just not very
bright<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:13.269> definitely<00:02:13.959> not<00:02:14.080> street-legal

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
bright so definitely not street-legal

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.400 
bright so definitely not street-legal
but<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.510> think<00:02:16.840> they'll<00:02:16.959> work<00:02:17.110> pretty<00:02:17.290> well

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
but I think they'll work pretty well

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.160 
but I think they'll work pretty well
here<00:02:17.769> with<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.690> integrated<00:02:19.690> tail<00:02:19.959> light

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
here with the integrated tail light

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.240 
here with the integrated tail light
along<00:02:20.380> with<00:02:20.590> them<00:02:22.920> what's<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:23.980> next<00:02:24.130> thing

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
along with them what's the next thing

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.520 
along with them what's the next thing
you're<00:02:24.459> gonna<00:02:24.550> do<00:02:24.900> attach<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:26.080> here<00:02:26.140> wire

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
you're gonna do attach this here wire

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.650 
you're gonna do attach this here wire
harness<00:02:27.510> that's<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.720> came<00:02:29.110> with<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:31.269> new<00:02:31.450> tail

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
harness that's a came with the new tail

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.820 
harness that's a came with the new tail
light<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.030> got<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:36.090> actually<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:38.680> got

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
light so you got to actually you got

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.560 
light so you got to actually you got
three<00:02:39.190> connectors<00:02:39.760> here<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.000> already<00:02:40.360> pulled

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
three connectors here I already pulled

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.229 
three connectors here I already pulled
the<00:02:41.010> previous<00:02:42.010> wires<00:02:42.220> out<00:02:42.489> this<00:02:42.700> one<00:02:42.910> here

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
the previous wires out this one here

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.380 
the previous wires out this one here
this<00:02:43.510> black<00:02:43.780> one<00:02:44.019> smaller<00:02:44.769> black<00:02:45.040> one<00:02:45.390> that's

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
this black one smaller black one that's

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
see here I got all my wires pushed up

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.200 
see here I got all my wires pushed up
nicely<00:03:23.850> into<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.360> little<00:03:24.510> bootie<00:03:24.870> there<00:03:26.210> you

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
nicely into that little bootie there you

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.110 
nicely into that little bootie there you
can<00:03:27.360> stick<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.720> out<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:28.640> little<00:03:29.640> sick

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
can stick it out a little sick

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.410 
can stick it out a little sick
I<00:03:30.150> think<00:03:31.020> sticking<00:03:31.320> out<00:03:31.470> are<00:03:31.650> these<00:03:32.420> two

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
I think sticking out are these two

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.450 
I think sticking out are these two
little<00:03:33.720> connectors<00:03:34.140> for<00:03:34.410> your<00:03:34.470> turn<00:03:35.040> signals

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
little connectors for your turn signals

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.660 
little connectors for your turn signals
they're<00:03:36.180> going<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.630> connect<00:03:36.960> to<00:03:37.430> these<00:03:38.430> two

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
they're going to connect to these two

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.670 
they're going to connect to these two
wires<00:03:38.880> right<00:03:39.180> here<00:03:39.240> blue<00:03:40.050> and<00:03:40.230> yellow<00:03:40.320> I
