the advantage to making a republic is

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.190 
the advantage to making a republic is
that<00:00:10.260> they<00:00:10.380> create<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.710> huge<00:00:10.769> amount<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.580> income

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
that they create a huge amount of income

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.810 
that they create a huge amount of income
especially<00:00:13.200> once<00:00:13.349> they<00:00:13.500> get<00:00:13.620> going

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
especially once they get going

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.120 
especially once they get going
and<00:00:15.150> once<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.630> if<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.139> have<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.680> example<00:00:16.740> we

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
and once you if you have for example we

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
and once you if you have for example we
have<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> large<00:00:17.940> city<00:00:18.270> taxation<00:00:19.970> so<00:00:20.970> we

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
have a large city taxation so we

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.920 
have a large city taxation so we
actually<00:00:21.510> pull<00:00:21.869> off<00:00:22.910> 35%<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.060> any<00:00:24.330> Republic

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
actually pull off 35% of any Republic

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.230 
actually pull off 35% of any Republic
vassals<00:00:25.500> income<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.430> if<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> vassal

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
vassals income so if we have a vassal

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.450 
vassals income so if we have a vassal
who<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> republic<00:00:28.130> we're<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.310> gonna

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460

they make their money from so you know
if<00:00:51.059> you're<00:00:51.210> scraping<00:00:51.620> 35%<00:00:52.620> off<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.039> what<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
if you're scraping 35% off of what a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.729 
if you're scraping 35% off of what a
republic<00:00:53.699> already<00:00:53.940> makes<00:00:54.440> you<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.590> like

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
republic already makes you can like

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.069 
republic already makes you can like
basically<00:00:55.920> double<00:00:56.520> your<00:00:56.699> kingdom's<00:00:57.059> income

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.110

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
so that's why you can consider everybody

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.520 
so that's why you can consider everybody
sometimes<00:01:03.449> worth<00:01:03.719> considering<00:01:04.290> now

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
sometimes worth considering now

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.710 
sometimes worth considering now
relations<00:01:05.100> wise<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.790> vassal<00:01:06.180> wise<00:01:06.390> that

the danger of having them in like a

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.140 
the danger of having them in like a
connected<00:03:28.560> part<00:03:28.769> of<00:03:28.859> your<00:03:28.980> empire<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.609> that

they're<00:03:30.329> like<00:03:30.599> they're<00:03:30.900> they<00:03:31.260> get<00:03:31.829> really

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
they're like they're they get really

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.640 
they're like they're they get really
easy<00:03:32.370> Cassius<00:03:32.940> belly<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.870> take<00:03:34.019> cities<00:03:34.410> and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
easy Cassius belly to take cities and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.589 
easy Cassius belly to take cities and
then<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.829> take<00:03:34.980> counties<00:03:35.519> within<00:03:35.730> wherever

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
then to take counties within wherever

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.530 
then to take counties within wherever
they've<00:03:36.840> closed<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:39.150> if<00:03:39.269> they<00:03:39.389> have

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
they've closed to so and if they have

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.089 
they've closed to so and if they have
land<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:40.230> know<00:03:40.319> if<00:03:40.379> they<00:03:40.440> can<00:03:40.590> get<00:03:40.650> across<00:03:40.889> by

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
land you know if they can get across by

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.400 
land you know if they can get across by
land<00:03:41.310> then<00:03:41.639> it's<00:03:41.819> a<00:03:41.879> lot<00:03:41.970> easier<00:03:42.359> for<00:03:42.389> them<00:03:42.720> so

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
land then it's a lot easier for them so

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.050 
land then it's a lot easier for them so
for<00:03:43.590> example<00:03:43.980> if<00:03:44.099> like<00:03:44.250> we<00:03:44.400> made<00:03:44.579> a<00:03:44.609> dot<00:03:44.849> a

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
for example if like we made a dot a

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.599 
for example if like we made a dot a
merchant<00:03:45.840> out<00:03:46.109> of<00:03:46.459> Constantinople

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
merchant out of Constantinople

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.990 
merchant out of Constantinople
for<00:03:47.760> example<00:03:48.949> they<00:03:49.949> would<00:03:50.099> easily<00:03:50.489> be<00:03:50.819> able<00:03:50.910> to

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
for example they would easily be able to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.670 
for example they would easily be able to
create<00:03:51.269> trade<00:03:51.660> posts<00:03:52.049> in<00:03:52.139> all<00:03:52.349> of<00:03:52.530> these

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
create trade posts in all of these

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.619 
create trade posts in all of these
nearby<00:03:53.010> cheaply<00:03:53.609> and<00:03:53.819> easily<00:03:53.910> create<00:03:54.269> trade

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
vassal right now and they're actually

this save right now and we're probably
second<00:05:18.330> honestly<00:05:19.290> but<00:05:19.919> I<00:05:19.979> would<00:05:20.280> actually<00:05:20.400> say

and think about I mean we have we have a
monthly<00:06:19.370> balanced<00:06:19.760> income<00:06:20.090> of<00:06:20.210> 53<00:06:20.960> Duckett's

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
monthly balanced income of 53 Duckett's

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.100 
monthly balanced income of 53 Duckett's
a<00:06:21.680> month<00:06:22.120> so<00:06:23.120> that<00:06:23.330> I<00:06:23.360> mean<00:06:23.630> even<00:06:23.810> if<00:06:23.900> it's<00:06:23.990> like

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
a month so that I mean even if it's like

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.420 
a month so that I mean even if it's like
three<00:06:24.350> uneven<00:06:24.650> it's<00:06:24.770> the<00:06:24.860> lower<00:06:25.010> end<00:06:25.250> of<00:06:25.280> that

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
three uneven it's the lower end of that

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.250 
three uneven it's the lower end of that
estimate<00:06:25.700> of<00:06:25.880> mine<00:06:26.000> even<00:06:26.630> if<00:06:26.690> it<00:06:26.810> was<00:06:26.930> only<00:06:27.020> two

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
estimate of mine even if it was only two

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.650 
estimate of mine even if it was only two
hundred<00:06:27.410> that's<00:06:27.740> still<00:06:27.980> quadruple<00:06:28.910> what<00:06:29.510> we

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660 
hundred that's still quadruple what we

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.060 
hundred that's still quadruple what we
make<00:06:29.870> per<00:06:30.110> month<00:06:32.050> so<00:06:33.050> republics<00:06:33.500> basically

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
make per month so republics basically

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.360 
make per month so republics basically
the<00:06:34.400> short<00:06:34.610> the<00:06:35.000> short<00:06:35.030> the<00:06:35.450> TLDR<00:06:35.930> the<00:06:36.530> TL<00:06:36.830> de<00:06:37.070> l

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
the short the short the TLDR the TL de l

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.260

Republic's they can't create King titles
but<00:06:48.410> it<00:06:48.500> doesn't<00:06:48.740> achieve<00:06:48.830> anything<00:06:49.220> for<00:06:49.550> them

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.890 

they<00:06:53.960> are<00:06:54.140> duke<00:06:54.380> level<00:06:54.680> titles<00:06:55.810> but<00:06:56.810> it

they are duke level titles but it

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.940 
they are duke level titles but it
actually<00:06:57.140> doesn't<00:06:57.290> help<00:06:57.500> them<00:06:57.650> to<00:06:57.740> create

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:57.950 
actually doesn't help them to create

actually doesn't help them to create
king<00:06:58.220> level<00:06:58.490> titles<00:07:01.990> but<00:07:02.990> being<00:07:03.230> do<00:07:03.350> global

titles actually helps them in some ways

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.130

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.140 
because they don't have this problem

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.020 
because they don't have this problem
where<00:07:06.350> their<00:07:06.470> vassals<00:07:06.740> like<00:07:07.160> hate<00:07:07.820> them
