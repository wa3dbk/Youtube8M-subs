hi I'm James Ward a Technical Evangelist

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.720 
hi I'm James Ward a Technical Evangelist
for<00:00:03.060> Flex<00:00:03.720> at<00:00:03.899> Adobe<00:00:04.370> so<00:00:05.370> we<00:00:05.490> recently

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
for Flex at Adobe so we recently

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.620 
for Flex at Adobe so we recently
released<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.779> new<00:00:07.109> air<00:00:07.529> launch<00:00:08.340> pad<00:00:08.730> so<00:00:09.540> this

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
released the new air launch pad so this

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.480 
released the new air launch pad so this
is<00:00:09.750> really<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.170> best<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.740> easiest<00:00:10.889> way<00:00:11.460> to

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490

is really the best and easiest way to
get<00:00:11.969> started<00:00:12.330> building<00:00:13.080> desktop

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
get started building desktop

applications<00:00:14.549> with<00:00:14.969> Flex<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.809> air<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.980> I

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
applications with Flex and air so I

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.470 
applications with Flex and air so I
wanted<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.400> give<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> quick<00:00:18.119> walkthrough

wanted to give you a quick walkthrough

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.019 
wanted to give you a quick walkthrough
for<00:00:19.140> how<00:00:19.350> we<00:00:20.130> can<00:00:20.310> actually<00:00:20.460> use<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.970> air

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
for how we can actually use the air

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.750 
for how we can actually use the air
launch<00:00:21.270> pad<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.689> get<00:00:21.810> started<00:00:22.260> building

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
launch pad to get started building

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.450 
launch pad to get started building
applications<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.119> desktop<00:00:25.039> so<00:00:26.039> all<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
applications for the desktop so all you

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.300 
applications for the desktop so all you
have<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.580> do<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.820> go<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.060> labs<00:00:27.619> Adobe<00:00:28.619> comm<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
have to do is go to labs Adobe comm and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.620 
have to do is go to labs Adobe comm and
go<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.300> air<00:00:30.660> launch<00:00:30.990> pad<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:32.120> then<00:00:33.120> just

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
go to the air launch pad and then just

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.870 
go to the air launch pad and then just
download<00:00:33.930> air<00:00:34.530> launch<00:00:34.920> pad<00:00:35.190> what<00:00:35.610> we'll<00:00:35.760> get

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
download air launch pad what we'll get

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.180

install it so let's go ahead and install

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.650 
install it so let's go ahead and install
it<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.879> when<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:42.000> install<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.450> application

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
it so when we install this application

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.279 
it so when we install this application
what<00:00:43.440> we'll<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:44.070> able<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.820> specify<00:00:45.289> some

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
what we'll be able to do is specify some

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.790 
what we'll be able to do is specify some
parameters<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.399> our<00:00:47.480> application<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.800> then

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
parameters for our application and then

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.819 
parameters for our application and then
we<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.100> import<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.640> project<00:00:51.420> into<00:00:51.960> flash

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
we can import that project into flash

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.000 
we can import that project into flash
builder<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.430> then<00:00:53.640> start<00:00:54.000> customizing<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:55.010> so

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
builder and then start customizing it so

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.709 
builder and then start customizing it so
here<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.250> go<00:00:56.370> let's<00:00:56.610> give<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> application<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
here we go let's give the application a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.459 
here we go let's give the application a
name<00:00:57.930> I'll<00:00:58.289> call<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.920> test<00:00:59.190> air<00:00:59.430> app<00:01:00.469> specify

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the air and then just some kind of

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.980 
the air and then just some kind of
common<00:01:29.670> things<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> do<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.869> an

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
common things that you do in an

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.870 
common things that you do in an
application<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.710> easily<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.250> added<00:01:32.369> as<00:01:32.670> well

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
application can easily be added as well

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.380 
application can easily be added as well
so<00:01:33.150> I'll<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.390> add<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.780> an<00:01:34.049> HTML<00:01:34.860> component

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
so I'll just add in an HTML component

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.090 
so I'll just add in an HTML component
then<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.509> hit<00:01:36.720> next<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.439> also<00:01:37.560> create<00:01:37.890> an

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
then I hit next I can also create an

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.980 
then I hit next I can also create an
install<00:01:38.460> bag<00:01:38.700> which<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.150> what<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.420> saw<00:01:39.630> back

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
install bag which is what you saw back

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.350 
install bag which is what you saw back

applications through the web that's an
install<00:01:44.159> badge<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.030> auto<00:01:45.270> generate

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
install badge so we can auto generate

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.319 
install badge so we can auto generate
that<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.409> well<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:47.119> then<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.180> just

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
that for you as well and then I just

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.539 
that for you as well and then I just
specify<00:01:48.689> where<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> want<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.470> create<00:01:49.950> these

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
specify where I want to create these

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.240 
specify where I want to create these
files<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.270> project<00:01:51.810> at<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.799> going<00:01:53.130> into

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
files this project at so it's going into

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.080 
files this project at so it's going into
my<00:01:53.939> IC<00:01:54.750> colon<00:01:55.049> projects<00:01:55.500> file<00:01:56.100> there<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.549> then

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
my IC colon projects file there and then

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.780 
my IC colon projects file there and then
I<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.329> hit<00:01:57.479> generate<00:01:57.810> air<00:01:58.229> project<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> that

project and I just hit finish and so now

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.569 
project and I just hit finish and so now
we've<00:02:33.019> got<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.650> code<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.400> was<00:02:34.519> generated

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
we've got the code that was generated

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.330 
we've got the code that was generated
from<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.480> air<00:02:35.629> launch<00:02:35.900> pad<00:02:36.139> here<00:02:36.439> I<00:02:36.650> can<00:02:37.069> open

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
from the air launch pad here I can open

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.610 
from the air launch pad here I can open
up<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.609> main<00:02:37.790> application<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.810> we'll<00:02:39.439> see

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
up the main application and we'll see

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.339 
up the main application and we'll see
some<00:02:39.919> of<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.250> functionality<00:02:41.150> in<00:02:41.269> here<00:02:41.659> that

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
some of the functionality in here that

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.319 
some of the functionality in here that
I'd<00:02:42.500> specified<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.519> be<00:02:43.549> included<00:02:44.120> like

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
I'd specified to be included like

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.449 
I'd specified to be included like
centering<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.930> application<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:45.919> HTML

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
centering the application and the HTML

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.690 
centering the application and the HTML
control<00:02:46.939> and<00:02:47.810> whatever<00:02:48.200> other<00:02:48.709> options<00:02:49.519> you

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
control and whatever other options you

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.959 
control and whatever other options you
specified<00:02:50.269> would<00:02:50.810> all<00:02:50.930> be<00:02:51.079> here<00:02:51.349> in<00:02:51.949> the<00:02:52.219> this

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:52.969 
specified would all be here in the this

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.869 
specified would all be here in the this
generated<00:02:53.510> source<00:02:53.780> code<00:02:54.019> so<00:02:54.859> now<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.340> can<00:02:55.639> just

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
generated source code so now I can just

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.309 
generated source code so now I can just
run<00:02:56.180> this<00:02:56.359> thing<00:02:56.599> and<00:02:57.819> there<00:02:58.819> we<00:02:58.969> go<00:02:59.209> I<00:02:59.449> should

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
run this thing and there we go I should

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.740 
run this thing and there we go I should
have<00:03:00.560> my<00:03:00.949> application<00:03:01.669> with<00:03:01.969> the<00:03:02.209> HTML

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
have my application with the HTML

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.220 
have my application with the HTML
control<00:03:03.199> and<00:03:04.129> auto<00:03:04.579> centered<00:03:05.230> resizable

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
control and auto centered resizable

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.709 
control and auto centered resizable
everything<00:03:06.709> that<00:03:06.829> I<00:03:06.919> specified<00:03:07.359> so<00:03:08.359> that's<00:03:08.540> it

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:08.719 
everything that I specified so that's it

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.780 
everything that I specified so that's it
then<00:03:09.409> I<00:03:09.439> could<00:03:09.859> go<00:03:09.980> in<00:03:10.069> and<00:03:10.159> customize<00:03:10.430> this

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
then I could go in and customize this

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.089 
then I could go in and customize this
code<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.329> and<00:03:11.719> make<00:03:12.019> it<00:03:12.169> do<00:03:12.349> what<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.620> wanted<00:03:12.949> it

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
code and and make it do what I wanted it

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.089 
code and and make it do what I wanted it
to<00:03:13.219> do<00:03:13.449> that's<00:03:14.449> the<00:03:14.569> air<00:03:14.750> launch<00:03:15.019> pad<00:03:15.290> it's

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
to do that's the air launch pad it's

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.679 
to do that's the air launch pad it's
really<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.790> best<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.209> easiest<00:03:17.269> way<00:03:17.659> to

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
really the the best and easiest way to

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.210 
really the the best and easiest way to
get<00:03:17.930> started<00:03:18.409> building<00:03:18.620> desktop

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
get started building desktop

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.149 
get started building desktop
applications<00:03:19.939> with<00:03:20.239> Flash<00:03:20.780> Builder<00:03:21.019> and<00:03:21.560> air

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.369 
applications with Flash Builder and air
so<00:03:22.819> check<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:23.269> out<00:03:23.359> and<00:03:23.569> let<00:03:23.989> us<00:03:24.019> know<00:03:24.109> what<00:03:24.319> you

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379
