in<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.799> beta<00:00:13.980> stage<00:00:14.070> but<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.120> a

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
in the beta stage but this is a

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.910 
in the beta stage but this is a
significant<00:00:15.990> bypass<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.830> was

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
significant bypass and it was

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.470 
significant bypass and it was
interesting<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.580> thought<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.789> would<00:00:18.210> share

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480

effort<00:00:28.410> into<00:00:28.439> making<00:00:29.070> sure<00:00:29.279> their<00:00:29.609> system<00:00:29.939> is

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
effort into making sure their system is

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.030 
effort into making sure their system is
secure<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.630> always<00:00:30.779> amuses<00:00:31.289> me<00:00:31.320> when<00:00:31.590> such

simple<00:00:32.550> little<00:00:32.820> bypasses<00:00:33.480> can<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.750> found<00:00:34.020> and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
simple little bypasses can be found and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.569

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
simple as making sure rotation lock is

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.700
