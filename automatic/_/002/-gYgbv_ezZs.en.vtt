videos<00:00:03.780> back<00:00:04.470> again<00:00:04.770> more<00:00:05.009> fun<00:00:05.279> with<00:00:05.460> delays

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
videos back again more fun with delays

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.440 
videos back again more fun with delays
week<00:00:06.120> Oh<00:00:06.589> today<00:00:07.589> I'm<00:00:08.099> using<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.880> duel<00:00:09.090> delay

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
week Oh today I'm using the duel delay

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.009 
week Oh today I'm using the duel delay
but<00:00:09.929> I'm<00:00:10.500> getting<00:00:10.889> three<00:00:11.040> delays<00:00:11.309> what<00:00:11.960> how<00:00:12.960> is

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
but I'm getting three delays what how is

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:22.700 
but I'm getting three delays what how is
that<00:00:13.110> possible<00:00:13.610> let's<00:00:14.610> find<00:00:14.790> out

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.529 

I<00:00:24.919> know<00:00:25.919> that<00:00:26.160> some<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.339> you<00:00:26.429> g-system<00:00:27.119> videos

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
I know that some of you g-system videos

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.710 
I know that some of you g-system videos
regulars<00:00:28.109> are<00:00:28.410> saying<00:00:29.369> he's<00:00:30.210> already<00:00:30.480> done<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
regulars are saying he's already done a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.150 
regulars are saying he's already done a
triple<00:00:31.140> delay<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.699> I<00:00:32.730> haven't<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
triple delay not like this I haven't the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.860 
triple delay not like this I haven't the
it's<00:00:35.160> interesting<00:00:35.570> something<00:00:36.570> must<00:00:36.750> have

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
it's interesting something must have

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.380 
it's interesting something must have
changed<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.649> TC<00:00:38.519> must<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:38.970> done<00:00:39.150> something

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
changed a TC must have done something

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.700 
changed a TC must have done something
differently<00:00:39.870> with<00:00:40.140> their<00:00:41.089> most<00:00:42.089> recent

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
differently with their most recent

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.360 
differently with their most recent
firmware<00:00:43.710> update<00:00:44.280> because<00:00:44.970> the<00:00:45.300> detune

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
firmware update because the detune

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.180 
firmware update because the detune
previously<00:00:47.370> had<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> delay<00:00:48.180> time<00:00:48.390> maximum<00:00:48.930> of

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
previously had a delay time maximum of

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.119 
previously had a delay time maximum of
60<00:00:50.190> milliseconds<00:00:50.399> oh<00:00:50.879> not<00:00:51.839> anymore<00:00:52.129> some

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
60 milliseconds oh not anymore some

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.389 
60 milliseconds oh not anymore some
bitch<00:00:53.280> goes<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.670> 350<00:00:54.210> milliseconds<00:00:55.340> let<00:00:56.340> me

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
bitch goes up to 350 milliseconds let me

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.799 
bitch goes up to 350 milliseconds let me
bring<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.699> back<00:00:56.820> down<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.090> 150<00:00:57.510> that's<00:00:57.660> where

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
bring it back down to 150 that's where

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.669 
bring it back down to 150 that's where
I'm<00:00:57.899> using<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.260> today<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.670> what<00:00:59.879> I've<00:01:00.000> done<00:01:00.030> is

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
I'm using it today so what I've done is

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.509 
I'm using it today so what I've done is
I<00:01:01.679> have<00:01:02.449> created<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.510> preset<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.710> using

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
I have created a preset here with using

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.020 
I have created a preset here with using
the<00:01:05.640> dual<00:01:05.789> delay<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.420> top<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.789> delay<00:01:08.789> there

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the dual delay on top of the delay there

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.719 
the dual delay on top of the delay there
with<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.390> detune<00:01:10.289> to<00:01:10.950> create<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> triple<00:01:11.520> delay

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
with the detune to create a triple delay

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.190 
with the detune to create a triple delay
so<00:01:12.330> what<00:01:12.630> you're<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> hear<00:01:12.929> is<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
so what you're going to hear is like a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.649 
so what you're going to hear is like a
tat<00:01:13.470> tat<00:01:13.590> tat<00:01:13.710> tat<00:01:13.860> tat<00:01:14.460> tat<00:01:14.580> tat<00:01:14.729> tat<00:01:14.880> kind<00:01:15.539> of

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
tat tat tat tat tat tat tat tat kind of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.340 
tat tat tat tat tat tat tat tat kind of
sound<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:17.000> it's<00:01:18.000> pretty<00:01:18.720> sweet<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
sound and it's pretty sweet and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.999 
sound and it's pretty sweet and
very<00:01:20.009> unique<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.610> am<00:01:21.390> using<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.500> dual<00:01:22.649> delay<00:01:22.860> as

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
very unique I am using the dual delay as

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.910 
very unique I am using the dual delay as
I<00:01:23.100> said<00:01:23.310> little<00:01:24.210> detune<00:01:24.450> i'm<00:01:25.350> using<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
I said little detune i'm using the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.480 
I said little detune i'm using the
flanger<00:01:26.550> for<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.540> bit<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:28.490> interesting

tidbits<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.200> let's<00:01:43.560> see<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> first<00:01:43.860> one

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.060 

now<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.660> show<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:01.900> that<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:02.410> can<00:02:02.590> do<00:02:02.800> more

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
now to show you that you can do more

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.160 
now to show you that you can do more
with<00:02:03.250> this<00:02:03.400> than<00:02:03.640> just<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:04.060> ratatat<00:02:04.570> tat<00:02:04.630> kind

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
with this than just the ratatat tat kind

with this than just the ratatat tat kind
of<00:02:05.260> thing<00:02:05.440> I<00:02:05.620> recorded<00:02:06.550> a<00:02:06.670> little<00:02:06.940> thing<00:02:07.120> yeah

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
of thing I recorded a little thing yeah

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.540 
of thing I recorded a little thing yeah
however<00:02:08.560> I<00:02:08.619> know<00:02:08.740> I've<00:02:08.860> done<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.070> before<00:02:09.400> but

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
however I know I've done this before but

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:30.809 
however I know I've done this before but
what<00:02:09.760> the<00:02:10.000> let's<00:02:10.210> do<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.360> again

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.000 

there<00:02:31.819> you<00:02:31.909> go<00:02:32.000> people<00:02:32.379> little<00:02:33.379> triple<00:02:33.769> delay

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
there you go people little triple delay

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.130 
there you go people little triple delay
action<00:02:34.220> with<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:34.549> Nova<00:02:34.849> Drive<00:02:35.030> oh<00:02:35.239> good<00:02:35.840> times

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
action with the Nova Drive oh good times

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.630 
action with the Nova Drive oh good times
and<00:02:37.060> if<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.180> would<00:02:38.299> like<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:39.099> get<00:02:40.099> this<00:02:40.220> preset
