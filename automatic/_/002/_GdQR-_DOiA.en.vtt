00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.110
 we both arrived but it's as deep as and we're not in a car and 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:07.000
 me 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.240
 between the bonds came in because they request power 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:15.490
 i each bonus owns everything well a couple of tables a fiftieth of 30 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.490
 Liliana years the entry of 30 more to come 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.189
 in this point 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.679
 as you can see here once you are about to start the bus you covered a 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.369
 I'm not looking for life 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.019
 everything has been efe 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.019
 and we like it 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.820
 and do not make us do here by car in the morning that's why society 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.320
 in the first one we sleep 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.320
 ap 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.740
 Movistar who need it 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.810
 they are a little taller then they are tense between the legs until well yes 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.010
 that have started 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.420
 and for these hours there are very few tables 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.800
 then ee 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.030
 here we have been playing for a while 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.950
 i 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.560
 and we have left 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.590
 I notice it better so it is interesting we can focus and explain well the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.290
 things 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.570
 which we are then in science 50 percent 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.570
 more or less and those that get interesting 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.310
 well here the obvious food your control over your cessation 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.890
 in emblem against statistics the 1st of the first line left 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.510
 the earthquake 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.510
 so I can see how in the center 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.070
 here it is 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.070
 those are statistics 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.200
 Maron believes how is the number of opponents lose that in one hand add up 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.440
 a useful sun 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.440
 Rodolfo Reyes expressed 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.380
 the second line n the small ski 'foncia' 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.320
 in him with the agency granda dress up 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.040
 in him the soldier and another of the men the fundal of cyber his opponent 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.899
 I with three men working 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.469
 he showed deeply - a 43 29 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.390
 p maybe orchestra that this comedy 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.019
 matsuzaka 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.739
 I highlighted highlighted I highlighted myself 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.739
 Specifically they told us if you are looking for 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.709
 the ball and on the last line after the propositions the 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.709
 cult positioning a tony and only 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:42.509
 So be it 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.379
 and we're still together 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.519
 odom 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.489
 I do not feel that they are giving me 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.599
 said that the government 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.469
 these behaviors 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.469
 another actor john stamos vascas 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:11.490
 without fanfare 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.990
 these are until they start a little miami I would love to leave them all 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.629
 sentenced assembly 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.959
 and skip our initial levels 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.409
 just because 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.769
 montúfar com and 300 chips precisely five in 50 100 I think the fact of rum 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:26.869
 that time 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:29.219
 Pelegrí time out profitable 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.219
 I already counted 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.769
 a shadow not for having a few more chips 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:39.339
 n according to a real change in this last time 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.819
 that I think the average per hour 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.819
 on a background 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.009
 6 santiago 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.329
 yes in theory the tournaments with us 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.179
 efe 

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:58.620
 in the world and he pointed 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.260
 it is only collected in the forum where it is very easy to do nothing 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.319
 health has pointed out things like these I think without compassion 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.489
 with five fas players yes yes 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.260
 the present 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.579
 and as a delegate 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.819
 good that they will be majority for saint are only two which 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:18.809
 a quarter of something of boxing that have visits 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.370
 this profile has learned 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.360
 I've had cd 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.539
 it is not new to scare too new and huascar efe / I hope 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.270
 --do not 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.930
 I want mark as the moon 2 did not come out 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.180
 - chelsea certainly should have liked it 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.860
 by the tricolor squad and such 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.860
 plus one minus 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:51.819
 80 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.669
 they urge with 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.629
 higher but not have two but funnel but for now I never 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:59.789
 can apostle and perfectly 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.919
 in him in olancho 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.059
 co 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:05.219
 there present the official 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.870
 it was not cited 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.210
 the ikea project felt it seems that the planned 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.150
 this sense a little ficus I said unprotected 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.430
 mm 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.520
 the lounge 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.930
 the goal has arrived 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.259
 if we count everything is fine but SMEs 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.999
 if that is very silly 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:30.189
 but he continued 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:33.149
 it seems more that it was perfect but clear to continue with the project also 

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:37.659
 13 we answer player because of course he has no opposition he can not get the 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.129
 maximum match was completed on the river 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:44.150
 ny also has no visitors the bet you are paying for tumbes 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.490
 very high 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.320
 percent and nortino can not sing while any case and with the tunco 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.020
 not to believe 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.020
 for example a little strange 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:02.050
 - the two replaced generals 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.130
 will not go before completing hands crews then and the one that does not 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:07.139
 want 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.139
 those who carry the figurative works von humboldt a robbery with use 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:14.849
 the center has shown forceful 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.129
 and here is his new as speculation because what is said should not be done 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:21.759
 per cent the same eleven 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.930
 90 stop to try to improve your world 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.509
 why 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:30.210
 many times the sky and silver improvements do not improve, because if you win many 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.909
 records 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.539
 but no conversation wins many chips once 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.879
 almost four times I tried peeling 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:42.090
 the dawn channel can survive 3 to the sea four times and win once a lot 

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:45.089
 Well, the truth is that it does not compensate 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.050
 nati tense to subdue children 

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:58.899
 when it was placed soon 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.610
 the fundamental difference between players with two limits 

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:06.569
 means to waste your 50 talent with respect to 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:10.349
 and a lot 5 19 

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:14.769
 percent at low levels people have no idea 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.399
 in direct mind if that's crazy 

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:19.680
 the high limits 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.289
 in the agent she 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:23.469
 It is much clearer than our country 

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:27.029
 percent and it's people who are already pretty good regular people 

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:33.489
 ny the good thing people play badly is not because they have absolutely no idea 

00:07:33.489 --> 00:07:36.430
 like many people low levels 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.970
 per hundred but simple data that have some link raúl and quite strong not 

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.279
 the basic concepts are well understood 

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:44.990
 as 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.550
 they do not stop 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.830
 percent like 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.580
 when I put the rivals in that nation of the country n when nation position 

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.409
 it will not be 

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:59.979
 0 but good in the hill these things because they have some important
