00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.760
 for all those who want 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.019
 sculpt their bodies whether body 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.000
 professional builder or a gentleman 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.470
 everyone electro can be used to 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.610
 three things so first of all it's a 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.080
 additional training 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.300
 so we will be able to introduce in 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.770
 training is also a program 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.119
 recovery that will allow to 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.160
 better recover from assimilate 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.710
 training and to limit the risks 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.300
 of body aches and after the third 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.129
 thing in case there are programs 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.780
 anti pain in the style of 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.970
 contractures years in mans style 2-2 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.850
 in the tendinitis style that go 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.550
 allow to relieve of imitating 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.589
 pain following the effort with 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.850
 context will be able to isolated faissault 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.320
 muscular so if I take the example 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.089
 of a quadriceps have the chief card 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.890
 muscular the beam this flight more 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.449
 weak extensive internal so the body 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.219
 builder have a hard time working extensive 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.300
 internally in isolation and thanks to 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.670
 context we will place the electrodes 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.350
 specifically on the vast internal and 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.789
 make it work in isolation 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.079
 compared to the quadriceps 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.580
 so today I'm going to make a 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.920
 hypertrophy work surely vast 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.409
 internal so what is very important 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.180
 it is to place the electrodes 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.159
 so I'm doing well the place and the most 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.950
 close to my internal gesture for 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.360
 recruit that my vast internal so the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.909
 larger electrodes well positioned 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.350
 on this part of the muscle this is the most 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.970
 close possible to the vast internal that I 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.569
 will target here that's very important 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.950
 the small electrodes well placed on the 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:33.429
 drop of water from the vast internal 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.429
 this is then I position 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.360
 with complex without being able to work 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.800
 also in pre fatick in the post fatigue 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.000
 as its name says it's a job 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.860
 which will be done before the exercise 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.730
 Traditional with pea with 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.930
 bars with the machine 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.400
 so we'll do a session of 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.020
 bodybuilding for example the program 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.330
 bodybuilding the body building program 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.610
 that will allow fatigue and musk 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.320
 in electro then we will spend his 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.120
 traditional exercise that the body 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.380
 builder do general is not it 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.550
 allow you to take less weight 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.320
 to say that I take the example of 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.150
 someone doing squats at 200 kg 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.880
 seeing that these muses are already tired we 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.830
 will only take 150 kg so it will limit 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.540
 the risk of injury by having the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.730
 same fatick threshold by having the same 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.560
 threshold of excitability at the level of 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.780
 muscle then the intensity is going to be clean 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.270
 to everyone it will have to be increased in 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.920
 function of his felt so that wants 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.330
 say that for example on a first 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.500
 session we may be starting between 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.270
 40 and 50 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.160
 and then as the session progresses 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.440
 we will go up every 4 5 contraction 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.270
 we will increase the intensity increases and 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.910
 maybe 5.5 each time for 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.710
 maybe up to 60 70 maximum of 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.240
 the intensity on that sitting there and the 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.680
 next session and we'll start 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.970
 between 50 and 60 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.980
 and we will grow Muscat a few years 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.290
 further by increasing the intensity in 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.180
 amount up to maybe 80 90 years 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.830
 even more each time it is the goal of the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.310
 game it's going to be going up in intensity 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.950
 intensity 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.170
 hu stimulated and pushed the fiber to 100% 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.970
 another method too that is used 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.650
 it is for example the combined exercise 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.470
 so tried to combine will allow to 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.300
 combine a movement with a session of 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.350
 electrostimulation at the same time it's 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.780
 to say I take the example of 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.400
 extortion young bilek extension we're going 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.830
 do the movement that will be associated 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.300
 with electrostimulation so the purpose of 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.610
 that's recruiting more movies 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.569
 muscle gives an example if by 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.180
 example we do a stimulation of 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.799
 volunteer we will recruit 80 % of the muscle 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.109
 it's managing very well and thanks to 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.480
 the electro one will come added course which 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.269
 will allow to go up to 90 or even 100 % 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.709
 muscle potential so we add 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.329
 a layer one makes work must 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.120
 harder use we are more extreme 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:37.310
 in the effort so it's more effective 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.810
 so what's important is actually 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.709
 a specific type of session like that 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.170
 it's going to have to actually 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.209
 mentally go to the maximum it wants 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.579
 to say even if one has the impression that this 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.659
 tax is really deeply my 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.069
 impression we can not hurt ourselves 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.150
 it's not possible we can not get 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.280
 hurt actually we'll push to 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.209
 the extreme level of contractions but 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.069
 safely 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.739
 we can not get hurt and the multiplex 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.540
 is stressed to the maximum another method 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.150
 working with comtex in bodybuilding 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.290
 it's going to be post fatigue so a little 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.540
 static as its name indicates this 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.379
 work after training so we 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.150
 does it serve as a training 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.260
 traditional one is no longer the muscle 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.669
 maximum that could do 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.349
 but the limit is going to be the influx 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.060
 nervous at one point we have more than enough 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.379
 the nerve impulse to go listen to the 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.970
 last philippe and this is where 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.829
 context of intervening on a program 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.720
 of bodybuilding is that since the 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.759
 muscle still has some energy but 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.650
 we no longer have the manure wishes could 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.419
 stimulate these girls we go 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.320
 to stimulate the muscle in post fatigue one goes 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.360
 add a layer 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.130
 we will add a training load to 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.720
 the training that there is to be done so 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.490
 once again we go further in 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.229
 training so for a work of 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.680
 pure force there is a method that is 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:45.620
 very effective it's the combination of the 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.639
 complex electro bodybuilding with a 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.870
 eccentric work 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.400
 because the work without tics consists of 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.120
 curb the charge to recruit more 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.889
 muscle fibers 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.349
 so the fact of associating 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.509
 electrostimulation with a job 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:59.659
 eccentric of a let's overcome 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:01.190
 the 100% muscle and increase the 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:04.789
 max power really in its extremes 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.050
 for the exercise of pure force it is necessary 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.490
 well practice makes with 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.270
 framing we can not do that all 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.130
 only 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.950
 you have to be minimum of people 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.990
 means one who manages the complex one that 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.580
 is behind for me seems to be 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.060
 very concentrated and it's not allowed to 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.410
 everybody 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.750
 you must have good potential 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.280
 physical and well trained one of my 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.530
 favorite sessions so and the session in 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.820
 recovery is a session 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.980
 which will allow me to actually be able to 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.800
 better recover for better progress 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.180
 then thanks to this session there actually 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.430
 I will be able to gain time 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.810
 recovery on a sitting that goes a 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.160
 big crisis session of habit but 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.690
 if I will have recovered the jemaye only three 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.770
 days in fact so this allows me 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.650
 to have to actually increase but that at 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.120
 training to be able to segment the 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.230
 workouts differently and may by 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.560
 example do my thighs twice by 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.790
 week really thoroughly so my girlfriend 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.560
 will be useful during the competition phase 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.940
 because it will help to tell the story 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.050
 hue warming up so we will use 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.460
 programs in styles 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.840
 capitalization but some 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.430
 contractions that will allow 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.870
 to save clothes shorter so 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.700
 to congest lemus very quickly 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.690
 which tires a little bit the other of a 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.160
 contest is the long step 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.450
 warm up there to help a lot 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.280
 of energy we are not very strong at this 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.830
 moment there so more we do is short 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.660
 more effective and with a context of 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.000
 vascularization programs we have some 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.890
 very nice muscle collections then 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.970
 what is important when you go 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.080
 stick to the electrodes is to have a 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.360
 dry skin 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.320
 especially do not moisturize do not put 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.670
 anything on the skin for 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.500
 can the electrodes be well 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.360
 stay in contact with the skin and can 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.630
 stick well and hold well throughout 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.630
 of the session
