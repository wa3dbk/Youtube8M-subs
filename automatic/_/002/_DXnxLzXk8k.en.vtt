00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.590
 totally judged with the situation 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.760
 just lost second place and 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.430
 surely 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.460
 in fact the possibility of being a podium 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.560
 paradise as above I do not want to talk to 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.480
 nobody has in fact even issued 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.930
 words to the official television 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.150
 but it is aso and after spending does 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.610
 15 minutes nothing more that of Rodriguez 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.110
 javier pizzolito and cacha rodríguez sus 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.390
 other teammates taking in 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.830
 tell who was your backpacker 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.040
 gonçálves had already been specified 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.020
 in previous stages they were 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.090
 However, the last decision of the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.400
 team I insist 15 minutes ago nothing more 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.890
 was that the other three pilots did not 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.500
 stay and leave and in this way 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.390
 none of the three can tow us 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.320
 or yes then must barreda 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.320
 get some 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.670
 along with the change of existence there 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.590
 who is going to have to come and tow it 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.520
 obviously none of his colleagues 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.620
 team can do it in a way 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.180
 in solidarity with some other competitor but 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.980
 your teammates us from 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.600
 waves as we said javier pizzolito 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.600
 cacha rodríguez dientes rodríguez 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.120
 so 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.320
 now live with desperate sweeping 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.870
 with your official assistance 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.350
 and solve the drawbacks of your 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.370
 motorcycle to get to the top if you do not 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.960
 we arrange ask for help from another partner 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.320
 obviously not of those tips so that 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.640
 help him to stay totally out of 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.920
 some way has to come but 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.290
 surely the assistance truck does not 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.820
 will solve so that you can arrive and 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.860
 will reach at least Valparaíso in the 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.420
 last stage although things pablos 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.530
 schillaci that must be happening in 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.530
 these moments by the head 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.670
 It is more stable 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.560
 trips to the battery is like this 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.560
 Olive collaborating among all 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.310
 what is worth 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.310
 now with 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.980
 so let's do 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.980
 anyway 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.000
 but mental barriers 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.030
 practically there is no other 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.030
 alternative 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.530
 the microphone we are going to try 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.530
 it is impossible 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.260
 we have made yellow 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.590
 it was not mounted by the bike 226 that mass 

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:41.030
 in the way 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.030
 for our next debate what is 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.930
 already connected 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.930
 Of the photos 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.039
 to the next 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.730
 the motorcycle kept her under that annoyance 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.730
 everything very take to the end 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.960
 with the assistance people 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.100
 but never 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.100
 of impotence 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.580
 the decision is to tow 

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:37.030
 one 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.900
 says later 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.449
 hooked on the trailers 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.020
 that's where the chalice is hooked 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.020
 to the tape 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.510
 to carry Latin 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.510
 so it's going to be that way 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:18.660
 traced by the pilot of ktm the pilot 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.660
 Dutch and number 126 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:23.710
 Dutch
