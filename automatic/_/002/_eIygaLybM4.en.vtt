00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.860 
gets pulled in the sprockets as you turn
this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.810> the<00:00:57.899> way<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.320> properly<00:00:58.829> installed

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
this is the way is properly installed

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.399 
this is the way is properly installed
let's<00:01:00.870> turn<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.170> back<00:01:01.350> clockwise<00:01:03.290> to<00:01:04.290> remove

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
let's turn it back clockwise to remove

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.600 
let's turn it back clockwise to remove
this

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610
