00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 the pipeline small life 9 of the pipeline 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.389
 connects in 1617 the capacity of the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.889
 plant is 27 pounds per second 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.219
 the volume that we treat 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.430
 semiannually 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.890
 we are taking one between 9,000 and 10,000 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.800
 cubic meters to the semester is treated in 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.199
 this plant 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.150
 comes to the weight tank also has the 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.789
 pretreatment tank we have other 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.070
 grids that retain solids but the 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.250
 separation between them is smaller already 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.140
 they retain solids of smaller sizes 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.850
 and with the suspended solids that it brings 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.320
 the water are precipitated in the 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.220
 inside the tank we call him 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.230
 to solbes 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.030
 in front of treatment by 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.010
 Decanting reaches a tank 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.320
 clarifier I do not know if they have heard 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:56.760
 talk about him so clarifying 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.650
 it's like 8 although it did show in small 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.650
 is 9 all we have 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.129
 has in operation 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.609
 digestion chamber is the same as 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.640
 washed qualified that is in the chamber of 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:16.649
 solicitation by decantation each channel 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.130
 and doubts send the purifying cells 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.049
 that we have stellar here of the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.719
 digestion chamber the solids that 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.959
 are stirring inside the 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.959
 tank 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:41.970
 by pouring pipes we have six 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.340
 rows of six tubes you every each 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.969
 transit and a vent is made every 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:54.150
 four hours there we send the water and the 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:56.340
 hair we have to put the surface 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.980
 and the water will give us a message 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.170
 dealer that is the same place where 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.990
 the qualified water of the tank 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.619
 Qualified details do not reach the box 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.619
 of delivery people 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.530
 and good 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.080
 the sewage treatment plants we 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.580
 comes to a disinfection area it 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.840
 disinfects with calcium hypochlorite 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.840
 to be sent to a departure station 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.120
 it is sent directly on the cardboard one 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.970
 exit simply nothing else because 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.430
 we want to store water because it is water 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.430
 that's why it's used for irrigation or 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.180
 for another use that you want to give 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.909
 we basically use 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.590
 and it's already sent to the drain right now 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.590
 to give the remembered hospitalizations 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.409
 we clarified in the tour and it appeared 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.409
 we physically have the parts
