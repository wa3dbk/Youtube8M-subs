00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.200
 hello welcome carrera fans 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:14.920
 I want to score a goal today 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:19.510
 new connection tenon of the rail and 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.670
 Digital 143 appeared here one sees 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.800
 have the connection set 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.800
 changed 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.820
 the new compensation rates on the 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.340
 rail box below 100 appear here 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:38.440
 completely one 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.130
 later down here again and said that 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.710
 knee 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:46.170
 the old ones would like to go here now 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.390
 you can connect the tricks 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:57.850
 comprehend 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:01:03.239
 with such small connection part we 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.239
 Just down in the times you go 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.660
 now it's not really 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.840
 apart if not special 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.890
 expensive shakes so go in driving 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.890
 Do not diverge 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.810
 Of course I can change the old ones 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.369
 seemed to connect with the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.479
 nothing seemed to be in itself 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.030
 changed change back together and 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.049
 but it also connects you this time 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.670
 with these share as a china the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.819
 Connecting the new 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.409
 connections did not have at the 219 though 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.960
 I have two new Schinko binder it is 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.289
 not absolutely necessary is now completely 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.689
 normal and hard together and they go 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:06.750
 very hard to get apart down here 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:14.310
 the pins in the other rail 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:16.790
 locked so that 's it then 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.790
 again
