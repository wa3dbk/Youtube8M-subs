00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
 only first I'm doing today 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.680
 around and video sessions cowon j3 grandchildren have because here 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.970
 Years Â«apologizes if the sense come across this amateurishly 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.070
 is it the first time that percent is something like that the doer 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.799
 and maybe he has some tips on how I want that 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.230
 can make better the next time Michi the man's first video for 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.900
 unpack and first impression 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.070
 I had a son before 5 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.050
 4 5 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.540
 which was actually quite good had everything I need not more Bento too 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.980
 very happy with it 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.790
 but sadly misfire by Arthur Moeller is also a reflection of it 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.790
 gave only one sentence did not really help much 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.710
 and percent the time the bats are made quite likely battery 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.480
 broken or something 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.410
 just after the warranty period and now I thought I was coming 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.410
 again really nice and has with this choir and band 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.330
 it's not Apple mainstream percent 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.870
 and around 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.270
 Free design has also convinced me for the actual stage heat iPod 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.740
 her main unneeded topic for all 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.740
 who also wants to shop not just as a help 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.390
 Platter very much read percent 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.510
 on customer reviews this turned out to be very positive 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.220
 but ultimately 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.060
 I still would like to go to the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.580
 So take white sentences 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.810
 Police out 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.350
 also mp3 player could have 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.350
 a right to welfare free range so 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.010
 The protective film I'm doing here now Sautner 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.670
 definitely 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.280
 made entirely of plastic but it lies 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.130
 good in the hand 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.770
 also has none 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.770
 noble appearance so far 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.440
 So it is already at a very high level of processing 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.100
 really okay 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.810
 and 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.299
 ETR second man was right down in the city Roding Tel sense of packaging 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.810
 around 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.670
 8 They stuck in the packaging very high quality so I've heard times 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.209
 You can also use these later as a flower vase so I'll do it 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.959
 Try it out then we probably will 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.219
 good looks 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.819
 mp3-player the EPP have made but also of goblins here Foer Audio 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.079
 Book 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.529
 Petrov's effect 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:34.799
 yes certainly very nice but otherwise the restraint is likely 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.439
 I like of course 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.159
 Earphones that are included are so many say they are solved 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.099
 others say that percent you can actually quite good musicians 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.609
 So I have my own next to this guaranteed better 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.549
 and percent but i can also test it 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.689
 Nice and Jack which again in a second video 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.789
 and sure 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.829
 here little Mark Olson also Boys Playas the ministers 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.069
 Connection for the headphones 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.679
 the failure of his side Gunson should be plump 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:14.819
 after I have fully loaded it later I will turn on for the first time 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.109
 then we already have my loud speaker 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.319
 there strengthened keys 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.319
 around Stock &amp; Play 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.859
 and check if strong and then the track is probably too high and down 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.489
 Trusted 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.269
 yes that was it for now so I'm percent 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.599
 from the player actually 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.209
 you will be satisfied, of course, the price also very high 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.309
 Expectations and 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.369
 Now, however, the affected are but fully and completely fulfilled 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.229
 and 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.979
 yes the next video with a bit longer because I bring them to you 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:50.689
 run and around 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.619
 this the sound quality 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:57.499
 yes thank you four times as much to look and hope you are too 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:59.489
 at the next video now 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.649
 And maybe you still have some suggestions for improvement because of it 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:04.909
 It is absolutely new for me here what I am doing here
