some<00:00:12.389> people<00:00:12.719> argue<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.200> pw<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.889> good

sub<00:00:14.309> machine<00:00:14.610> gun<00:00:14.880> I've<00:00:15.690> got<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:15.929> say<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.350> really

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
sub machine gun I've got to say I really

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.560 
sub machine gun I've got to say I really
really<00:00:16.920> do<00:00:17.070> disagree<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.760> submachine<00:00:18.180> gun

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
really do disagree the submachine gun

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.599 
really do disagree the submachine gun
the<00:00:18.869> pw<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.470> really<00:00:20.160> really<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.490> know

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the pw is really really you know

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.370 
the pw is really really you know
probably<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.600> way<00:00:21.689> maybe<00:00:22.199> i<00:00:22.320> don't

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
probably like the way maybe i don't

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.960 
probably like the way maybe i don't
really<00:00:22.529> like<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.769> way<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.949> plays<00:00:23.250> out<00:00:23.490> you

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
really like the way it plays out you

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.519 
really like the way it plays out you
know<00:00:24.060> i<00:00:24.090> really<00:00:24.300> do<00:00:24.539> think<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.170> best<00:00:25.380> of

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
know i really do think that the best of

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.890 
know i really do think that the best of
machine<00:00:25.830> gun<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.220> scorpion<00:00:26.789> evo<00:00:27.150> or<00:00:27.330> do<00:00:27.869> I

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
machine gun is the scorpion evo or do I

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.990 
machine gun is the scorpion evo or do I
can't<00:00:28.230> argue<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.560> little<00:00:28.740> bit<00:00:28.920> at<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.070> mp7<00:00:29.640> is

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
can't argue a little bit at the mp7 is

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.030 
can't argue a little bit at the mp7 is
also<00:00:30.240> pretty<00:00:30.449> good<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.869> know<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.830> one<00:00:32.009> of

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
also pretty good you know it's one of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.979 
also pretty good you know it's one of
the<00:00:32.189> two<00:00:32.430> submachine<00:00:32.969> guns<00:00:33.120> i<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.480> ID<00:00:33.660> send

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
the two submachine guns i think ID send

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.750 
the two submachine guns i think ID send
the<00:00:34.140> game<00:00:34.290> although<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.160> MP<00:00:35.340> said<00:00:35.489> was<00:00:35.610> one

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
the game although the MP said was one

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.580 
the game although the MP said was one
the<00:00:35.910> first<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:36.329> block<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.899> people<00:00:37.200> might<00:00:37.320> like

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
the first one block so people might like

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.959 
the first one block so people might like
think<00:00:37.890> against<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> good

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
think against it but it's really a good

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.639 
think against it but it's really a good
weapon<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.600> takes<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.020> lot<00:00:40.170> more<00:00:40.200> bullets

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
weapon it just takes a lot more bullets

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.220 
weapon it just takes a lot more bullets
to<00:00:40.739> kill<00:00:40.770> someone<00:00:41.160> down<00:00:41.489> scope<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.270> evil<00:00:42.570> now

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
to kill someone down scope and evil now

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.720 
to kill someone down scope and evil now
in<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.410> class<00:00:43.710> sup<00:00:43.950> guys<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.520> see<00:00:44.700> that

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
in this class sup guys you can see that

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.940 
in this class sup guys you can see that
we<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.239> laser<00:00:45.390> sight<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.930> detachment<00:00:46.890> of

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
we have the laser sight as detachment of

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.400 
we have the laser sight as detachment of
the<00:00:47.010> scorpion<00:00:47.489> evo<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:48.809> fast<00:00:49.079> mag<00:00:49.260> as

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the scorpion evo we have fast mag as

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.600 
the scorpion evo we have fast mag as
well<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> reason<00:00:49.860> for<00:00:50.129> laser<00:00:50.309> sides

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
well but the reason for laser sides

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.279 
well but the reason for laser sides
because<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.059> know<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.629> allow<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.899> shoot

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
because you know you can allow to shoot

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.490 
because you know you can allow to shoot
from<00:00:52.559> hip<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:53.399> really<00:00:53.550> accurate<00:00:53.969> yeah

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
from hip really really accurate yeah

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.299 
from hip really really accurate yeah
when<00:00:55.500> you're<00:00:55.590> shooting<00:00:55.739> from<00:00:55.920> him<00:00:56.129> because

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
when you're shooting from him because

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.040 
when you're shooting from him because
you<00:00:56.550> can't<00:00:56.730> scorpion<00:00:57.149> all<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> time<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
you can't scorpion all the time the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.049 
you can't scorpion all the time the
lasers<00:00:58.320> i<00:00:58.410> hope<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:59.059> increasing

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
lasers i hope you to be increasing

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.060 
lasers i hope you to be increasing
increases<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.600> accuracy<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
increases your accuracy going on in the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.529 
increases your accuracy going on in the
chute<00:01:02.340> really<00:01:02.579> well<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.760> know<00:01:03.030> get<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> kill

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
chute really well you know get the kill

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.299 
chute really well you know get the kill
you<00:01:03.660> want<00:01:03.870> kill<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.379> think<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.070> laser

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
you want kill and I think the laser

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.039 
you want kill and I think the laser
sight<00:01:05.549> really<00:01:05.790> really<00:01:05.939> helps<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.299> got

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
sight really really helps with that got

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.390 
sight really really helps with that got
the<00:01:07.110> fast<00:01:07.320> bug<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:07.920> reload<00:01:08.159> really

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the fast bug so you can reload really

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.920 
the fast bug so you can reload really
fast<00:01:08.670> reloading<00:01:09.119> slow<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
fast reloading slow it's one of the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.410 
fast reloading slow it's one of the
things<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.290> normally<00:01:10.830> most<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:12.240> you

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
things that normally most and if you

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.850 
things that normally most and if you
were<00:01:12.540> launched<00:01:12.840> only<00:01:13.140> by<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.470> time<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.770> were

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
were launched only by the time you were

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.260 
were launched only by the time you were
already<00:01:14.070> done<00:01:14.250> already<00:01:14.490> killing<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.970> really

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
already done already killing you really

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.570 
already done already killing you really
