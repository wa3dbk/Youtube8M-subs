00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
something silly um mostly just to cover

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.730 
something silly um mostly just to cover
a<00:00:25.650> very<00:00:25.890> very<00:00:26.220> tiny<00:00:26.490> tiny<00:00:27.240> little<00:00:27.740> change

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
a very very tiny tiny little change

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.620 
a very very tiny tiny little change
that's<00:00:29.160> like<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.640> little<00:00:29.939> too<00:00:30.060> complicated<00:00:30.390> to

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
that's like a little too complicated to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.600 
that's like a little too complicated to
include<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.080> like<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> full<00:00:31.380> part<00:00:31.590> video<00:00:31.710> but

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
include in like a full part video but

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.979 
include in like a full part video but
it's<00:00:33.090> something<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.480> would<00:00:33.540> be<00:00:33.630> beneficial

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
it's something that would be beneficial

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.270 
it's something that would be beneficial
for<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> game<00:00:34.410> overall<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.130> worth

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
for the game overall so it's worth

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.520 
for the game overall so it's worth
covering<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.570> mostly<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:36.989> an<00:00:37.230> excuse

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
covering and it's mostly just an excuse

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.569 
covering and it's mostly just an excuse
for<00:00:37.559> me<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.920> really<00:00:38.129> short<00:00:38.280> video<00:00:38.430> just

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579

for me to do a really short video just
to<00:00:38.820> kind<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> test<00:00:39.180> out<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.540> magical<00:00:39.930> face

game<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.500> stands<00:01:01.770> when<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.550> run<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> game

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
game as it stands when you run the game

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.960 
game as it stands when you run the game
and<00:01:03.470> you<00:01:04.470> fly<00:01:04.680> around<00:01:04.830> little<00:01:05.339> asteroids<00:01:07.970> as

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
and you fly around little asteroids as

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.520 
and you fly around little asteroids as
little<00:01:09.270> asteroid<00:01:09.570> shooting<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.350> shoot

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
little asteroid shooting and you shoot

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.820 
little asteroid shooting and you shoot
all<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> asteroids<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:12.000> blow<00:01:12.210> them<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.479> um

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
all the asteroids you blow them up um

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.830 
all the asteroids you blow them up um
they<00:01:13.830> when<00:01:14.460> they<00:01:14.580> respawn<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:15.240> set<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.509> up<00:01:15.630> so

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
they when they respawn we set it up so

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.100 
they when they respawn we set it up so
that<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.110> asteroids<00:01:16.560> spawn<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.840> spawn<00:01:18.840> away

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that the asteroids spawn and spawn away

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.539 
that the asteroids spawn and spawn away
from<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> player<00:01:19.590> right<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.220> they<00:01:20.369> would

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
from the player right so if they would

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.969 
from the player right so if they would
spawn<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:20.939> top<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> player<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.799> game

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
spawn on top of the player then the game

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.760 
spawn on top of the player then the game
goes<00:01:23.220> into<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> little<00:01:24.119> loop<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.540> says<00:01:25.530> oh

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
goes into like a little loop and says oh

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.060 
goes into like a little loop and says oh
okay<00:01:26.930> while<00:01:27.930> West<00:01:28.439> pointing<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:28.799> top<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
okay while West pointing on top of the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.560 
okay while West pointing on top of the
player<00:01:29.250> spawn<00:01:29.520> somewhere<00:01:29.759> else<00:01:30.030> at<00:01:30.180> random

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
player spawn somewhere else at random

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.969 
player spawn somewhere else at random
and<00:01:30.780> we'll<00:01:30.960> keep<00:01:31.140> doing<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.530> until<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.770> find

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
and we'll keep doing that until I find

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.219 
and we'll keep doing that until I find
somewhere<00:01:32.189> that's<00:01:32.369> not<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.610> player<00:01:32.790> yeah

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
somewhere that's not the player yeah

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.200 
somewhere that's not the player yeah
which<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.590> obviously<00:01:35.310> quite<00:01:35.400> sensible<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.119> you

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
which is obviously quite sensible so you

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.569 
which is obviously quite sensible so you
don't<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.900> stuck<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:38.430> don't

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
don't just like get stuck like you don't

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.859 
don't just like get stuck like you don't
have<00:01:38.670> bastards<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.150> spawn<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.509> top<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.780> you

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
have bastards just spawn on top of you

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.480 
have bastards just spawn on top of you
and<00:01:39.960> kill<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.290> yeah<00:01:40.530> but<00:01:40.979> there's<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> slightly

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
and kill you yeah but there's a slightly

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.800 
and kill you yeah but there's a slightly
better<00:01:41.610> way<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.450> few<00:01:42.479> people

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
better way to do that and a few people

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.450 
better way to do that and a few people
asked<00:01:43.020> about<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.350> how<00:01:43.470> how<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> go<00:01:44.399> about

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
asked about like how how to go about

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.020 
asked about like how how to go about
doing<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.909> um<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:46.590> way<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.250> check<00:01:47.549> to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
doing it um that way is to just check to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.410 
doing it um that way is to just check to
see<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:49.350> distance<00:01:49.860> between<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.970> asteroid

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
see the distance between the asteroid

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.940 
see the distance between the asteroid
and<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.600> player<00:01:51.780> rather<00:01:51.990> than<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.560> saying<00:01:52.740> oh

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
and a player rather than just saying oh

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.280 
and a player rather than just saying oh
are<00:01:53.189> we<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.820> top<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.360> plane<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:55.020> a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
are we like on top of the plane it's a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.569 
are we like on top of the plane it's a
surprise<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.680> really<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> first

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
surprise and really do this the first

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.679 
surprise and really do this the first
time<00:01:56.790> around<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.210> there<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.540> go

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
time around but there you go

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.319 
time around but there you go
so<00:01:58.439> at<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.590> moment<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:58.950> say<00:01:59.130> oh<00:01:59.430> wow<00:02:00.030> we're

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
so at the moment we say oh wow we're

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.170 
so at the moment we say oh wow we're
colliding<00:02:01.040> this<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.310> obj<00:02:02.759> underscore

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
top of the player okay but there is a

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.920 
top of the player okay but there is a
problem<00:02:48.579> with<00:02:48.849> how<00:02:48.970> we<00:02:49.030> set<00:02:49.329> this<00:02:49.450> up<00:02:49.659> because

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
problem with how we set this up because

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.599 
problem with how we set this up because
if<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.260> remember<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.650> smaller<00:02:51.069> asteroids

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
if you remember the smaller asteroids

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.099 
if you remember the smaller asteroids
currently<00:02:51.970> inherit<00:02:52.359> all<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.750> code<00:02:52.930> from

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
currently inherit all of that code from

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.020 
currently inherit all of that code from
the<00:02:53.230> larger<00:02:53.560> asteroid<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.459> at<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.669> moment<00:02:54.790> if

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
the larger asteroid so at the moment if

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.699 
the larger asteroid so at the moment if
I<00:02:55.120> go<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.359> destroy<00:02:55.720> an<00:02:55.840> asteroid<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:56.590> see

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
I go and destroy an asteroid you can see

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.379 
I go and destroy an asteroid you can see
it<00:02:56.799> spawned<00:02:57.129> a<00:02:57.250> little<00:02:57.489> asteroid<00:02:57.849> like<00:02:58.120> miles

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
it spawned a little asteroid like miles

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.629 
it spawned a little asteroid like miles
away<00:02:58.720> like<00:02:58.959> all<00:02:59.109> the<00:02:59.200> way<00:02:59.290> up<00:02:59.409> that<00:02:59.639> we

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
away like all the way up that we

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.220 
away like all the way up that we
obviously<00:03:00.760> don't<00:03:01.150> want<00:03:01.269> that<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.599> happen<00:03:01.750> so

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
obviously don't want that to happen so

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.539 
obviously don't want that to happen so
what<00:03:02.349> we<00:03:02.470> need<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.680> do<00:03:02.769> is<00:03:02.889> just<00:03:03.040> kind<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.250> split

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
what we need to do is just kind of split

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.119 
what we need to do is just kind of split
this<00:03:03.730> code<00:03:03.939> up<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.180> little<00:03:04.389> bit<00:03:04.540> okay<00:03:05.319> so<00:03:05.500> I'm

this code up a little bit okay so I'm

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.949

too close to the player now rather than
just<00:03:49.620> just<00:03:50.620> not<00:03:50.889> spawning<00:03:51.220> directly<00:03:51.699> on<00:03:51.819> top
