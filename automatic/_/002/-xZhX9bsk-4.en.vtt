00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.850
It's the first time that I'm shooting 
in studios that are so laidback.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.160
There's a little patio outside, there's 
a ping-pong table… It's a villa, 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.310
it's not even offices. During the presentation, 
they explained to us that the fact that the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.779
designers are really close, it's a fun atmosphere, 
because they really work together,

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.810
and it shows.
Yes, it's obvious, yes.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.980
So, it's really like its name implies: 
a mix of Kung Fu, because in Rayman

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.670
there's this reference to Kung Fu, in the form 
of slaps. A campy and simplified version of 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.480
Kung Fu. And of course, there's all the jumping, 
hitting, etc., so there's all 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.260
this stuff happening up in 
the air which reminds you of 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.059
Hong Kong cinema. And then, the football 
aspect with the basic idea of making a goal.

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:56.010
I loved it, I really loved it. It's really 
cool, though, I really hope that the tournament

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.129
and stuff and Kung Foot is online because 
that would be really cool to battle people

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:01.850
online.
Yeah, 'cause I think the time trails 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.940
are online, you can compare your times and 
how quickly you can do it, so being able to 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.480
compete like this, it can actually start 
some really strong competition.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.720
Yeah [laughs]
So, the story of Kung Foot...

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.600
The team had just finished Rayman Origins, 
and we were having a end-of-project Rayman

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.260
Origins event - a party with everyone 
having a blast, having a great time. 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.360
And there was a tiny part of the team that started 
developing this game mode, especially for the event.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.770
It's true that the party at the end of a project, 
that's what we're waiting for because we're together

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.600
when we work on a game for one year, a year 
and a half, sometimes two years. And then, well,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.440
in the middle of the party, the dev team pulled 
off a great prank. A total surprise!

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.390
For three, four hours it was packed the whole 
evening. And another surprise: girls play it.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.920
Which, for a team of developers who live 
kind of like monks, is like an 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.990
added  bonus. It's... we get girls to play. 
And so it was great, it was the game that 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.990
made the party. Everything revolved 
around Kung Foot.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.520
It's a blast because, for one thing, it only 
lasts two minutes. Two minutes to make

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.280
as many goals as possible, two minutes to 
smack each other around. Two minutes of 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.140
fun and two minutes of suspense because 
up to the last second, the score can 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.520
really change, really swing the other way.
What's funny is that often people, 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.459
actually if they're going to play Kung Foot,
the first thing they hear is people yelling,

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.390
they hear other people yelling, 
and they wonder what's going on.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.280
And they come over and grab the gamepad 
and they see that it's great fun to play 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.989
and they have a blast.
Everything's over-the-top, jumping in the air,

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.989
 smacking three times while jumping…
It's great, really really nice.  We're four

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.189
French on YouTube here, and so the 
four of us played together earlier. 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.659
And we're having a great time, 
we're really having fun.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.159
It's the ultimate reward. When we make a 
game, we're really doing it for the players.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.280
We do it for everyone who's going to 
be able to have fun with it.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.439
And we, we spent entire evenings, sometimes 
two to three hours playing over and over, 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:51.409
we were sweating. It's Kung Foot, 
it's really a strong point of the game.
