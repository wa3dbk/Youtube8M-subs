00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.400 
cyclin it was a major upgrade to from
old<00:03:24.150> cyclone<00:03:24.570> which<00:03:24.750> was<00:03:24.900> kind<00:03:25.080> of<00:03:25.110> slow<00:03:25.380> and

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
old cyclone which was kind of slow and

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.980 
old cyclone which was kind of slow and
old<00:03:25.770> and<00:03:26.370> sluggish<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:27.150> wicked<00:03:27.480> cyclone<00:03:27.840> which

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
old and sluggish to wicked cyclone which

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.770 
old and sluggish to wicked cyclone which
was<00:03:28.170> really<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.680> well-placed<00:03:29.310> ride<00:03:29.640> I<00:03:29.970> think

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
was really a well-placed ride I think

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.320 
was really a well-placed ride I think
our<00:03:30.900> bigger<00:03:31.230> thing<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.770> is<00:03:31.980> uh<00:03:32.010> what<00:03:32.940> are<00:03:33.180> we

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
our bigger thing is is uh what are we

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.760 
our bigger thing is is uh what are we
going<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.510> call<00:03:33.690> this<00:03:33.870> because<00:03:34.140> I'm<00:03:34.590> not

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
going to call this because I'm not

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.830 
going to call this because I'm not
feeling<00:03:35.130> mega<00:03:35.370> roar<00:03:35.730> I'm<00:03:36.000> not<00:03:36.150> feeling<00:03:36.570> iron

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
feeling mega roar I'm not feeling iron

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.350 
feeling mega roar I'm not feeling iron
roar<00:03:37.400> who<00:03:38.400> knows<00:03:38.580> we're<00:03:38.790> certainly<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.120> lot<00:03:39.210> of

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
roar who knows we're certainly a lot of

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.880 
roar who knows we're certainly a lot of
options<00:03:39.780> but<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:39.960> think<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.260> bigger<00:03:40.470> thing<00:03:40.560> is

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
options but I think the bigger thing is

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.190 
options but I think the bigger thing is
what<00:03:41.070> element<00:03:41.490> is<00:03:41.610> going<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:41.940> have<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:43.050> it

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
what element is going to have is it

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.960 
what element is going to have is it
going<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.470> be<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.800> wicked<00:03:44.130> cyclone<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.700> the

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
going to be the wicked cyclone of the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.580 
going to be the wicked cyclone of the
west<00:03:45.180> coast<00:03:45.510> which<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.900> what<00:03:46.050> some<00:03:46.260> people
