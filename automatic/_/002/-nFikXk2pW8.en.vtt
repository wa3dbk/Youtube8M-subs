00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
I talked about on the BB thing there a

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.270 
I talked about on the BB thing there a
few<00:01:15.890> minutes<00:01:15.979> ago<00:01:17.110> so<00:01:18.110> I'm<00:01:18.740> going<00:01:18.920> to<00:01:19.009> use<00:01:19.130> the

few minutes ago so I'm going to use the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.950 
few minutes ago so I'm going to use the
metronome<00:01:19.579> on<00:01:19.790> two<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.180> four<00:01:20.270> now<00:01:20.689> if<00:01:20.810> you've

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
metronome on two and four now if you've

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.450 
metronome on two and four now if you've
never<00:01:21.140> done<00:01:21.380> this<00:01:21.439> before<00:01:21.740> it<00:01:22.070> takes<00:01:22.219> a<00:01:22.340> little

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
never done this before it takes a little

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.850 
never done this before it takes a little
getting<00:01:22.579> used<00:01:22.969> to<00:01:23.090> because<00:01:23.719> that<00:01:24.020> clique<00:01:24.380> we

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
getting used to because that clique we

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.920 
getting used to because that clique we
tend<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.159> want<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.369> try<00:01:25.549> to<00:01:25.610> hear<00:01:25.850> that<00:01:26.090> as<00:01:26.329> one

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
tend to want to try to hear that as one

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.209 
tend to want to try to hear that as one
two<00:01:27.700> three<00:01:28.810> four<00:01:29.810> when<00:01:30.170> it's<00:01:30.350> not<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.920> say<00:01:31.070> I'm

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
two three four when it's not and say I'm

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.260 
two three four when it's not and say I'm
going<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.490> treat<00:01:31.700> that<00:01:31.850> as<00:01:32.030> one<00:01:32.560> three<00:01:33.700> one<00:01:34.700> two

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
going to treat that as one three one two

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.480 
going to treat that as one three one two
three<00:01:35.840> four<00:01:36.320> so<00:01:36.649> it's<00:01:36.799> as<00:01:36.920> if<00:01:37.039> when<00:01:37.369> you're

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
three four so it's as if when you're

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.099 
three four so it's as if when you're
counting<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.880> tune<00:01:38.060> off<00:01:38.240> you're<00:01:38.420> snapping<00:01:38.689> your

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
counting a tune off you're snapping your

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:41.889 
counting a tune off you're snapping your
fingers<00:01:39.350> between<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:40.039> beats<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.750> like<00:01:41.750> your

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
fingers between the beats and like your

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.899 
fingers between the beats and like your
high<00:01:42.020> school<00:01:42.289> jazz<00:01:42.560> ensemble<00:01:43.430> teacher<00:01:43.609> might

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
high school jazz ensemble teacher might

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.940 
high school jazz ensemble teacher might
have<00:01:44.030> done<00:01:44.180> back<00:01:44.420> in<00:01:44.570> your<00:01:44.719> days<00:01:44.899> back<00:01:45.170> then<00:01:45.200> so

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
have done back in your days back then so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.109 
have done back in your days back then so
we're<00:01:46.039> going<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.219> use<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.369> metronome<00:01:46.729> on<00:01:47.030> two

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
we're going to use a metronome on two

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.789 
we're going to use a metronome on two
and<00:01:47.420> four<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:48.140> it<00:01:48.259> works<00:01:48.409> great<00:01:48.500> on<00:01:48.679> the

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
and four and it works great on the

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.169 
and four and it works great on the
shuffles<00:01:49.189> and<00:01:49.369> as<00:01:49.490> I<00:01:49.579> said<00:01:49.759> earlier<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.090> works

you're going to actually have that as
one<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.690> your<00:02:11.840> playing<00:02:12.050> exercises<00:02:12.830> in<00:02:12.950> this

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
one of your playing exercises in this

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
like this 1 2 1 2 3 4 so just a little

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.770 
like this 1 2 1 2 3 4 so just a little
bit<00:02:54.409> about<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:54.769> baseline<00:02:55.220> I'm<00:02:55.819> playing<00:02:56.690> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
bit about that baseline I'm playing the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.430 
bit about that baseline I'm playing the
notes<00:02:56.989> 1<00:02:57.349> 3<00:02:58.159> 5<00:02:58.879> 6<00:02:59.889> from<00:03:00.889> the<00:03:01.069> G<00:03:01.250> Major<00:03:01.459> scale<00:03:02.440> so

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
notes 1 3 5 6 from the G Major scale so

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.229 
notes 1 3 5 6 from the G Major scale so
that<00:03:03.470> baseline<00:03:04.310> if<00:03:04.430> I<00:03:04.519> was<00:03:04.639> going<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:04.819> describe

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
that baseline if I was going to describe

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.819 
that baseline if I was going to describe
that<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.569> a<00:03:05.599> bass<00:03:05.810> player<00:03:05.989> on<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.349> gig<00:03:06.590> real

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
that to a bass player on the gig real

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.280 
that to a bass player on the gig real
quickly<00:03:07.099> on<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.909> blue<00:03:08.209> jam<00:03:08.450> or<00:03:08.659> something<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:09.049> say

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
quickly on a blue jam or something I say

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.629 
quickly on a blue jam or something I say
it's<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.889> you<00:03:10.280> play<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.549> notes<00:03:10.730> 1<00:03:10.939> 3<00:03:11.239> 5<00:03:11.480> 6<00:03:11.810> and

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
it's it you play the notes 1 3 5 6 and

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.460 
it's it you play the notes 1 3 5 6 and
that<00:03:13.639> would<00:03:13.790> mean<00:03:13.939> you<00:03:14.510> know<00:03:14.599> it<00:03:14.720> works<00:03:14.959> now

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
that would mean you know it works now

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.740 
that would mean you know it works now
one<00:03:15.650> more<00:03:15.799> time<00:03:15.859> on<00:03:16.250> this<00:03:16.340> metronome<00:03:16.879> you've

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
one more time on this metronome you've

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.390 
one more time on this metronome you've
got<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.109> feel<00:03:18.319> in<00:03:18.590> between<00:03:18.950> these<00:03:19.069> beats

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
got to feel in between these beats

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.129 
got to feel in between these beats
because<00:03:19.700> this<00:03:19.939> is<00:03:20.090> 2<00:03:20.209> &amp;<00:03:20.359> 4<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:20.750> you've<00:03:20.870> got<00:03:21.049> to

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
because this is 2 &amp; 4 so you've got to

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.180 
because this is 2 &amp; 4 so you've got to
start<00:03:21.349> counting<00:03:21.769> one<00:03:22.189> two<00:03:23.410> one<00:03:24.410> two<00:03:24.680> three

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
start counting one two one two three

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.680 
start counting one two one two three
four<00:03:25.879> just<00:03:26.299> to<00:03:26.359> get<00:03:26.510> into<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:26.840> couple<00:03:27.650> bars<00:03:28.690> show

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
four just to get into a couple bars show

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.520 
four just to get into a couple bars show
you<00:03:29.750> how<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.109> feels

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
to try practicing with the metronome on

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.229 
to try practicing with the metronome on
two<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.260> four<00:03:39.319> some<00:03:39.799> and<00:03:40.069> we're<00:03:40.879> going<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.150> be

two and four some and we're going to be

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.289 
two and four some and we're going to be
using<00:03:41.419> it<00:03:41.720> on<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.840> number<00:03:42.049> of<00:03:42.230> songs<00:03:42.940> on<00:03:43.940> two<00:03:44.180> and
