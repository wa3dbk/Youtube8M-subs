00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.370
 at the canaries we have three types 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.400
 color canaries which then can be different 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.529
 a color the builders canaries that 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.590
 various sizes going forward 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.490
 and the real singing canaries at the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.010
 parakeets 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.400
 we have the smaller parrot species 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.800
 she budgerigar the slightly larger 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.620
 cockatiels and then we also have 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.620
 for example, the parakeet parakeets 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.510
 most canaries that are kept 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.060
 are the song canaries because they are beautiful 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.490
 whistles are the males that alone 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.230
 but the flute and the females are not among the 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.320
 parakeet behind me are the most loved 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:06.239
 parakeets the budgerigars 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.239
 and the multicolored ah boilies 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.789
 you can keep canaries and parakeets 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.920
 or two ways 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.920
 on the one hand it can be done outside the household 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.659
 or four opportunities in-house code 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.750
 we slide in pieces then you have 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.979
 a nice one where you can see the birds 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.899
 to house 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.939
 the according can of course in the house 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.299
 follow flying around 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.500
 do you have an outside aviary then you have two 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.079
 things needed 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.479
 on the one hand and from flying aviary and 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.310
 on the other hand am also where animals 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.590
 can spend the night 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.049
 in addition, the animals must both enter 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.119
 if outside slide buy a good one 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.849
 food must be provided and they 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.849
 receive fresh drinking water every day 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.170
 here we have a bit of a double 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.509
 revenge 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.670
 canaries and francs in the back 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.500
 usually grain mix and there are 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.849
 different types of grain mixes 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.979
 on the march 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.860
 with parakeets, grain becomes your mix 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.319
 but you better actually 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.610
 do feed it because parakeets 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.700
 grain mix 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.489
 not 100% tip was an order 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.519
 Parakeets party to peel their garages 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.230
 and the calcium in the arrow 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.950
 on the ground are parakeets 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.080
 selective window eaters and those are the ones 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.720
 windows that they prefer to eat 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.010
 and that gives problems on older ones 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.010
 age with the parakeets 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.640
 at the courtyard you have to see for it 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.100
 that the birds are like their people 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.950
 wings can spread such that they 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.200
 the sticks have enough space 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.380
 what they say is best understood 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.910
 different thicknesses so they can go 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.910
 exercise stone muscle 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.630
 canaries and parakeets can then make here 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.030
 by putting them first 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.580
 approach it calmly and you approach them 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.990
 best down the side so that they are u 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.750
 see it coming 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.330
 the tall of bird stand on one side 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.010
 So it is important that it is out of it 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.170
 the side also approached 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.630
 It is also important to keep on talking 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.510
 repeat the same words as you 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.880
 asks come on my hans then give 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.420
 a brief powerful command hans 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.420
 for instance
