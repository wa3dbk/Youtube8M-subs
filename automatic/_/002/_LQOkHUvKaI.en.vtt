usually grouped together there's one by

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.890 
usually grouped together there's one by
the<00:00:20.430> pillars<00:00:20.850> that's<00:00:21.090> kind<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.359> separate<00:00:21.750> and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
the pillars that's kind of separate and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.359 
the pillars that's kind of separate and
the<00:00:21.990> most<00:00:22.170> important<00:00:22.619> one<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> one<00:00:23.189> by<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
the most important one is the one by the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.130 
the most important one is the one by the
pool<00:00:23.699> there's<00:00:24.150> also<00:00:24.269> one<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.660> library<00:00:25.019> but

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
pool there's also one in the library but

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.480 
pool there's also one in the library but
you<00:00:25.230> don't<00:00:25.410> really<00:00:25.500> do<00:00:25.710> whatever<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.189> since

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
you don't really do whatever that since

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.339 
you don't really do whatever that since
we<00:00:26.760> were<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:26.910> there<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.420> hopefully<00:00:27.960> nobody

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
we were in there and hopefully nobody

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.529 
we were in there and hopefully nobody
should<00:00:28.529> spawn<00:00:28.800> there<00:00:29.039> all<00:00:29.189> right<00:00:29.970> moving<00:00:30.359> on

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
should spawn there all right moving on

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.389 
should spawn there all right moving on

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
coming up here is our first learning

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.310 
coming up here is our first learning
opportunity<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.780> two<00:01:00.930> spawns<00:01:01.199> of

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
opportunity the two spawns of

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.049 
opportunity the two spawns of
highlighted<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:01.920> are<00:01:02.039> quite<00:01:02.190> important<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
highlighted here are quite important the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.299 
highlighted here are quite important the
pella<00:01:03.300> spawn<00:01:03.629> will<00:01:04.049> usually<00:01:04.530> run<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.100> left

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
pella spawn will usually run to the left

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.940 
pella spawn will usually run to the left
and<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.610> pool<00:01:06.210> spawn<00:01:06.600> will<00:01:07.049> usually<00:01:07.290> run<00:01:07.710> to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
and the pool spawn will usually run to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.219 
and the pool spawn will usually run to
the<00:01:08.070> left<00:01:08.280> although<00:01:09.030> they<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.450> run<00:01:09.720> down<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the left although they can run down and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.870 
the left although they can run down and
then<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.590> join<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.220> path<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.640> left

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
then can join with the path to the left

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.969 
then can join with the path to the left
as<00:01:12.030> well<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.930> will<00:01:13.049> bear<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.500> mind<00:01:13.530> when

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
as well so will bear that in mind when

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.399 
as well so will bear that in mind when
you're<00:01:14.189> camping<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> library<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.290> it's

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
you're camping in the library so it's

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.539 
you're camping in the library so it's
important<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.830> remember<00:01:17.040> once<00:01:17.310> you've<00:01:17.430> picked

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
important to remember once you've picked

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.920 
important to remember once you've picked
up<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.820> kill<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.240> check<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.689> other<00:01:18.840> side

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
up a kill just to check the other side

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.359 
up a kill just to check the other side
to<00:01:19.259> make<00:01:19.320> sure<00:01:19.500> it'll<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.740> sneaking<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.280> you

maybe<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.970> pillows<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.540> running<00:01:27.780> through

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
maybe a pillows but running through

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.170 
maybe a pillows but running through
pills<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.040> that's<00:01:29.460> why<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.729> important<00:01:30.119> to

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
pills and that's why it's important to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.700 
pills and that's why it's important to
have<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> portable<00:01:30.600> radar<00:01:30.960> its<00:01:31.259> key<00:01:31.439> for<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
have the portable radar its key for the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.520 
have the portable radar its key for the
spot<00:01:32.040> because<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.970> need<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:34.049> pick<00:01:34.170> up<00:01:34.290> all<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
spot because you need to pick up all the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.080 
spot because you need to pick up all the
people<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.979> know<00:01:35.579> which<00:01:35.820> way<00:01:36.030> they're

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
people and to know which way they're

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.210 
people and to know which way they're
going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.450> run<00:01:36.630> even<00:01:36.900> though<00:01:37.350> they<00:01:37.890> won't<00:01:38.100> know

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
going to run even though they won't know

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.859 
going to run even though they won't know
where<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.670> stills<00:01:39.150> next<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> really

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
where you are stills next have a really

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.800 
where you are stills next have a really
good<00:01:39.960> advantage<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.530> them<00:01:40.759> know<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.360> camping

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
good advantage of them know this camping

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.740 
good advantage of them know this camping
spot<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.229> very<00:01:43.649> different<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.509> some<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.630> my

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
spot is very different to some of my

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.080 
spot is very different to some of my
other<00:01:45.930> camping<00:01:46.409> spots<00:01:46.740> which<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.520> get<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> huge

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
other camping spots which you get a huge

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.929 
other camping spots which you get a huge
advantage<00:01:48.210> over<00:01:48.630> people<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.649> kind<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.579> spot

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
advantage over people this kind of spot

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.730 
advantage over people this kind of spot
is<00:01:51.149> more<00:01:52.040> related<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.810> knowing<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.140> area<00:01:55.530> and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
is more related to knowing the area and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.670 
is more related to knowing the area and
walking<00:01:56.670> down<00:01:56.880> an<00:01:57.090> area<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:58.200> being<00:01:58.439> close

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
walking down an area but being close

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.959 
walking down an area but being close
quarters<00:01:59.100> at<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.280> same<00:01:59.430> time<00:01:59.640> so

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
quarters at the same time so

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.819 
quarters at the same time so
unfortunately<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.229> are<00:02:01.439> going<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.710> die

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
unfortunately you are going to die

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.069 
unfortunately you are going to die
tonight<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.219> little<00:02:02.640> bit<00:02:02.759> more<00:02:02.969> if<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.780> don't

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
tonight a little bit more if you don't

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.859 
tonight a little bit more if you don't
move<00:02:04.920> around<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:06.060> I'm<00:02:06.240> though<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.630> know

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
move around like I'm though you know

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.690 
move around like I'm though you know
because<00:02:07.290> if<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.829> don't<00:02:08.009> move<00:02:08.160> around<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
because if you don't move around in the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.729 
because if you don't move around in the
library<00:02:09.149> people<00:02:09.780> will<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.229> head<00:02:10.440> glitch<00:02:10.709> you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
library people will just head glitch you

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.640 
library people will just head glitch you
through<00:02:11.610> these<00:02:11.910> windows<00:02:12.090> when<00:02:12.480> they<00:02:12.599> spawn<00:02:12.900> a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
through these windows when they spawn a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.759 
through these windows when they spawn a
arches<00:02:14.129> and<00:02:14.420> also<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:16.170> won't<00:02:16.319> get<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> lot<00:02:16.739> of

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
arches and also you won't get a lot of

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.589 
arches and also you won't get a lot of
traffic<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.400> if<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.909> just<00:02:18.090> set<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.510> the

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
traffic and if you just set in the

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.030 
traffic and if you just set in the
library<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.140> need<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.409> make<00:02:19.560> use<00:02:19.769> of<00:02:19.799> these

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
library so you need to make use of these

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.069 
library so you need to make use of these
metal<00:02:20.400> corridors<00:02:20.849> because<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.750> middle

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
metal corridors because this middle

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.170 
metal corridors because this middle
corridor<00:02:22.260> isn't<00:02:22.709> used<00:02:22.920> as<00:02:23.099> much<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.549> call<00:02:24.090> this

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
corridor isn't used as much I call this

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.789 
corridor isn't used as much I call this
a<00:02:24.329> check-in<00:02:24.569> corridor<00:02:24.989> because<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.349> got

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
a check-in corridor because it's got

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.190 
a check-in corridor because it's got
check-ins<00:02:26.069> in<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.459> for<00:02:26.790> all<00:02:26.849> these<00:02:27.000> reasons

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
check-ins in it for all these reasons

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.539 
check-ins in it for all these reasons
this<00:02:28.200> middle<00:02:28.500> corridor<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.860> wouldn't<00:02:29.159> step<00:02:29.370> out

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
this middle corridor I wouldn't step out

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.250 
this middle corridor I wouldn't step out
and<00:02:29.670> because<00:02:29.970> it's<00:02:30.120> got<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.299> long<00:02:30.540> layer<00:02:30.900> site

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
and because it's got a long layer site

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
and because it's got a long layer site
to<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.579> may<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.730> unwise<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:34.590> yeah<00:02:34.799> always

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
to it so it may be unwise so yeah always

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.369 
to it so it may be unwise so yeah always
just<00:02:35.430> circulate<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.180> like<00:02:36.840> I'm<00:02:37.019> doing<00:02:37.290> though

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
just circulate and like I'm doing though

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.720 
just circulate and like I'm doing though
some<00:02:37.650> things<00:02:37.799> make<00:02:37.980> your<00:02:38.159> way<00:02:38.250> into<00:02:38.340> pillows

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
some things make your way into pillows

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.160 
some things make your way into pillows
if<00:02:38.879> you<00:02:38.970> feel<00:02:39.120> comfortable<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.810> nobody's

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
if you feel comfortable and nobody's

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.530 
if you feel comfortable and nobody's
spawned<00:02:40.439> at<00:02:40.650> pool<00:02:40.859> and<00:02:41.670> it's<00:02:42.180> just<00:02:42.329> a<00:02:42.420> good

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
spawned at pool and it's just a good

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.000 
spawned at pool and it's just a good
idea<00:02:42.840> just<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.140> get<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.379> spawns<00:02:43.680> flowing

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
idea just to get the spawns flowing

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.319 
idea just to get the spawns flowing
again<00:02:44.099> because<00:02:44.400> sometimes<00:02:44.970> people<00:02:45.030> want

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
again because sometimes people want

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.589 
again because sometimes people want
spinal<00:02:45.780> arches<00:02:46.139> because<00:02:47.040> you're<00:02:47.639> and<00:02:47.970> library

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
spinal arches because you're and library

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.899 
spinal arches because you're and library
and<00:02:48.690> you've<00:02:48.780> got<00:02:48.870> good<00:02:49.139> Lena<00:02:49.349> say<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.709> them<00:02:49.909> so

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
and you've got good Lena say on them so

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.149 
and you've got good Lena say on them so
it's<00:02:51.150> important<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.840> keep<00:02:52.079> that<00:02:52.109> in<00:02:52.349> mind<00:02:52.590> and

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
it's important to keep that in mind and

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.289 
it's important to keep that in mind and
also<00:02:53.430> if<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.549> haven't<00:02:53.670> noticed<00:02:53.760> I've<00:02:54.090> got<00:02:54.209> the

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
also if you haven't noticed I've got the

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.509 
also if you haven't noticed I've got the

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.429 
sexy golden i'm really loving this camel
finally<00:02:57.239> got<00:02:57.359> a<00:02:57.389> gold<00:02:57.629> after<00:02:57.810> having<00:02:58.290> read

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
finally got a gold after having read

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.679 
finally got a gold after having read
tiger<00:02:58.829> for<00:02:59.010> ages<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.670> would<00:03:00.090> have<00:03:00.209> seen<00:03:00.420> in

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
tiger for ages of you would have seen in

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.229 
tiger for ages of you would have seen in
my<00:03:00.720> last<00:03:01.319> video<00:03:01.829> and<00:03:02.189> also<00:03:02.430> right<00:03:02.819> there's<00:03:03.060> an

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
my last video and also right there's an

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.030 
my last video and also right there's an
example<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:03.900> why<00:03:04.200> need<00:03:04.379> to<00:03:04.470> go<00:03:04.560> at<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.709> library
