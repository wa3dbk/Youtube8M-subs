right<00:00:02.190> I<00:00:04.850> see<00:00:05.850> yes<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.330> first<00:00:06.540> we<00:00:06.779> gonna

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
right I see yes and the first we gonna

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.410 
right I see yes and the first we gonna
think<00:00:07.880> well<00:00:08.880> this<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.150> so

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
think well this is so

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.340 
think well this is so
I<00:00:11.450> concentrate<00:00:12.320> on<00:00:12.440> keeping<00:00:12.559> life<00:00:14.350> back

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350

straight<00:00:18.009> one<00:00:19.009> of<00:00:19.099> you<00:00:19.220> is<00:00:19.880> very<00:00:19.939> easy<00:00:20.300> to<00:00:20.450> lose

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.069 

so<00:00:24.320> the<00:00:24.529> function<00:00:24.919> is<00:00:24.980> less<00:00:25.250> comfortable

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:26.079 
so the function is less comfortable

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.999 
so the function is less comfortable
maybe<00:00:28.450> in<00:00:29.450> our<00:00:29.599> favorite<00:00:29.989> will<00:00:30.169> cutting

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
maybe in our favorite will cutting

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.970

like the where you have this
Ridge<00:00:45.949> here<00:00:45.980> which<00:00:46.460> creates<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.629> sense<00:00:47.839> of

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
Ridge here which creates the sense of

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.709 
Ridge here which creates the sense of
security<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:48.859> you<00:00:48.890> know<00:00:49.070> not<00:00:49.760> going<00:00:49.969> flying

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
security so you know not going flying

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
yeah yeah interconnect at the moment

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.509 
yeah yeah interconnect at the moment
tracking<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.940> beat<00:02:14.269> and<00:02:14.630> hands<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:16.220> skater

using the collective electric chair
that's<00:02:18.500> all<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:19.340> theory<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.790> can<00:02:19.940> track

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.110 

no<00:03:01.689> one<00:03:01.870> follow-up<00:03:02.400> no<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:03.700> suppose<00:03:04.030> it

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
no one follow-up no I suppose it

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.910 
no one follow-up no I suppose it
naturally<00:03:04.659> if<00:03:04.989> you<00:03:05.079> try<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.319> bunt<00:03:05.500> yourself

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
naturally if you try and bunt yourself

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.240 
naturally if you try and bunt yourself
it<00:03:06.129> comes<00:03:06.370> in<00:03:06.549> so<00:03:06.819> I

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.040
