wrote<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> book<00:01:55.530> slow<00:01:55.890> burn<00:01:56.189> and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
wrote the book slow burn and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.550 
wrote the book slow burn and
you<00:01:57.149> know<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.270> can't<00:01:57.329> recommend<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.380> book

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
you know I can't recommend that book

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.550 
you know I can't recommend that book
more<00:01:59.130> highly<00:01:59.670> because<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.899> refer<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.439> it

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
more highly because I just refer to it

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.219 
more highly because I just refer to it
all<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.859> time<00:02:02.030> but<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.390> funny<00:02:03.659> because<00:02:03.899> he

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
all the time but it's funny because he

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.660 
all the time but it's funny because he
puts<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.619> much<00:02:04.679> information<00:02:05.039> in<00:02:05.460> there<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
puts so much information in there that

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.760 
puts so much information in there that
you<00:02:05.909> don't<00:02:06.030> really<00:02:06.119> get<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.479> all<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.500> first

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
you don't really get it all the first

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.440 
you don't really get it all the first
time<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.039> kind<00:02:08.519> of<00:02:08.580> keep<00:02:08.789> referring<00:02:09.090> back<00:02:09.239> to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
time just kind of keep referring back to

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.930 
time just kind of keep referring back to
it<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:09.959> start<00:02:10.200> incorporating<00:02:10.410> things<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.760> he

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
it and start incorporating things and he

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.759 
it and start incorporating things and he
was<00:02:12.120> talking<00:02:12.390> was<00:02:12.959> using<00:02:13.379> some<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.590> his

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
was talking was using some of his

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.229 
was talking was using some of his
clients<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.519> some<00:02:15.299> examples<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.140> how<00:02:16.560> people

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
clients and some examples of how people

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.880 
clients and some examples of how people
transform<00:02:18.239> their<00:02:18.299> energy<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.140> I'm<00:02:19.590> sorry<00:02:19.799> I'm

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
transform their energy and I'm sorry I'm

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.559 
transform their energy and I'm sorry I'm
thinking<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.340> do<00:02:20.400> from<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.000> do<00:02:21.060> all<00:02:21.420> these

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
thinking I do from and I do all these

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.740 
thinking I do from and I do all these
things<00:02:21.629> I'm<00:02:22.170> young<00:02:23.010> why<00:02:23.400> don't<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.239> have<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
things I'm young why don't I have the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.640 
things I'm young why don't I have the
energy<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.530> really<00:02:25.920> want<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:27.620> one<00:02:28.620> thing

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
energy that I really want and one thing

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.670 
energy that I really want and one thing
in<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.099> book<00:02:29.370> spoke<00:02:30.239> about<00:02:30.510> sugar<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.260> what

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
in the book spoke about sugar and what

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.699 
in the book spoke about sugar and what
sugar<00:02:31.980> does<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.819> how<00:02:33.390> sugar<00:02:33.840> can<00:02:34.230> take<00:02:34.470> away

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
sugar does and how sugar can take away

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.130 
sugar does and how sugar can take away
your<00:02:34.860> energy<00:02:35.280> how<00:02:35.519> its<00:02:35.790> quote-unquote<00:02:36.450> it

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
your energy how its quote-unquote it

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.039 
your energy how its quote-unquote it
acidifies<00:02:37.769> you<00:02:38.280> if<00:02:38.459> it's<00:02:38.610> an<00:02:38.730> acid<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.540> it

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
acidifies you if it's an acid and it

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.710 
acidifies you if it's an acid and it
flit<00:02:40.470> over<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:41.099> sort<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.000> creates<00:02:42.209> over

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
flit over it sort of creates over

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.930 
flit over it sort of creates over
acidification<00:02:43.379> in<00:02:43.769> your<00:02:43.890> body<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.400> it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
acidification in your body and it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.600 
acidification in your body and it
flushes<00:02:45.390> your<00:02:45.750> body<00:02:46.019> with<00:02:46.290> acid<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:46.920> how<00:02:47.040> acid

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
flushes your body with acid and how acid

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.059 
flushes your body with acid and how acid
can<00:02:47.790> take<00:02:48.000> away<00:02:48.269> some<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.780> your<00:02:48.959> energy<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.560> of

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
can take away some of your energy and of

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.530 
can take away some of your energy and of
course<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.430> goes<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.579> lot<00:02:50.940> more<00:02:51.150> into<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
course it goes a lot more into the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.069 
course it goes a lot more into the
principles<00:02:51.989> but<00:02:52.260> i<00:02:53.090> really<00:02:54.090> had<00:02:54.510> sort<00:02:55.019> of

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
principles but i really had sort of

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.020 
principles but i really had sort of
stuck<00:02:55.379> on<00:02:55.530> this<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.829> said<00:02:55.890> whoa<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.670> know<00:02:56.790> I

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
know I understand the nutrient content

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.970 
know I understand the nutrient content
I'm<00:03:06.269> sort<00:03:06.569> of<00:03:06.600> looking<00:03:06.930> at<00:03:07.319> what<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.560> was<00:03:07.739> eating

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980

during<00:03:08.370> my<00:03:08.639> day<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.060> realized<00:03:09.540> how<00:03:09.840> much

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
during my day and I realized how much

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.520 
during my day and I realized how much
sugar<00:03:10.470> was<00:03:10.769> in<00:03:10.950> my<00:03:11.100> day<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.670> for<00:03:12.569> me<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:13.139> thought

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
sugar was in my day and for me I thought

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.970 
sugar was in my day and for me I thought
well<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:14.099> know<00:03:14.130> what<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.760> have<00:03:15.359> to<00:03:15.389> try<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:15.980> so

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
well you know what I have to try this so

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.339 
well you know what I have to try this so
I<00:03:17.010> started<00:03:17.430> off<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.670> first<00:03:17.970> day<00:03:18.349> switching

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
I started off the first day switching

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.309 
I started off the first day switching
from<00:03:19.500> black<00:03:19.769> tea<00:03:20.040> with<00:03:20.310> literally<00:03:20.849> five

from black tea with literally five
tablespoons<00:03:22.319> of<00:03:22.620> sugar<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.069> had<00:03:23.400> gotten<00:03:23.760> up

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
tablespoons of sugar and I had gotten up

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.050 
tablespoons of sugar and I had gotten up
to<00:03:23.910> like<00:03:24.120> four<00:03:24.420> cups<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.139> this<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.319> day<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:26.609> green

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
that 12 grams of sugar I switched to

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.379 
that 12 grams of sugar I switched to
zero<00:03:33.299> sugar<00:03:33.799> with<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:35.010> now<00:03:35.340> do<00:03:35.400> almond<00:03:35.910> butter<00:03:36.090> I
