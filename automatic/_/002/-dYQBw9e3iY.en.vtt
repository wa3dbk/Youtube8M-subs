3<00:00:19.710> Lego<00:00:19.980> set<00:00:20.310> which<00:00:20.490> sounds<00:00:20.789> pretty<00:00:20.939> stupid<00:00:21.359> it

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
3 Lego set which sounds pretty stupid it

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.259 
3 Lego set which sounds pretty stupid it
was<00:00:22.260> cool<00:00:22.500> but<00:00:22.680> then<00:00:22.890> look<00:00:23.130> at<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.430> one<00:00:23.670> this

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
was cool but then look at this one this

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.630 
was cool but then look at this one this
literally<00:00:24.869> looks<00:00:25.199> like<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.920> diner<00:00:26.189> from

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
literally looks like the diner from

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.939 
literally looks like the diner from
Trenton<00:00:27.119> actually<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.199> almost<00:00:28.349> exactly<00:00:28.830> it

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
Trenton actually it almost exactly it

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.800 
Trenton actually it almost exactly it
looks<00:00:29.099> like<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.310> time<00:00:29.460> from<00:00:29.670> transit<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
looks like the time from transit and the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.030 
looks like the time from transit and the
funny<00:00:31.019> thing<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.230> why<00:00:31.529> would<00:00:31.560> they<00:00:31.859> be<00:00:31.920> doing

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
funny thing is why would they be doing

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.670 
funny thing is why would they be doing
that<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.790> black<00:00:33.000> ops<00:00:33.180> 3<00:00:33.480> transit<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.410> point<00:00:34.620> o

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
that for black ops 3 transit to point o

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.959 
that for black ops 3 transit to point o
confirmed<00:00:35.040> um<00:00:36.860> you<00:00:37.860> know<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:39.000> think<00:00:40.969> because

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
confirmed um you know it I think because

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.700 
confirmed um you know it I think because
I<00:00:42.300> can't<00:00:42.750> say<00:00:42.960> they're<00:00:43.140> not<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.590> do

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
I can't say they're not going to do

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.250 
I can't say they're not going to do
because<00:00:43.890> why<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> hell<00:00:45.090> would<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:45.989> just

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
because why in the hell would they just

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.580 
because why in the hell would they just
bring<00:00:46.739> us<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.610> black<00:00:48.030> ops<00:00:48.270> 3<00:00:48.690> i'm<00:00:48.930> lego

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
bring us this as a black ops 3 i'm lego

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.340 
bring us this as a black ops 3 i'm lego
set<00:00:50.390> when<00:00:51.390> they<00:00:51.570> when<00:00:51.870> they're<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.170> bringing

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
set when they when they're not bringing

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.500 
set when they when they're not bringing
transit<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.129> quotations<00:00:53.910> because<00:00:54.030> they<00:00:54.329> are

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
transit in quotations because they are

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.930 
transit in quotations because they are
and<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:54.960> gonna<00:00:55.050> be<00:00:55.170> transit<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.620> point<00:00:55.829> out

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
and it's gonna be transit to point out

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
and it's gonna be transit to point out
so<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.570> know<00:00:57.690> which<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> go<00:00:58.530> out<00:00:58.559> all

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
so you know which is going to go out all

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.889 
so you know which is going to go out all
in<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.340> we're<00:00:59.489> just<00:00:59.670> gonna<00:00:59.789> say<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
in and we're just gonna say this is the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.110 
in and we're just gonna say this is the
image<00:01:01.140> they're<00:01:02.070> probably<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:02.969> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
image they're probably going to do it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.230 
image they're probably going to do it
and<00:01:03.769> how<00:01:04.769> are<00:01:04.920> they<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.280> change<00:01:05.549> transit

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and how are they going to change transit

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.280 
and how are they going to change transit
okay<00:01:06.540> how<00:01:06.720> are<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.080> change

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
okay how are they going to change

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.010 
okay how are they going to change
transit<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.280> make<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.640> actually<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.270> decent<00:01:09.570> map

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
transit to make it actually a decent map

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.859 
transit to make it actually a decent map
there's<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> lot<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.159> stuff<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.909> and

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
there's a lot of stuff they can do and

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.530 
there's a lot of stuff they can do and
now<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.010> i<00:01:14.070> think<00:01:14.100> about<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.549> i<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.240> no<00:01:15.420> idea

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
now that i think about it i have no idea

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.859 
now that i think about it i have no idea
because<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:17.090> you<00:01:18.090> know<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.420> only<00:01:18.570> way<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
because if you know the only way to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.230 
because if you know the only way to
really<00:01:19.229> make<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.740> good<00:01:19.890> map<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:21.060> make

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
really make it a good map is to make

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.740 
really make it a good map is to make
sure<00:01:21.270> jug<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.689> a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
sure jug is like in a you know like a

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.020 
sure jug is like in a you know like a
location<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.130> actually<00:01:26.250> read<00:01:26.700> get

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
location that you can actually read get

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.780 
location that you can actually read get
to<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.540> fast<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:29.189> not<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.520> bye<00:01:29.759> bye

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
to like fast and it's not like bye bye

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.300 
to like fast and it's not like bye bye
round<00:01:30.450> 15<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.140> finally<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:31.619> jog<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:32.070> town

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
round 15 you finally get jog at town

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.609 
round 15 you finally get jog at town
because<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> bus<00:01:33.240> leaves<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.049> stays<00:01:34.350> you

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
because the bus leaves you it stays you

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.280 
because the bus leaves you it stays you
want<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.890> get<00:01:34.979> stuff<00:01:35.189> done<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:36.390> like<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> map

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
want to get stuff done if like the map

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.130 
want to get stuff done if like the map
gives<00:01:37.560> us<00:01:37.770> time<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.909> around<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.930> like

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
gives us time to go around and like

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.810 
gives us time to go around and like
explore<00:01:40.829> everything<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.460> bus<00:01:41.790> is

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
explore everything and if the bus is

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.850 
explore everything and if the bus is
like<00:01:42.270> let's<00:01:43.079> say<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> pit

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
like let's say you have to like a pit

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.469 
like let's say you have to like a pit
you<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> pay<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> fair<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.030> use<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.329> bus

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
you have to pay a fair to use the bus

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.120 
you have to pay a fair to use the bus
but<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> bus<00:01:46.320> stays<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.829> whole<00:01:47.070> time

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
but the bus stays there the whole time

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
but the bus stays there the whole time
and<00:01:47.670> then<00:01:47.970> whenever<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.479> want<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.810> pay<00:01:49.020> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
and then whenever you want you pay a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.620 
and then whenever you want you pay a
fair<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.829> go<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.220> use<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.820> you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
fair and you go and you use it and you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.389 
fair and you go and you use it and you
use<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.840> when<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.259> want<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.530> doesn't<00:01:53.009> leave

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
use it when you want it doesn't leave

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.639 
use it when you want it doesn't leave
like<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.360> doesn't<00:01:54.509> get<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.869> bus<00:01:55.020> depot<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.439> hit

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
like it doesn't get to bus depot you hit

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.350 
like it doesn't get to bus depot you hit
the<00:01:55.770> back<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.070> once<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.610> then<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.759> leaves<00:01:57.119> like

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the back to once and then it leaves like

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.850 
the back to once and then it leaves like
the<00:01:57.420> minute<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.840> hit<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.079> box<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.710> can't

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the minute you hit the box and you can't

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
the minute you hit the box and you can't
get<00:01:58.950> your<00:01:59.070> ray<00:01:59.219> gun<00:01:59.250> or<00:01:59.490> whatever<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.850> know

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
get your ray gun or whatever you know

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.080 
get your ray gun or whatever you know
it's<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:01.079> doesn't<00:02:01.439> make<00:02:01.500> any<00:02:01.560> sense<00:02:02.090> so

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
it's like it doesn't make any sense so

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.370 
it's like it doesn't make any sense so
if<00:02:03.270> they're<00:02:03.420> doing<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.719> transit<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.140> point

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
if they're doing the transit to point

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.020 
if they're doing the transit to point
out<00:02:04.500> first<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.860> all<00:02:04.920> redo<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> whole<00:02:05.430> map<00:02:05.729> okay

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
out first of all redo the whole map okay

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.310 
out first of all redo the whole map okay
i<00:02:06.060> don't<00:02:06.420> want<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.600> play<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.750> map<00:02:07.020> again<00:02:07.170> it

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
i don't want to play that map again it

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.949 
i don't want to play that map again it
was<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> cool<00:02:07.619> map<00:02:08.270> it<00:02:09.270> wasn't<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.539> best<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.869> was

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
was a cool map it wasn't the best it was

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.990 
was a cool map it wasn't the best it was
cool<00:02:10.170> for<00:02:11.069> me<00:02:11.190> for<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> while<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.700> know<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
cool for me for a while you know the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.280 
cool for me for a while you know the
first<00:02:12.209> week<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:12.690> whatever

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
first week or whatever

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.990 
first week or whatever
but<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.799> redo<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.219> make<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.459> really<00:02:14.849> cool

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
but just redo it make it really cool

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.490 
but just redo it make it really cool
make<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.239> insane<00:02:15.629> make<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.959> whole<00:02:16.170> different

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
make it insane make it a whole different

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.020 
make it insane make it a whole different
experience<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:17.189> then<00:02:17.370> make<00:02:17.579> it<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:17.819> we<00:02:17.849> can

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
experience and then make it so we can

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.240 
experience and then make it so we can
actually<00:02:18.120> control<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.109> bus<00:02:19.469> even<00:02:19.799> drive<00:02:20.219> it

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
actually control the bus even drive it

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.619 
actually control the bus even drive it
for<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.849> matter<00:02:21.090> because<00:02:21.420> we're<00:02:21.540> on

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
so if they do that for transit to point

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.190 
so if they do that for transit to point
oh<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:30.150> would<00:02:30.239> be<00:02:30.269> insane<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.870> just<00:02:31.019> look

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
oh that would be insane it just look

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.869 
oh that would be insane it just look
just<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.590> fact<00:02:31.859> of<00:02:32.040> like<00:02:32.340> thinking<00:02:32.790> about

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
just the fact of like thinking about

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.869 
just the fact of like thinking about
transit<00:02:33.329> to<00:02:33.450> point<00:02:33.659> out<00:02:33.750> that's<00:02:33.840> crazy<00:02:34.640> but<00:02:35.640> it

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
transit to point out that's crazy but it

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.729 
transit to point out that's crazy but it
looks<00:02:36.420> like<00:02:36.689> it<00:02:36.840> like<00:02:37.019> why<00:02:37.290> they<00:02:37.500> putting

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
looks like it like why they putting

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.559 
looks like it like why they putting
diner<00:02:37.950> here<00:02:38.400> what<00:02:38.819> why<00:02:39.030> else<00:02:39.209> would<00:02:39.389> they<00:02:39.450> put

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
diner here what why else would they put

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.110 
diner here what why else would they put
iron<00:02:39.780> they're<00:02:40.709> not<00:02:40.829> going<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.040> oh<00:02:41.280> yeah<00:02:41.489> so<00:02:41.819> for

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
iron they're not going to oh yeah so for

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.509 
iron they're not going to oh yeah so for
black<00:02:42.329> ops<00:02:42.359> 3<00:02:42.959> we're<00:02:43.739> going<00:02:43.859> to<00:02:43.920> bring<00:02:44.069> back<00:02:44.280> a

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
black ops 3 we're going to bring back a

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.879 
black ops 3 we're going to bring back a
black<00:02:45.090> ops<00:02:45.299> 2<00:02:45.540> map<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.959> know<00:02:46.109> like<00:02:46.349> know<00:02:46.680> it

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
black ops 2 map you know like know it

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.099 
black ops 2 map you know like know it
for<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.879> Lego<00:02:48.180> say<00:02:48.480> at<00:02:48.599> least<00:02:48.629> like<00:02:48.989> I

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
for the for the Lego say at least like I

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.240 
for the for the Lego say at least like I
would<00:02:49.230> understand<00:02:49.650> if<00:02:49.709> they<00:02:49.829> brought<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.129> into

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
would understand if they brought it into

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.220 
would understand if they brought it into
the<00:02:50.459> game<00:02:50.730> but<00:02:51.000> like<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.329> Lego<00:02:51.599> set<00:02:51.959> that's

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
the game but like the Lego set that's

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.170 
the game but like the Lego set that's
that<00:02:52.650> would<00:02:52.769> be<00:02:52.889> only<00:02:53.069> for<00:02:53.489> black<00:02:53.669> absolutely

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
that would be only for black absolutely

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.319 
that would be only for black absolutely
and<00:02:54.650> obviously<00:02:55.650> its<00:02:56.040> transit<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.579> transit

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
and obviously its transit and transit

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.690 
and obviously its transit and transit
will<00:02:57.659> some<00:02:58.319> extent<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.799> it<00:02:58.950> at<00:02:59.069> least<00:02:59.099> would<00:02:59.489> be

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
will some extent of it at least would be

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.849 
will some extent of it at least would be
in<00:03:00.000> black<00:03:00.480> ops<00:03:00.629> 3<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.049> coming<00:03:01.530> guys<00:03:01.620> what<00:03:01.769> you
