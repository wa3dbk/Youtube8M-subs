interesting about these new LG phones
for<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.600> mid-range<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.140> actually<00:00:58.559> that

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
for the mid-range is actually that

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.770 
for the mid-range is actually that
they're<00:00:58.949> bringing<00:00:59.370> down<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:00.239> curve<00:01:00.480> design

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
they're bringing down the curve design

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.389 
they're bringing down the curve design
that<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.500> from<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.859> LG<00:01:02.129> G<00:01:02.370> flex

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
that you know from the LG G flex

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.810 
that you know from the LG G flex
flagship<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.559> mid-range<00:01:05.040> actually<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.670> if

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
flagship to the mid-range actually so if

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820 
flagship to the mid-range actually so if
you<00:01:05.970> look<00:01:06.270> at<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.479> device<00:01:06.659> from<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> side

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
you look at this device from the side

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.380 
you look at this device from the side
really<00:01:08.189> closely<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.640> won't<00:01:08.880> see<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
really closely you won't see it on the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.240 
really closely you won't see it on the
camera<00:01:09.570> pretty<00:01:09.900> much<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.650> see<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
camera pretty much you can see that the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.490 
camera pretty much you can see that the
back<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.299> phone<00:01:12.510> is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
back of the phone is

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.130 
back of the phone is
slightly<00:01:14.130> bent<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.940> pretty<00:01:15.540> bent<00:01:15.750> actually

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
slightly bent or pretty bent actually

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.770 
slightly bent or pretty bent actually
the<00:01:16.740> front<00:01:16.980> is<00:01:17.250> even<00:01:17.610> less<00:01:17.790> bent<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.570> is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the front is even less bent but it is

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.410 
the front is even less bent but it is
bent<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.830> front<00:01:20.070> screen<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:21.060> screen<00:01:21.180> on

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
bent so the front screen the screen on

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.390 
bent so the front screen the screen on
this<00:01:21.540> device<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.200> actually<00:01:22.500> it's<00:01:22.950> slightly

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
this device is actually it's slightly

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.640 
this device is actually it's slightly
curved<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.240> about<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.630> millimeter<00:01:25.380> or

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
curved so you have about a millimeter or

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.860 
curved so you have about a millimeter or
two<00:01:25.790> difference<00:01:26.790> between<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.300> edges<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
two difference between the edges of the

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.020 
two difference between the edges of the
device<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> middle<00:01:28.830> so<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.370> you<00:01:29.460> put<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
device and the middle so if you put the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.910 
device and the middle so if you put the
device<00:01:30.119> down<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> table<00:01:31.440> it<00:01:31.590> will<00:01:31.710> not

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
device down on the table it will not

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.400 
device down on the table it will not
have<00:01:32.130> contact<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.510> surface<00:01:34.140> that

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
have contact with the surface that

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.130 
have contact with the surface that
surface<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.020> is

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
surface that is that that is that it is

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.700 
surface that is that that is that it is
laying<00:01:37.470> on

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.590 

what's<00:01:41.280> pretty<00:01:41.460> cool<00:01:41.700> about<00:01:41.790> those<00:01:42.120> new<00:01:42.330> LG

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
what's pretty cool about those new LG

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.210 
what's pretty cool about those new LG
devices<00:01:43.200> actually<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.890> they're<00:01:44.070> bringing

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
devices actually that they're bringing

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.090 
devices actually that they're bringing
down<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.120> curve<00:01:45.480> the<00:01:45.690> design<00:01:46.050> from<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.680> G

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
down the curve the design from the G

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.490 
down the curve the design from the G
place<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.700> flagship<00:01:48.270> device<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
place to flagship device to the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.680 
place to flagship device to the
mid-range<00:01:49.800> devices<00:01:50.490> which<00:01:51.000> means<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.480> not

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
mid-range devices which means it's not

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.870 
mid-range devices which means it's not
flexible<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.830> Flex<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.340> still<00:01:53.670> is

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
flexible like the Flex to still is

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.270 
flexible like the Flex to still is
although<00:01:54.150> LG<00:01:54.660> isn't<00:01:55.020> putting<00:01:55.229> any<00:01:55.800> weight<00:01:55.950> on

this marketing-wise but on the magnet

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.460 
this marketing-wise but on the magnet
for<00:01:58.860> example<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.240> spirit<00:02:01.170> device

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
for example like on the spirit device

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.100 
for example like on the spirit device
which<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:01.979> 4.7<00:02:02.670> inch<00:02:02.820> smaller<00:02:03.540> brother<00:02:03.869> of

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
which is the 4.7 inch smaller brother of

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.320 
which is the 4.7 inch smaller brother of
this<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.770> actually<00:02:05.400> that<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> front<00:02:05.940> screen

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
this is actually that the front screen

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.900 
this is actually that the front screen
has<00:02:06.660> been<00:02:06.690> slightly<00:02:07.200> curved<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.880> a

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
has been slightly curved so you have a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.550 
has been slightly curved so you have a
small<00:02:09.240> difference<00:02:09.570> between<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.110> edges<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
small difference between the edges of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.050 
small difference between the edges of
the<00:02:10.679> device<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.400> middle<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.820> device

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the device and the middle of the device

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.880 
the device and the middle of the device
so<00:02:12.570> if<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.750> put<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.020> down<00:02:13.050> on<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.380> surface

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
so if you put it down on the surface

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.120 
so if you put it down on the surface
surface<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.730> will<00:02:15.030> not<00:02:15.330> touch<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:16.680> area<00:02:16.860> that

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
surface it will not touch the area that

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.560 
surface it will not touch the area that
it<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.340> running<00:02:17.580> on<00:02:17.790> at<00:02:18.060> least<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.480> middle

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
it is running on at least in the middle

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.140 
it is running on at least in the middle
so<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.170> supposed<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:20.100> keep<00:02:20.310> scratches

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
so that is supposed to keep scratches

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.390 
so that is supposed to keep scratches
away<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.570> tiny<00:02:21.989> bit<00:02:22.200> at<00:02:22.320> least<00:02:22.500> or<00:02:22.770> protect<00:02:23.280> it

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
away a tiny bit at least or protect it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.590 
away a tiny bit at least or protect it
from<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.910> other<00:02:24.030> than<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.300> it's<00:02:24.540> just

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
from that and other than that it's just

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.600 
from that and other than that it's just
a<00:02:24.989> freakin<00:02:25.380> cool<00:02:25.590> design<00:02:25.920> at<00:02:26.100> least<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.489> my

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
a freakin cool design at least in my

a freakin cool design at least in my
world<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:28.350> have<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.500> five<00:02:28.739> inch<00:02:28.920> screen<00:02:29.130> on

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
device they're both on the back so you

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.480 
device they're both on the back so you

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
this curved or round structure to it so

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.040

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
at this cover on here there's just a

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.060 
at this cover on here there's just a
slight<00:04:13.030> structure<00:04:13.750> to<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.560> should<00:04:14.800> keep

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
slight structure to it that should keep

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.920 
slight structure to it that should keep
fingerprints<00:04:15.730> away<00:04:15.940> and<00:04:16.209> these<00:04:16.359> devices<00:04:16.510> have

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
fingerprints away and these devices have

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.630 
fingerprints away and these devices have
really<00:04:17.170> been<00:04:17.290> out<00:04:17.470> here<00:04:17.650> for<00:04:17.890> a<00:04:17.920> week<00:04:18.190> now<00:04:18.340> and

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
integrated into this device as you just

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.500 
integrated into this device as you just
saw<00:04:51.340> so<00:04:51.520> you<00:04:51.580> can<00:04:51.760> switch<00:04:51.940> around<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.360> bit<00:04:52.480> with

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
saw so you can switch around a bit with

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.900 
saw so you can switch around a bit with
them<00:04:52.780> and<00:04:52.990> that's<00:04:53.890> pretty<00:04:54.040> much<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.430> this<00:04:54.669> will

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
them and that's pretty much it this will

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.000 
them and that's pretty much it this will
be<00:04:55.030> out<00:04:55.240> in<00:04:55.660> Europe<00:04:55.960> pretty<00:04:56.380> soon<00:04:56.680> and<00:04:56.890> it

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
be out in Europe pretty soon and it

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.280 
be out in Europe pretty soon and it
should<00:04:57.220> retail<00:04:57.640> for<00:04:57.910> just<00:04:58.150> around<00:04:58.419> 200<00:04:58.990> euros

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
should retail for just around 200 euros

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.280 
should retail for just around 200 euros
and<00:04:59.500> it<00:05:00.220> probably<00:05:00.520> will<00:05:00.850> also<00:05:01.240> launch<00:05:01.540> in<00:05:01.900> the

and it probably will also launch in the
u.s.<00:05:02.470> though<00:05:03.010> probably<00:05:03.400> not<00:05:03.820> as<00:05:04.000> a<00:05:04.720> dual<00:05:05.080> SIM

don't sell fuel cell models and the US
market<00:05:11.190> is<00:05:11.310> still<00:05:11.850> sticking<00:05:12.150> to<00:05:12.270> that<00:05:12.540> carrier

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160
