line because it has the only has a
diameter<00:03:19.350> of<00:03:19.560> 17<00:03:20.040> pound<00:03:20.310> test<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:20.850> if<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.390> use

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
diameter of 17 pound test and if you use

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.630 
diameter of 17 pound test and if you use
lighter<00:03:22.020> line<00:03:22.290> then<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.800> diameter<00:03:23.100> gets<00:03:23.430> so

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
lighter line then the diameter gets so

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.400 
lighter line then the diameter gets so
thin<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.120> tends<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.420> cut<00:03:24.660> in<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.870> school<00:03:25.170> and

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
thin it tends to cut in the school and

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.780 
thin it tends to cut in the school and
you<00:03:25.500> start<00:03:25.739> having<00:03:25.830> problem<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.550> heavier

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
you start having problem so the heavier

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.520 
you start having problem so the heavier
line<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.180> used<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.900> give<00:03:28.050> you<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.200> little<00:03:28.350> bit

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
line is used to give you a little bit

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.130 
line is used to give you a little bit
more<00:03:28.650> diameter<00:03:29.280> under<00:03:29.520> super<00:03:29.790> light<00:03:30.020> when<00:03:31.020> you

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
more diameter under super light when you

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.780 
more diameter under super light when you
talk<00:03:31.410> about<00:03:31.560> these<00:03:31.860> big<00:03:32.130> fish<00:03:32.340> you'll<00:03:32.610> hear
