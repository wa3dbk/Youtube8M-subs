00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.160
 apparently we have a big problem to solve but stay calm 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.369
 that we are going to clarify this apparent biblical contradiction 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.129
 for many who want to destroy the immutability of God's law and that 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.490
 other miscellaneous 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.769
 seems to be all they need 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.699
 not even those who attack the law of God 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.249
 arrived at a unity of thought 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:27.409
 for some 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.979
 she was abolished on the cross for others it lasted until joao 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.270
 but interesting that if it lasted until jo達o 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.400
 jesus did not have anything else for bullet anyway 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.680
 neither do they themselves understand 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.350
 but the problem under discussion and the following discussion 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.720
 the law and the prophets last until July 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.500
 as 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.330
 correctly interpret this Bible verse 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.430
 I want to remind you again and that 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.930
 to interpret the Bible properly 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.980
 we can not isolate a third of its context 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.790
 so as not to make mistakes in interpretation 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.280
 le mans back is that verse of saint lucas 16 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.270
 in the older versions of the Bible the word lasted 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.630
 is in the italicized italic form pistoia written with a letter a little bit 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.640
 inclined 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.160
 this happens 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.650
 every time the translator finds no original Greek 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.090
 that word 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.890
 and the translator just put one or another word to complete the meaning better 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.700
 of the verse 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.720
 now 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.010
 Let's analyze this verse. 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.270
 de s達o lucas 16 compared to the quote from s達o mateus 11 13 there we 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.960
 we will go 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.590
 because all the prophets and the law 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.210
 prophesied until john 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.260
 it was clear now 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.570
 and are lucas said that the law and the prophets lasted until June 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.940
 but Matthew says that the prophets prophesied 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.530
 and in this text there is no italicized word and the meaning is 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.310
 of course and we can understand perfectly 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.270
 What did Jesus mean? 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.640
 the law and the prophets represent the teachings of the Old Testament that were the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.189
 the only ones that existed in the days of Christ 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:12.029
 they were 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:14.849
 all that men had in matters of revelation 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.390
 the gospel did not come to abolish the ancient prophets but to reinforce them 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.939
 and confirm 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.159
 therefore 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.499
 What did Jesus mean? 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:26.439
 was that even John Baptist 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.340
 the prophets made their prophecies concerning their first coming 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.610
 and indicated through the written word 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.800
 two symbols 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.490
 and the sacrificial system 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.110
 the time when the kingdom of God would be announced and that from Christ a 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.929
 new linen was arrived 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.699
 if the law and the prophets lasted until John 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.729
 we have to disregard 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:52.809
 all the prophets who are mentioned a book of deeds and also disregard 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:55.939
 the bestowal of gifts in the holy spirit the apostolic church 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.069
 that even one of the gifts was a gift of prophecy 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.109
 if the law and the prophets lasted until John 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.129
 we must also disregard the words of paulo romano 7 12 where he 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.689
 say 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.900
 in fact the law is holy and the commandment is holy righteous and gift 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.599
 At no time does Christ contradict himself. 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.330
 because he himself said in s達o mateus 5 17 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.509
 does not have six 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:22.190
 which had abolished the law 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.079
 the prophets 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.790
 and to sediment this so clear truth of the word of God 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.689
 from what 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.859
 God's law did not only last until John but remains alive until our 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:34.619
 days 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:37.349
 see what jesus christ said 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.159
 I tell them the truth 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.340
 as long as there are heavens and earth in no way will the law disappear from 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:45.460
 same letter 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.700
 the slightest trace 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.980
 until everything 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.019
 if it is fulfilled this is in son mateus chapter 5 of the sub-18 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:52.640
 therefore 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.509
 the promise is clear would have missed 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:58.019
 while there are heavens and the earth 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.759
 the law and the prophets was in force 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:04.429
 and no man has the right to change to nullify what God himself 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:05.609
 established 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.839
 and he did it for the happiness of his children 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:10.459
 think about it 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.969
 ask your question 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:14.330
 we send so that we can answer it 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.499
 a big hug 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.279
 and until our next meeting, God willing
