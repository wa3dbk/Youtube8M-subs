there's<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:23.509> little<00:01:23.780> spark<00:01:24.229> down<00:01:24.500> below<00:01:24.829> so

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
there's a little spark down below so

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.310 
there's a little spark down below so
maybe<00:01:25.670> it's<00:01:25.850> supposed<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.210> be<00:01:26.360> both<00:01:26.570> because

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
maybe it's supposed to be both because

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.859 
maybe it's supposed to be both because
it<00:01:27.409> looks<00:01:27.560> like<00:01:27.619> this<00:01:27.860> is<00:01:28.009> a<00:01:28.040> popped<00:01:28.430> cap<00:01:28.850> of<00:01:29.180> a
