00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
interesting because you know if you're

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.430 
interesting because you know if you're
going<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> normally<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:48.059> uh<00:00:48.440> it's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
going to do that normally it's uh it's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.510 
going to do that normally it's uh it's
not<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.760> type<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> thing<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.510> admit<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.170> I

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
not the type of thing you admit you I

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.319 
not the type of thing you admit you I
think<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> lot<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.730> people<00:00:53.820> unfortunately

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
think a lot of people unfortunately

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.330 
think a lot of people unfortunately
think<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.199> took<00:00:55.350> away<00:00:55.590> from<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.920> moment

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
think that it took away from the moment

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.510 
think that it took away from the moment
but<00:00:56.579> look<00:00:57.329> uh<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:58.109> think<00:00:58.559> Adam<00:00:58.920> Wainwright<00:00:59.309> is

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
but look uh I think Adam Wainwright is

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.700 
but look uh I think Adam Wainwright is
getting<00:00:59.879> maligned<00:01:00.539> completely<00:01:01.289> unfairly

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
getting maligned completely unfairly

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.939 
getting maligned completely unfairly
because<00:01:02.629> frankly<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.049> Glen<00:01:04.320> Perkins<00:01:04.530> said

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
because frankly and Glen Perkins said

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.130 
because frankly and Glen Perkins said

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
of easy one to hit because everybody is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.679 
of easy one to hit because everybody is
coming<00:01:11.369> there<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.640> see<00:01:11.880> Derek<00:01:12.090> Jeter<00:01:12.240> get<00:01:12.659> a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.010 
hit and that's what this all-star game
should<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.700> about<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.479> an<00:01:15.600> exhibition

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
should be about but it's an exhibition

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.320 
should be about but it's an exhibition
at<00:01:16.680> least<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.100> used<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:17.880> Chan<00:01:18.150> Ho<00:01:18.299> Park

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
at least it used to be if Chan Ho Park

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.570 
at least it used to be if Chan Ho Park
wants<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.049> serve<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.740> meatball<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.369> Cal

wants to serve up to a meatball to Cal

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.090 
wants to serve up to a meatball to Cal
Ripken<00:01:20.970> junior<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.930> he<00:01:21.990> didn't<00:01:22.290> say<00:01:22.619> he<00:01:22.890> did<00:01:23.070> I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
Ripken junior but he didn't say he did I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.370 
Ripken junior but he didn't say he did I
don't<00:01:23.400> think<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.509> think<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:24.990> one<00:01:25.170> thing<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
don't think I I think it's one thing to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.590 
don't think I I think it's one thing to
say<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.920> did<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.729> another<00:01:27.030> thing<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.390> do

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
say you did it it's another thing to do

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.890 
say you did it it's another thing to do
I'm<00:01:27.810> fine<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.470> did<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.420> am<00:01:30.420> NOT<00:01:30.600> fine

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
I'm fine if you did it I am NOT fine

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.450 
I'm fine if you did it I am NOT fine
that<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.229> admit<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.829> did<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.159> because<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
that you admit you did it because it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.910 
that you admit you did it because it
takes<00:01:32.670> away<00:01:32.880> from<00:01:33.119> Jeter<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.409> think<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:34.860> he

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
takes away from Jeter so I think what he

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.510 
takes away from Jeter so I think what he
was<00:01:35.040> trying<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.369> do<00:01:35.659> actually<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.840> negative

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
was trying to do actually is a negative

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.679 
was trying to do actually is a negative
when<00:01:38.520> people<00:01:38.790> look<00:01:38.820> at<00:01:39.000> Derek<00:01:39.299> Jeter<00:01:39.329> with

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
when people look at Derek Jeter with

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.410 
when people look at Derek Jeter with
that<00:01:39.810> first<00:01:40.049> he'll<00:01:40.290> see<00:01:41.280> my<00:01:41.520> rationale<00:01:42.270> behind

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
that first he'll see my rationale behind

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.260 
that first he'll see my rationale behind
that<00:01:42.720> though<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.439> by<00:01:44.369> saying<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.000> think

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
that though is by saying and I think

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.690 
that though is by saying and I think
that's<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:46.020> sign<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.100> ultimate

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
that's just a sign of the ultimate

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.639 
that's just a sign of the ultimate

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.860 
that overrated but you're talking about
intangibles<00:07:08.550> and<00:07:08.730> off-the-field<00:07:09.150> stuff<00:07:09.480> I

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870 
intangibles and off-the-field stuff I

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.800 
intangibles and off-the-field stuff I
was<00:07:10.050> talking<00:07:10.320> about<00:07:10.350> as<00:07:10.650> a<00:07:10.680> player<00:07:11.630> yeah<00:07:12.630> but

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
was talking about as a player yeah but

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.320 
was talking about as a player yeah but
the<00:07:12.930> intent<00:07:13.320> look<00:07:14.010> the<00:07:14.190> intangibles<00:07:14.910> I<00:07:15.060> think

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 
the intent look the intangibles I think

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.540 
the intent look the intangibles I think
actually<00:07:15.570> matter<00:07:16.139> when<00:07:16.590> you<00:07:16.710> play<00:07:16.950> in<00:07:17.250> a<00:07:17.340> place

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
actually matter when you play in a place

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.969 
actually matter when you play in a place
like<00:07:17.700> New<00:07:18.150> York<00:07:18.450> for<00:07:19.080> a<00:07:19.110> team<00:07:19.500> like<00:07:19.530> the

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 
like New York for a team like the

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:21.560 
like New York for a team like the
Yankees<00:07:20.010> I<00:07:20.490> think<00:07:20.790> that's<00:07:20.970> all<00:07:21.120> part<00:07:21.360> of<00:07:21.479> the

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:21.570 
Yankees I think that's all part of the

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.770 
Yankees I think that's all part of the
package<00:07:22.400> by<00:07:23.400> the<00:07:23.460> way<00:07:23.639> they<00:07:23.760> hated<00:07:24.120> mclovin

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
package by the way they hated mclovin

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.629
