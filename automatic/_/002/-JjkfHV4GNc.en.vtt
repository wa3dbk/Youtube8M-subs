00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.840 
think anybody's read the Bible
cover-to-cover<00:02:50.769> except<00:02:51.370> for<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.549> person<00:02:51.670> who

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
cover-to-cover except for the person who

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.759 
cover-to-cover except for the person who
wrote<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.209> they<00:02:52.420> probably<00:02:52.720> read<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.230> but<00:02:53.410> this

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
wrote it they probably read it but this

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.860 
wrote it they probably read it but this
could<00:02:54.070> be<00:02:54.220> Noah<00:02:54.489> I'm<00:02:54.790> thinking<00:02:55.150> Noah<00:02:55.330> Noah<00:02:55.630> had

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
could be Noah I'm thinking Noah Noah had

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.870 
could be Noah I'm thinking Noah Noah had
white<00:02:56.080> hair<00:02:56.110> no<00:02:56.590> one<00:02:56.739> was<00:02:56.920> looking<00:02:57.070> cool<00:02:57.519> he

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
white hair no one was looking cool he

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.390 
white hair no one was looking cool he
had<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.209> rainbow<00:02:58.570> going<00:02:59.200> on<00:02:59.380> and<00:02:59.650> I'm

probers<00:04:01.270> East<00:04:01.569> right<00:04:01.870> now<00:04:02.050> I<00:04:02.080> think<00:04:02.470> this<00:04:02.590> is

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
probers East right now I think this is

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.080 
probers East right now I think this is
actually<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.010> video<00:04:03.370> game<00:04:03.610> of<00:04:03.819> some<00:04:04.060> sort

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
actually a video game of some sort

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.960 
actually a video game of some sort
that's<00:04:04.930> represented<00:04:05.770> in<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.040> game<00:04:06.340> maybe<00:04:06.640> but

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
that's represented in the game maybe but

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.729 
that's represented in the game maybe but
basically<00:04:07.360> it's<00:04:07.720> just<00:04:08.140> kind<00:04:08.500> of<00:04:08.560> funny

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
basically it's just kind of funny

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.410 
basically it's just kind of funny
because<00:04:08.920> they're<00:04:09.370> probing<00:04:09.819> you<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.270> they're

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
because they're probing you and they're

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.030 
because they're probing you and they're
aliens<00:04:10.930> they<00:04:11.110> probably<00:04:11.319> some<00:04:11.560> weird<00:04:11.739> stuff
