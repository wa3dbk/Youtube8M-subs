00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.040 
hole jig to the right height and don't
forget<00:02:49.340> about<00:02:49.460> adjusting<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.480> collar<00:02:50.720> on

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
forget about adjusting the collar on

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.730 
forget about adjusting the collar on
your<00:02:51.200> drill<00:02:51.590> bit<00:02:51.620> as<00:02:51.980> well<00:02:53.110> simply<00:02:54.110> drop<00:02:54.710> a

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
your drill bit as well simply drop a

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.610 
your drill bit as well simply drop a
clamp<00:02:55.160> on<00:02:55.430> here<00:02:55.820> just<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.690> secure<00:02:57.080> down<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.530> the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
clamp on here just to secure down to the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.970 
clamp on here just to secure down to the
table<00:02:59.500> drop<00:03:00.500> my<00:03:00.710> piece<00:03:00.980> in<00:03:01.250> Center<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:03.470> I

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
table drop my piece in Center it and I

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:16.800 
table drop my piece in Center it and I
can<00:03:04.190> drill<00:03:04.400> these<00:03:04.550> tools

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:31.350 

and<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.260> other<00:03:18.380> piece<00:03:18.650> as<00:03:18.830> well

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.450 

and<00:03:32.360> now<00:03:32.600> what<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.840> did<00:03:33.050> was<00:03:33.260> took<00:03:33.470> my<00:03:33.650> 34<00:03:34.280> inch

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
and now what I did was took my 34 inch

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.900 
and now what I did was took my 34 inch
piece<00:03:34.790> measure<00:03:35.390> 24<00:03:36.230> inches<00:03:36.560> up<00:03:36.770> put<00:03:37.610> a<00:03:37.640> line

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
piece measure 24 inches up put a line

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.480 
piece measure 24 inches up put a line
there<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.690> what<00:03:38.900> I<00:03:38.930> can<00:03:39.200> do<00:03:39.320> now<00:03:39.530> is<00:03:39.860> set<00:03:40.310> this

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
there and what I can do now is set this

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.770 
there and what I can do now is set this
piece<00:03:41.020> perfectly<00:03:42.020> along<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.680> line<00:03:43.570> take<00:03:44.570> my

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
piece perfectly along the line take my

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.430 
piece perfectly along the line take my
face<00:03:45.200> clamp<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:46.210> pop<00:03:47.210> it<00:03:47.450> down<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:47.690> then

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
face clamp and pop it down and then

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.920 
face clamp and pop it down and then
screw<00:03:48.800> my<00:03:48.920> pocket<00:03:49.310> hole<00:03:49.400> screws<00:03:49.430> in<00:03:49.940> and<00:03:50.660> these

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
screw my pocket hole screws in and these

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.200 
screw my pocket hole screws in and these
pocket<00:03:51.440> hole<00:03:51.560> screws<00:03:51.590> are<00:03:52.220> 2<00:03:52.520> and<00:03:52.700> 1/2<00:03:52.760> inch

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
pocket hole screws are 2 and 1/2 inch

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.050 
pocket hole screws are 2 and 1/2 inch
pocket<00:03:53.480> hole<00:03:53.870> screws<00:03:53.900> that<00:03:54.860> are<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:55.670> Blue

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
pocket hole screws that are the Blue

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.390 
pocket hole screws that are the Blue
Coat<00:03:56.540> series<00:03:57.140> so<00:03:57.620> that<00:03:57.800> means<00:03:58.010> that<00:03:58.220> they're

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
Coat series so that means that they're

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.370 
Coat series so that means that they're
weather<00:03:58.610> resistant<00:03:59.330> that's<00:03:59.810> probably<00:04:00.110> a<00:04:00.230> good

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
weather resistant that's probably a good

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.020 
weather resistant that's probably a good
idea<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.740> have<00:04:00.980> so<00:04:01.280> that<00:04:01.430> your<00:04:01.550> screws<00:04:01.850> don't

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
idea to have so that your screws don't

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:14.110 
idea to have so that your screws don't
rust<00:04:02.330> out

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.580 

now<00:04:15.120> what<00:04:15.270> I<00:04:15.300> need<00:04:15.390> to<00:04:15.630> do<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:15.900> attach<00:04:16.050> this

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
now what I need to do is attach this

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.350 
now what I need to do is attach this
center<00:04:16.890> brace<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.340> I'm<00:04:17.610> gonna<00:04:17.790> measure<00:04:18.000> ten

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:18.360 
center brace so I'm gonna measure ten

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.210 
center brace so I'm gonna measure ten
and<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.570> half<00:04:18.690> inches<00:04:19.080> down<00:04:19.290> and<00:04:19.530> ten<00:04:20.040> and<00:04:20.190> a

well I have one side of it done and now

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.629 
well I have one side of it done and now
I<00:04:52.810> need<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.200> make<00:04:53.380> another<00:04:53.710> doing<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.310> exact

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
I need to make another doing the exact

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.330 
I need to make another doing the exact
same<00:04:54.850> process<00:04:55.290> so<00:04:56.290> now<00:04:56.530> I<00:04:56.560> need<00:04:56.680> to<00:04:56.889> put<00:04:57.070> two

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
same process so now I need to put two

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.879 
same process so now I need to put two
pocket<00:04:57.820> holes<00:04:58.030> in<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.450> end<00:04:58.630> of<00:04:58.990> each<00:04:59.470> of<00:04:59.740> these

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
pocket holes in the end of each of these

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.090 
pocket holes in the end of each of these
two<00:05:00.130> by<00:05:00.280> four<00:05:00.550> so<00:05:00.790> I<00:05:00.850> have<00:05:01.000> two<00:05:01.210> here<00:05:01.510> two<00:05:02.020> here

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
two by four so I have two here two here

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.710 
two by four so I have two here two here
football<00:05:03.100> upside<00:05:03.490> down<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:03.940> put<00:05:04.240> two<00:05:04.450> on<00:05:04.510> the

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:15.830 
football upside down and put two on the
other<00:05:04.840> side

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.840 

so<00:05:16.840> basically<00:05:17.170> what<00:05:17.410> I<00:05:17.440> have<00:05:17.680> here<00:05:17.920> is<00:05:18.100> my<00:05:18.130> 45

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
so basically what I have here is my 45

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.570 
so basically what I have here is my 45
inch<00:05:19.090> board<00:05:19.420> and<00:05:19.930> I'm<00:05:20.230> taking<00:05:20.710> the<00:05:20.920> seat<00:05:21.250> part

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
inch board and I'm taking the seat part

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.790 
inch board and I'm taking the seat part
of<00:05:21.730> this<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.510> I'm<00:05:22.750> going<00:05:22.900> to<00:05:22.930> screw<00:05:23.290> it<00:05:23.410> in<00:05:23.530> so

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
of this and I'm going to screw it in so

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.010 
of this and I'm going to screw it in so
it's<00:05:23.980> exactly<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:24.820> same<00:05:25.030> height<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.570> then

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
it's exactly the same height and then

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.140 
it's exactly the same height and then
I'll<00:05:26.140> put<00:05:26.380> this<00:05:26.560> on<00:05:26.800> this<00:05:27.040> side<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:27.850> I'll<00:05:27.970> do

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
I'll put this on this side and I'll do

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:45.410 
I'll put this on this side and I'll do
the<00:05:28.300> exact<00:05:28.690> same<00:05:28.720> thing

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.730 

so<00:05:46.420> know<00:05:46.630> what<00:05:46.780> I'm<00:05:46.930> doing<00:05:47.230> is<00:05:47.350> putting<00:05:47.500> these

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
so know what I'm doing is putting these

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.830 
so know what I'm doing is putting these
supports<00:05:48.190> in<00:05:48.310> here<00:05:48.490> and<00:05:48.880> they're<00:05:49.030> set<00:05:49.330> three

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
supports in here and they're set three

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.250 
supports in here and they're set three
and<00:05:49.990> a<00:05:50.020> quarter<00:05:50.230> inches<00:05:50.560> below<00:05:51.370> so<00:05:52.300> that<00:05:52.540> my

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
and a quarter inches below so that my

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.670 
and a quarter inches below so that my
pieces<00:05:53.740> will<00:05:54.550> fit<00:05:54.760> exactly<00:05:55.570> in<00:05:56.320> there<00:05:56.470> and

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
pieces will fit exactly in there and

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.800 
pieces will fit exactly in there and
will<00:05:56.860> be<00:05:56.890> flush<00:05:57.310> on<00:05:57.520> their<00:05:57.670> surface<00:05:58.150> so<00:05:58.540> I<00:05:58.570> put

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
will be flush on their surface so I put

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.290 
will be flush on their surface so I put
one<00:05:58.840> here<00:05:59.380> one<00:05:59.890> in<00:05:59.980> this<00:06:00.070> corner<00:06:00.520> and<00:06:00.730> I'll<00:06:01.090> put

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
one here one in this corner and I'll put
