eyes and I'm going to keep them if the
nose<00:00:51.120> were<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> draw<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.890> UM<00:00:53.190> line<00:00:53.460> straight

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
nose were to draw to UM line straight

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.110 
nose were to draw to UM line straight
I'm<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> keep<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.899> um<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:56.879> see

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.979 
I'm going to keep it um as you can see
far<00:00:57.300> away<00:00:57.390> from<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> nose<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> another

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
far away from the nose there so another

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.609 
far away from the nose there so another
big<00:01:01.230> either<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.920> now<00:01:02.910> what<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> want<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.660> do<00:01:03.960> is

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
big either and now what I want to do is

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.640 
big either and now what I want to do is
I'm<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> trace<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.970> back<00:01:06.650> from

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
I'm just going to trace that back from

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.210 
I'm just going to trace that back from
the<00:01:07.740> eye<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.729> connect<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> nose

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
the eye to connect that to the nose

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.070 
the eye to connect that to the nose
which<00:01:11.220> draws<00:01:11.549> kind<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.450> snout<00:01:13.049> I

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
which draws kind of like on a snout I

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.300 
which draws kind of like on a snout I
guess<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.799> lack<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.369> better<00:01:14.520> words<00:01:16.100> all<00:01:17.100> right

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
guess for lack of better words all right

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.499 
guess for lack of better words all right
and<00:01:17.460> then<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> eyes<00:01:18.000> I'm<00:01:18.180> going<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.390> draw

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
and then for the eyes I'm going to draw

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.859 
and then for the eyes I'm going to draw
two<00:01:18.780> circles<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> inside<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.939> I'm<00:01:21.840> going

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
two circles on the inside and I'm going

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.800 
two circles on the inside and I'm going
to<00:01:21.990> color<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> rest<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.740> black<00:01:23.720> just<00:01:24.720> like

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
to color the rest of black just like

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.340 
to color the rest of black just like
that<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:26.210> then<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.689> some<00:01:27.930> detail<00:01:28.259> I'm

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that and then just for some detail I'm

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.460 
that and then just for some detail I'm
going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> draw<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:29.009> few<00:01:29.040> palm<00:01:29.909> dots<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:31.079> that

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
going to draw a few palm dots like that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.140 
going to draw a few palm dots like that
and<00:01:31.560> then<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:33.140> little<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.530> guess<00:01:35.159> dimples<00:01:35.820> maybe

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and then a little I guess dimples maybe

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.679 
and then a little I guess dimples maybe
for<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> cheeks<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.880> for<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.970> ears<00:01:39.180> I'm<00:01:39.479> just

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
for the cheeks and for the ears I'm just

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.340 
for the cheeks and for the ears I'm just
going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.869> draw<00:01:40.140> two<00:01:40.409> pretty<00:01:40.710> small<00:01:42.350> circles

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
going to draw two pretty small circles

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.999 
going to draw two pretty small circles
there<00:01:44.509> just<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
there just like that and then for the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.010 
there just like that and then for the
body<00:01:47.250> I'm<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> go<00:01:48.390> ahead<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.840> draw<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
body I'm going to go ahead and draw the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.139 
body I'm going to go ahead and draw the
back<00:01:49.350> first<00:01:49.979> which<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.820> you're<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.060> be

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
back first which is you're going to be

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.469 
back first which is you're going to be
right<00:01:51.360> kind<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.840> where<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> mouth<00:01:52.350> left's<00:01:53.040> off

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
right kind of where the mouth left's off

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.020 
right kind of where the mouth left's off
and<00:01:55.219> then<00:01:56.219> I'm<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.340> going<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.670> draw<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> curve

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
and then I'm just going to draw a curve

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.539 
and then I'm just going to draw a curve
there<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.540> leg<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.770> I'm<00:01:59.369> also

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
there for the leg and then I'm also
