 really very very easy to use 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.700
 in fact single file truth comes 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.770
 from a tree that grows to blades 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.020
 China in North America and that was 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.180
 already used by the Indians actually 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.340
 that he used for his anti 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.770

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.630

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.210
 easy to use for us we did not 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.820
 no need to grind the leaves of 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.200
 do a whole alchemy just 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.240
 a few drops are enough 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.329
 you will see to relieve some 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.670
 pains so go for these first 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.009
 recipes then a way to use 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.020
 the essential oil of wintergreen is 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.790
 against tendonitis and there you have 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.570
 therefore need this oil more than one 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.990
 vegetable oil 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.390
 I suggest you take it instead 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.740
 macadamia vegetable oil or oil 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.810
 vegetable of St. John's wort 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.520
 and there it is very simple you go 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.869
 actually take 5 drops of oils 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.420
 plants in which you go 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.190
 incorporated three drops of gaulle perished 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.650
 and then you actually practiced 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.110
 massages at the regional level 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.180
 painful in your tendonitis 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.680
 at least three times a day during 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.300
 a few days and you will see in 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.370
 does that allow you to 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.920
 relieve very very quickly of this 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.030
 pain related to tendonitis but 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.540

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.450

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.980
 so really it's an oil 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.010
 extraordinary for tendonitis 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.049
 so for pain pains of 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.540
 rheumatism also sprains 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.560

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.989
 rosemary and still vegetable oil 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.630

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.190
 take fifteen thousand liters of 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.410
