very easy thing to make and it is also
something<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:12.049> is<00:01:13.049> not<00:01:14.040> expensive<00:01:14.400> at<00:01:14.790> all

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
something that is not expensive at all

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.820 
something that is not expensive at all
very<00:01:15.390> inexpensive<00:01:16.380> these<00:01:16.560> are<00:01:16.710> usually

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
very inexpensive these are usually

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.880 
very inexpensive these are usually
things<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.369> people<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.680> if

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
things that people have and so and if

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.530 
things that people have and so and if
you<00:01:20.009> can't<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.580> don't<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.060> spray<00:01:21.330> bald

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
you can't if you don't have a spray bald

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.289 
you can't if you don't have a spray bald
and<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.020> put<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> container

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
and you can just put it in a container

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.850 
and you can just put it in a container
it's<00:01:24.299> fine<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.960> don't<00:01:25.080> need<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> spray<00:01:25.680> bottle

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
it's fine you don't need a spray bottle

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.160 
it's fine you don't need a spray bottle
but<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.520> would<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:26.970> best<00:01:27.330> because<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
but that would be best because it is the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.770 
but that would be best because it is the
easiest<00:01:28.470> way<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> apply<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.189> but<00:01:29.579> yeah<00:01:30.509> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
easiest way to apply it but yeah so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.179 
easiest way to apply it but yeah so
that's<00:01:30.900> how<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.200> make<00:01:31.380> your<00:01:31.500> own<00:01:31.590> heat

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
that's how you make your own heat

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.280 
that's how you make your own heat
protectant<00:01:32.729> spray<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.860> said<00:01:34.920> before<00:01:35.100> um

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
protectant spray and as I said before um

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.120 
protectant spray and as I said before um
you<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.680> add<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:38.369> many<00:01:39.079> like<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
you can just add as many like of the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.950 
you can just add as many like of the
things<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> need<00:01:41.939> depending<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.810> how
