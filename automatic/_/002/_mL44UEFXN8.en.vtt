00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:40.089 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.570 

you<00:05:41.089> know<00:05:41.120> it<00:05:41.270> doesn't<00:05:41.419> have<00:05:41.599> to<00:05:41.689> always<00:05:41.870> be

you know it doesn't have to always be

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.209 
you know it doesn't have to always be
like<00:05:43.580> that<00:05:43.639> so<00:05:44.599> the<00:05:45.050> the<00:05:45.319> three<00:05:45.710> chords<00:05:46.069> of<00:05:46.159> the

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:46.219
