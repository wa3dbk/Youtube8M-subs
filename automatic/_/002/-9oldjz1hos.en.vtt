other drivers in the United States

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
other drivers in the United States
that's<00:01:06.600> because<00:01:06.870> they're<00:01:07.050> rude<00:01:07.440> though<00:01:08.250> they

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
that's because they're rude though they

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.210 
that's because they're rude though they
are<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.910> they're<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.050> rude<00:01:10.320> little<00:01:10.890> damn

even<00:01:27.240> look<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.810> then<00:01:27.900> they<00:01:28.020> go<00:01:28.530> over<00:01:28.650> without

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
even look and then they go over without

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.530 
even look and then they go over without
turning<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.520> their<00:01:29.670> blinkers<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.119> I'm<00:01:30.390> like
