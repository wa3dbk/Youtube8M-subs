00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.030 
actually this is this looks like a

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.360 
actually this is this looks like a
better<00:00:28.240> idea<00:00:28.360> I'll<00:00:29.110> try<00:00:29.320> Warren<00:00:29.650> batteries<00:00:30.010> I

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:30.370 
better idea I'll try Warren batteries I

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.910 
better idea I'll try Warren batteries I
time<00:00:30.940> it<00:00:30.970> 24<00:00:31.540> minutes<00:00:31.990> ah<00:00:32.320> you<00:00:32.560> don't<00:00:32.680> have<00:00:32.830> an

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
time it 24 minutes ah you don't have an

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.270 
time it 24 minutes ah you don't have an
alarm<00:00:33.100> on<00:00:33.310> it<00:00:33.400> no<00:00:33.850> not<00:00:34.270> yet<00:00:35.160> there's<00:00:36.160> no

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
alarm on it no not yet there's no

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.550 
alarm on it no not yet there's no
telemetering<00:00:36.700> or<00:00:36.970> you<00:00:37.930> could<00:00:38.080> just<00:00:38.110> take<00:00:38.470> a

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560 
telemetering or you could just take a

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.330 
telemetering or you could just take a
small<00:00:38.950> buzzer<00:00:39.160> on<00:00:39.340> it<00:00:39.430> yeah<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:41.739> guess<00:00:42.070> that

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
small buzzer on it yeah I guess that

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.950 
small buzzer on it yeah I guess that
would<00:00:42.430> even<00:00:42.580> yeah<00:00:42.820> even<00:00:43.090> just<00:00:43.270> few<00:00:43.540> grams<00:00:43.750> of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
would even yeah even just few grams of

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.790 
would even yeah even just few grams of
make<00:00:44.500> a<00:00:44.530> difference<00:00:44.860> is<00:00:49.260> no<00:00:50.260> idea<00:00:50.530> where<00:00:50.680> is

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
make a difference is no idea where is

00:00:50.800 --> 00:01:00.000 
make a difference is no idea where is
going<00:00:51.070> until<00:00:51.309> I<00:00:51.400> hear<00:00:51.580> the<00:00:51.670> sound<00:00:58.800> I've<00:00:59.800> only

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
going until I hear the sound I've only

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.669 
going until I hear the sound I've only
got<00:01:00.160> return<00:01:00.400> to<00:01:00.550> home

00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:04.679 

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:26.930 

yeah<00:01:05.679> with<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:05.950> water<00:01:06.130> pressure<00:01:06.670> you<00:01:06.939> can<00:01:07.090> see

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:02:01.330 

so<00:01:27.540> cool

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.160 

and<00:02:01.939> I<00:02:02.030> think<00:02:02.090> it's<00:02:02.359> the<00:02:02.479> battery<00:02:02.630> connection

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
and I think it's the battery connection

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:24.720 
and I think it's the battery connection
oh<00:02:03.320> yeah<00:02:03.679> almost<00:02:04.100> oh<00:02:07.090> yeah<00:02:08.090> is<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.840> battery

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.790
