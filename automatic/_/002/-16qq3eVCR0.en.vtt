00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
these sunflower cookies and let's get

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.749 
these sunflower cookies and let's get
right<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.899> it<00:00:04.230> I've<00:00:04.560> got<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> relatively<00:00:05.430> large

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
right to it I've got a relatively large

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.940 
right to it I've got a relatively large
piping<00:00:06.330> tip<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.750> think<00:00:06.960> it<00:00:07.080> was<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.259> number<00:00:07.649> three

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
piping tip I think it was a number three

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.360 
piping tip I think it was a number three
and<00:00:08.160> my<00:00:08.309> piping<00:00:08.700> bag<00:00:08.940> some<00:00:09.870> yellow<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.099> gold

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
and my piping bag some yellow and gold

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.589 
and my piping bag some yellow and gold
colored<00:00:12.059> icing<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:13.130> now<00:00:14.130> I'm<00:00:14.460> just<00:00:14.880> outlining

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
colored icing and now I'm just outlining

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.800 
colored icing and now I'm just outlining
each<00:00:16.350> petal<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.220> want<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.910> create<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.210> little<00:00:18.600> bit

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
each petal I want to create a little bit

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.230 
each petal I want to create a little bit
of<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.050> textured<00:00:19.710> look<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.340> each<00:00:20.490> pedal<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.029> don't

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
of a textured look to each pedal I don't

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.509 
of a textured look to each pedal I don't
want<00:00:21.359> them<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.660> be<00:00:21.779> flat<00:00:22.170> like<00:00:22.949> normally<00:00:23.189> you

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
want them to be flat like normally you

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.250 
want them to be flat like normally you
would<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:23.820> outline<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.480> flood<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.779> pedal

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
would just outline and flood the pedal

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.560 
would just outline and flood the pedal
this<00:00:25.439> time<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.279> want<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.609> do<00:00:26.760> lines<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
this time I just want to do lines and

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.330 
this time I just want to do lines and
you'll<00:00:27.689> see<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.019> gives<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.410> nice<00:00:28.619> kind<00:00:29.099> of

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
you'll see it gives a nice kind of

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.850 
you'll see it gives a nice kind of
roughly<00:00:29.789> looking<00:00:30.420> petal<00:00:30.900> more<00:00:31.500> realistic<00:00:32.189> I

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
roughly looking petal more realistic I

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.940 
roughly looking petal more realistic I
did<00:00:34.860> my<00:00:35.070> first<00:00:35.489> row<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.090> lines<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.260> my<00:00:37.440> petals<00:00:37.829> I

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
did my first row of lines on my petals I

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.100 
did my first row of lines on my petals I
let<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.370> crust<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.969> now<00:00:39.090> I'm<00:00:39.270> coming<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
let it crust and now I'm coming in and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.119 
let it crust and now I'm coming in and
doing<00:00:40.860> another<00:00:41.610> pass<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.050> same<00:00:43.350> thing<00:00:43.710> except

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
doing another pass the same thing except

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.459 
doing another pass the same thing except
i'm<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.520> laying<00:00:44.940> them<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.450> top<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.170> first

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
i'm just laying them on top of the first

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.279 
i'm just laying them on top of the first
row<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.860> lines<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.629> creating<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
row of lines and you see it's creating a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.319 
row of lines and you see it's creating a
little<00:00:49.559> bit<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.860> textured<00:00:50.399> effect<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
little bit of a textured effect on the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.779 
little bit of a textured effect on the
pedals<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.020> i'm<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.770> again<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.460> let<00:00:53.610> this

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
pedals and i'm going again to let this

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.970 
pedals and i'm going again to let this
crust<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.390> now<00:00:54.570> come<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> section

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
crust and now come in with the section

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
crust and now come in with the section
in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> middle

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.940 

now<00:01:07.000> I'm<00:01:07.270> working<00:01:07.479> on<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:08.140> center<00:01:08.619> of<00:01:08.650> my

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
now I'm working on the center of my

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.490 
now I'm working on the center of my
flower<00:01:09.280> about<00:01:09.700> some<00:01:09.909> electric<00:01:10.390> green<00:01:10.659> and<00:01:11.020> I'm

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
flower about some electric green and I'm

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.890 
flower about some electric green and I'm
dropping<00:01:11.979> in<00:01:12.100> some<00:01:12.340> orange<00:01:12.790> in<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.240> wet<00:01:13.390> icing

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
dropping in some orange in the wet icing

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.810 
dropping in some orange in the wet icing
and<00:01:14.049> then<00:01:14.200> I'm<00:01:14.380> dropping<00:01:14.860> some<00:01:15.159> yellow<00:01:15.520> icing

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
and then I'm dropping some yellow icing

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.359 
and then I'm dropping some yellow icing
in<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.360> middle<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.720> that<00:01:19.979> once<00:01:20.979> i<00:01:21.159> was<00:01:21.310> done

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
in the middle of that once i was done

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.300 
in the middle of that once i was done
this<00:01:21.759> I<00:01:21.940> decided<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.810> airbrush<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.470> edge<00:01:23.920> of

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
this I decided to airbrush the edge of

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.279 
this I decided to airbrush the edge of
my<00:01:24.369> petals<00:01:25.090> towards<00:01:25.539> the<00:01:25.690> center<00:01:26.080> there<00:01:26.259> I

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
my petals towards the center there I

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:27.300 
my petals towards the center there I
thought<00:01:26.560> it<00:01:26.649> was<00:01:26.740> missing<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.190> little

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
thought it was missing a little

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.310 
thought it was missing a little
something<00:01:27.430> and<00:01:27.940> now<00:01:28.509> when<00:01:28.720> I<00:01:28.750> come<00:01:29.020> in<00:01:29.170> with

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
something and now when I come in with

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.740 
something and now when I come in with
those<00:01:29.500> dots<00:01:30.009> they<00:01:30.670> stand<00:01:31.030> out<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.240> little<00:01:31.479> bit

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
those dots they stand out a little bit

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.920 
those dots they stand out a little bit
more<00:01:32.140> so<00:01:32.770> I<00:01:32.799> just<00:01:33.159> did<00:01:33.399> a<00:01:33.430> border<00:01:34.000> of<00:01:34.180> dots<00:01:34.450> all

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
more so I just did a border of dots all

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.109 
more so I just did a border of dots all
the<00:01:35.170> way<00:01:35.289> around<00:01:35.409> my<00:01:35.830> green<00:01:36.130> circle<00:01:36.729> leaving<00:01:37.030> a

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
the way around my green circle leaving a

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.790 
the way around my green circle leaving a
space<00:01:37.240> in<00:01:37.600> between<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:38.110> be<00:01:38.200> able<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.470> come<00:01:38.649> in

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
space in between to be able to come in

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.340 
space in between to be able to come in
with<00:01:38.950> some<00:01:39.250> brown<00:01:39.490> later<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:40.210> then<00:01:40.810> just<00:01:41.200> a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
with some brown later and then just a

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.440 
with some brown later and then just a
bunch<00:01:41.619> of<00:01:41.830> little<00:01:42.039> dots<00:01:42.310> all<00:01:42.759> over<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:43.179> place

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
bunch of little dots all over the place

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.380 
bunch of little dots all over the place
I<00:01:43.720> just<00:01:43.990> wanted<00:01:44.440> it<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.069> look<00:01:45.610> kind<00:01:45.970> of<00:01:46.060> more

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
I just wanted it to look kind of more

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.590 
I just wanted it to look kind of more
textured<00:01:47.229> and<00:01:47.259> less<00:01:48.009> flat<00:01:48.580> as<00:01:48.970> far<00:01:49.240> as<00:01:49.390> my

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
textured and less flat as far as my

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.090 
textured and less flat as far as my
design<00:01:50.080> goes<00:01:51.720> how<00:01:52.720> to<00:01:52.780> give<00:01:53.110> my<00:01:53.440> flowers<00:01:54.069> a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
design goes how to give my flowers a

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.639 
design goes how to give my flowers a
little<00:01:54.429> bit<00:01:54.580> more<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:54.909> a<00:01:55.090> frozen<00:01:55.360> fever<00:01:55.929> feel

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
little bit more of a frozen fever feel

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.609 
little bit more of a frozen fever feel
to<00:01:56.950> them<00:01:57.130> I'm<00:01:57.640> adding<00:01:58.240> some<00:01:58.270> white<00:01:58.960> icing

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
to them I'm adding some white icing

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.130 
to them I'm adding some white icing
which<00:01:59.860> I<00:02:00.039> will<00:02:00.250> be<00:02:00.280> dunking<00:02:00.850> in<00:02:01.090> sanding<00:02:01.720> sugar

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
which I will be dunking in sanding sugar
