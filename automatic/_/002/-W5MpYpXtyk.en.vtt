00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 gp2 tomorrow instead for the pilots 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.350
 as lin square kimi raikkonen 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.780
 day dedicated to worldliness like 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.960
 tradition wants to montecarlo in the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.330
 monk principality with and pilots who 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.400
 will be protagonists of some 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.199
 manifestations among these also one 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.199
 parade but the unlucky moments 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.050
 perfect because now has problems e 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.240
 obviously the conditions are not yet 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.760
 good to get on the track though anyway 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.800
 his problem car is not ready 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.020
 now they don't tell us what I am 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.280
 trying to look around 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.129
 I think they are working on 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.460
 drive box then or who took a 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.739
 blow back in this round you should 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.750
 make one plus one you can see others 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.720
 25 that we cannot talk about timing 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.140
 interesting on the tour that of rai 2 32 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.050
 and therefore who has tried 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.809
 we see kimi raikkonen as he had 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.390
 early margin fell from 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.340
 machine 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.290
 admitted that perhaps we know well and 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.019
 precisely on the dry tires from 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.900
 wet to use for the races and here are the 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:13.390
 images of kimi raikkonen going towards 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.750
 the motorhome is still quiet, yes 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.940
 stops signing autographs is granted to 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.369
 fans present there in the area of 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.950
 entrance of the entrance turnstiles to the 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.930
 somehow lucky paddocks of 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.030
 these fans believe in staying there 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.520
 instead of going to the stands to see 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.440
 the action of the formula 1 now to whom 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.020
 aims also will go towards the motorhome 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.840
 della ferrari and then will have the briefing with 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.670
 engineers for evaluations of 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.590
 this day we rely on data 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.720
 of the first free practice session 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.280
 and yes because they are a confirmation that anyway 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.460
 we will never give up because it is very difficult 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.440
 then meet again in politics on Saturday 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.970
 for example with a dry track and 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.100
 half wet however it is very spectacular 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.740
 because it is true that there was little but the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.360
 public that is for example a mirabeau o 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.470
 towards the area of â€‹â€‹also of raskas sees the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.470
 cars that go wide 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.850
 on the track also nico rosberg then the two 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:15.970
 mercedes pilots while we see virtue 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.970
 kimi raikkonen's girlfriend virtanen 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.920
 the motorhome ferrari then went out 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.990
 from that privileged location e 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.760
 observer for this action of 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.890
 predictable given that kimi raikkonen is 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.570
 already abundantly returned 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.130
 within the garden panorama of the 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.960
 chemical mother- in- law because i 'm 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.000
 asking how between the two 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.550
 two things before returning to the cabin from 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.500
 carlo vanzini a face instead kimi 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.710
 raikkonen when he had to go down the 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.520
 his car at half an hour from the end no 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.250
 to worry we know what happened 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.420
 it should not be repeated at any time 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.760
 of the weekend 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.620
 pity because he does not know he does not have the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.150
 feeling with the supersoft rubber we know 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.880
 that kimi is a key driver of the feeling 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.070
 so it won't help on weekends though a 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.660
 Reliability level is not for 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.040
 don't worry and then take advantage of a 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.050
 assists the car that the fans said 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.340
 ferrari should come here on Saturday 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.350
 and Sunday to wet the track a little 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.370
 smoking you can give yourself no i hope 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.230
 however both a dry track the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.330
 safe qualification is a monk qualification 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.790
 helps and spectacular Saturday there 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.860
 we have fun safely after Sunday for the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.660
 race we'll see why it's true that the weather 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.900
 it's also not 100 percent sure that 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.900
 be dry
