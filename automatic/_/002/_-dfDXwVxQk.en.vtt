 and the band like being here is I hate myself 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.529
 47 motorcycles reporting with a new video 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.439
 of gt5 online later in this video les 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.260
 will teach how to put the cars of 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.300
 Luxury your friends' cars to the garage 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.230
 Well, because I've already uploaded a video of how 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.430
 bring that environment your fear of a hundred and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.719
 totally free ok and well if you remember 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.489
 that he had told them he did not know if 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.040
 there was a new trick to put the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.770
 car to the garage 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.660
 Well, if it exists, it exists, although it is almost 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.149
 the same as before but has some 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.860
 variations ok and well for this one we're going to 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.289
 buy two friends what we are going to do 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.930
 three in total as was also in the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.789
 passed then we are going to park the car 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.699
 what we want as I am 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.350
 accommodating or that the owner of the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.329
 car does not have to be seeing at all 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.339
 moment the third friend who was the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.750
 second friend forgiveness has to be in 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.450
 another session ok 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.400
 then that other friend is going to start a 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.830
 starting any I recommend a 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.200
 career ok and what he's going to do is that 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.760
 he's going to invite them ok but he's going to be in 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.340
 another session is not yours 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.320
 ok here in this session can only 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.530
 be the friend who is going to spend the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.060
 car and had to if it does not follow another 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.180
 friend so that the car does not look like 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.130
 then already up the car they want 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.690
 replace by the one that is outside I by 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.510
 example I'm going to replace this truck 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.820
 how to see kim joo saul thank you for 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.470
 bastard inviting me just invited him 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.170
 is in another session as I told you and here 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.869
 let's accept and accelerate it 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.330
 time that from account has to be 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.700
 there accelerate at the same time you have 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.830
 to be just at the same time who 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.570
 you hear look while we're 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.940
 looking towards the cloud you have to 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.190
 listen to the gate that opens ok 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.619
 there in that way we will know that no longer 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.479
 it came out that and here so easy already with 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.160
 let's go in, your friend does not have to be 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.229
 the game or that you have to 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.810
 go out first so that this goes well 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.100
 when you give them a chance they go out to this 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.410
 exit 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.560
 we hope that here they are going to have to be 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.410
 very fast why then because it's going to 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.820
 put everything gray and they will have to run 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.280
 before that because there is like a 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.950
 time but to cases to arrive a 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.840
 matter is that you can take one or more 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.660
 attempts but you keep trying because 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.550
 that will come out will come out ok 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.220
 well I'm like they saw I told them 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.620
 it gets all gray and what you have to 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.770
 to do is to run to the car or not 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.620
 they are greeting haha ​​good as they see 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.140
 it looks and we appear like that but the car 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.000
 disappears and the car does not seem outside 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.860
 from the garage or anything ok 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.970
 then now what follows is that 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.820
 we have to enter our garage 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.510
 because inside the garage will be the 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.790
 car today something I forgot to say 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.710
 this trick will have to do with 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.440
 your first garage with the second garage 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.030
 not because because the second garages 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.780
 as they just left those are already 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.040
 patched these tickets ok then 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.290
 as I said it has to be in its first 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.880
 garage as you see here is my car the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.490
 just happened that I end up 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.020
 pass but not and is insured and everything 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.140
 and everything is as I told you in the video 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.690
 pass cars so story the environment 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.100
 totally free do the same and then 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.270
 also as I told you, it can work 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.450
 for the infinite money they bring it make 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.850
 this trick and then they sell it ok the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.360
 network is very close to me if it is very 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.090
 well all this the truth and well 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.610
 now let's go for good we're 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.430
 outside 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.710
 and good all candle that is not even click the 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.620
 friend juan asaja 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.140
 Well, as you see here back here is 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.470
 the environment that I just passed the 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.180
 same as I bring, or both are 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.310
 friend does not lose the car or that in any 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.190
 moment only when we do this 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.410
 gray to your friend will it seem that your 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.850
 car was destroyed but the only thing that 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.850
 they have to do is call amours 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.770
 mutual ok and it's all that simple and 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.480
 to do the video procedure 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.730
 that I told them in 13 that environment 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.010
 totally free and founded 100 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.450
 it is also the same procedure a 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.790
 friend has to be watching the car 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.350
 so that it does not disappear or that I have put 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.600
 in friends this has been all I hope that 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.790
 you liked it, you know if you liked it 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.890
 like and if they have any doubt as 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.410
 comment or not here I am always 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.750
 commenting on the videos as soon as I can ok 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.880
