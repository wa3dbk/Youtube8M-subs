milliampere<00:00:50.640> battery<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.269> means<00:00:51.479> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
milliampere battery that means the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.119 
milliampere battery that means the
battery<00:00:51.839> is<00:00:51.989> even<00:00:52.379> bigger<00:00:52.530> than<00:00:52.650> the<00:00:52.830> one<00:00:53.010> from

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
battery is even bigger than the one from

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.119 
battery is even bigger than the one from
the<00:00:53.250> galaxy<00:00:53.519> note<00:00:53.960> 2<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.409> we<00:00:55.949> should

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the galaxy note 2 so we should

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.240 
the galaxy note 2 so we should
definitely<00:00:56.339> get<00:00:57.299> all<00:00:57.989> day<00:00:58.320> battery<00:00:58.559> life<00:00:58.979> out

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
definitely get all day battery life out

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.469 
definitely get all day battery life out
of<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.580> and<00:00:59.790> just<00:00:59.970> to<00:01:00.059> give<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.330> an<00:01:00.390> idea

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
of this and just to give you an idea

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.619 
of this and just to give you an idea
about<00:01:01.049> the<00:01:01.589> sheer<00:01:01.799> size<00:01:02.040> of<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.489> they<00:01:03.360> just

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
about the sheer size of it they just

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.460 
about the sheer size of it they just
hold<00:01:03.839> it<00:01:03.989> next<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.470> galaxy<00:01:04.769> note<00:01:05.100> 2<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
hold it next to a galaxy note 2 here and

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.130 
hold it next to a galaxy note 2 here and
so<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> 5.5<00:01:08.490> inch<00:01:08.790> device<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
so this is a 5.5 inch device this is a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.260 
so this is a 5.5 inch device this is a
six<00:01:10.680> inch<00:01:10.890> device<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.610> definitely<00:01:11.850> see

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
six inch device you can definitely see

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.390 
six inch device you can definitely see
there's<00:01:12.870> a<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.020> bit<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.860> difference<00:01:14.250> in

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
there's a little bit of a difference in

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.810 
there's a little bit of a difference in
sample<00:01:14.580> size<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:16.170> really<00:01:16.620> interesting<00:01:17.490> was

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
sample size but a really interesting was

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.020 
sample size but a really interesting was
it<00:01:18.000> also<00:01:18.450> comes<00:01:18.750> with<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.230> stylus<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:20.760> have<00:01:20.850> also

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
it also comes with a stylus we have also

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.080 
it also comes with a stylus we have also
some<00:01:21.390> cameras<00:01:21.870> there's

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
some cameras there's

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.819 
some cameras there's
I<00:01:23.119> think<00:01:23.299> it's<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.479> two<00:01:23.689> megapixel<00:01:23.899> camera<00:01:24.619> on

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
I think it's a two megapixel camera on

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.459 
I think it's a two megapixel camera on
the<00:01:24.920> front<00:01:25.189> and<00:01:25.549> an<00:01:26.329> 8<00:01:26.600> megapixel<00:01:26.780> camera<00:01:27.409> on

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
the front and an 8 megapixel camera on

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.260 
the front and an 8 megapixel camera on
the<00:01:27.530> back<00:01:28.780> Anika<00:01:29.780> tell<00:01:29.960> stories<00:01:30.500> out<00:01:30.710> there

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
the back Anika tell stories out there

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.330 
the back Anika tell stories out there
just<00:01:32.930> can't<00:01:33.170> tell<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.469> anything<00:01:33.770> about<00:01:34.039> the

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
just can't tell you anything about the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.480 
just can't tell you anything about the
measurements<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:35.179> just<00:01:35.950> how<00:01:36.950> thick<00:01:37.219> it<00:01:37.369> is

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
measurements and just how thick it is

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.999 
measurements and just how thick it is
north<00:01:37.850> in<00:01:38.179> it<00:01:38.329> is<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:39.200> how<00:01:39.229> much<00:01:39.469> it<00:01:39.770> weighs

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
north in it is and how much it weighs

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.310 
north in it is and how much it weighs
right<00:01:40.340> now<00:01:40.549> but<00:01:41.270> in<00:01:41.390> general<00:01:41.539> really<00:01:42.049> nice

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
right now but in general really nice

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.020 
right now but in general really nice

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
device you see this power button over

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.330 
device you see this power button over
here<00:01:44.060> we<00:01:44.450> have<00:01:44.539> a<00:01:44.570> volume<00:01:44.960> control<00:01:44.990> here<00:01:45.920> on

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
here we have a volume control here on

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.080 
here we have a volume control here on
the<00:01:46.549> right<00:01:46.729> side<00:01:47.060> we<00:01:47.359> have<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.259> headset<00:01:48.500> jack<00:01:49.090> on

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
the right side we have a headset jack on

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.510 
the right side we have a headset jack on
the<00:01:50.299> top<00:01:50.569> say<00:01:51.409> anything<00:01:51.770> here<00:01:52.009> on<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.280> right

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
the top say anything here on the right

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.359 
the top say anything here on the right
side<00:01:53.170> ok<00:01:54.170> here<00:01:54.319> we<00:01:54.350> go<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:54.860> i<00:01:54.890> would<00:01:55.159> guess

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
side ok here we go so i would guess

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.709 
side ok here we go so i would guess
there<00:01:56.090> will<00:01:56.179> be<00:01:56.299> a<00:01:56.890> microSD<00:01:57.890> card<00:01:58.159> slot

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
there will be a microSD card slot

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.569 
there will be a microSD card slot
underneath<00:01:59.770> due<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:00.979> fact<00:02:01.189> that<00:02:01.310> this<00:02:01.459> is

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
underneath due to the fact that this is

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.899 
underneath due to the fact that this is
completely<00:02:02.060> sealed<00:02:02.509> in<00:02:02.899> my<00:02:03.049> opinion<00:02:03.909> there

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
completely sealed in my opinion there

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.330 
completely sealed in my opinion there
might<00:02:05.119> be<00:02:05.149> even<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.869> micro<00:02:06.289> sim<00:02:06.530> card<00:02:06.829> or<00:02:07.009> sim

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
might be even the micro sim card or sim

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.289 
might be even the micro sim card or sim
card<00:02:07.610> slot<00:02:07.849> in<00:02:08.299> here<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:09.289> when<00:02:09.470> is<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.709> note
