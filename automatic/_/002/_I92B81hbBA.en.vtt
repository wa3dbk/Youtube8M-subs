first-person<00:01:40.560> shooters<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.189> PC<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.060> guys

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
first-person shooters on PC do you guys

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.060 
first-person shooters on PC do you guys
feel<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.600> way<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.200> kind<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.619> it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
feel that way to that it's kind of a it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.590 
feel that way to that it's kind of a it
deserves<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.549> second<00:01:44.880> chance<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.270> I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
deserves a second chance like this I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.850 
deserves a second chance like this I
think<00:01:46.200> there's<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> lot<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.590> people<00:01:46.799> that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
think there's a lot of people that

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.679 
think there's a lot of people that
didn't<00:01:47.100> get<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.310> experience<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.119> there's

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
didn't get to experience it and there's

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.670 
didn't get to experience it and there's
actually<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> lot<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.140> people<00:01:49.350> didn't<00:01:49.500> get<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
actually a lot of people didn't get to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.440 
actually a lot of people didn't get to
experience<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.159> optimally<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.790> mean<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.180> was<00:01:51.299> one

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
experience it optimally I mean I was one

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.389 
experience it optimally I mean I was one
of<00:01:51.479> those<00:01:51.630> guys<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.899> would<00:01:52.470> use<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.979> games<00:01:53.220> as

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
of those guys that would use it games as

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.160 
of those guys that would use it games as
a<00:01:53.430> benchmark<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.090> would<00:01:54.210> build<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.509> new<00:01:54.630> rig<00:01:54.869> for

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
a benchmark I would build a new rig for

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.690 
a benchmark I would build a new rig for
them<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.590> I've<00:01:55.950> talked<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.280> lot<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.430> people

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
told me that well you know I wanted to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.179 
told me that well you know I wanted to
build<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.079> rig<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.259> could<00:02:01.500> run<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.829> as<00:02:01.950> you

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
build a rig that could run it as you

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.520 
build a rig that could run it as you
know<00:02:02.369> that's<00:02:02.640> 60<00:02:03.030> frames<00:02:03.240> per<00:02:03.329> second<00:02:03.840> as<00:02:04.049> good

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
know that's 60 frames per second as good

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.740 
know that's 60 frames per second as good
as<00:02:04.619> possible<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.549> just<00:02:05.909> never<00:02:06.060> got<00:02:06.180> my<00:02:06.509> rig

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
as possible but I just never got my rig

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.779 
as possible but I just never got my rig
to<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.049> level<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.649> now<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.069> can<00:02:08.369> just<00:02:08.520> put

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
to that level and now you can just put

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.889 
to that level and now you can just put
it<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.149> play<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.479> way<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.629> was<00:02:09.660> meant

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
it in and play it the way it was meant

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.180 
it in and play it the way it was meant
to<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:09.989> experienced<00:02:10.619> whether<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.129> on

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
to be experienced whether it's on

that's one of the things we've been able

to readjust now in this edition besides
going<00:02:26.530> in<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.580> redoing<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.330> lighting<00:02:28.690> and

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
going in and redoing the lighting and

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.330 
going in and redoing the lighting and
the<00:02:28.900> renderer<00:02:29.260> you'll<00:02:29.830> notice<00:02:30.070> things<00:02:30.160> are<00:02:30.280> a

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
the renderer you'll notice things are a

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.190 
the renderer you'll notice things are a
bit<00:02:30.370> more<00:02:30.550> crisp<00:02:30.790> went<00:02:31.030> in<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.330> yeah<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:31.990> can

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
bit more crisp went in and yeah you can

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.270 
bit more crisp went in and yeah you can
now<00:02:32.320> turn<00:02:32.560> on<00:02:32.680> your<00:02:32.800> armor<00:02:33.040> mounted

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
now turn on your armor mounted

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.710 
now turn on your armor mounted
flashlights<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:33.880> fire<00:02:34.210> your<00:02:34.330> weapon<00:02:34.570> at<00:02:34.660> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
flashlights and fire your weapon at the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.450 
flashlights and fire your weapon at the
same<00:02:34.870> time<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:35.320> it's<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.860> little<00:02:36.070> bit<00:02:36.160> easier<00:02:36.190> to

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
same time so it's a little bit easier to

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.000 
same time so it's a little bit easier to
navigate<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.910> world<00:02:37.080> Buttle<00:02:38.080> SP<00:02:38.530> pantsing

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
navigate the world Buttle SP pantsing

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.850 
navigate the world Buttle SP pantsing
going<00:02:39.610> on<00:02:39.700> now<00:02:39.880> from<00:02:40.150> from<00:02:40.330> scared<00:02:40.690> gamers<00:02:40.990> so

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
going on now from from scared gamers so

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.300 
going on now from from scared gamers so
the<00:02:42.010> 3d<00:02:42.900> how<00:02:43.900> did<00:02:44.080> this<00:02:44.200> happen<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.650> what<00:02:45.190> is

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
the 3d how did this happen and what is

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.220 
the 3d how did this happen and what is
3d<00:02:45.700> do<00:02:45.910> for<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.150> first-person<00:02:46.540> shooter

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
3d do for a first-person shooter

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.080 
3d do for a first-person shooter
well<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:48.130> think<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:48.400> does<00:02:48.520> a<00:02:48.550> lot<00:02:48.730> for<00:02:48.790> Doom

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
well I think it does a lot for Doom

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.880 
well I think it does a lot for Doom
specifically<00:02:49.600> I<00:02:49.630> mean<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:50.020> is<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.200> bit<00:02:50.740> of<00:02:50.830> a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
specifically I mean it is a bit of a

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.710 
specifically I mean it is a bit of a
horror<00:02:51.130> game<00:02:51.250> there's<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.180> lot<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.540> atmosphere

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
horror game there's a lot of atmosphere

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.980 
horror game there's a lot of atmosphere
it's<00:02:53.410> it's<00:02:53.710> kind<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.070> scary<00:02:54.370> at<00:02:54.520> times<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.690> so

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
it's it's kind of scary at times and so

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.270 
it's it's kind of scary at times and so
when<00:02:56.140> you're<00:02:56.260> playing<00:02:56.380> in<00:02:56.560> 3d<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:56.950> just<00:02:57.160> get

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
when you're playing in 3d you just get

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.420 
when you're playing in 3d you just get
that<00:02:57.460> added<00:02:58.000> level<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.510> being<00:02:59.080> terrified<00:02:59.470> it's

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
that added level of being terrified it's
