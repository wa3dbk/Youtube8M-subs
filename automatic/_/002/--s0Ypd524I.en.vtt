00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.900
 the brain tumor is a proliferation 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.180
 abnormal cells in brain tissue 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.610
 this abnormal proliferation may be 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.950
 cells that already make up the 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.380
 or may be from cells 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.010
 originating from other tissues or 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.010
 metastasis 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.610
 the brain tumor and a present a cause 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.330
 defined 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.930
 despite the fact that most cases are 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.310
 tumors and metastases from other sites of the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.820
 body 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.260
 however the genetic causes are 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.970
 being extensively studied in the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.610
 medical literature 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.510
 symptoms are the main ones 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.309
 severe headache vomiting 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.119
 difficulty walking convulsive seizures 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.920
 and possible fainting 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.770
 however the different locations 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.630
 of tumors can locate different 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.660
 symptoms of patients 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.990
 for example localized tumors of the 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.990
 the left side of this frontal region 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.840
 speech region can cause 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.660
 difficulty speaking in patient tumors 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.360
 located in the nearby region or in the 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.880
 motor can locate of ignition of 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.600
 force on the emmy body against the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.210
 patient tumors located in the 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.020
 sensitive sensory changes in the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.750
 visual here brings visual changes 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.409
 in the part of being less changes of 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.409
 balance 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.979
 the diagnosis of brain tumor 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.130
 fundamentally it is performed by the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.110
 MRI of the brain to 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.690
 complementation can be made with the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.300
 tomography to study 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.840
 some details of the tumor as invasion 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.250
 of bone tissues and eventually 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.580
 commitment of other structures in the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.580
 encephalon 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.800
 the primary brain tumor is a tumor 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.610
 I was born in a cell that is the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.400
 brain 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.730
 the metastatic tumor is a tumor 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.460
 from a cancerous cell that 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.480
 comes from another tissue of the organism that 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.480
 not a brain tissue 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.769
 the most common primary tumor of the system 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.340
 central nervous system is glioblastoma 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:54.060
 multiforme the group launched multiforme is 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.040
 an injury such as the extreme dignity 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.739
 affects different system locations 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.440
 central nervous system whose treatment in general 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.730
 is surgical with chemotherapy and 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.099
 radiotherapy 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.310
 on the other hand there are biomes with 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:11.099
 of smaller malignancy and these biomes in 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.379
 usually occurs in younger patients 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.170
 the treatment of low grade glaucoma 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.810
 depends on the histological type of tumor 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.629
 for example tumors of the lineage 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.950
 brought tica in general can be treated 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.720
 both with radiotherapy and surgery 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.430
 however tumors of the oil line 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.280
 within bial which is another type of 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.829
 brain cells can be treated in the 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.030
 only with surgery and 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.620
 chemotherapy 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.299
 leaving radiotherapy to the 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.090
 rescue treatment 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.879
 However, the specific treatment of 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.919
 each brain tumor should be considered 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.260
 by a multidisciplinary team that 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:52.340
 encompasses the surgeons that a thousand therapists 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.340
 and radiotherapists 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:02.269
 another extremely common tumor of the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.450
 brain is a meningioma though 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.879
 meningioma in the vast majority of cases 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.940
 it grows in extra cerebral tissue or 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.640
 or in the tissue surrounding the brains 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.739
 in general it compresses the structures of the 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.310
 brain from the outside in 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.049
 eventually leading to an invasion of 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.330
 brain structures 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.870
 the treatment of meningioma in the 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.750
 most cases and surgical and 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.060
 refractory cases, if possible. 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.229
 can be released mandate surgery for 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.229
 complementary treatment
