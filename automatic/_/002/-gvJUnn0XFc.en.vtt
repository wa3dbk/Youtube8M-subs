00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
look this subset of amp I want to say

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.750 
look this subset of amp I want to say
black<00:02:24.879> black<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.659> always<00:02:25.870> negative<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.760> blue

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
black black is always negative and blue

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.250 
black black is always negative and blue
in<00:02:27.939> the<00:02:28.060> blue<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.269> positive<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:29.019> know<00:02:29.140> it

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
in the blue is positive you know it

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.600 
in the blue is positive you know it
normally<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.680> rare<00:02:29.890> positive<00:02:30.340> but<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.489> know

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.089 
normally is rare positive but you know
saying<00:02:30.790> blue<00:02:30.970> positive<00:02:31.420> negative<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:33.040> you

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
saying blue positive negative so you

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.069 
saying blue positive negative so you
