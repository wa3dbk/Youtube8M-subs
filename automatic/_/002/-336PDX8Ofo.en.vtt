00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello friends, serious minecraft 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.960
 with you and today we continue to do 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.420
 reviews on interesting game mods 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.240
 maynkravt you look at this damn 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.759
 and say it is sho and I will answer you 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.520
 this is a portal to elysium 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.310
 Of course this is not the Elysium that was in 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.150
 the film Elysium Paradise is not on earth but still 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.000
 it is made like paradise but in minecraft 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.420
 kansky style is shorter let's get down to 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.030
 to the construction of this portal to the word I 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.130
 hurried a little bit to get into this 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.640
 illusion we need to build here 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.170
 such a portal and absolutely such 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.300
 easy extracted resource like egg 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.789
 the dragon without him you are in this elizium not 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.789
 get into but let's say this is all 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.590
 formalities you have a dragon egg 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.800
 so proceed to build the portal 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.629
 It is built so we say non-standard 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.210
 all the other portals there are several 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.039
 Blocks set and all chiki bunches built 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.309
 he is in several stages building this 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.799
 site of a would from an ordinary Bortsova 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.570
 block further we take a quartz column from 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:13.350
 her say to rank the two shorter 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.420
 block the height of the column here we build so 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.130
 and fill the middle to nebylo 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.790
 empty terrain 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.780
 further expose a strip of gold 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.979
 blocks and again from above 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.290
 a stack of quartz columns so 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.299
 so here so here and make sure not to 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.619
 there was such a thing that is all the blocks 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.680
 should be arranged vertically 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.740
 up further we again here such 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.180
 the belt is made from the usual block block 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.680
 which is shorter for the main 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.680
 column for one block 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:00.990
 and now attention attention 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.750
 we build a square of carved quartz 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.110
 block that's almost done 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.239
 above we put the egg of the dragon principle 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.490
 the portal is ready well, we still need 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.700
 diamond diamond we step on the egg 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.680
 and there's such a verbal portal 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.850
 I will not enter it because 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.940
 the world is loaded for a long time in general everything lags 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.000
 and I will go to that world which is already 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.170
 the inscription is displayed 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.900
 teleporting to elizium 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.070
 and after a while we appear here 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.850
 this one 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.280
 In this strange world, call this world 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.430
 friendly can not be because here 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.820
 there are also hostile mobs that 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.030
 friends will also try to kill you 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.240
 this world has a huge amount 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.690
 any danzhe any sekreka 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:58.410
 interesting things in general I studied this world 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:02.610
 Elisium to zero integer 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.850
 hundredths percent and something more intelligible 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.740
 what for the debut class I tell you 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.140
 I can not because it is really huge 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.790
 I need to study it for a long time, but I can 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.400
 tell you what i met here 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.960
 some doji well, even a secret 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.910
 interesting things like these here 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.730
 the columns I just picked up 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.040
 a staff that well, let's say it is a staff 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.380
 rushes ender eyes deals damage 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.630
 mobs also if we are lucky if 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.490
 I remember somewhere here in my opinion there is a dungeon 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.260
 in which yes here it is further in which 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.570
 endermen and executed, and the main prize 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.840
 is a diamond block well or same 6 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:43.290
 diamonds who are more comfortable with the word here 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.960
 Ahi the universe is simple and the sky is just pipets 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.770
 how cool is that? 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.290
