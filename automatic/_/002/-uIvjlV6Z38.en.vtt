this is my fish holding tank it's a

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.749 
this is my fish holding tank it's a
light<00:00:04.140> that<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.650> got<00:00:04.799> from<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.100> hardware<00:00:05.370> store

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
light that I got from a hardware store

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.810 
light that I got from a hardware store
with<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.450> full-spectrum<00:00:06.899> bulb<00:00:07.440> in<00:00:07.649> it<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.010> some

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
with a full-spectrum bulb in it and some

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.879 
with a full-spectrum bulb in it and some
plants<00:00:09.300> that<00:00:09.510> happens<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.110> be<00:00:10.230> hydric<00:00:10.710> Otto

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
plants that happens to be hydric Otto

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.419 
plants that happens to be hydric Otto
leucocephala<00:00:11.900> sefa<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:13.040> Brazilian<00:00:14.040> penny<00:00:14.250> work

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
leucocephala sefa a Brazilian penny work

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.429 
leucocephala sefa a Brazilian penny work
and<00:00:15.350> I<00:00:16.350> like<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.130> because<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.580> fast<00:00:17.789> growing

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
and I like it because it's fast growing

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.250 
and I like it because it's fast growing
the<00:00:19.439> faster<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> plant<00:00:20.130> grows<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.670> more<00:00:21.260> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
the faster the plant grows the more the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.460 
the faster the plant grows the more the
nitrogen<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:22.920> gonna<00:00:23.039> eat<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:24.470> Brazilian

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
nitrogen it's gonna eat and Brazilian

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.990 
nitrogen it's gonna eat and Brazilian
penny<00:00:25.650> work<00:00:25.800> doesn't<00:00:26.160> need<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> substrate<00:00:26.820> so

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
penny work doesn't need a substrate so

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.820 
penny work doesn't need a substrate so
this<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> bare<00:00:27.539> bottom<00:00:27.840> tank<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.680> see

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
this is a bare bottom tank you can see

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.290 
this is a bare bottom tank you can see
there's<00:00:29.010> algae<00:00:29.279> growing<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> bottom<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
there's algae growing on the bottom and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.150 
there's algae growing on the bottom and
that's<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.230> heater<00:00:31.439> because<00:00:32.219> these<00:00:32.790> fish<00:00:33.239> are

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
that's a heater because these fish are

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.380 
that's a heater because these fish are
holding<00:00:35.160> fish<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> can't<00:00:35.820> sell<00:00:36.030> them<00:00:36.149> until

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
holding fish and I can't sell them until

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.150 
holding fish and I can't sell them until
they<00:00:36.510> grow<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.290> waters<00:00:37.620> heated<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.040> they

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
they grow so the waters heated so they

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.790 
they grow so the waters heated so they
grow<00:00:38.280> faster<00:00:38.760> because<00:00:39.300> they've<00:00:39.480> got<00:00:39.600> these

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
grow faster because they've got these

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.900 
grow faster because they've got these
guppy<00:00:40.800> metabolism<00:00:41.399> depends<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.820> the

guppy metabolism depends on the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.760 
guppy metabolism depends on the
temperature<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:43.020> see<00:00:43.170> there's<00:00:43.379> not<00:00:43.710> very

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
temperature you can see there's not very

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.709 
temperature you can see there's not very
much<00:00:44.190> water<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.610> here<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:45.149> enough<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.600> cover

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
much water in here just enough to cover

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.040 
much water in here just enough to cover
the<00:00:45.870> heater<00:00:45.989> because<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:47.730> tank<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
the heater because this tank is a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.840 
the heater because this tank is a
rubbermaid<00:00:49.770> clever<00:00:50.070> store<00:00:50.370> tub

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
rubbermaid clever store tub

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
rubbermaid clever store tub
they<00:00:51.329> are<00:00:54.559> $14.97<00:00:55.559> apparently<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:58.140> they're<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
they are $14.97 apparently so they're a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.709 
they are $14.97 apparently so they're a
little<00:00:58.500> bit<00:00:58.590> expensive<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.600> you<00:01:00.600> can

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
little bit expensive and you can you can

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.990 
little bit expensive and you can you can
get<00:01:00.809> them<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.170> seven<00:01:01.530> bucks<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:02.070> think

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
get them for like seven bucks I think

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.890 
get them for like seven bucks I think
this<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.270> was<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> gift<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.489> anyway<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
this one was a gift but anyway so the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.710 
this one was a gift but anyway so the
tubs<00:01:07.140> will<00:01:07.950> break<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.549> put<00:01:09.000> more<00:01:09.360> water<00:01:09.540> in

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
tubs will break if you put more water in

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.260 
tubs will break if you put more water in
it<00:01:09.930> like<00:01:10.590> water<00:01:10.860> all<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.430> way<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.850> here<00:01:12.119> is

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it like water all the way up to here is

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.530 
it like water all the way up to here is
not<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> good<00:01:12.630> idea<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.799> sides<00:01:14.760> start<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> bow

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
not a good idea the sides start to bow

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.520 
not a good idea the sides start to bow
out<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.200> it'll<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.500> like<00:01:16.530> yeah<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.350> only

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
out so it'll be like yeah and so I only

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
out so it'll be like yeah and so I only
put<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.159> much<00:01:20.340> water<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:20.970> that's<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
put that much water in it and that's the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.850 
put that much water in it and that's the
sustainable<00:01:21.780> amount<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.200> tub<00:01:22.409> has<00:01:22.680> been

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
sustainable amount this tub has been

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.120 
sustainable amount this tub has been
setup<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.630> almost<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.810> year

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
setup for almost a year

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.190 
setup for almost a year
mmm<00:01:26.130> that's<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> long<00:01:26.520> time<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.049> see

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
mmm that's a long time and you can see

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.800 
mmm that's a long time and you can see
the<00:01:28.320> sides<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:28.860> straight<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.430> not<00:01:29.549> bowing

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
the sides are straight and not bowing

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.420 
the sides are straight and not bowing
when<00:01:30.810> they<00:01:30.930> bail<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.200> they're<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.590> wow<00:01:31.860> so

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
um the light does fall in sometimes it's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.210

have any fin rot or anything like that
the<00:01:58.590> plant<00:01:58.860> growth<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.750> what<00:02:00.750> protects<00:02:01.140> them

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
the plant growth is what protects them

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.920 
the plant growth is what protects them
you<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.920> feed<00:02:02.340> them<00:02:02.430> fish<00:02:03.360> flakes<00:02:03.659> like

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
you just feed them fish flakes like

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.490 
you just feed them fish flakes like
normal<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.740> plant<00:02:04.979> eats<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.600> surface

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
normal and the plant eats it the surface

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.830 
normal and the plant eats it the surface
area<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.340> water<00:02:08.459> also<00:02:09.090> protects<00:02:09.450> them<00:02:09.599> so

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
area of the water also protects them so

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.590 
area of the water also protects them so
they<00:02:09.959> don't<00:02:10.110> run<00:02:10.259> out

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
they don't run out

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.040 
they don't run out
of<00:02:10.720> oxygen<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:12.550> diffusion<00:02:12.970> rate<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.420> high

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
of oxygen the diffusion rate is high

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.130 
of oxygen the diffusion rate is high
enough<00:02:14.290> with<00:02:14.590> such<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:15.510> thin<00:02:16.510> amount<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.930> water

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
enough with such a thin amount of water

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.750 
enough with such a thin amount of water
and<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.500> large<00:02:17.680> surface<00:02:17.920> area<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.460> they<00:02:18.580> don't

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
and a large surface area that they don't

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.080 
and a large surface area that they don't
need<00:02:18.910> like<00:02:19.240> filters<00:02:20.080> or<00:02:20.500> anything<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.850> it's<00:02:22.000> a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
need like filters or anything so it's a

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.050 
need like filters or anything so it's a
completely<00:02:22.510> quiet<00:02:22.810> tank<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.640> if<00:02:24.910> you've

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
completely quiet tank and and if you've

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.180 
completely quiet tank and and if you've
got<00:02:25.300> some<00:02:26.170> room<00:02:26.320> outside<00:02:26.710> I<00:02:26.740> live<00:02:27.010> in<00:02:27.100> an

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
got some room outside I live in an

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.590 
got some room outside I live in an
apartment<00:02:27.280> but<00:02:27.670> if<00:02:27.790> you've<00:02:27.910> got<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.120> yard<00:02:28.330> you

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
apartment but if you've got a yard you

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.330 
apartment but if you've got a yard you
don't<00:02:29.230> even<00:02:29.380> need<00:02:29.530> this<00:02:29.710> light<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.070> can<00:02:30.190> just

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
don't even need this light you can just

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.510 
don't even need this light you can just
put<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:30.910> outside<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:33.040> fish<00:02:33.250> eat

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
put this outside and the fish eat

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.120 
put this outside and the fish eat
mosquitoes<00:02:34.300> so<00:02:34.480> it's<00:02:34.630> like<00:02:34.900> not<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.470> bad<00:02:35.920> idea

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
mosquitoes so it's like not a bad idea

mosquitoes so it's like not a bad idea
um<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:38.560> could<00:02:38.650> probably<00:02:38.890> save<00:02:39.340> some<00:02:39.520> money<00:02:39.580> on

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
um you could probably save some money on

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.080 
um you could probably save some money on
fish<00:02:39.940> food<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:41.380> anyway<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.490> is<00:02:42.520> my<00:02:42.790> holding

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
fish food so anyway that is my holding

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.090 
fish food so anyway that is my holding
tank<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.570> call<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:43.990> a<00:02:44.080> bucket<00:02:44.260> tank<00:02:44.560> sometimes

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
tank I call it a bucket tank sometimes

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.490 
tank I call it a bucket tank sometimes
cuz<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.760> could<00:02:45.910> just<00:02:46.060> use<00:02:46.210> a<00:02:46.240> bucket<00:02:46.690> these

cuz you could just use a bucket these
thin<00:02:47.710> water<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.550> trick<00:02:49.470> large<00:02:50.470> surface

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
thin water is the trick large surface

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.830 
thin water is the trick large surface
area<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.610> can<00:02:51.970> put<00:02:52.120> as<00:02:52.210> many<00:02:52.330> fish<00:02:52.570> as<00:02:52.600> you

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
area you can put as many fish as you
