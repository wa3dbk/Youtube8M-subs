00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hi to all and balsan case i hope that 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.570
 you're fine anyway I'm fine 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.160
 nickel 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.230
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.519
 pretty important information video so 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.559
 about the future dlc 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.509
 so we had information from 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.549
 rockstar who was official so there 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.839
 above no problem by cons a little 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.460
 later others youtuber were 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.800
 amused to make videos about 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.840
 two leaks on this dlc and who 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.760
 unfortunately was wrong so that's 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.430
 the case of two vehicles the bnf actors 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.960
 prestige and the ob run so these two 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.000
 vehicles that supposedly had been 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.140
 found by a modder is only in fact 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.180
 that a big troll that an American 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.590
 have fun doing so I'm going to you 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.750
 show his message that was posted on 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.700
 a forum to show you that they 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.170
 that he managed to have some youtuber 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
 and frankly I find that limit 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.120
 pitiful to have fun doing stuff 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.890
 like that 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.390
 when in history we will not remember 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.559
 the guy who did the troll but 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.539
 just youtuber she wanted 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.379
 give the info to its subscribers and ultimately 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.300
 who got himself 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.550
 so that's the message from the guy who made 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.350
 the troll so yesterday I have a pretty thought 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.449
 bad what if i leak is in 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.440
 made some people youtuber the contents of 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.570
 the next update 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.640
 I sent emails under a fake 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.409
 identity with about two new 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.900
 vehicles the bnf actors prestige and 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.640
 Rhenish labe and confirmed vehicles 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.470
 which appears too much so in fact he has 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.390
 sent a message with an anonymous nick 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.860
 to youtube hours with both 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.500
 vehicles that were fake the subscriber 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.729
 prestige factors and the auber nn and with 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.320
 that's why he put vehicles that 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.270
 were who will appear so in my opinion 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.970
 he had to send the step that rockstar 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.229
 published I sent this message to 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.750
 youtube hours and one of them came to me 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.790
 see and this one was pretty hopeless 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.170
 information 1 to the point that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.360
 that he received the information and the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.579
 direccte made a video with and of course 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.079
 everything was wrong I had fun with his 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.000
 big youtuber and see how he 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.280
 was desperate to have information 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.780
 no surprise so here I will not tell you 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.240
 not the name did a video on my 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.530
 disclosed content so this guy has managed to 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.640
 have some youtuber who have made 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.140
 videos on his vehicles 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.270
 So as I say it really is 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.470
 pity and so that's for this 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.759
 story if you ever heard 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.250
 talk about these two vehicles 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.869
 you know now that the wrong and 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.159
 that as I wanted to call back at the beginning 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.200
 video it will have many novelties 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.759
 rockstar even shared an image where 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.619
 we can see again a new 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.090
 car and a new weapon that are at 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.590
 really beautiful passage so there 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.660
 will have novelties and I think that 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.890
 that's where we have to stay and 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.239
 So here we come to the end of this 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.790
 video I hope the video will have you 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.170
 enjoyed 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.370
 do not hesitate to drop a little thumb 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.989
 blue if so and subscribe 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.280

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.019
