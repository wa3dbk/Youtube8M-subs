00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.800
 yes 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.900
 Have you ever wondered what the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.910
 origin of wii 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.910
 If so, stay until the end of the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.890
 video and find out the wii is a 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.259
 fictional character of videogames 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.970
 of nintendo that appears on occasions in 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.669
 the videogames of the super saga 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.700
 Mario is inspired by BoyacÃ¡ de la 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.739
 Japanese series is already man ua luigi was 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.390
 created by the designer was my useful idea 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.340
 and it appeared for the first time in the year 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.020
 2000 in the game mario tennis de 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.850
 Nintendo 64 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.670
 is the antithesis of luigi could 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.130
 consider your alter ego has a l the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.079
 initial of luigi upside down 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.540
 wow and it became popular because of its 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.160
 mysterious aspect from its 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.320
 unexpected appearance has followed 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.140
 appearing in subsequent games of 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.049
 sports careers tennis basketball 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.270
 soccer etcetera has even been encouraged to 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.509
 participate in the parties of mario party 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.579
 from mario party 3 however he has never 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.369
 made an appearance in an adventure game 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.290
 we see him committing misdeeds in mario 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.420
 golf and mario power tennis both for 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.170
 gamecube and also in the mario tennis 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.380
 power turn and mario 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.520
 advanced tours for game boy advance 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.340
 although there has been a lot of controversy 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.200
 about the woolwich color since according to 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.630
 the color palette used up 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.310
 now it should be blue cyan thing 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.439
 it's pretty clear if you have in 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.780
 account that wario uses yellow for 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.670
 mono and purple for the letters being in 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.610
 the louis and vice versa purple in the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.860
 clothes and yellow in the letters 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.630
 details about warwick's past and 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.310
 they are very confusing because it is a 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.950
 untapped character and without a 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.720
 story to present simply 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.700
 appeared in the saga of mario as a 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.560
 character that seemed to have already 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.330
 been there but transmits the clear 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.429
 feeling that wii has already been 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.340
 bugging mario like wario 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.380
 before its debut in any case the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.170
 rivalry seems to be with luigi like 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.140
 shows the intro of mario tennis according to the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.060
 trophy of super smash bros which luigi is 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.680
 I would have been training for his debut and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.290
 it is rumored that he is the same age as 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.340
 luigi on the official website of mario 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.530
 tennis 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.050
 wa luigi has two meanings 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.030
 different in Japanese the word 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.550
 Japanese huarui means bad bitter 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.590
 this means that the name of wii 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.860
 it's a mix between war iii and luigi 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.360
 essentially it means the malawi and 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.280
 many mistakenly believe that their 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.170
 name is a cheap copy of the name of 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.769
 wario and that his opponent has been added 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.560
 luigi the relationship between warwick and wario 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.450
 it's confusing it seems that they could be 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.390
 brothers since they share some 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.540
 facial and mental characteristics but 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.340
 in super smash bros brawl the trophy 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.190
 warwick and comments that their relationship does not 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.110
 It is clear, however there are 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.000
 several official references that yes 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.000
 they show that they are brothers as is the 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.099
 case of nintendo europe in the article 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.170
 several users a few years ago had 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.200
 he commented that wario was referring to water 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.180
 luigi as his weak brother in nintendo 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.400
 europa in the section of mario kart ds 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.170
 there is a description of the baldwin circuit 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.790
 and dance spin in which they refer water 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.250
 'Luis and as the little brother of 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.739
 guard like they call them in a 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.840
 old dedicated nintendo america web 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.450
 a mario tenis 64 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.960
 well this is everything points comments and 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:46.830
