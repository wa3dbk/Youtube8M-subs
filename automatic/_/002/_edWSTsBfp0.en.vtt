you<00:03:26.639> know<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.940> can<00:03:27.420> imagine<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.900> archer<00:03:28.319> being

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
you know I can imagine the archer being

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.890 
you know I can imagine the archer being
really<00:03:28.829> weak<00:03:29.069> in<00:03:29.880> close<00:03:30.120> range<00:03:30.299> but<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.720> same

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
really weak in close range but the same

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.930 
really weak in close range but the same
having<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.260> actually<00:03:31.350> do<00:03:31.650> damage<00:03:32.130> as<00:03:32.310> opposed

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
having it actually do damage as opposed

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.780 
having it actually do damage as opposed
to<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.150> healer<00:03:33.540> we<00:03:34.079> can't<00:03:34.350> do<00:03:34.440> damage<00:03:34.829> but<00:03:35.250> who

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
to the healer we can't do damage but who

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.170 
to the healer we can't do damage but who
cannot<00:03:36.030> do<00:03:36.299> damage<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.720> study<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.260> heals<00:03:37.739> and

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
cannot do damage and study it heals and

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.879 
cannot do damage and study it heals and
the<00:03:39.180> archer<00:03:39.630> attacks<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.200> i<00:03:40.319> can<00:03:40.500> assume<00:03:40.829> that

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
the archer attacks and i can assume that

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.699 
the archer attacks and i can assume that
there's<00:03:41.280> more<00:03:41.489> like<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.720> know<00:03:43.049> when

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709

you know i was looking through all the
stuff<00:03:45.209> here<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:45.450> i'm<00:03:45.660> really<00:03:45.989> impressed<00:03:46.440> by

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
stuff here and i'm really impressed by

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.800 
stuff here and i'm really impressed by
the<00:03:47.250> content<00:03:47.910> there<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.150> all<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:48.569> know<00:03:48.630> this

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810

the content there is all you know this
is<00:03:48.840> just<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.139> beginning<00:03:49.260> part<00:03:49.680> i'm<00:03:50.519> pretty

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
is just the beginning part i'm pretty

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.729 
is just the beginning part i'm pretty
sure<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.299> is<00:03:51.389> not<00:03:51.540> all<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.870> items<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.350> even

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
sure this is not all the items that even

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.680 
sure this is not all the items that even
even<00:03:53.310> then<00:03:53.489> this<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.819> pretty<00:03:54.150> good<00:03:54.420> start

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
even then this is a pretty good start

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.059 
even then this is a pretty good start
pursuing<00:03:55.349> this<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.709> very<00:03:55.829> beginning

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
pursuing this is the very beginning

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.759 
pursuing this is the very beginning
there's<00:03:56.819> a<00:03:56.910> huge<00:03:57.299> skill<00:03:57.720> tree<00:03:58.019> thing<00:03:58.319> I<00:03:58.560> mean

there's a huge skill tree thing I mean
that's<00:03:58.950> pretty<00:03:59.099> big<00:03:59.430> for<00:03:59.639> an<00:03:59.730> iOS<00:04:00.180> game<00:04:00.209> if<00:04:00.569> you

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
that's pretty big for an iOS game if you

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.860 
that's pretty big for an iOS game if you
think<00:04:00.900> about<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.970> doin<00:04:02.970> sort<00:04:03.150> of<00:04:03.209> skills<00:04:03.510> i'm

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
there's some passive ones that increases

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.610 
there's some passive ones that increases
your<00:04:07.980> damage<00:04:08.040> all<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:09.510> time<00:04:09.750> for<00:04:10.260> something
