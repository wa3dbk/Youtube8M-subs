00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
the benchmark sounds of a string so you

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.080 
the benchmark sounds of a string so you
went<00:00:44.800> one<00:00:44.950> step<00:00:45.070> further<00:00:45.220> than<00:00:45.760> just<00:00:45.790> to

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
went one step further than just to

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.640 
went one step further than just to
switch<00:00:46.300> over<00:00:46.450> from<00:00:46.750> a<00:00:46.780> beat<00:00:46.930> when<00:00:47.050> a<00:00:47.110> bus<00:00:47.380> runs

you<00:00:47.890> were<00:00:47.950> looking<00:00:48.220> to<00:00:48.250> optimize<00:00:48.910> this<00:00:49.150> the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
you were looking to optimize this the

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.479 
you were looking to optimize this the
gauging<00:00:50.290> from<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.620> grand<00:00:50.920> concert<00:00:51.220> and<00:00:51.340> grand

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:52.470 
gauging from the grand concert and grand
auditorium<00:00:51.940> as<00:00:52.000> well

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
auditorium as well

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.569

yeah<00:00:52.630> specifically<00:00:53.440> for<00:00:53.649> small<00:00:53.890> body<00:00:54.130> guitars

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
yeah specifically for small body guitars

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.750 
yeah specifically for small body guitars
I<00:00:54.970> wanted<00:00:55.780> a<00:00:55.870> customized<00:00:56.440> set<00:00:56.950> that<00:00:57.579> would

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
I wanted a customized set that would

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.160 
I wanted a customized set that would
give<00:00:57.910> me<00:00:58.060> a<00:00:58.090> different<00:00:58.270> tension<00:00:58.720> profile

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
give me a different tension profile

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.860 
give me a different tension profile
across<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.710> bridge<00:00:59.920> I<00:01:00.280> wanted<00:01:01.120> to<00:01:01.300> achieve<00:01:01.420> a

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
across the bridge I wanted to achieve a

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.450 
across the bridge I wanted to achieve a
real<00:01:02.200> bold<00:01:03.030> articulate<00:01:04.030> top<00:01:04.239> end<00:01:04.570> without

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
real bold articulate top end without

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.240 
real bold articulate top end without
sacrificing<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:07.409> comfortable<00:01:08.409> slinky<00:01:09.009> hand

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
sacrificing the comfortable slinky hand

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.420 
sacrificing the comfortable slinky hand
feel<00:01:09.460> of<00:01:09.729> a<00:01:09.850> light<00:01:10.060> set<00:01:10.360> as<00:01:11.140> well<00:01:11.439> I<00:01:11.920> didn't

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
feel of a light set as well I didn't

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.070 
feel of a light set as well I didn't
want<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.670> overload<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.270> top<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.659> that<00:01:13.750> small

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
want to overload the top of that small

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.620 
want to overload the top of that small
guitar<00:01:14.229> with<00:01:14.680> tension<00:01:15.159> so<00:01:15.760> I<00:01:15.790> didn't<00:01:16.210> want<00:01:16.450> a

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
guitar with tension so I didn't want a

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.100 
guitar with tension so I didn't want a
full<00:01:16.930> medium<00:01:17.350> set<00:01:17.710> I<00:01:18.270> wanted<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.390> blend<00:01:19.720> the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
full medium set I wanted to blend the

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.250 
full medium set I wanted to blend the
low<00:01:20.260> end<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.650> a<00:01:20.740> light<00:01:20.950> set<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:21.870> the<00:01:22.870> two<00:01:23.049> high

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
low end of a light set and the two high

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.560 
low end of a light set and the two high
strings<00:01:23.680> out<00:01:24.100> of<00:01:24.190> a<00:01:24.250> medium<00:01:24.610> set<00:01:24.909> to<00:01:25.420> create

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
strings out of a medium set to create

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.590 
strings out of a medium set to create
this<00:01:25.869> unique<00:01:26.740> profile<00:01:27.400> you'd<00:01:28.180> share<00:01:28.450> that

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
this unique profile you'd share that

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.870 
this unique profile you'd share that

me<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.210> then<00:01:31.330> using<00:01:31.720> a<00:01:31.750> little<00:01:32.080> bit<00:01:32.170> from

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
me and then using a little bit from

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.690 
me and then using a little bit from
meeting<00:01:32.560> they'd<00:01:32.710> set<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:33.220> little<00:01:33.430> bit<00:01:33.520> from<00:01:33.640> the
