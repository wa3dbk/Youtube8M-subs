might<00:00:07.230> already<00:00:07.470> recognize<00:00:07.740> as<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:09.090> scene<00:00:09.450> or

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
might already recognize as the scene or

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
kind of up in the air right now but

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.330 
kind of up in the air right now but
anyway<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.429> scene<00:00:29.910> from<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:31.340> episode

Temple and I if you the I'm tongue
twisted<00:01:12.810> right<00:01:12.930> now<00:01:13.460> this<00:01:14.460> mock<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.030> smaller

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
twisted right now this mock is smaller

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.649 
twisted right now this mock is smaller
than<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:16.080> normal<00:01:16.619> mock<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.280> would<00:01:17.490> make<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
than a normal mock I would make if you

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.240 
than a normal mock I would make if you
watch<00:01:18.810> my<00:01:19.020> other<00:01:19.049> videos<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.770> would<00:01:19.830> sure<00:01:20.100> hope

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
watch my other videos I would sure hope

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.660 
watch my other videos I would sure hope
you<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:22.020> might<00:01:22.740> know<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.159> have<00:01:23.460> made

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you do you might know that I have made

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.160 
you do you might know that I have made
you<00:01:24.630> more<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.710> know<00:01:25.830> humongous<00:01:26.820> mocks<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
you more you know humongous mocks in the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.980 
you more you know humongous mocks in the
past<00:01:28.460> this<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.850> small<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.869> how

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
past this is just small because of how

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.480 
past this is just small because of how
things<00:01:31.259> are<00:01:31.439> going<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.740> school<00:01:32.100> right<00:01:32.280> now

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
things are going with school right now

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.870 
things are going with school right now
and<00:01:32.820> also<00:01:33.450> I'm<00:01:34.140> not<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.590> my<00:01:34.829> air<00:01:35.100> hockey<00:01:35.369> table

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
and also I'm not on my air hockey table

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.190 
and also I'm not on my air hockey table
which<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.420> normally<00:01:36.479> build<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
which I normally build on this is a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.999 
which I normally build on this is a
shelf<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.350> my<00:01:40.470> bedroom<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.329> I<00:01:42.329> I've<00:01:43.290> been

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
shelf in my bedroom and I I've been

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.460 
shelf in my bedroom and I I've been
making<00:01:44.159> smaller<00:01:44.700> mocks<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.210> am<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:46.079> filling<00:01:46.290> a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
making smaller mocks I am just filling a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.440 
making smaller mocks I am just filling a
video<00:01:46.710> about<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.570> mock<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.200> my<00:01:49.890> Guiteau<00:01:50.450> um

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
video about a mock here on my Guiteau um

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.649 
video about a mock here on my Guiteau um
so<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.799> might<00:01:53.070> be<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.640> before<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.119> video<00:01:54.390> or

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
so that might be up before this video or

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.350 
so that might be up before this video or
it<00:01:55.229> might<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:55.590> up<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:56.430> immediately<00:01:57.000> after

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
it might be up just immediately after

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.789 
it might be up just immediately after
this<00:01:57.479> video<00:01:58.369> look<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.520> that<00:02:00.229> anyway<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.649> get

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
this video look for that anyway to get

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.240 
this video look for that anyway to get
in<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> mock<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.149> watched<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.590> scene<00:02:04.890> of

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
in to the mock I watched the scene of

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.930 
in to the mock I watched the scene of
this<00:02:06.049> duel<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.079> YouTube<00:02:07.799> three<00:02:08.670> or<00:02:08.819> four<00:02:09.060> times

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
this duel on YouTube three or four times

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.830 
this duel on YouTube three or four times
in<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.420> row<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:10.870> just<00:02:11.370> try<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.480> capture<00:02:13.480> every

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
in a row and just try to capture every

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.280 
in a row and just try to capture every
single<00:02:14.440> tiny<00:02:14.950> detail<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.840> put<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.050> into<00:02:17.200> my

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
single tiny detail and put that into my

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.400 
single tiny detail and put that into my
build<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:18.340> this<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.970> really<00:02:19.270> exactly<00:02:20.080> what<00:02:20.200> it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
build so this is really exactly what it

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.220 
build so this is really exactly what it
looked<00:02:20.620> like<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.240> one<00:02:22.390> exception<00:02:22.510> that

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
looked like with the one exception that

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.330 
looked like with the one exception that
these<00:02:23.560> circles<00:02:24.250> here<00:02:24.310> don't<00:02:24.760> rise<00:02:25.120> up<00:02:25.570> there

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
these circles here don't rise up there

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.490 
these circles here don't rise up there
on<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.700> same<00:02:27.910> level<00:02:28.120> that's<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.050> floor<00:02:29.350> they

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
on the same level that's the floor they

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.920 
on the same level that's the floor they
aren't<00:02:29.890> above<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.310> floor<00:02:30.520> but<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.540> couldn't

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
aren't above the floor but I couldn't

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.840 
aren't above the floor but I couldn't
really<00:02:32.050> do<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.980> obviously<00:02:33.280> have<00:02:33.820> the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
really do that so you obviously have the

disappointed<00:03:59.410> in<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.190> because<00:04:00.490> there<00:04:00.760> is<00:04:00.940> a

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
disappointed in that because there is a

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.530 
disappointed in that because there is a
scene<00:04:02.230> where<00:04:02.260> they<00:04:02.650> are<00:04:02.830> or<00:04:03.310> after<00:04:03.910> she<00:04:04.300> breaks

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
scene where they are or after she breaks

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.540 
scene where they are or after she breaks
through<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.810> window<00:04:05.080> she's<00:04:05.530> on<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.830> roof<00:04:06.040> and

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
through the window she's on the roof and

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.390 
through the window she's on the roof and
