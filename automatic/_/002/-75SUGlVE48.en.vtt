00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.380
 last time the distance not appeared a 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.509

 February 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.100
 these two horses figure in a 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.270
 selection so suspicious five numbers 16 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.619

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.930
 best foals in the stable 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.220
 the horse was wrong 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.480
 lately strasbourg it is necessary 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.060
 redeem it has the potential to win 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.310
 here I will ask the 108 baritone tivoli 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.630
 horseback in progress and the 112 jewels of 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.310
 to make delicate fold but the obvious 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.780
 able to finish on the podium of 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.520
 this race including the training 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.350
 of vaca rage especially so the new blood 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.810
 baccarat the first young favorite 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.250
 313 ceara nosos the mad cow that has 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.620
 experienced some health troubles after he got 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.940
 been bought by jean-luc that said it's 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.320
 a horse that is late for gains he 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.780
 is undefeated in two outings this year 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.130
 in 2014 in my opinion it can remain so because 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.530
 he does not yet have the relative gains 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.480
 with its potential of 313 arano jocelyn 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.700
 patrick quinton always very powerful 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.160
 during his travels in the east of 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.600
 country presents the 503 a gallop star the 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.650
 horse here comes back on with a 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.780
 nice chance of success 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.090
 he will probably have to fight with 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.220
 the 501 my nixon present and at 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.799
 the essential guillaume macaire 500 3 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.390
 501 for this civilian in strasbourg and lyon 2 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.850
 1st 3rd and 5th 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.730
 about agen in meeting iii I know 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.489
 pascal Mans lot estimated 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.720
 bottom waggle lake are 212 a horse that has 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.100
 started victoriously on the 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.810
 office programs from lomagne the only 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.180
 BMOL mathilde and is good is that the 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.530
 horse had could still be 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.750
 showed that they tended little at first 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.220
 so it should not be that this 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.170
 that this speed course and this departure 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.700
 of Turkish starter his interests that said in 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.220
 potential he has the means perfectly 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.390
 to play the leading roles 212 brénac 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.090
 with the reservation issued 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.280
 it can impose Christmas langlois present 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.650
 the 502 al capone I already wanted indicated 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.780
 the horse already has five victories in 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.700
 only six public attempts 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.870
 it's a quality horse the oil is 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.250
 a little blooming at the beginning it is necessary 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.270
 to remain vigilant it is not necessary that he 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.720
 tangle the pencils in the phase 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.970
 initial 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.500
 that says dale potential to shine to 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.510
 this level of competition any case he 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.620
 will logically be installed among the 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.660
 favorite christmas langlois is going a new 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.550
 times the driver in confidence even though the 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.930
 horse know it's give a little 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.330
 shot a heel a couple of dozen 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.600
 days and one feels a little discomfort but 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.830
 very light concerning the 506 highness of 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.000
 bengoreine who also depend on 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.130
 her training and well she is better 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.480
 only during his last outings 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.580
 she can take a place in this lot 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.890
 his two training companions will have to 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.299
 compose that 507 these stars smell a 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.320
 horse that has always been held in esteem 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.530
 by richard william bitter 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.419
 currently convalescent but who here 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.910
 proves a great opportunity to get 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.900
 highlight the 107.1 those gold stars 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.150
 to counter the two friends 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.850
 the training 500 2 506 I finish with 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.979
 the 7th pascal mansou present that 703 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.780
 vinci duplessis on horseback late 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.580
 gains according to him he should be fine 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.690
 run and in my opinion he should fight 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.740
 for the first places and why 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.380
 not at good odds 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.720
 it may in my opinion frustrate the plans 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.830
 from 711 to the caribbean a horse from 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.780
 quality he has proven time and time again 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.010
 in the area and who will have to try 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.740
 deal with distance performance 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.080
 but Michel whole class among his 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.400

 among the good the elements of his 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.030
 stable so pay attention to 703 and 711 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.060
 laughing 3 race e target h meeting iii 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.129
