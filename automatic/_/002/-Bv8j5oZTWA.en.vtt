00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
question and obviously let's talk about

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.450 
question and obviously let's talk about
vegan<00:00:29.969> eating<00:00:30.419> versus<00:00:30.960> vegan<00:00:31.439> dieting<00:00:31.950> okay

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
vegan eating versus vegan dieting okay

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.310

what<00:00:32.669> soon<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.120> imply<00:00:33.420> dieting<00:00:34.110> you're

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
what soon as you imply dieting you're

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.590 
what soon as you imply dieting you're
implying<00:00:34.680> something<00:00:35.340> about<00:00:35.670> calories<00:00:36.269> so

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
implying something about calories so

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.259 
implying something about calories so
let's<00:00:36.809> leave<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.379> aspect<00:00:38.190> out<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.609> and

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
let's leave that aspect out of it and

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.840 
let's leave that aspect out of it and
let's<00:00:39.539> look<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:39.870> diets<00:00:40.289> in<00:00:40.530> general<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.219> food

let's look at diets in general and food

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.639 
let's look at diets in general and food
in<00:00:42.030> general<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.600> see<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> distinctions

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
in general and see what the distinctions

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.310 
in general and see what the distinctions
are<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.999> you<00:00:45.089> and<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.329> coach<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.870> one's<00:00:46.170> a

are and for you and I coach this one's a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.840 
are and for you and I coach this one's a
no-brainer<00:00:46.469> but<00:00:47.039> for<00:00:47.219> other<00:00:47.370> people<00:00:47.760> they

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
no-brainer but for other people they

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.209 
no-brainer but for other people they
think<00:00:47.879> there's<00:00:48.239> magic<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.649> diet<00:00:49.890> system

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
think there's magic in the diet system

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.399 
think there's magic in the diet system

days well of course people lose weight

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.220 
days well of course people lose weight
because<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.969> all<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.539> foods<00:01:00.839> that<00:01:00.989> they're

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
because of all the foods that they're

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.770 
because of all the foods that they're
not<00:01:01.409> allowed<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:01.979> eat<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.210> no<00:01:03.390> different

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
not allowed to eat this is no different

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.600 
not allowed to eat this is no different
than<00:01:03.839> the<00:01:03.960> cabbage<00:01:04.320> soup<00:01:04.500> diet<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.040> the

than the cabbage soup diet and the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.640 
than the cabbage soup diet and the
grapefruit<00:01:06.120> diet<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> 80s<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
grapefruit diet of the 80s this is the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.160 
grapefruit diet of the 80s this is the
same<00:01:07.950> mentality<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:09.000> packaged<00:01:09.870> in<00:01:10.080> a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
same mentality just packaged in a

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.750 
same mentality just packaged in a
different<00:01:10.530> way<00:01:10.620> the<00:01:10.800> Christmas<00:01:11.220> wrapping<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
different way the Christmas wrapping is

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.940 
different way the Christmas wrapping is
just<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:12.030> lot<00:01:12.180> prettier<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.660> the<00:01:13.380> vegan<00:01:13.710> diet

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
just a lot prettier and the vegan diet

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.670 
just a lot prettier and the vegan diet
is<00:01:14.160> actually<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.090> same<00:01:15.300> yes<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.260> know<00:01:16.350> began

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
is actually the same yes you know began

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.990 
is actually the same yes you know began
diet<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.070> you're<00:01:17.220> heavy<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.730> you're<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
diet if you're heavy and you're not a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.580 
diet if you're heavy and you're not a
vegan<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.600> go<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.870> vegan<00:01:19.170> diet<00:01:19.350> you

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
vegan and you go to a vegan diet you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.740 
vegan and you go to a vegan diet you
will<00:01:19.620> more<00:01:19.980> than<00:01:20.130> likely<00:01:20.190> lose<00:01:20.730> weight<00:01:21.090> but

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
will more than likely lose weight but

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.110 
will more than likely lose weight but
the<00:01:22.200> reason<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.710> not<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.220> much<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> specialty

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
the reason is not so much the specialty

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.970 
the reason is not so much the specialty
of<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.300> vegan<00:01:24.660> diet<00:01:24.870> but<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> fact<00:01:25.890> that

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
of the vegan diet but the fact that

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.370 
of the vegan diet but the fact that
you're<00:01:26.160> eliminating<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.060> many<00:01:27.240> other<00:01:27.480> foods

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
you're eliminating so many other foods

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.260 
you're eliminating so many other foods
that<00:01:28.620> you<00:01:28.770> would<00:01:28.920> normally<00:01:29.100> eat<00:01:29.580> that<00:01:29.940> tend<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
that you would normally eat that tend to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.720 
that you would normally eat that tend to
be<00:01:30.420> higher<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.870> calories<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.070> magic<00:01:32.310> isn't

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
be higher in calories so the magic isn't

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.050 
be higher in calories so the magic isn't
in<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> vegan<00:01:33.450> aspect<00:01:34.050> of<00:01:34.230> it<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.030> reality<00:01:36.030> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
in the vegan aspect of it the reality is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.990 
in the vegan aspect of it the reality is
in<00:01:36.690> a<00:01:37.020> process<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.590> elimination<00:01:37.710> coach<00:01:38.580> yeah

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
in a process of elimination coach yeah

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.520 
in a process of elimination coach yeah
it's<00:01:39.210> no<00:01:39.330> different<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:39.870> and<00:01:40.110> I'm<00:01:40.170> sure<00:01:40.380> you

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
it's no different then and I'm sure you

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.130 
it's no different then and I'm sure you
can<00:01:41.010> relate<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.760> back<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.330> 60s<00:01:43.050> i

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
can relate to this it back in the 60s i

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.890 
can relate to this it back in the 60s i
believe<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.620> bodybuilders<00:01:44.600> they<00:01:45.600> used<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
believe the bodybuilders they used to

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.530 
believe the bodybuilders they used to
drink<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.170> lot<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.410> whole<00:01:46.530> milk<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.980> then<00:01:47.760> when

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
drink a lot of whole milk and then when

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.020 
drink a lot of whole milk and then when
they<00:01:48.570> came<00:01:48.930> time<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.230> pre<00:01:49.560> contest<00:01:50.070> they<00:01:50.790> cut

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
they came time for pre contest they cut

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.940 
they came time for pre contest they cut
the<00:01:51.180> milk<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.510> and<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:51.870> got<00:01:52.020> lean<00:01:52.230> so<00:01:52.710> that

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
the milk out and they got lean so that

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.910 
the milk out and they got lean so that
thus<00:01:53.700> became<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.360> theory<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:55.680> can't

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
thus became the theory that you can't

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.800 
thus became the theory that you can't
have<00:01:56.160> milk<00:01:56.400> on<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> pre<00:01:56.910> contest<00:01:57.360> diet<00:01:57.570> because

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
have milk on a pre contest diet because

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.750 
have milk on a pre contest diet because
it<00:01:57.930> makes<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.260> retain<00:01:59.070> water<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.490> makes<00:01:59.640> you

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
it makes you retain water and makes you

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.120 
it makes you retain water and makes you
fat<00:01:59.970> well<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.720> reality<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.470> it<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.800> when

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
fat well the reality of it is that when

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.440 
fat well the reality of it is that when
they<00:02:02.250> took<00:02:02.400> milk<00:02:02.670> another<00:02:02.940> guy<00:02:03.150> they<00:02:03.390> were

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
they took milk another guy they were

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.850 
they took milk another guy they were
taking<00:02:03.810> one<00:02:04.080> hundreds<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.500> hundreds<00:02:04.800> of

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
taking one hundreds and hundreds of

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.160 
taking one hundreds and hundreds of
calories<00:02:05.070> another<00:02:05.460> diet<00:02:05.760> every<00:02:06.060> day<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.990> they

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
calories another diet every day so they

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.190 
calories another diet every day so they
got<00:02:07.320> leaner<00:02:07.560> move<00:02:08.160> also<00:02:08.550> just<00:02:09.030> think<00:02:09.479> not<00:02:09.959> so

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
got leaner move also just think not so

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.709 
got leaner move also just think not so
much<00:02:10.379> think<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.860> ways<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.220> eating<00:02:11.519> not<00:02:12.299> so<00:02:12.540> much

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:12.719 
much think of ways of eating not so much

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.280 
much think of ways of eating not so much
as<00:02:12.959> diet<00:02:13.620> but<00:02:14.280> as<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.609> food<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.689> nothing<00:02:16.140> wrong

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
as diet but as in food so nothing wrong

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.910 
as diet but as in food so nothing wrong
with<00:02:16.499> Abby

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
with Abby

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.710 
with Abby
diet<00:02:17.190> but<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> reason<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.209> leads<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.569> weight

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
diet but the reason it leads to weight

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.240 
diet but the reason it leads to weight
loss<00:02:18.959> for<00:02:19.230> people<00:02:19.530> who<00:02:19.650> weren't<00:02:19.830> vegans

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
loss for people who weren't vegans

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.370 
loss for people who weren't vegans
before<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.910> what<00:02:21.510> we're<00:02:21.630> talking<00:02:22.020> about<00:02:22.050> is

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
before is what we're talking about is

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.140 
before is what we're talking about is
that<00:02:22.530> you're<00:02:22.709> just<00:02:22.739> eliminating<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:23.940> many

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
that you're just eliminating so many

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.180 
that you're just eliminating so many
foods<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.750> that's<00:02:25.230> no<00:02:25.410> different<00:02:25.620> than<00:02:25.950> like

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
foods and that's no different than like

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.670 
foods and that's no different than like
I<00:02:26.310> said<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.640> cabbage<00:02:26.970> soup<00:02:27.180> diet<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
I said the cabbage soup diet and the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.760 
I said the cabbage soup diet and the
grapefruit<00:02:29.340> only<00:02:29.640> diet<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.590> there's<00:02:31.590> been<00:02:31.739> a

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
grapefruit only diet and there's been a

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.620 
grapefruit only diet and there's been a
whole<00:02:32.010> bunch<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.819> diets<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.270> basically

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
whole bunch of diets that basically

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.229 
whole bunch of diets that basically
focus<00:02:34.110> on<00:02:34.260> one<00:02:34.530> food<00:02:34.860> at<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.580> expense<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.090> all

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
focus on one food at the expense of all

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.390 
focus on one food at the expense of all
these<00:02:36.450> others<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.050> basically<00:02:37.650> get<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.160> sick

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
these others and basically get so sick

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.880 
these others and basically get so sick
of<00:02:38.520> eating<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:39.000> one<00:02:39.270> specific<00:02:40.110> food<00:02:40.380> that

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
of eating that one specific food that

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.710 
of eating that one specific food that
you<00:02:41.040> eat<00:02:41.069> less<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.090> tend<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.569> keep

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
you eat less of it so you tend to keep

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.660 
you eat less of it so you tend to keep
losing<00:02:42.959> weight<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.860> important<00:02:44.400> thing<00:02:44.430> to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
losing weight the important thing to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.759 
losing weight the important thing to
watch<00:02:44.850> there<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:46.380> don't<00:02:46.530> get<00:02:46.739> that

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
watch there is that you don't get that

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.250 
watch there is that you don't get that
downregulation<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.760> metabolism<00:02:48.569> that<00:02:48.750> slows

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
downregulation of metabolism that slows

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.960 
downregulation of metabolism that slows
your<00:02:49.500> metabolic<00:02:49.800> rate<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.850> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
your metabolic rate and this is the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.910 
your metabolic rate and this is the
danger<00:02:51.420> when<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:51.930> start<00:02:52.260> looking<00:02:52.440> at<00:02:52.739> things

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
danger when you start looking at things

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.100 
danger when you start looking at things
like<00:02:53.069> a<00:02:53.160> vague<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.670> diet<00:02:53.850> as<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> diet<00:02:54.630> rather

than a way of eating so this has been a

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.720 
than a way of eating so this has been a
very<00:02:57.569> important<00:02:58.140> coach<00:02:58.319> them<00:02:58.500> up<00:02:58.650> coach<00:02:58.980> yeah

that<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.600> same<00:03:00.870> thing<00:03:01.110> goes<00:03:01.350> for<00:03:02.420> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
that the same thing goes for the
