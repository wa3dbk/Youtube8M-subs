the diagram I'm going to show you how to
do<00:00:53.480> this<00:00:53.900> really<00:00:54.559> fun<00:00:54.950> edging<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:55.670> then<00:00:56.210> I'm

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
do this really fun edging and then I'm

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.710 
do this really fun edging and then I'm
gonna<00:00:56.510> do<00:00:56.720> it<00:00:56.870> in<00:00:57.080> beads<00:00:57.940> here<00:00:58.940> we<00:00:59.060> go<00:00:59.240> people

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
gonna do it in beads here we go people

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.600 
gonna do it in beads here we go people
really<00:00:59.990> like<00:01:00.170> this<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:00.800> start<00:01:00.860> with<00:01:01.250> a<00:01:01.280> cuff

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
really like this you start with a cuff

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.520 
really like this you start with a cuff
that<00:01:02.090> has<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:02.420> holes<00:01:02.660> of<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.990> beads<00:01:03.170> on<00:01:03.410> the

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
that has the holes of the beads on the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.260 
that has the holes of the beads on the
outside<00:01:03.560> because<00:01:04.520> that's<00:01:04.850> where<00:01:05.150> you're

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
outside because that's where you're

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.180 
outside because that's where you're
going<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.420> be<00:01:05.570> coming<00:01:05.810> out<00:01:06.080> of<00:01:06.140> now<00:01:06.950> all<00:01:07.160> a

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
going to be coming out of now all a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.260 
going to be coming out of now all a
picot<00:01:07.729> is<00:01:07.940> is<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.810> little<00:01:09.200> stem<00:01:09.860> with<00:01:10.580> generally

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
picot is is a little stem with generally

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.100 
picot is is a little stem with generally
three<00:01:11.690> beads<00:01:12.340> one<00:01:13.340> two<00:01:13.610> three<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.960> go

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
three beads one two three and you go

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.410 
three beads one two three and you go
back<00:01:15.440> through<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.040> stem<00:01:16.310> into<00:01:17.090> your<00:01:17.210> beadwork

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
back through the stem into your beadwork

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.710 
back through the stem into your beadwork
that's<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.560> simplest<00:01:19.160> of<00:01:19.399> a<00:01:19.520> picot<00:01:19.970> now<00:01:20.660> you

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
that's the simplest of a picot now you

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.630 
that's the simplest of a picot now you
can<00:01:21.200> start<00:01:21.470> to<00:01:21.560> get<00:01:21.649> fancier<00:01:22.160> you<00:01:22.430> can

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
can start to get fancier you can

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.790 
can start to get fancier you can
increase<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.270> size<00:01:23.540> of<00:01:23.690> your<00:01:23.750> stem<00:01:24.170> here<00:01:24.740> I

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
increase the size of your stem here I

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.060 
increase the size of your stem here I
have<00:01:25.130> two<00:01:25.550> green<00:01:25.940> beads<00:01:26.300> in<00:01:26.630> my<00:01:26.780> stem<00:01:27.110> little

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
have two green beads in my stem little

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.960 
have two green beads in my stem little
three<00:01:28.310> bead<00:01:29.020> picot<00:01:30.020> back<00:01:30.710> down<00:01:31.069> through<00:01:31.700> that

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
three bead picot back down through that

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.740 
three bead picot back down through that
bead<00:01:32.240> again<00:01:32.500> here<00:01:33.500> I'm<00:01:33.619> making<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:34.009> bigger<00:01:34.250> one

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
bead again here I'm making a bigger one

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.749 
bead again here I'm making a bigger one
same<00:01:35.750> thing<00:01:36.020> generally<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.590> Pico<00:01:37.039> is<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.280> three

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
same thing generally a Pico is a three

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.279 
same thing generally a Pico is a three
bead<00:01:38.440> little<00:01:39.440> dinghy<00:01:40.429> thing<00:01:40.880> on<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.300> end<00:01:41.330> okay

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
bead little dinghy thing on the end okay

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.350 
bead little dinghy thing on the end okay
now<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.560> can<00:01:42.770> do<00:01:43.069> a<00:01:43.100> bridge<00:01:43.520> with<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:43.880> picot

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
now you can do a bridge with a picot

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.380 
now you can do a bridge with a picot
where<00:01:45.050> you<00:01:45.229> come<00:01:45.470> out<00:01:45.500> of<00:01:45.709> a<00:01:45.890> bead<00:01:46.459> and<00:01:46.789> you

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
where you come out of a bead and you

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.719 
where you come out of a bead and you
pick<00:01:47.660> up<00:01:47.869> several<00:01:48.410> beads<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:49.160> you<00:01:49.520> have<00:01:49.700> a

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
pick up several beads and you have a

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.639 
pick up several beads and you have a
core<00:01:50.240> bead<00:01:50.569> that<00:01:50.840> you're<00:01:50.990> going<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.200> come<00:01:51.440> back

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
core bead that you're going to come back

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.380 
core bead that you're going to come back
through<00:01:52.009> after<00:01:52.429> you<00:01:52.459> pick<00:01:52.729> up<00:01:52.880> those<00:01:53.119> three

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
through after you pick up those three

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.359 
through after you pick up those three
you're<00:01:53.690> going<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:53.899> come<00:01:54.110> back<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.709> notice

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
you're going to come back and notice

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.150 
you're going to come back and notice
that<00:01:55.520> I'm<00:01:55.670> skipping<00:01:56.270> my<00:01:57.110> beads<00:01:57.440> in<00:01:57.679> my<00:01:57.860> cuff

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
that I'm skipping my beads in my cuff

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.309 
that I'm skipping my beads in my cuff
when<00:01:58.550> I<00:01:58.580> come<00:01:58.910> back<00:01:59.119> down<00:01:59.450> so<00:02:00.050> you<00:02:00.110> have<00:02:00.200> this

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
when I come back down so you have this

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.949 
when I come back down so you have this
nice<00:02:00.590> arch<00:02:01.009> now<00:02:01.729> you<00:02:01.789> can<00:02:02.090> weave<00:02:02.300> through<00:02:02.750> your

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
nice arch now you can weave through your

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.160 
nice arch now you can weave through your
beadwork<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.679> really<00:02:04.610> very<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:05.149> picot<00:02:05.660> so<00:02:06.020> that

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
beadwork and really very a picot so that

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.300 
beadwork and really very a picot so that
in<00:02:06.289> this<00:02:06.440> case<00:02:06.709> I<00:02:07.270> have<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:08.920> different<00:02:09.920> kind<00:02:10.190> of

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
in this case I have a different kind of

in this case I have a different kind of
a<00:02:10.429> core<00:02:10.700> bead<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.330> I'm<00:02:11.480> going<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.720> be<00:02:11.810> coming

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
a core bead so I'm going to be coming

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.380 
a core bead so I'm going to be coming
out<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.500> forming<00:02:12.950> my<00:02:13.099> little<00:02:13.760> bridge<00:02:14.060> my

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
little arch coming through it can be a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.210 
little arch coming through it can be a
crystal<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.750> can<00:02:17.900> be<00:02:17.990> a<00:02:18.020> larger<00:02:18.650> seed<00:02:18.890> bead

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
crystal it can be a larger seed bead
