and she says it's gonna be balanced more

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.300 
and she says it's gonna be balanced more
so<00:01:22.049> as<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.259> know<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.500> last<00:01:22.650> update<00:01:23.100> they

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
so as we know in the last update they

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.330 
so as we know in the last update they
actually<00:01:23.700> decrease<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> range<00:01:24.930> low<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:26.130> maybe

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
actually decrease the range low so maybe

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.800 
actually decrease the range low so maybe
that's<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> whole<00:01:27.150> plan<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.750> were

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
that's what the whole plan they were

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.789 
that's what the whole plan they were
planning<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.470> next<00:01:28.619> update

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
planning to do in the next update

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.580 
planning to do in the next update
because<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.909> know<00:01:30.030> knife<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.869> slow<00:01:31.110> condo<00:01:31.409> p

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
because you know knife in a slow condo p

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.899 
because you know knife in a slow condo p
but<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.829> think<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.159> decreased<00:01:32.490> arranged<00:01:32.759> maybe

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
but I think it decreased arranged maybe

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.749 
but I think it decreased arranged maybe
like<00:01:33.329> half<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.380> could<00:01:34.619> be<00:01:34.710> balanced<00:01:35.280> way<00:01:35.549> more

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
like half it could be balanced way more

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.450 
like half it could be balanced way more
so<00:01:36.000> hopefully<00:01:36.710> they<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.860> significant

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
so hopefully they do a significant

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.200 
so hopefully they do a significant
change<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.909> knife<00:01:39.380> next<00:01:40.380> week<00:01:40.650> says<00:01:41.400> that

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
change to the knife next week says that

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.550 
change to the knife next week says that
you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.479> tell<00:01:42.659> stayed<00:01:43.020> because<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.439> know

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
you can tell stayed because you know

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.630 
you can tell stayed because you know
it's<00:01:43.829> not<00:01:43.920> finished<00:01:44.189> yet<00:01:44.369> they're<00:01:44.549> still

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
it's not finished yet they're still

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.389 
it's not finished yet they're still
working<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:46.290> next<00:01:46.500> one's<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.920> she<00:01:47.280> was

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
working on it the next one's a she was

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.280 
working on it the next one's a she was
actually<00:01:47.490> asking<00:01:47.759> about<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.600> our<00:01:48.930> thoughts

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
actually asking about that our thoughts

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.100 
actually asking about that our thoughts
on<00:01:49.439> manhunt<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.759> score<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.210> limit<00:01:51.509> score

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
on manhunt on the score and limit score

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.740 
on manhunt on the score and limit score
limit<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.500> time<00:01:52.950> limit<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.430> stuff<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.299> if<00:01:54.630> it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
limit and time limit and stuff and if it

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.389 
limit and time limit and stuff and if it
should<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:54.930> changed<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.259> an<00:01:55.320> update<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.740> I

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
should be changed in an update and I

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.800 
should be changed in an update and I
think<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.729> reason<00:01:56.759> she<00:01:57.119> was<00:01:57.210> asking<00:01:57.509> was

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
think the reason she was asking was

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.819 
think the reason she was asking was
because<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.290> know<00:01:58.409> maybe<00:01:58.619> they<00:01:58.770> were

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
because you know maybe they were

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.590 
because you know maybe they were
thinking<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.250> changing<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.240> up<00:02:00.329> for<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
thinking of changing it up for the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.690 
thinking of changing it up for the
ranked<00:02:00.869> matches<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.009> update<00:02:02.280> sense<00:02:02.520> node

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
ranked matches in the update sense node

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.160 
ranked matches in the update sense node
at<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.000> time<00:02:03.210> limited<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.570> think<00:02:03.719> that's<00:02:03.869> 10

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
at the time limited I think that's 10

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.499 
at the time limited I think that's 10
but<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.950> takes<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.340> must<00:02:05.939> never<00:02:06.090> get<00:02:06.420> to

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
but it takes you must never get to

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.270 
but it takes you must never get to
finish<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.869> manhunt<00:02:07.229> game<00:02:07.409> since<00:02:07.710> they're<00:02:08.250> so

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
finish the manhunt game since they're so

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.160 
finish the manhunt game since they're so
long<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.030> maybe<00:02:09.209> she'd<00:02:09.390> some<00:02:09.509> planet<00:02:09.810> change

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
long so maybe she'd some planet change

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.999 
long so maybe she'd some planet change
that

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
that

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.289 
that
they<00:02:11.459> actually<00:02:11.700> give<00:02:11.819> your<00:02:11.939> feedback<00:02:12.090> about

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
they actually give your feedback about

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.750 
they actually give your feedback about
this<00:02:12.689> question<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.280> comments<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.730> know

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
this question in the comments you know

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.520 
this question in the comments you know
maybe<00:02:15.150> let<00:02:15.420> Candice<00:02:15.780> know<00:02:16.110> when<00:02:16.260> stuff<00:02:16.349> like

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
maybe let Candice know when stuff like

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.000 
maybe let Candice know when stuff like
that<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:18.090> next<00:02:18.450> quarter<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.470> next<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:19.799> cheat

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
that the next quarter the next we cheat

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.679 
that the next quarter the next we cheat
we<00:02:20.099> doubt<00:02:20.370> was<00:02:20.760> talking<00:02:20.939> about<00:02:21.060> spawns<00:02:21.390> the

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
we doubt was talking about spawns the

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.630 
we doubt was talking about spawns the
spawn<00:02:21.900> system<00:02:22.019> c4<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.340> lot<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.519> people

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
spawn system c4 and a lot of people

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.190 
spawn system c4 and a lot of people
actually<00:02:24.090> complained<00:02:24.390> about<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.019> maybe

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
actually complained about this and maybe

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.190 
actually complained about this and maybe
she<00:02:25.700> realized<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.209> she<00:02:27.329> won't<00:02:27.450> be<00:02:27.599> get

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
she realized this and she won't be get

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.119 
she realized this and she won't be get
some<00:02:28.349> constructive<00:02:28.769> I<00:02:29.730> don't<00:02:30.720> advise<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
some constructive I don't advise to the

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.640 
some constructive I don't advise to the
developers<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.780> she<00:02:33.840> can<00:02:33.989> even<00:02:34.170> convince<00:02:34.409> them

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
developers so she can even convince them

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.979 
developers so she can even convince them
to<00:02:34.680> know<00:02:34.950> changed<00:02:35.250> up<00:02:35.340> response<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.930> know

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
to know changed up response and you know

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.479 
to know changed up response and you know
improve<00:02:37.379> them<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.829> that<00:02:37.859> because<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.250> spots

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
improve them like that because the spots

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.479 
improve them like that because the spots
can<00:02:38.819> at<00:02:38.970> some<00:02:39.209> points<00:02:39.690> be<00:02:39.930> kind<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.530> bad<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:41.040> mean

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
can at some points be kind of bad I mean

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.660 
can at some points be kind of bad I mean
I've<00:02:41.909> had<00:02:42.120> many<00:02:42.959> many<00:02:43.170> moments<00:02:43.459> spawning<00:02:44.459> and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
I've had many many moments spawning and

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.470 
I've had many many moments spawning and
dying<00:02:44.730> just<00:02:45.329> like<00:02:45.510> ah<00:02:45.750> my<00:02:46.260> god<00:02:46.440> i<00:02:47.180> just<00:02:48.180> wanted

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
dying just like ah my god i just wanted

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.390 
dying just like ah my god i just wanted
joke<00:02:48.840> those<00:02:49.019> developers<00:02:49.409> anyway<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.370> next

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
joke those developers anyway the next

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.119 
joke those developers anyway the next
week<00:02:51.230> she<00:02:52.230> actually<00:02:52.319> talked<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.650> developers

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
week she actually talked to developers

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.309 
week she actually talked to developers
and<00:02:53.340> she<00:02:53.430> said<00:02:53.609> that<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.659> sponsor<00:02:55.079> supposed

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
and she said that the sponsor supposed

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.629 
and she said that the sponsor supposed
to<00:02:55.379> be<00:02:55.470> based<00:02:55.709> spawns<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.220> should<00:02:56.370> inspire

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
to be based spawns you should inspire

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.910 
to be based spawns you should inspire
any<00:02:56.909> location<00:02:57.389> in<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.510> enemy's<00:02:57.959> site<00:02:58.230> the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
any location in the enemy's site the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.379 
any location in the enemy's site the
problem<00:02:59.310> with<00:02:59.430> this<00:02:59.609> is<00:02:59.879> if<00:03:00.090> you're<00:03:00.209> not<00:03:00.299> an

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
problem with this is if you're not an

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.000 
problem with this is if you're not an
enemy<00:03:00.569> side<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.290> know<00:03:01.409> they<00:03:01.650> might<00:03:01.739> just<00:03:01.920> come

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
enemy side you know they might just come

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.470 
enemy side you know they might just come
around<00:03:02.159> the<00:03:02.280> corner<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.519> kill<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.450> I

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
around the corner and kill you so I

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.369 
around the corner and kill you so I
think<00:03:03.690> what<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:04.079> propose<00:03:04.319> is<00:03:04.500> make<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.040> site<00:03:06.379> if

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
think what I propose is make the site if

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.990 
think what I propose is make the site if
Candice<00:03:07.889> watching<00:03:08.190> maybe<00:03:08.400> like<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.730> make<00:03:08.849> it

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
Candice watching maybe like to make it

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.149 
Candice watching maybe like to make it
so<00:03:09.420> there's<00:03:09.840> no<00:03:09.989> look<00:03:10.170> like<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.680> enemy<00:03:10.920> can't

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
so there's no look like the enemy can't

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.449
