00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.970
 hello everyone, petman bonfire 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.890
 today wanted to make a small 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:24.700
 interesting things and long wanted her 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:27.279
 to buy this flashlight from the company in the 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.640
 project wmx flashlight replica 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:34.150
 200 that's who makes them 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.060
 inside in my original lights like 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.190
 insight appeared not so long ago probably 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.280
 a couple of years ago you submitted but he already 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.070
 flashes on the photos of all sorts of fashionable 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.910
 photos of fashion units from 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.000
 afghanistan first 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.710
 so it becomes so very, very 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.710
 true yo voy gizmo 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.850
 replica on a car 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.980
 only do 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.229
 which is very unusual because until then I 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.259
 I don't remember the project diva flashlights 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.020
 and here they are so very quickly somehow this 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.649
 all done before some other 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.060
 unknown Chinese companies for 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:19.250
 did comes in enough 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.250
 qualitatively and here is such a box 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.250
 not bad packed in the money that for 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.500
 he was asked I met in their sales 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.080
 anywhere from 55 to 70 dollars 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.250
 there are still versions a little more expensive somewhere there 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.050
 in the region of 80 dollars but this version with 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.970
 markings it is called ordinary 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.830
 medicinal lady suite like so but in 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.700
 availability is difficult to meet 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.380
 so I did not suffer and bought myself 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.259
 usually there is only one version 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.659
 the difference where I wrote lan 01 there will be 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.280
 still marked the company itself 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:02.610
 inside the rest of these lanterns 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.039
 no different in general flashlight 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.940
 very very simple but it's about that 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.860
 what I didnâ€™t look for because it was shaped 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.440
 almost like a flashlight 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.440
 attached to the sheet sockets and 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.370
 just what i need 2 usually 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.269
 it's usually just the ability to remove 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.709
 dedicate and wish he would greatly 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.739
 didn't stick out 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.760
 machines not to fight not to cling to them 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.680
 for all garbage 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.230
 all other functions are not really necessary 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.650
 real america wmx has like 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.400
 momentary is constantan yes and have 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.850
 more lines 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.500
 replica strobe does not have that is in 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.329
 community you clamp for three seconds he 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.880
 after that comes in strobe mode 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.709
 on a replica of such a function does not possess but 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.520
 I honestly say strobe is not needed 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.710
 yes and in my 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.530
 In many games they are banned by these 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.100
 the strobe button has it 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.460
 behind 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.400
 comfortable enough large rubber 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.850
 button here in this moment, 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.380
 this flashlight we have a button 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.260
 There have so far replica key 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.520
 remote does not exist therefore 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.830
 the only option is to press this 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:21.230
 button with your finger yes and it brings its 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.200
 adjustments to work with this lantern 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.780
 strengthening it has the ability 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.610
 lean back that is here you can 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.670
 play with the location with the mount 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.680
 its top or bottom right to the left as 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.680
 you are comfortable as you need it and you can 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.900
 tilt the flashlight far enough then 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.900
 there is a 180 degree he leans back from 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.490
 attachment points which is convenient and unusual 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.380
 with this replica mount done 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.390
 fairly high quality but very tight 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.020
 there he does not hang does not spin 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.900
 there is a marking here and there 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.220
 infrared ie ordinary flashlight 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.810
 mx200 it has a built-in function 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.500
 work in infrared and just 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.660
 by turning the light head you can 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.120
 change the replica functionality naturally 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:15.240
 in for 50 60 dollars in a replica of what 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:17.040
 functional no flashlight made of 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.260
 some aluminum with 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.900
 annotation money come in black 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.100
 there are such 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.860
 golden beige or which one is right 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.460
 call made very high quality no 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.620
 there is no trace of dirt 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.870
 for this money it seems to me a lantern 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.340
 really very very cool not up 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.990
 it is still surprising why Russian 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.169
 stores brings they sell and 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:45.150
 you have to order such a trifle and 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:48.270
 from behind bought it on site like him 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.220
 called shooter gear dot com or something 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.260
 we down there put a link some run 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.570
 shooter richer such a never created site 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.350
 bought but redeemed well enough 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.849
 quickly worked much faster than 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.580
 other stores I am used to 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:06.209
 I buy it here 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.059
 outwardly to on flashlight dressed on drive bow 

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:11.729
 very cool unfortunately I had to 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:14.789
 put deep enough in the rail 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.659
 because since there is no external buttons to 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:21.469
 I still want to press a button 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:23.939
 he has become far enough and part of the world 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:25.589
 restraint is blocking therefore not 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.899
 main color a little up to 5 new 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:29.219
 becomes so circumcised in general for 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:32.219
 those situations in which I use 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:34.769
 a flashlight of this is enough it is not scary 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:37.769
 on if you need a full spot well 

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:41.550
 will have to leave it on again whale 

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:45.479
 on a large ari strongly 12-inch retina 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.399
 do you have these cyber there in pic 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.800
 short of this problem will not you 

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:51.499
 everything will be on hand at 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.939
 regarding his turning 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:57.659
 tight enough it works well 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:06:00.479
 holds and with the upper position you can 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:02.699
 press with your index finger 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:07.079
 that is, you can click on the alpica 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:08.459
 and press the button on the flashlight of course 

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:10.680
 the biggest minus is that it does not exist 

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:13.409
 in parked behind the other side acute 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.300
 pain usually remote buttons such 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.829
 harmonies are constantly falling off and in the most 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.309
 right moment they don't work therefore 

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:22.319
 maybe even such a construction is just 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:24.569
 button mainly tamar flashlights which 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:28.800
 quite ergonomic is yours 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:33.319
 under the finger can show you the same 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.319
 better so let's take a look
