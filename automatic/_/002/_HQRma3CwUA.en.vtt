potentially control over the Internet
I<00:00:12.780> can<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.049> haven't<00:00:13.590> set<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.980> up<00:00:14.009> yet<00:00:15.320> the<00:00:16.320> it's

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
I can I haven't set that up yet the it's

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.240 
I can I haven't set that up yet the it's
in<00:00:17.039> its<00:00:17.190> first<00:00:17.400> few<00:00:17.609> stages<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.920> taken<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
in its first few stages I have taken the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.439 
in its first few stages I have taken the
robot<00:00:20.789> itself<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.900> have<00:00:23.300> basically<00:00:24.300> taken

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
robot itself and I have basically taken

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.679

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.810 
pull the data from pachoo Bay
broadcasted<00:00:55.079> by<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> other<00:00:55.440> Arduino<00:00:56.070> which

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
broadcasted by the other Arduino which

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.660 
broadcasted by the other Arduino which
will<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.239> allow<00:00:57.270> me<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.960> control<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.670> robot

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
will then allow me to control the robot

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.099 
will then allow me to control the robot
over<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.239> Internet

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
over the Internet

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.529 
over the Internet
but<00:01:01.890> I'm<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:02.280> there<00:01:02.520> yet<00:01:02.730> I'm<00:01:03.000> still<00:01:03.180> waiting

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
but I'm not there yet I'm still waiting

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.560 
but I'm not there yet I'm still waiting
on<00:01:03.629> parts<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.170> pieces<00:01:04.909> this<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.150> all<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.330> have

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
on parts and pieces this is all I have

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.630 
on parts and pieces this is all I have
so<00:01:06.750> far<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.680> robot<00:01:08.070> I've<00:01:08.310> set<00:01:08.610> up

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
so far I just have the robot I've set up

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.380 
so far I just have the robot I've set up
this<00:01:08.850> first<00:01:09.240> servo<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.640> basically<00:01:11.640> be

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
this first servo for it to basically be

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.840 
this first servo for it to basically be
able<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.740> let<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> robot<00:01:14.070> turn<00:01:14.340> left<00:01:14.670> and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
able to let the robot turn left and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.969 
able to let the robot turn left and
right<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.290> much<00:01:16.470> better<00:01:16.619> because

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
right but this is much better because

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.219 
right but this is much better because
the<00:01:17.070> original<00:01:17.250> servo<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.540> turn<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> left<00:01:19.020> it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the original servo if I turn the left it

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.499 
the original servo if I turn the left it
would<00:01:19.350> turn<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> extreme<00:01:20.820> left<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.420> I

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
would turn to the extreme left and if I

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.910 
would turn to the extreme left and if I
turn<00:01:21.570> right<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.020> would<00:01:22.140> turn<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> extreme

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
turn right it would turn to the extreme

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.359 
turn right it would turn to the extreme
right

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
right

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.359 
right
I<00:01:23.400> had<00:01:24.240> no<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.720> between<00:01:25.259> which<00:01:25.619> gave<00:01:25.950> me<00:01:26.159> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
I had no in between which gave me a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.289 
I had no in between which gave me a
little<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.479> no<00:01:27.680> stability<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.280> no<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:30.150> as

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
little to no stability and no not as

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.670 
little to no stability and no not as
much<00:01:30.450> control<00:01:30.869> as<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.380> would<00:01:31.530> like<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:33.680> anyway

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
much control as I would like so anyway

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.170 
much control as I would like so anyway

pull the left analog stick left it will

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.990 
pull the left analog stick left it will
turn<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.110> robot<00:02:16.380> left<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.980> turn<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.819> right

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
turn the robot left I turn it right

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.680 
turn the robot left I turn it right
it'll<00:02:18.420> turn<00:02:18.599> right<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.270> actually

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
it'll turn right so this is actually

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.130 
it'll turn right so this is actually
much<00:02:21.930> sturdier<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.590> much<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:24.390> whole<00:02:24.959> lot

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
much sturdier and much a whole lot

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.300 
much sturdier and much a whole lot
better<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.680> terms<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:27.650> how<00:02:28.650> much<00:02:28.770> control<00:02:29.190> and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
better in terms of how much control and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.300 
better in terms of how much control and
precision<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.849> have<00:02:30.120> over<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.569> robot<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.950> but

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
precision I have over the robot so but

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.540 
precision I have over the robot so but
this<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:34.410> first<00:02:34.620> few<00:02:34.800> stages<00:02:35.069> I'm

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
this is just the first few stages I'm

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.170 
this is just the first few stages I'm
hoping<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.330> make<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> lot<00:02:37.140> more<00:02:37.260> progress<00:02:37.319> and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
hoping to make a lot more progress and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.680 
hoping to make a lot more progress and
hope<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.209> upload<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.690> lot<00:02:39.959> more<00:02:40.140> videos<00:02:41.690> showing

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
hope to upload a lot more videos showing

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.870 
hope to upload a lot more videos showing
how<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.470> project<00:02:43.890> goes<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.280> really<00:02:44.519> hope<00:02:44.700> it

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
interface the ps2 with the Arduino or

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.640 
interface the ps2 with the Arduino or
how<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.730> Arduino<00:03:00.269> talks<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.840> servo<00:03:01.290> or

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650
