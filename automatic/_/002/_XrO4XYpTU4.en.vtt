00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.270
 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.529
 I bring you one more option on how to start 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.340
 a braid of 4 segments and I hope you like it 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:18.370
 then let's start 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:22.680
 take a lock 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.680
 separates 4 segments of hair 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.680
 the left segment passes below the 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:45.260
 right now on the right side the 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.630
 first segment of this side went through 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.110
 over the left carrying it 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.500
 directly towards the center thus leaving 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.140
 joined the braid will continue the same 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.650
 forms the first segment of left 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.620
 happens below the right now of the 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.910
 right side the first bass on this side 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.009
 He passed it over the left 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.980
 taking it directly to the center 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:16.830
 thus leaving the actress together 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.130
 and so we will continue weaving until 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.130
 final 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.950
 and do not forget to put a ring at the end 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.950
 of this one 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.040
 and if you want you can loosen the braid to 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.040
 all along 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.070
 I hope you liked this braid 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.550
 of 4 ends you see that this is another 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.140
 option of how you could start it we 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.140
 we see soon smile
