00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.089
 there was once in the league of legends 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.519
 a subnormal who entered the game 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.660
 said I'm going to play jungle dance and nothing of 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.970
 what you do or say is not going to do 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.740
 change your mind a poor man who 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.660
 he was on his team seeing himself in that 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.490
 situation thought good because since this 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.640
 It is going to be a fucking garbage at least 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.940
 You play jon and so I have a good time 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.870
 takes appeal to the pod 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.870
 those people 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.079
 i 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.100
 come to the contrary 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.710
 see you later 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.629
 and what the fuck 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.740
 what balls to texts songs 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.740
 well, that 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 great 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.390
 and I do not say if several minutes 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.680
 or 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.980
 but together 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.980
 if not 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.119
 so he told me everything 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.510
 it is proposed the study can not do 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.510
 study 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.560
 and 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.050
 yes 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.610
 if not 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.880
 there is nothing is doing is the second 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.880
 dragon 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.999
 and it seemed silly when we bought it 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.999
 when a botijo 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.959
 I have a few seconds and I'm going I'm going 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.830
 I send you 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.340
 with the heat 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.010
 I 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.010
 goodbye 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:12.769
 no, it is true, there is much more support 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.769
 is pulling aesthetic
