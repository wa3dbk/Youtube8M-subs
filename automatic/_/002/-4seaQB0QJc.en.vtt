00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.119 
about how evolved this is basically
quarter-inch<00:00:54.360> luan<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.020> bottom<00:00:55.530> quarter

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129

boards<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:58.949> between<00:00:59.280> luckily<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.329> were<00:01:00.420> able

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
boards in between luckily we were able

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.490 
boards in between luckily we were able
to<00:01:00.719> get<00:01:01.219> each<00:01:02.219> one<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.670> these<00:01:02.870> foam<00:01:03.870> panels<00:01:04.320> out

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to get each one of these foam panels out

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500 
to get each one of these foam panels out
it's<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.010> make<00:01:05.189> reassembling<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.330> a

you know took a lot of time to ream

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.090 
you know took a lot of time to ream
everything<00:02:21.050> out<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.410> get<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.710> so<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:21.950> would

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
everything out to get it so it would

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.220 
everything out to get it so it would
slide<00:02:22.400> in<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.760> far<00:02:23.060> but<00:02:23.330> here<00:02:23.930> are<00:02:24.050> pretty

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
slide in that far but here are pretty

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.700 
slide in that far but here are pretty
well<00:02:24.610> all<00:02:25.610> those<00:02:25.850> edges<00:02:26.090> I<00:02:26.480> mean<00:02:27.260> they

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
well all those edges I mean they

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.800 
well all those edges I mean they
practically<00:02:28.310> don't<00:02:28.490> even<00:02:28.730> need<00:02:28.880> trim<00:02:29.360> or

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
practically don't even need trim or

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.250 
practically don't even need trim or
anything<00:02:30.110> but<00:02:30.770> uh<00:02:31.540> we<00:02:32.540> will<00:02:32.690> touch<00:02:32.930> up<00:02:33.140> the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
anything but uh we will touch up the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:47.160 
anything but uh we will touch up the
interior<00:02:41.740> just<00:02:42.740> making<00:02:43.100> my<00:02:43.220> way<00:02:43.370> around<00:02:43.760> here

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.040 

the<00:02:48.170> insides<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.650> those<00:02:48.830> cabinets<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:50.240> inner

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
the insides of those cabinets the inner

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.590 
the insides of those cabinets the inner
plates<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:51.650> still<00:02:51.920> have<00:02:52.130> they'll<00:02:52.580> just<00:02:52.880> be<00:02:53.360> put

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
plates I still have they'll just be put

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.580 
plates I still have they'll just be put
in<00:02:53.720> afterwards<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.810> top<00:02:57.020> side<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.380> roof

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
in afterwards the top side of the roof

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.820 
in afterwards the top side of the roof
roof<00:02:58.130> is<00:02:58.340> far<00:02:58.550> more<00:02:58.700> interesting<00:02:59.770> this<00:03:00.770> is

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
roof is far more interesting this is

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.890 
roof is far more interesting this is
where<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.760> know<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:02.060> individual<00:03:02.660> foam

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
where you know the individual foam

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.720 
where you know the individual foam
panels<00:03:03.350> had<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.590> be<00:03:03.709> glued<00:03:03.980> down<00:03:04.190> one<00:03:04.520> at<00:03:04.640> a

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
panels had to be glued down one at a

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
panels had to be glued down one at a
time<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.300> then<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:07.430> top<00:03:07.880> panels<00:03:08.300> had<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.630> be

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
time and then the top panels had to be

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.509 
time and then the top panels had to be
glued<00:03:08.959> down<00:03:09.140> on<00:03:09.320> top<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.560> them<00:03:09.830> so<00:03:10.160> you're

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
glued down on top of them so you're

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.090 
glued down on top of them so you're
talking<00:03:10.840> several<00:03:11.840> days<00:03:12.140> of<00:03:12.500> waiting<00:03:12.890> for

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
talking several days of waiting for

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.210 
talking several days of waiting for
sealants<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.330> contacts<00:03:14.930> ments<00:03:15.350> to<00:03:15.560> cure<00:03:15.860> in

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
sealants and contacts ments to cure in

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.870 
sealants and contacts ments to cure in
between<00:03:16.700> applications<00:03:18.220> carrying<00:03:19.220> heavy

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
between applications carrying heavy

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.020 
between applications carrying heavy
bricks<00:03:20.239> on<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.630> off<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.870> roof<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.580> daily<00:03:22.580> basis

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
bricks on and off the roof a daily basis

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.560 
bricks on and off the roof a daily basis
so<00:03:24.220> it's<00:03:25.220> definitely<00:03:25.730> if<00:03:26.360> several<00:03:28.570> intervals

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
so it's definitely if several intervals

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.600 
so it's definitely if several intervals
of<00:03:29.810> time<00:03:30.019> that<00:03:30.260> are<00:03:30.350> passing<00:03:30.590> between<00:03:31.070> each<00:03:31.400> of

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
of time that are passing between each of

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.140 
of time that are passing between each of
these<00:03:31.700> clips<00:03:33.250> at<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.370> point<00:03:34.580> we<00:03:34.730> finally<00:03:35.060> got

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
these clips at this point we finally got

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.300 
these clips at this point we finally got
it<00:03:35.300> ripped<00:03:35.480> down<00:03:35.540> towards<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.260> rear<00:03:36.890> which

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
it ripped down towards the rear which

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.680 
it ripped down towards the rear which
that<00:03:37.580> didn't<00:03:37.880> that<00:03:38.150> didn't<00:03:38.420> occur<00:03:38.660> until

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
that didn't that didn't occur until

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:48.820 
that didn't that didn't occur until
really<00:03:39.470> late<00:03:39.590> in<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:39.890> project

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.440 

all<00:03:49.830> that<00:03:50.220> all<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.460> rubber<00:03:50.790> still<00:03:51.120> had<00:03:51.240> to<00:03:51.330> be

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
all that all that rubber still had to be

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.570 
all that all that rubber still had to be
removed<00:03:51.780> at<00:03:52.050> that<00:03:52.200> point<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.650> was<00:03:52.830> how

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
removed at that point that was how

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.550 
removed at that point that was how
several<00:03:53.910> hours<00:03:54.360> labor<00:03:54.660> there<00:03:57.200> this<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:58.380> where

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
several hours labor there this is where

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.330 
several hours labor there this is where
things<00:03:58.770> are<00:03:58.980> shaping<00:03:59.160> together<00:03:59.610> and

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
things are shaping together and

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.220 
things are shaping together and
everything<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.520> done<00:04:02.940> is<00:04:03.360> ready<00:04:03.720> for<00:04:03.990> rubber

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
everything is done is ready for rubber

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.720 
everything is done is ready for rubber
to<00:04:04.650> be<00:04:04.740> glued<00:04:04.980> down

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
to be glued down

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.790 
to be glued down
we<00:04:06.030> used<00:04:06.300> Pella<00:04:07.260> window<00:04:07.620> tape<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.250> tar<00:04:08.910> based

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
we used Pella window tape and tar based

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.110 
we used Pella window tape and tar based
aluminum<00:04:10.800> tape<00:04:11.040> for<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.430> edges<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.000> all

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
aluminum tape for the edges and all

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.630 
aluminum tape for the edges and all
those<00:04:12.330> seams<00:04:12.630> we<00:04:12.960> had<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.170> really<00:04:13.610> make<00:04:14.610> sure

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
those seams we had to really make sure

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.990 
those seams we had to really make sure
we<00:04:14.880> went<00:04:15.480> over<00:04:15.720> every<00:04:16.080> little<00:04:16.640> every<00:04:17.640> little

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
we went over every little every little

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.690 
we went over every little every little
screw<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.420> broke<00:04:18.690> off<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.320> every<00:04:20.190> possible

screw that broke off and every possible
rough<00:04:21.570> edge<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:22.560> could<00:04:22.710> puncture<00:04:22.890> that

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
rough edge that could puncture that

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:31.970 
rough edge that could puncture that
rubber<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:30.360> here<00:04:30.960> we've<00:04:31.140> actually<00:04:31.440> laid<00:04:31.770> out

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
rubber and here we've actually laid out

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
we had to make sure that it was set in

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.040 
we had to make sure that it was set in
its<00:04:37.530> final<00:04:38.460> position<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:39.090> then<00:04:39.450> first<00:04:39.870> we

when we rolled this down we needed some

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
heat to get up into this section just a

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.390 
heat to get up into this section just a

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
aid in the curing because it wasn't

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.420 
aid in the curing because it wasn't
still<00:05:27.180> wasn't<00:05:27.419> warm<00:05:27.600> enough<00:05:27.840> you<00:05:28.440> know<00:05:29.310> like

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
still wasn't warm enough you know like

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.850 
still wasn't warm enough you know like
today's<00:05:29.669> November<00:05:30.150> eighth<00:05:30.300> and<00:05:30.630> it's<00:05:30.750> like<00:05:30.960> 45

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
today's November eighth and it's like 45

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.340 
today's November eighth and it's like 45
degrees<00:05:32.220> out<00:05:32.490> so<00:05:33.030> I've<00:05:33.300> decided<00:05:33.570> that<00:05:33.960> this<00:05:34.200> is

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
degrees out so I've decided that this is

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.990 
degrees out so I've decided that this is
it<00:05:34.530> for<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:34.860> year<00:05:34.890> I<00:05:35.340> don't<00:05:35.550> feel<00:05:35.790> comfortable

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
it for the year I don't feel comfortable

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.409 
it for the year I don't feel comfortable
dealing<00:05:36.510> with<00:05:36.720> sealants<00:05:37.680> and<00:05:37.740> adhesives<00:05:38.419> when

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
dealing with sealants and adhesives when

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.300 
dealing with sealants and adhesives when
it's<00:05:39.570> going<00:05:39.720> to<00:05:39.780> be<00:05:39.900> that<00:05:40.080> cold<00:05:40.530> out<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.220> I

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
it's going to be that cold out and I

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.340 
it's going to be that cold out and I
think<00:05:41.550> that<00:05:41.760> this<00:05:42.300> is<00:05:42.480> very<00:05:42.630> well<00:05:42.930> prepped<00:05:43.230> for

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
think that this is very well prepped for

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.420 
think that this is very well prepped for
the<00:05:43.530> winter<00:05:44.150> we're<00:05:45.150> going<00:05:45.419> to<00:05:45.630> put<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.890> new

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
the winter we're going to put a new

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.590 
the winter we're going to put a new
plastic<00:05:47.730> down<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.540> original<00:05:48.720> tarp<00:05:49.590> down<00:05:49.919> and

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
plastic down the original tarp down and

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.170 
plastic down the original tarp down and
put<00:05:51.600> a<00:05:51.870> lot<00:05:52.590> of<00:05:52.770> weight<00:05:53.160> on<00:05:53.190> top<00:05:53.580> of<00:05:53.730> it<00:05:53.880> just<00:05:54.000> so

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
put a lot of weight on top of it just so

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.060 
put a lot of weight on top of it just so
that<00:05:54.300> I<00:05:54.330> can't<00:05:54.630> go<00:05:54.840> anywhere<00:05:55.169> tie<00:05:55.830> it<00:05:55.890> down

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
that I can't go anywhere tie it down

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.680 
that I can't go anywhere tie it down
really<00:05:56.280> securely<00:05:56.729> for<00:05:56.970> the<00:05:57.060> winter<00:05:57.300> and<00:05:57.450> even

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
really securely for the winter and even

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.600 
really securely for the winter and even
if<00:05:58.380> it<00:05:58.470> does<00:05:58.620> leak<00:05:58.860> I<00:05:59.039> think<00:05:59.250> we're<00:05:59.370> in<00:05:59.430> pretty

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
if it does leak I think we're in pretty

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.760 
if it does leak I think we're in pretty
good<00:05:59.700> shape<00:05:59.820> here

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
good shape here

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.760 
good shape here
this<00:06:02.669> project<00:06:03.210> has<00:06:03.360> been<00:06:03.650> overwhelming<00:06:04.650> to

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
this project has been overwhelming to

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.480 
this project has been overwhelming to
say<00:06:04.919> the<00:06:05.039> least

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
say the least

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.179 
say the least
I<00:06:05.610> hope<00:06:05.970> it's<00:06:06.180> useful<00:06:06.389> for<00:06:06.689> somebody<00:06:07.259> I<00:06:07.500> hope

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:08.189 
I hope it's useful for somebody I hope

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:10.129 
I hope it's useful for somebody I hope
it<00:06:08.370> doesn't<00:06:08.699> discourage<00:06:09.270> you<00:06:09.629> as<00:06:09.810> much<00:06:09.990> as

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 
it doesn't discourage you as much as

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:11.990 
it doesn't discourage you as much as
it's<00:06:10.319> discouraged<00:06:10.919> me<00:06:11.189> hopefully<00:06:11.849> it's

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
it's discouraged me hopefully it's

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.080 
it's discouraged me hopefully it's
actually<00:06:12.300> useful<00:06:13.280> in<00:06:14.280> the<00:06:14.460> end<00:06:14.610> I'm<00:06:14.819> glad<00:06:15.060> I

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
actually useful in the end I'm glad I

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.779 
actually useful in the end I'm glad I
did<00:06:15.449> it<00:06:15.479> but<00:06:16.110> it's<00:06:16.740> been<00:06:16.949> a<00:06:16.979> lot<00:06:17.219> a<00:06:17.280> lot<00:06:17.639> of

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:17.789 
did it but it's been a lot a lot of

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.659 
did it but it's been a lot a lot of
labour<00:06:17.969> so<00:06:18.620> in<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:19.770> end<00:06:19.919> it<00:06:20.099> wound<00:06:20.280> up<00:06:20.460> being

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
labour so in the end it wound up being

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:25.640 
labour so in the end it wound up being
around<00:06:21.270> 1,500<00:06:22.110> in<00:06:23.240> materials<00:06:24.240> which<00:06:25.199> actually

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
around 1,500 in materials which actually

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.589 
around 1,500 in materials which actually
wasn't<00:06:25.860> bad<00:06:26.340> at<00:06:26.580> all<00:06:26.729> considering<00:06:27.210> how<00:06:27.419> many

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 
wasn't bad at all considering how many

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:30.170 
wasn't bad at all considering how many
days<00:06:27.870> I<00:06:28.169> probably<00:06:28.349> have<00:06:28.620> 15<00:06:29.430> full<00:06:29.729> days<00:06:29.939> of

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
days I probably have 15 full days of

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.399 
days I probably have 15 full days of
labour<00:06:30.469> from<00:06:31.469> start<00:06:31.800> to<00:06:31.919> finish<00:06:31.949> so<00:06:33.259> the<00:06:34.259> one

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:34.409 
labour from start to finish so the one

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.339 
labour from start to finish so the one
thing<00:06:34.620> is<00:06:34.860> the<00:06:35.159> DAP<00:06:36.090> weld<00:06:36.449> would<00:06:36.719> contact

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
thing is the DAP weld would contact

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.350 
thing is the DAP weld would contact
cement<00:06:37.590> we<00:06:38.159> went<00:06:38.370> through<00:06:38.639> probably<00:06:39.090> six

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
cement we went through probably six

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.200 
cement we went through probably six
gallons<00:06:39.780> of<00:06:39.900> that<00:06:40.280> from<00:06:41.280> start<00:06:41.520> to<00:06:41.610> finish<00:06:41.639> and

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
gallons of that from start to finish and

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.480 
gallons of that from start to finish and
that<00:06:42.270> stuff<00:06:42.659> is<00:06:42.949> forty<00:06:43.949> one<00:06:44.099> forty<00:06:44.340> two

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
that stuff is forty one forty two

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.279 
that stuff is forty one forty two
dollars<00:06:44.610> a<00:06:44.909> gallon<00:06:45.120> so<00:06:45.569> if<00:06:45.690> you<00:06:45.840> take

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:46.289 
dollars a gallon so if you take

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:48.559 
dollars a gallon so if you take
something<00:06:46.680> like<00:06:46.710> this<00:06:46.979> on<00:06:47.190> you<00:06:47.789> know<00:06:47.879> just<00:06:48.449> be

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:48.569 
something like this on you know just be

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:50.480 
something like this on you know just be
prepared<00:06:48.840> to<00:06:49.229> spend<00:06:49.530> you<00:06:49.860> know<00:06:49.979> I<00:06:50.009> think<00:06:50.400> we

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
prepared to spend you know I think we

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.279 
prepared to spend you know I think we
spent<00:06:50.759> two<00:06:51.030> three<00:06:51.330> hundred<00:06:51.419> dollars<00:06:51.840> just<00:06:52.110> in

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
spent two three hundred dollars just in

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:54.920 
spent two three hundred dollars just in
contact<00:06:52.919> cement<00:06:53.099> so<00:06:53.940> that<00:06:54.300> was<00:06:54.419> a<00:06:54.449> surprising

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
contact cement so that was a surprising
