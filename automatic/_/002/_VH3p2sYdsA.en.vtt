emblem that's even lighter plastic and
I'll<00:01:10.740> show<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.040> what<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> good<00:01:12.229> primer<00:01:13.229> stage

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
I'll show you what a good primer stage

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.969 
I'll show you what a good primer stage
will<00:01:14.340> look<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.729> might<00:01:15.450> use<00:01:15.979> adhesion

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
will look like might use adhesion

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.649 
will look like might use adhesion
promoter<00:01:17.369> instead<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.820> primer<00:01:18.060> I'm<00:01:18.270> not<00:01:18.420> sure

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
promoter instead of primer I'm not sure

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.999 
promoter instead of primer I'm not sure
yet<00:01:19.100> but<00:01:20.100> I'll<00:01:20.430> be<00:01:20.520> back<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:20.729> more<00:01:21.090> progress

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
yet but I'll be back with more progress

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.770 
yet but I'll be back with more progress
so<00:01:23.009> after<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> lot<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.640> sanding<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.360> moving<00:01:24.659> all

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
so after a lot of sanding and moving all

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.289 
so after a lot of sanding and moving all
the<00:01:24.869> way<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.290> 80<00:01:25.590> grit<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.729> start<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.119> use<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the way up to 80 grit to start to use a

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.819 
the way up to 80 grit to start to use a
smaller<00:01:27.930> sanding<00:01:28.470> disc<00:01:29.689> just<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:30.990> some<00:01:31.710> of

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
smaller sanding disc just to get some of

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.240 
smaller sanding disc just to get some of
the<00:01:31.920> tight<00:01:32.280> corners<00:01:33.259> this<00:01:34.259> paint<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.710> terrible

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the tight corners this paint is terrible

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.170 
the tight corners this paint is terrible
and<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:37.799> runs<00:01:38.100> we're<00:01:38.610> really<00:01:38.790> hard<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.090> get

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
and the runs we're really hard to get

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.640 
and the runs we're really hard to get
out<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.720> that's<00:01:39.840> why<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.110> went<00:01:40.320> all<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.470> way<00:01:40.560> up

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
out so that's why I went all the way up

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.429 
out so that's why I went all the way up
to<00:01:40.920> 80<00:01:41.810> hopefully<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.899> don't<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> same

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
to 80 hopefully you don't have the same

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.300 
to 80 hopefully you don't have the same
problem<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.450> think<00:01:45.450> once<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.780> get<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.380> with

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
problem but I think once I get this with

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.660 
problem but I think once I get this with
the<00:01:47.460> smaller<00:01:47.759> disc<00:01:48.119> then<00:01:48.890> we'll<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:50.040> ready<00:01:50.220> for

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the smaller disc then we'll be ready for

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.560 
the smaller disc then we'll be ready for
adhesion<00:01:51.450> promoter<00:01:51.930> or<00:01:52.140> primary<00:01:52.649> pretty<00:01:52.890> soon

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
adhesion promoter or primary pretty soon

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.330 
adhesion promoter or primary pretty soon
so<00:01:54.570> here's<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> first<00:01:55.079> coat<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.409> primer<00:01:55.680> it's

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
so here's the first coat of primer it's

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.039 
so here's the first coat of primer it's
got<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> little<00:01:56.700> bit<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.000> sanding<00:01:57.360> then<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.810> find

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
three or four coats it's going to take a

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.100 
three or four coats it's going to take a
lot<00:02:23.069> too<00:02:23.700> big<00:02:23.879> piece<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.450> might<00:02:24.689> have<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.930> get<00:02:25.049> a

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
lot too big piece I might have to get a

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.050 
lot too big piece I might have to get a
few<00:02:25.290> more<00:02:25.439> cans

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
few more cans

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.550 
few more cans
so<00:02:27.900> now<00:02:28.049> just<00:02:29.840> spraying<00:02:31.250> sanding<00:02:32.250> washing<00:02:33.120> and

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
so now just spraying sanding washing and

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.069 
so now just spraying sanding washing and
doing<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.790> as<00:02:35.790> many<00:02:36.060> times<00:02:36.150> until<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:36.780> get

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
doing that as many times until I get

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.210 
doing that as many times until I get
something<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.129> I<00:02:38.159> like<00:02:39.890> then<00:02:40.890> I'm<00:02:41.040> going<00:02:41.189> to

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
something that I like then I'm going to

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.930 
something that I like then I'm going to
shoot<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.549> with<00:02:41.609> a<00:02:42.090> perfect<00:02:42.930> match

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
shoot it with a perfect match

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.990 
shoot it with a perfect match
dupli-color<00:02:45.560> gloss<00:02:46.560> black<00:02:46.829> to<00:02:47.609> match<00:02:47.790> my

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
dupli-color gloss black to match my

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.420 
dupli-color gloss black to match my
truck<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:50.150> we'll<00:02:51.150> see<00:02:51.329> how<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.599> turns<00:02:51.810> out

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
truck and we'll see how that turns out

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.819 
truck and we'll see how that turns out
so<00:02:53.430> after<00:02:53.760> priming<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.359> sanding<00:02:54.900> three<00:02:55.709> or

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
so after priming and sanding three or

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.360 
so after priming and sanding three or
four<00:02:56.069> times<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.639> laid<00:02:57.569> down<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.900> first<00:02:58.340> coat<00:02:59.340> of

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
four times I laid down the first coat of

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.410 
four times I laid down the first coat of
base<00:02:59.609> and<00:03:01.909> definitely<00:03:02.909> should<00:03:03.120> have<00:03:03.209> done<00:03:03.389> a

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
base and definitely should have done a

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.849 
base and definitely should have done a
few<00:03:03.659> more<00:03:03.900> sanding<00:03:05.299> cycles<00:03:06.299> I<00:03:06.840> got<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.620> lot<00:03:07.829> of

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
few more sanding cycles I got a lot of

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.110 
few more sanding cycles I got a lot of
the<00:03:08.010> runs<00:03:08.250> out<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:08.760> were<00:03:08.849> in<00:03:08.939> there

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
the runs out that were in there

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.690 
the runs out that were in there
previously<00:03:09.799> but<00:03:10.799> this<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.519> not<00:03:11.670> a

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
previously but this is not a

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.420 
previously but this is not a
professional<00:03:12.269> job<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.900> $15.00<00:03:13.739> job<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.400> I

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
professional job it's a $15.00 job so I

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.400 
professional job it's a $15.00 job so I
kind<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.819> expected<00:03:15.329> it<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.660> not<00:03:15.780> be<00:03:15.810> perfect

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
kind of expected it to not be perfect

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.059 
kind of expected it to not be perfect
but<00:03:17.030> definitely<00:03:18.030> better<00:03:18.150> than<00:03:18.269> what<00:03:18.569> it<00:03:18.660> was

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
but definitely better than what it was

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.390 
but definitely better than what it was
uh<00:03:20.069> looks<00:03:20.579> pretty<00:03:20.879> matte<00:03:21.150> right<00:03:21.510> now<00:03:22.400> I'm

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
uh looks pretty matte right now I'm

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.059 
uh looks pretty matte right now I'm
hoping<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.239> clear<00:03:25.019> will<00:03:25.680> help<00:03:25.859> that<00:03:26.040> out

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
hoping that the clear will help that out

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.619 
hoping that the clear will help that out
I<00:03:27.109> got<00:03:28.109> three<00:03:28.650> cans<00:03:28.889> of<00:03:29.010> clear<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.549> that<00:03:30.389> may

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
I got three cans of clear and that may

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.439 
I got three cans of clear and that may
not<00:03:30.780> be<00:03:30.959> enough<00:03:31.459> it<00:03:32.459> doesn't<00:03:32.669> really<00:03:33.000> seem<00:03:33.239> to

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
not be enough it doesn't really seem to

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.960 
not be enough it doesn't really seem to
blast<00:03:33.720> right<00:03:33.959> now<00:03:34.129> I'm<00:03:35.129> debating<00:03:35.340> whether<00:03:35.699> I

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
blast right now I'm debating whether I

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.170 
blast right now I'm debating whether I
should<00:03:36.120> be<00:03:36.419> wet<00:03:36.690> sanding<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:38.280> clear<00:03:38.790> once<00:03:39.090> I

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
should be wet sanding the clear once I

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.199 
should be wet sanding the clear once I
started<00:03:39.629> I<00:03:40.040> might<00:03:41.040> do<00:03:41.190> test<00:03:41.579> section<00:03:42.000> on<00:03:42.120> the

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
started I might do test section on the

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.960 
started I might do test section on the
back<00:03:44.000> we'll<00:03:45.000> come<00:03:45.180> back<00:03:45.359> with<00:03:45.479> more<00:03:45.510> progress

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
back we'll come back with more progress

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.339 
back we'll come back with more progress
so<00:03:47.970> here's<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.329> finished<00:03:48.510> product<00:03:49.139> of<00:03:49.290> the

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
so here's the finished product of the

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.539 
so here's the finished product of the
grill<00:03:49.650> after<00:03:49.889> painting<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:51.079> blossom<00:03:52.549> turned

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
grill after painting and blossom turned

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.000 
grill after painting and blossom turned
out<00:03:53.699> a<00:03:53.729> little<00:03:53.970> bit<00:03:54.180> flat<00:03:54.739> could<00:03:55.739> have<00:03:55.859> done

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
out a little bit flat could have done

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.909 
out a little bit flat could have done
some<00:03:56.220> more<00:03:56.340> sanding<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:56.970> bring<00:03:57.209> up<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.449> glass

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
some more sanding to bring up the glass

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:02.000 
some more sanding to bring up the glass
now<00:03:58.919> we're<00:03:59.099> going<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.310> reinstall<00:03:59.729> it
