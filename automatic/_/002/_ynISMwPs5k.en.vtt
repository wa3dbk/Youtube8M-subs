00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.850 
logo LG down here and cover for
everything<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.240> overall<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.380> much<00:02:01.619> girl

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
everything so overall this much girl

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.800 
everything so overall this much girl
this<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.369> probably<00:02:02.520> one<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.000> best

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
this is probably one of the best

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.319 
this is probably one of the best
cheapest<00:02:04.350> cases<00:02:04.770> you're<00:02:04.920> gonna<00:02:05.040> get<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.460> terms

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
cheapest cases you're gonna get in terms

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.520 
cheapest cases you're gonna get in terms
of<00:02:06.390> protection<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.960> will<00:02:07.079> protect<00:02:07.380> you

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
of protection it will protect you

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.380 
of protection it will protect you
against<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:08.009> normal<00:02:08.429> drop<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.060> if<00:02:09.149> you're<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
against a normal drop so if you're to

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.930 
against a normal drop so if you're to
drop<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.780> gets<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.739> surface<00:02:11.190> though

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
drop it gets the surface though

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.760 
drop it gets the surface though
only<00:02:12.150> do<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.420> again<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:13.050> should<00:02:13.200> protect<00:02:13.590> it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
only do that again it should protect it

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.050 
only do that again it should protect it
and<00:02:13.920> especially<00:02:14.250> because<00:02:14.610> there's<00:02:14.820> glass<00:02:15.000> on

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and especially because there's glass on

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.190 
and especially because there's glass on
the<00:02:15.210> front<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.690> back<00:02:15.750> especially

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
the front and the back especially

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.900 
the front and the back especially
definitely<00:02:17.010> want<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.190> protect<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.580> glass<00:02:17.670> in

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
definitely want to protect the glass in

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.970 
definitely want to protect the glass in
about<00:02:18.120> because<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.990> can<00:02:19.260> be<00:02:19.410> pretty<00:02:19.620> easy<00:02:19.740> to

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
about because it can be pretty easy to

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.310 
about because it can be pretty easy to
break<00:02:20.280> if<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.520> were<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.730> drop<00:02:20.880> at<00:02:21.060> once<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:21.540> if

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
break if you were to drop at once so if

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.990 
break if you were to drop at once so if
you're<00:02:22.770> looking<00:02:22.830> for<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.190> cheap<00:02:23.430> case<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.880> can
