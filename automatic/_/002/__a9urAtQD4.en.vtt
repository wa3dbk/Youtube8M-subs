that we apply to the first page will be

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.580 
that we apply to the first page will be
propagated<00:01:23.789> through<00:01:24.240> other<00:01:24.509> rest<00:01:25.319> of<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.050 

and<00:01:34.469> that<00:01:34.979> will<00:01:35.130> mean<00:01:35.219> if<00:01:35.369> any<00:01:35.520> changes<00:01:35.939> we

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and that will mean if any changes we

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.580 
and that will mean if any changes we
make<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.450> first<00:01:36.659> one<00:01:36.899> will<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.350> replicated

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
make to the first one will be replicated

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.420 
make to the first one will be replicated
and<00:01:38.340> these<00:01:38.579> other<00:01:38.820> ones<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.450> side<00:01:40.430> so

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and these other ones on this side so

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.249 
and these other ones on this side so
first<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.789> all<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.000> want<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.390> rotate<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:43.020> one

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
first of all we want to rotate this one

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.440 
first of all we want to rotate this one
and<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:44.280> needs<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.640> rotated<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.360> left

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and it needs to be rotated to the left

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.660 
and it needs to be rotated to the left
so<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.439> fit<00:01:46.740> we're<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> first<00:01:47.310> tab<00:01:47.640> here

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
so the fit we're on the first tab here

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.929 
so the fit we're on the first tab here
we'll<00:01:48.179> click<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> first<00:01:48.840> image<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
we'll click on the first image and

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.389 
we'll click on the first image and
rotate<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.329> left<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.979> then<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.280> do

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
rotate it to the left and then we can do

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.980 
rotate it to the left and then we can do
a<00:01:53.429> preview<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.240> see<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.600> worked<00:01:54.780> all

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
a preview just to see if it's worked all

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.899 
a preview just to see if it's worked all
right<00:01:55.020> yes<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.560> has<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.610> will<00:01:56.759> have

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
right yes it has and that will have

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.520 
right yes it has and that will have
being<00:01:57.149> propagated<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.719> all<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:58.049> those<00:01:58.200> ones

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
being propagated to all of those ones

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.510 
being propagated to all of those ones
now<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.369> click<00:01:59.610> on<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> right-hand<00:02:00.270> side<00:02:00.509> and

here is not fully rectangular slightly

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.690 
here is not fully rectangular slightly
narrower<00:02:30.420> at<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.690> top<00:02:30.799> so<00:02:31.799> you<00:02:32.099> have<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.430> drag

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
narrower at the top so you have to drag

this little peak this little 4 handled
guide<00:02:36.989> here<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.130> four<00:02:38.400> corners<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.970> the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
guide here to the four corners of the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.420 
guide here to the four corners of the
page<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:39.989> we<00:02:40.109> drag<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.470> start<00:02:40.829> with<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> bottom

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
page so we drag the start with a bottom

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.720 
page so we drag the start with a bottom
right<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.000> drag<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.959> down<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.859> that<00:02:44.160> roughly

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
right and drag it down to that roughly

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.930 
right and drag it down to that roughly
and<00:02:45.120> then<00:02:45.150> we'll<00:02:46.019> take<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.350> top<00:02:46.590> right<00:02:46.940> and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
and then we'll take the top right and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.930 
and then we'll take the top right and
drag<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.359> over<00:02:48.480> there

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
drag it over there

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.460 
drag it over there
bottom<00:02:50.930> left

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.810 

and<00:02:54.920> finally<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.570> top<00:02:56.810> left<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.550> might

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
and finally the top left and you might

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.760 
and finally the top left and you might
want<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.120> make<00:02:59.240> a<00:02:59.270> few<00:02:59.540> little<00:02:59.770> modifications

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
want to make a few little modifications

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.790 
want to make a few little modifications
actually<00:03:01.520> this<00:03:01.700> looks<00:03:01.910> okay<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.770> we<00:03:03.770> can

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
actually this looks okay and we can

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.730 
actually this looks okay and we can
preview<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.550> now<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:05.930> see<00:03:06.380> that's<00:03:06.590> now

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
preview that now and you see that's now

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.830 
preview that now and you see that's now
a<00:03:06.770> rectangular<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:08.300> will<00:03:08.660> be

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
a rectangular and that will be

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.870 
a rectangular and that will be
propagated<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.500> all<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:10.040> ones<00:03:10.250> on<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:10.670> left

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
propagated to all the ones on the left

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.920 
propagated to all the ones on the left
side<00:03:11.380> now<00:03:12.380> we'll<00:03:12.770> do<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:12.980> right-hand<00:03:13.370> side

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
side now we'll do the right-hand side

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.230 
side now we'll do the right-hand side
and<00:03:17.440> but<00:03:18.440> just<00:03:18.710> take<00:03:18.920> take<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.580> preview<00:03:19.970> on

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
and but just take take the preview on

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.200 
and but just take take the preview on
what<00:03:20.360> off<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.660> show<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.560> handles<00:03:22.210> and

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
what off to show the the handles and

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.870 
what off to show the the handles and
we'll<00:03:24.020> drag<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:24.350> one<00:03:24.560> down<00:03:24.710> now<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.790> the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
we'll drag this one down now to the

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:40.620 
we'll drag this one down now to the
right-hand<00:03:26.240> side

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.870 

you<00:03:41.170> get<00:03:41.350> it<00:03:41.440> as<00:03:41.560> close<00:03:41.800> as<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:42.070> can<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.580> then

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
you get it as close as you can and then

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.970 
you get it as close as you can and then
maybe<00:03:43.360> just<00:03:43.660> make<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.870> few<00:03:44.170> little<00:03:44.290> tweaks<00:03:44.650> and

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
maybe just make a few little tweaks and

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.700 
maybe just make a few little tweaks and
she<00:03:45.190> go<00:03:45.370> along<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:46.750> one<00:03:46.960> needs<00:03:47.200> doing<00:03:47.530> down

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
she go along that one needs doing down

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.420 
she go along that one needs doing down
there

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.509 

I<00:03:55.329> think<00:03:56.329> that's<00:03:56.480> all<00:03:56.629> right<00:03:56.659> right<00:03:57.310> now<00:03:58.310> we're

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
I think that's all right right now we're

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.420 
I think that's all right right now we're
gonna<00:03:58.640> go<00:03:58.819> to<00:03:59.769> have<00:04:00.769> a<00:04:00.829> look<00:04:00.950> at<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.099> preview

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
gonna go to have a look at the preview

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.849 
gonna go to have a look at the preview
yep<00:04:01.760> that's<00:04:02.060> good<00:04:02.469> we'll<00:04:03.469> do<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.620> left<00:04:03.769> side

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
yep that's good we'll do the left side

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.860 
yep that's good we'll do the left side
outside<00:04:04.219> again<00:04:04.730> now<00:04:04.969> and<00:04:05.209> we're<00:04:05.540> going<00:04:05.659> to<00:04:05.780> do

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
outside again now and we're going to do

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.800 
outside again now and we're going to do
cropping<00:04:06.379> now<00:04:07.219> this<00:04:07.430> time<00:04:07.670> you<00:04:07.879> get<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.299> square

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
cropping now this time you get a square

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.259 
cropping now this time you get a square
with<00:04:08.989> two<00:04:09.230> handles<00:04:09.620> on<00:04:09.859> and<00:04:10.670> not<00:04:10.879> the<00:04:11.000> fall

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
with two handles on and not the fall

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.830 
with two handles on and not the fall
like<00:04:11.510> in<00:04:11.719> the<00:04:11.900> decode<00:04:12.849> the<00:04:13.849> key<00:04:14.090> styling<00:04:14.510> and

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
like in the decode the key styling and

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.500 
like in the decode the key styling and
you<00:04:15.650> just<00:04:15.920> drag<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.489> bottom<00:04:16.609> right

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510

all<00:04:28.789> this<00:04:28.970> garbage<00:04:29.330> around<00:04:29.720> here<00:04:29.990> is<00:04:30.319> going<00:04:31.069> to

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
all this garbage around here is going to

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.240 
all this garbage around here is going to
go<00:04:31.310> we<00:04:32.120> preview<00:04:32.539> that<00:04:32.750> and<00:04:33.590> that's<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.039> kind

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
go we preview that and that's the kind

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.830 
go we preview that and that's the kind
of<00:04:34.310> image<00:04:34.580> you're<00:04:34.699> going<00:04:34.729> to<00:04:34.970> get<00:04:35.150> do<00:04:35.539> the<00:04:35.630> same

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
of image you're going to get do the same

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.559 
of image you're going to get do the same
on<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.050> right<00:04:36.080> hand<00:04:36.440> side<00:04:37.270> click<00:04:38.270> off<00:04:38.449> the

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 
on the right hand side click off the

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:48.879 
on the right hand side click off the
preview<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.259> we'll<00:04:39.860> do<00:04:40.039> the<00:04:40.220> cropping<00:04:40.460> there

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.400 

and<00:04:49.580> take<00:04:49.819> that<00:04:50.030> one<00:04:50.180> down<00:04:50.360> too

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.470 

and<00:04:53.530> we<00:04:54.400> just<00:04:54.550> have<00:04:54.670> a<00:04:54.700> preview<00:04:55.060> of<00:04:55.120> that<00:04:55.360> one

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
and we just have a preview of that one

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.390 
and we just have a preview of that one
that's<00:04:56.320> okay

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
that's okay

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.540 
that's okay
then<00:04:57.970> finally<00:04:58.570> you<00:04:58.720> go<00:04:58.900> on<00:04:59.050> to<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.740> scaling

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
then finally you go on to the scaling

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.379 
then finally you go on to the scaling
and<00:05:02.520> first<00:05:03.520> of<00:05:03.639> all<00:05:03.699> I<00:05:03.729> like<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.060> use

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
and first of all I like to use

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.420 
and first of all I like to use
millimeters<00:05:04.990> so<00:05:05.229> millimeters<00:05:05.800> is<00:05:05.979> okay<00:05:06.370> but

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
millimeters so millimeters is okay but

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.189 
millimeters so millimeters is okay but
there<00:05:06.699> are<00:05:06.820> other<00:05:07.000> options<00:05:07.419> there<00:05:07.630> pixels<00:05:08.110> are

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
there are other options there pixels are

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.870 
there are other options there pixels are
inches<00:05:08.560> but<00:05:08.740> I'm<00:05:08.889> going<00:05:09.039> to<00:05:09.070> use<00:05:09.130> millimeters

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
inches but I'm going to use millimeters

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.719 
inches but I'm going to use millimeters
I'm<00:05:10.090> also<00:05:10.300> going<00:05:10.509> to<00:05:10.570> put<00:05:10.750> it<00:05:10.840> on<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.199> highest

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
I'm also going to put it on the highest

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.850 
I'm also going to put it on the highest
level<00:05:12.729> of<00:05:12.900> resolution<00:05:13.900> which<00:05:14.020> is<00:05:14.050> 600<00:05:14.680> dots

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
level of resolution which is 600 dots

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.760 
level of resolution which is 600 dots
and<00:05:15.190> then<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:16.090> resulting<00:05:16.900> image<00:05:17.169> size<00:05:17.350> I<00:05:17.590> want

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
and then the resulting image size I want

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.469 
and then the resulting image size I want
this<00:05:17.889> to<00:05:18.039> be<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.280> same<00:05:18.550> size<00:05:18.880> as<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.449> original

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
this to be the same size as the original

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.210 
this to be the same size as the original
book<00:05:20.110> now<00:05:20.289> my<00:05:20.500> broccoli<00:05:20.860> is<00:05:20.919> 105<00:05:22.199> millimeters

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
book now my broccoli is 105 millimeters

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:30.540 
book now my broccoli is 105 millimeters
by<00:05:24.479> 150<00:05:25.860> millimeters<00:05:26.889> and<00:05:28.199> so<00:05:29.199> that<00:05:29.470> shows<00:05:29.770> the

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
by 150 millimeters and so that shows the

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.820 
by 150 millimeters and so that shows the
book<00:05:30.760> as<00:05:31.030> it's<00:05:31.300> going<00:05:31.780> to<00:05:31.870> come<00:05:32.020> out<00:05:32.199> so<00:05:32.620> that's

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
book as it's going to come out so that's

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.260 
book as it's going to come out so that's
the<00:05:32.979> finished<00:05:33.340> sort<00:05:33.729> of<00:05:33.820> image<00:05:34.090> really<00:05:35.100> and

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
the finished sort of image really and

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.770 
the finished sort of image really and
then<00:05:37.270> you<00:05:37.570> can<00:05:37.780> export<00:05:38.260> to<00:05:39.750> JPEG<00:05:40.750> formats

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
then you can export to JPEG formats

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.830 
then you can export to JPEG formats
I'll<00:05:42.930> put<00:05:43.110> it<00:05:43.170> into<00:05:43.380> that<00:05:43.410> folder<00:05:43.980> there

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
I'll put it into that folder there

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.010 
I'll put it into that folder there
select<00:05:45.840> the<00:05:45.930> folder<00:05:46.140> and<00:05:47.300> those<00:05:48.300> will<00:05:48.810> be

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
select the folder and those will be

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.910 
select the folder and those will be
exported<00:05:49.710> into<00:05:49.920> that<00:05:50.220> folder<00:05:51.500> now<00:05:52.500> one<00:05:52.740> thing

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
exported into that folder now one thing

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.610 
exported into that folder now one thing
just<00:05:53.100> I<00:05:53.280> would<00:05:53.550> like<00:05:53.700> to<00:05:53.820> mention<00:05:53.970> if<00:05:54.240> you<00:05:54.650> find

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
if you find as you're going down the

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.820 
if you find as you're going down the
image<00:06:03.570> you<00:06:03.780> see<00:06:03.810> if<00:06:03.990> you've<00:06:04.080> got<00:06:04.200> a<00:06:04.230> long<00:06:04.560> book

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
image you see if you've got a long book

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.820 
image you see if you've got a long book
it<00:06:05.070> could<00:06:05.280> be<00:06:05.460> that<00:06:05.790> your<00:06:05.970> book<00:06:06.590> moves<00:06:07.590> a

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
it could be that your book moves a

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.590 
it could be that your book moves a
little<00:06:08.130> bit<00:06:08.250> or<00:06:08.730> has<00:06:08.880> moved<00:06:09.180> a<00:06:09.330> little<00:06:09.420> bit

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
little bit or has moved a little bit

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.140 
little bit or has moved a little bit
when<00:06:10.080> you<00:06:10.260> were<00:06:10.620> taking<00:06:11.040> the<00:06:11.160> images<00:06:11.610> so<00:06:12.120> you

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
when you were taking the images so you

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.530 
when you were taking the images so you
may<00:06:12.390> find<00:06:12.720> that<00:06:13.170> the<00:06:14.000> keystoning<00:06:15.000> or<00:06:15.420> the

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
may find that the keystoning or the

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.870 
may find that the keystoning or the
cropping<00:06:15.780> need<00:06:16.680> to<00:06:16.800> be<00:06:16.950> modified<00:06:17.310> a<00:06:17.820> bit

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
cropping need to be modified a bit

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.630 
cropping need to be modified a bit
further<00:06:18.300> down<00:06:18.530> well<00:06:19.530> it's<00:06:19.740> okay<00:06:20.100> to<00:06:20.160> do<00:06:20.430> that

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
further down well it's okay to do that

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.760 
further down well it's okay to do that
because<00:06:20.850> if<00:06:21.270> you<00:06:21.330> look<00:06:21.750> at<00:06:22.020> the<00:06:22.110> bottom<00:06:22.470> here

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
because if you look at the bottom here

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.070 
because if you look at the bottom here
you<00:06:22.920> can<00:06:23.400> make<00:06:23.580> a<00:06:23.610> modification<00:06:23.970> to<00:06:24.480> any<00:06:24.930> of

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
you can make a modification to any of

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.500 
you can make a modification to any of
the<00:06:25.200> images<00:06:25.320> way<00:06:25.950> down<00:06:26.190> here<00:06:26.490> maybe<00:06:26.850> the<00:06:27.090> 30th

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
the images way down here maybe the 30th

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.400 
the images way down here maybe the 30th
or<00:06:27.660> 40th<00:06:27.810> page<00:06:28.290> and<00:06:28.880> change<00:06:29.880> and<00:06:30.510> make<00:06:30.900> changes

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
or 40th page and change and make changes

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.250 
or 40th page and change and make changes
and<00:06:31.670> it<00:06:32.670> will<00:06:32.970> go<00:06:33.180> to<00:06:33.240> all<00:06:33.630> the<00:06:33.960> following

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
and it will go to all the following

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.400 
and it will go to all the following
images<00:06:34.650> on<00:06:34.950> the<00:06:35.070> side<00:06:35.280> so<00:06:35.460> you<00:06:35.520> can<00:06:35.669> actually

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
images on the side so you can actually

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.920 
images on the side so you can actually
correct<00:06:37.410> things<00:06:38.360> sequentially<00:06:39.360> going<00:06:39.660> down

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
correct things sequentially going down

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.040 
correct things sequentially going down
if<00:06:40.500> you<00:06:40.590> find<00:06:40.860> this<00:06:41.010> something<00:06:41.430> that's<00:06:41.610> wrong

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
if you find this something that's wrong

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.020 
if you find this something that's wrong
you<00:06:43.050> can<00:06:43.230> check<00:06:43.440> it<00:06:43.560> out<00:06:43.680> and<00:06:44.640> make

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
you can check it out and make

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.670 
you can check it out and make
corrections<00:06:45.540> and<00:06:45.660> that<00:06:45.810> will<00:06:45.960> be<00:06:46.080> propagated

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
corrections and that will be propagated

this particular image you can see quite

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.880 
this particular image you can see quite
a<00:07:05.480> bit<00:07:05.540> of<00:07:05.690> bleed<00:07:06.200> through<00:07:06.470> from<00:07:06.620> the<00:07:06.740> other

side of the page and what I do from this
I<00:07:11.180> use<00:07:11.450> this<00:07:11.660> as<00:07:11.870> the<00:07:12.200> output<00:07:12.860> of<00:07:12.890> the<00:07:13.520> Yasu<00:07:14.420> a

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:14.980 
I use this as the output of the Yasu a

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.210 
I use this as the output of the Yasu a
program<00:07:15.980> has<00:07:16.460> an<00:07:16.730> input<00:07:17.240> into<00:07:17.680> scan<00:07:18.680> tailor

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 
program has an input into scan tailor

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.880 
program has an input into scan tailor
which<00:07:19.370> is<00:07:19.520> another<00:07:19.820> free<00:07:20.150> program<00:07:20.890> because

which is another free program because
scan<00:07:22.160> tear<00:07:22.400> that<00:07:22.550> is<00:07:22.700> very<00:07:23.000> good<00:07:23.330> at<00:07:23.600> removing

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.050 
scan tear that is very good at removing
