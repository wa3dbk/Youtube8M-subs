not my favorite feature having said it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.460 
not my favorite feature having said it
though<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.750> actually<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
though this one is actually one of the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.280 
though this one is actually one of the
best<00:01:16.650> positioned<00:01:17.189> I've<00:01:17.610> ever<00:01:17.820> shot<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.869> should

I<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> thumbs<00:01:19.950> up<00:01:20.159> when<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.340> shoot<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
I like a thumbs up when I shoot in the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.249 
I like a thumbs up when I shoot in the
stock<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.240> designed<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.049> kind<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
stock is designed for that but I kind of

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.010 
stock is designed for that but I kind of
squared<00:01:22.710> off<00:01:22.890> piece<00:01:23.159> back<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.540> but<00:01:24.540> easy<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
squared off piece back here but easy to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.340 
squared off piece back here but easy to
deploy

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
deploy

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.580

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
I can I can shoot I can talk let the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.530 
I can I can shoot I can talk let the
safety<00:01:31.950> go<00:01:32.100> without<00:01:32.460> ever<00:01:32.670> moving<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.090> gun<00:01:33.270> so

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
safety go without ever moving the gun so

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.210 
safety go without ever moving the gun so
I<00:01:33.570> really<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.470> design<00:01:35.040> overall

okay once you get to 200 bar that's

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.090 
okay once you get to 200 bar that's
about<00:01:54.180> 2,800<00:01:54.840> psi<00:01:55.970> close<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.740> open<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.830> bleep

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.280 
this is pretty typical I say this a lot
where<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:06.410> jsb<00:05:07.250> jumbo<00:05:08.060> exacts<00:05:08.450> the<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:09.050> gun

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
where the jsb jumbo exacts the the gun

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.790 
where the jsb jumbo exacts the the gun
shot<00:05:10.040> the<00:05:10.190> exact<00:05:10.520> Jumbo's<00:05:10.910> really<00:05:11.690> well<00:05:11.900> tight

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
shot the exact Jumbo's really well tight

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.130 
shot the exact Jumbo's really well tight
groups<00:05:13.160> they<00:05:13.460> hit<00:05:13.670> hard<00:05:13.880> it's<00:05:14.720> an<00:05:14.930> all-around

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
groups they hit hard it's an all-around

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.260 
groups they hit hard it's an all-around
great<00:05:15.410> pellet<00:05:15.860> and<00:05:16.010> probably<00:05:16.640> if<00:05:16.760> I<00:05:16.880> only<00:05:17.060> had

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
great pellet and probably if I only had

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.970 
great pellet and probably if I only had
to<00:05:17.420> buy<00:05:17.570> one<00:05:17.600> pellet<00:05:18.020> these<00:05:18.260> days<00:05:18.500> this<00:05:18.770> would

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
to buy one pellet these days this would

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.830 
to buy one pellet these days this would
I<00:05:19.220> have<00:05:19.640> to<00:05:19.790> say<00:05:19.940> honestly<00:05:20.090> be<00:05:20.420> the<00:05:20.570> one<00:05:20.690> that

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
I have to say honestly be the one that

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.650 
I have to say honestly be the one that
I'd<00:05:20.960> shoot<00:05:21.530> but<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:22.250> know<00:05:22.400> as<00:05:22.730> as<00:05:23.150> you<00:05:23.540> all

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
I'd shoot but you know as as you all

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.150 
I'd shoot but you know as as you all
know<00:05:23.870> if<00:05:24.020> you've<00:05:24.170> been<00:05:24.290> shooting<00:05:24.530> different

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
know if you've been shooting different

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.650 
know if you've been shooting different
guns<00:05:25.520> like<00:05:25.730> different<00:05:26.090> pellets<00:05:26.420> so<00:05:26.570> you

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
guns like different pellets so you

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.810 
guns like different pellets so you
always<00:05:26.810> have<00:05:27.140> to<00:05:27.170> look<00:05:27.950> and<00:05:28.250> I've<00:05:28.520> hit<00:05:28.700> the

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
always have to look and I've hit the

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.640 
always have to look and I've hit the
occasional<00:05:29.330> rifle<00:05:29.600> that<00:05:29.690> doesn't<00:05:29.990> like<00:05:30.110> jsb

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
occasional rifle that doesn't like jsb

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.590 
occasional rifle that doesn't like jsb
but<00:05:30.860> it's<00:05:31.010> it's<00:05:31.460> rare<00:05:31.730> with<00:05:31.970> this<00:05:32.150> collet<00:05:32.420> than

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
but it's it's rare with this collet than

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.930 
but it's it's rare with this collet than
any<00:05:32.720> other
