00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.220
 a new wind every rap daring in belo 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.720
 horizon the Chilean team continues 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.420
 awakening great expectation of the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.070
 press and nobody wants to lose it 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.170
 Chilean and foreign media arrive 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.090
 there is a strong security and as no 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.950
 it could be different we found a 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.790
 fan that is hitting on the pear at 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.790
 Brazilian father-in-law 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.960
 well I want to see chile I want to see 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.710
 Chile 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.940
 well I hope here it's called the country 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.930
 the country of the world cup has to have 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.930
 trust in channel 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.650
 Chinese colleagues arrived and a broad 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.110
 amount of reporter to record the 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.940
 chili training the entrance of the 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.470
 players and try to focus your focus 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.470
 about alexis and arturo vidal 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.800
 to start a tennis game while 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.820
 appeared the man from the juventus to 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.820
 talk with the coaching staff 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.750
 at a conference to Gonzalo Carlos Marcelo 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.640
 dayz analyze the first days of 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.760
 work and the need to win before 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.310
 Australia 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:51.950
 the issue of critical height 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:53.990
 go have defenders I do not think that 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.450
 handles well beyond the subject we study 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.549
 the theme of time and distance that each 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.530
 player or defenses have to handle the 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.409
 clear weather that is a fundamental factor 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.679
 to keep in mind but I do not think we 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.539
 affect mainly for the same reason we have 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.090
 I've been training very hard here with a 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.739
 weather 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.230
 it's hot that coming is not going to be the 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.470
 exception and it will work out just like 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.620
 always from the first minute to attack 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.629
 and if we have to run ramÃ³n lawyer 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.629
 tower and it will have to be like that
