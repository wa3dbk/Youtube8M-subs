00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.650
 Until 1988 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.209
 Toyota 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.549
 In-line four-cylinder engine turbocharged 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.549
 I have raced from group c 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:17.880
 Photo 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.720
 As the base level goes up 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.259
 In-line four-cylinder engine 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.489
 Output and fuel consumption 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.489
 And the lack of durability began to stand out 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.580
 So Toyota 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.510
 Twin turbocharged you 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.150
 3.2 liters of 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.620
 developed a v-type 8-cylinder engine 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.340
 This is also new 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.340
 Mounted on the body of carbon composite structure 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.600
 This v8 turbo engine is 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.600
 While generating power from low speed 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.350
 The highest output is 851 million yen 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.040
 Qualifying for 12 minutes 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.280
 It also became a monopoly machine station 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.180
 In the car of chin 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.350
 Debuted in 1988 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.780
 Miyagi from Matsue City 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.620
 On this fourth of August 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.620
 When the end is announced at the end 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.440
 Gasoline re-price increase 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.290
 Ship is rock 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.420
 I got an engine 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.830
 Both power response 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.180
 The performance was as expected 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.750
 However 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.210
 Eighty-eight types of body raised 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.620
 Both wheelbases are short 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.100
 It was a special layout but the stability was broken 50 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.940
 It was universality of cornering Naka-Nitta Shrine but now it is 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.050
 Toyota 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.050
 We started to improve immediately 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.800
 During 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.100
 July's

 All Japan Sports Prototype Car Championship Series Round 4 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.840
 In the eighty-eight years that had changed significantly from the time of the test 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.650
 I entered the 7th place in qualifying 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.729
 Hiroshima showed an activity to win the third consecutive victory 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:14.639
 After all it was trouble of this machine 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.959
 Dropped out of the base 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.819
 Next declaration 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.639
 Qualifying site is from the following 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.649
 After all the trouble occurs in the final 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:28.939
 Finished 16th 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.659

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.409
 We sent in to 88 cm of the title 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:47.719
 88cv 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.759
 Qualifying in fifth place against the world's top players 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.359
 After all it is late by trouble 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.359
 The result was 22nd place 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.479
 Toyota is this season 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.819
 Fast but unstable 88 cd 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.819
 The improvement zone was high on an ip basis every previous war 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.129
 After all to 88 cm 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.129
