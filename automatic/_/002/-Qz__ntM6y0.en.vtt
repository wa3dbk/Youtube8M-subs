FSG<00:02:22.349> why<00:02:22.590> PC<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.099> need<00:02:23.280> said<00:02:23.579> I<00:02:24.469> believe<00:02:25.700> one

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
FSG why PC you need said I believe one

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.720 
FSG why PC you need said I believe one
of<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.909> latest<00:02:27.209> versions<00:02:27.390> for<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.639> but<00:02:29.639> you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
of the latest versions for that but you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.240 
of the latest versions for that but you
don't<00:02:29.909> have<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.180> own<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.980> registered<00:02:31.980> version

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
don't have to own a registered version

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.149 
don't have to own a registered version
it's<00:02:32.819> not<00:02:33.090> really<00:02:33.389> necessary<00:02:33.959> but<00:02:34.799> anyways

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
it's not really necessary but anyways

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.099 
it's not really necessary but anyways
it's<00:02:35.760> now<00:02:35.909> connected<00:02:36.299> to<00:02:36.329> flight<00:02:36.599> simulator

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
it's now connected to flight simulator

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.990 
it's now connected to flight simulator
so<00:02:37.889> the<00:02:37.980> next<00:02:38.159> thing<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.579> do<00:02:38.790> is

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
first go to the settings right here on

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.460 
first go to the settings right here on
the<00:02:49.049> settings<00:02:49.409> knob<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.919> then<00:02:50.700> your<00:02:51.629> only<00:02:52.109> the

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
only thing f2 is enter the IP address

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.890 
only thing f2 is enter the IP address
that<00:02:55.349> you<00:02:55.590> can<00:02:55.739> find<00:02:56.129> here<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.659> also<00:02:57.659> the

server port that you can find here and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.869 
server port that you can find here and
make<00:03:00.359> sure<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.719> test<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.139> connection<00:03:01.469> and<00:03:01.879> if

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
make sure you test the connection and if

they are favored as I've told but you

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.539 
they are favored as I've told but you
know<00:03:55.290> they<00:03:55.530> are<00:03:55.620> all<00:03:55.769> based<00:03:55.979> on<00:03:56.129> general

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
know they are all based on general

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.339 
know they are all based on general
aviation<00:03:56.639> aircraft<00:03:57.180> so<00:03:57.629> we<00:03:57.659> won't<00:03:58.079> really

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
aviation aircraft so we won't really

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.990 
aviation aircraft so we won't really
find<00:03:58.620> Boeing<00:03:59.250> 737<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.180> CP<00:04:00.569> panel<00:04:00.930> for<00:04:01.470> example

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
find Boeing 737 and CP panel for example

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.129 
find Boeing 737 and CP panel for example
but<00:04:03.000> at<00:04:03.120> least<00:04:03.239> they<00:04:03.419> do<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.629> job<00:04:03.870> and

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
but at least they do the job and

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.050 
but at least they do the job and
especially<00:04:04.379> this<00:04:04.709> one<00:04:04.919> this<00:04:05.280> one<00:04:05.549> is<00:04:05.579> freeware

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
especially this one this one is freeware

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.360 
especially this one this one is freeware
so<00:04:06.329> go<00:04:06.989> ahead<00:04:07.109> and<00:04:07.229> download<00:04:07.439> it<00:04:07.769> I<00:04:07.979> can<00:04:08.220> really
