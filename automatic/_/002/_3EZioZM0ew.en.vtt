00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.420
 we turn on the machine and wait until 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.250
 this button lights up red that means 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.750
 that the steam is finished flashing 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.449
 means that it is now 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.400
 the first step we make is heated 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.560
 because we have something in the lance now 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.150
 have pervade water we need to 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.400
 first get out by one 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:35.350
 In addition to the cup a glass and 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.670
 first let off a ski of the water 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.120
 then we take another one 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:50.530
 filled with milk and put this in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:54.129
 the lonza what matters is this lance 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.570
 has a breathable yet this hole 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.570
 should not be completely covered 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.220
 and it's not important fast 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.850
 but to make hectic movements 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.190
 to stay in constant motion 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.570
 This is called this phase if I am 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.180
 notice that they make me a bit warmer 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.560
 The lance will be completely clean 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.600
 to warm me up and close them 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.420
 so that the foam does not clear up 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.610
 composed but with the milk 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.009
 united when the temperature is reached 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.270
 the milk the ca between 65 and 70 degrees 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:34.890
 I should do the whole thing out of her 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:38.500
 into the cane and put it to the side 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.179
 what is important in the cafissimo is 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.319
 that the lance must be cooled down 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.840
 means 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.670
 I press the red button again 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.240
 he blinks white I turn the lance 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.240
 fully out 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.850
 close them and have them again 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.360
 possibility if the whole program 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.360
 attack 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.570
 They also try their best at home 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.570
 times
