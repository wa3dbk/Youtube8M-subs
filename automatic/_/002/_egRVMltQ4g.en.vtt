 an important meeting with the community 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.529
 Andean mountain range the lion held the 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.690
 Mayor of the commune of CochamÃ³ Carlos 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.089
 soto sotomayor who unveiled the 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.710
 project that was presented this month to 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.599
 the admissibility to the government of the 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.250
 region of the lakes to restore the 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.080
 footbridge that joins the border town 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.109
 to the international passage in territory 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.939
 Argentine through the gentle river the 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.099
 submitted project seeks approval 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.500
 of the resources for the execution of the 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.359
 work well that was destroyed two years ago 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.369
 years because of the fatigue of materials 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.710
 produced by the large snowfalls that 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.260
 they fell in the winter season leaving 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.809
 disconnected to the locals who do 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.980
 part in the place and working to 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.719
 to be able to have a path and to be able to take 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.930
 really true isolation that well 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.150
 these people 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.460
 how many people does this sector come to pass 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.390
 of oven and here around between glasses 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.239
 leoni torrentoso about 40 houses 40 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.250
 neighboring family groups the total cost 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.989
 of the project presented to the fund 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.560
 regional development of volleyball for its 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.510
 approval 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.400
 making 400 million pesos 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.740
 resources that the construction of 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.360
 a new footbridge and that unites the sector and 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.450
 that allows pedestrians to pass 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.850
 carts with oxen up to more than 5 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.530
 kilos so that people from 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.170
 sector can access the desired 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.240
 connectivity we have a boat 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.729
 hired a municipal staff to 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.220
 that they can pass in the part 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.240
 emergency with these issues of the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.700
 inclement weather are already 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.369
 completely isolated of course 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.720
 they are completely isolated and here 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.720
 we also have to thank the help of the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.270
 carabinero and that's why live is 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.610
 forming is this crusade so that 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.440
 we can really have a 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.800
 road traveled around the given year 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.869
 and get out and these people can get to 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.630
 chili for stores and not go through 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.750
 bariloche except with argentina to wer 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.750
 wenn 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.390
 currently to this settlement village 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.460
 Chileans can be accessed by land 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.380
 in off - road vehicles from bariloche 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.450
 up to the gentle river through 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.700
 horseback riding on horseback from the town river 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.709
 and cochamÃ³ by long and rugged paths 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.750
 situation that makes its inhabitants 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.940
 take up to three days to get to your 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.130
 houses the most important subject but 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.040
 we think the one from 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.190
 isolation that we have on the one hand 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.160
 our of our authority a 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.810
 path that we really are in 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.630
 wait for a way and we are in the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.819
 opportunity not to lose this 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.069
 opportunity that we have for this with the 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:37.120
 construction of a road as it comes 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.610
 of a person directly 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.450
 on account of it that of the 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.540
 mediterranean 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.180
 and I think it's 67 km that the most 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.860
 that would be where they are going to get to 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.300
 limit 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.739
 as reported the initiative is 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.870
 priority but as a law that 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.420
 will allow more than 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.709
 60 families that saw the lion this 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.420
 project will allow to connect 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.489
 definitely to the sector the passage of 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.440
 lion inhabitants who currently have 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.480
 to cross by motor boat through the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.040
 dangerous waters of the Panzo River and that its 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.290
 only exit is towards 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.510
 Argentine territory precise down by 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.549
 land to which roughly you what 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.310
 It makes fast two days are well combined 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.010
 on the one hand ours and it depends if you 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.019
 it does not go with good time because 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.420
 we populated our own attack 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.750
 our cattle and there in our channel 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.670
 We have four days of development with 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.150
 a bad route that we have to know 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.849
 perhaps a path are not pathways 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.620
 than a vehicle then therefore 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.569
 we practically met 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.489
 extremely isolated in this place the 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.829
 neighborhood leader of the step the lions in 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.650
 car masters said that until today the 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.239
 Locals have done everything to get out 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.840
 of the isolation in which they are 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.000
 many 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.970
 here there have been settlers who have done 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.400
 transfer of the stretcher on foot east 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.220
 practically because suddenly by the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.959
 tempests we get a helicopter and 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.599
 many times you know that a person 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.330
 Nor can not let die must 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.040
 remove some way or another this 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.830
 path that would benefit you as 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.709
 community to whom the lion passed by 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.709
 we would be a huge benefit yo 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.530
 I think a dream that I think could 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.049
 we had because unfortunately 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.900
 we have that all life 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.090
 we depend on the Argentines we do not have 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.740
 our access by ours 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.240
 preliminary feasibility studies 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.280
 they were financed by the municipality 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.930
 and they had an approximate cost of 21 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.729
 million pesos which they made 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.070
 the first survey for the work that 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.810
 consists of a steel bridge type h 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.340
 with a wooden walkway with 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.030
 nominal strength of these five 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.479
 tons cable-stayed by cables 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.660
 one-inch steel and a long end of 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.660
 155 meters
