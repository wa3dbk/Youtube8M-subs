let's<00:01:07.360> move<00:01:07.570> on<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:08.020> talk<00:01:08.200> about<00:01:08.230> shape<00:01:08.710> polls

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
let's move on to talk about shape polls

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.820 
let's move on to talk about shape polls
electronics<00:01:09.910> I've<00:01:10.840> got<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.110> pickups<00:01:11.560> here

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
electronics I've got the pickups here

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.530 
electronics I've got the pickups here
this<00:01:12.340> is<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.520> bridge<00:01:12.700> one<00:01:12.940> when<00:01:13.210> I've<00:01:13.300> taken

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
this is the bridge one when I've taken

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.650 
this is the bridge one when I've taken
the<00:01:13.960> back<00:01:14.500> plate<00:01:14.770> off<00:01:14.950> and<00:01:15.370> the<00:01:16.300> reason<00:01:16.420> I've

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
the back plate off and the reason I've

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.969 
the back plate off and the reason I've
done<00:01:16.810> this<00:01:16.960> is<00:01:17.140> because<00:01:17.320> of<00:01:17.440> sentiment<00:01:17.740> issue

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
done this is because of sentiment issue

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.350 
done this is because of sentiment issue
with<00:01:18.280> this<00:01:18.430> last<00:01:18.670> time<00:01:18.880> I<00:01:18.940> was<00:01:19.090> trying<00:01:19.270> to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
with this last time I was trying to

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.660 
with this last time I was trying to
check<00:01:19.600> it<00:01:19.870> to<00:01:20.020> play<00:01:20.200> it<00:01:20.350> it<00:01:20.680> wasn't<00:01:21.130> given<00:01:21.340> very

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
check it to play it it wasn't given very

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.919 
check it to play it it wasn't given very
much<00:01:21.910> of<00:01:22.060> an<00:01:22.150> output<00:01:22.450> at<00:01:22.600> all

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.349 

so<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.829> was<00:01:29.100> going<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.310> take<00:01:29.429> a<00:01:29.460> partnership<00:01:29.880> see

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
so I was going to take a partnership see

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:31.459 
so I was going to take a partnership see
ojala<00:01:30.600> connections<00:01:31.020> were<00:01:31.140> fighting<00:01:31.380> it

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
ojala connections were fighting it

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:32.810 
ojala connections were fighting it
looked<00:01:31.679> okay<00:01:32.070> there's<00:01:32.340> nothing<00:01:32.579> wrong<00:01:32.759> with

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
looked okay there's nothing wrong with

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.060 
looked okay there's nothing wrong with
it<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.299> far<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.719> see<00:01:33.929> so<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.740> need<00:01:34.859> to<00:01:34.950> look

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
it as far as I can see so I need to look

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.130 
it as far as I can see so I need to look
at<00:01:35.219> this<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.670> test<00:01:35.909> at<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.960> how

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
at this and test at the see just how

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.630 
at this and test at the see just how
much<00:01:37.350> resistance<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:38.039> getting<00:01:38.310> through<00:01:38.520> it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
much resistance is getting through it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.539 
much resistance is getting through it
before<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.539> test<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.990> brush<00:01:40.530> back<00:01:40.740> up<00:01:40.979> I've<00:01:41.310> taken

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
before a test I brush back up I've taken

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.760 
before a test I brush back up I've taken
the<00:01:41.729> neck<00:01:41.880> back<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.299> oh<00:01:42.450> that's<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.469> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the neck back up oh that's it here and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.919 
the neck back up oh that's it here and
I'm<00:01:44.399> going<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.579> connect<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.209> my<00:01:45.360> mini

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
I'm going to connect up to my mini

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.260 
I'm going to connect up to my mini
multimeter<00:01:46.469> I've<00:01:47.369> got<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.579> set<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.939> twenty

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270

change<00:02:06.209> on<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:06.630> multimeter<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:07.979> go<00:02:08.119> so

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
change on the multimeter there we go so

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.809 
change on the multimeter there we go so
we're<00:02:09.390> looking<00:02:09.690> at<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:11.250> per<00:02:11.370> eight<00:02:11.519> point

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
we're looking at the per eight point

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.080 
we're looking at the per eight point
four<00:02:12.140> for<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.200> neck<00:02:13.349> back<00:02:13.560> up<00:02:13.739> we'd<00:02:14.730> expect

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
four for the neck back up we'd expect

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.330 
four for the neck back up we'd expect
that<00:02:15.329> bridge<00:02:15.840> humbucker<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.560> be<00:02:16.650> slightly

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
that bridge humbucker to be slightly

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.949 
that bridge humbucker to be slightly
hotter<00:02:17.750> or<00:02:18.750> more<00:02:19.200> resistance<00:02:19.680> at<00:02:19.799> least<00:02:20.959> so

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
hotter or more resistance at least so

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.750 
hotter or more resistance at least so
I'm<00:02:22.049> going<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.290> take<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.500> bridge<00:02:22.769> pickup<00:02:23.519> here

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
I'm going to take the bridge pickup here

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.330 
I'm going to take the bridge pickup here
to<00:02:24.569> see<00:02:24.720> what<00:02:24.840> goes<00:02:24.959> on<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.769> do<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.920> same<00:02:26.099> again

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
to see what goes on so do the same again

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.140 
to see what goes on so do the same again
rate<00:02:26.579> to<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.940> hot<00:02:27.150> wire<00:02:27.769> black<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.879> ground

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
and on the twenty key reading we're

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.160 
and on the twenty key reading we're
getting<00:02:32.670> nothing<00:02:32.940> at<00:02:33.209> all<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.900> resistance

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
getting nothing at all so the resistance

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.020 
getting nothing at all so the resistance
is<00:02:34.410> far<00:02:34.620> too<00:02:34.769> high<00:02:34.889> for<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.160> we'll<00:02:35.670> try<00:02:35.850> and

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
is far too high for that we'll try and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.340 
is far too high for that we'll try and
notch<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.359> up<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.630> two<00:02:36.810> hundred<00:02:36.840> K<00:02:37.290> it

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
notch it up to two hundred K it

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.979 
notch it up to two hundred K it
shouldn't<00:02:37.709> be<00:02:37.769> bigger<00:02:37.980> than<00:02:38.190> this<00:02:41.989> again

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
shouldn't be bigger than this again

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.430 
shouldn't be bigger than this again
we're<00:02:43.170> getting<00:02:43.260> nothing<00:02:45.139> essential<00:02:46.139> it<00:02:46.230> looks

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
we're getting nothing essential it looks

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.780 
we're getting nothing essential it looks
like<00:02:46.620> we're<00:02:46.739> going<00:02:46.829> to<00:02:46.920> open<00:02:47.190> circuit<00:02:47.609> here

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
like we're going to open circuit here

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.550 
like we're going to open circuit here
which<00:02:47.940> means<00:02:48.150> there's<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.359> break<00:02:48.690> in<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.989> coil

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
which means there's a break in the coil

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.460 
which means there's a break in the coil
and<00:02:49.859> the<00:02:50.040> connections<00:02:50.549> somewhere<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.200> got

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
and the connections somewhere so I got

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.930 
and the connections somewhere so I got
to<00:02:52.590> go<00:02:52.709> into<00:02:52.889> about<00:02:53.069> troubleshooting<00:02:53.609> and<00:02:53.760> see

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
to go into about troubleshooting and see

reconnected<00:02:59.730> here<00:03:00.150> I'm<00:03:00.630> pretty<00:03:00.930> sure<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.260> did

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
reconnected here I'm pretty sure I did

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.920 
reconnected here I'm pretty sure I did
that<00:03:01.889> a<00:03:02.010> long<00:03:02.160> time<00:03:02.220> ago<00:03:02.819> but<00:03:03.480> there's<00:03:03.780> always

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
that a long time ago but there's always

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.710 
that a long time ago but there's always
time<00:03:04.319> to<00:03:04.590> see<00:03:04.769> F<00:03:05.069> as<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.120> reason<00:03:06.540> that

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
time to see F as for the reason that

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.339 
time to see F as for the reason that
there<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.349> a<00:03:07.380> break<00:03:08.690> so<00:03:09.690> there<00:03:09.840> we<00:03:09.959> go

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
there is a break so there we go

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.970 
there is a break so there we go
take<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.430> off<00:03:11.639> I've<00:03:11.970> joined<00:03:12.389> the<00:03:12.989> shield<00:03:13.799> up

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
take that off I've joined the shield up

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.259 
take that off I've joined the shield up
and<00:03:14.220> there's<00:03:14.400> definitely<00:03:14.489> continuity<00:03:15.120> in<00:03:15.180> the

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
and there's definitely continuity in the

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.569 
and there's definitely continuity in the
shield<00:03:15.480> but<00:03:16.109> there<00:03:16.230> may<00:03:16.590> be<00:03:16.620> an<00:03:16.889> issue<00:03:17.010> with

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
shield but there may be an issue with

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.309 
shield but there may be an issue with
the<00:03:19.160> hot<00:03:20.160> wire<00:03:20.370> here<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.660> often<00:03:21.750> get<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.139> off

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
the hot wire here so often get this off

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.190 
the hot wire here so often get this off
a<00:03:22.650> knife<00:03:23.099> and<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.819> guys<00:03:23.970> tape<00:03:24.299> off<00:03:24.569> I<00:03:24.840> put<00:03:25.079> on

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
a knife and you guys tape off I put on

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.879 
a knife and you guys tape off I put on
here<00:03:26.090> both<00:03:27.090> connections<00:03:27.690> look<00:03:28.019> pretty<00:03:28.380> strong

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
here both connections look pretty strong

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.309 
here both connections look pretty strong
so<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.730> very<00:03:29.970> much<00:03:30.239> doubt<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.599> so<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.019> we<00:03:31.169> can

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
so I very much doubt it so that we can

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.490 
so I very much doubt it so that we can
take<00:03:31.530> check<00:03:31.889> for<00:03:32.040> some<00:03:32.160> continuity<00:03:33.200> now<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.290> can

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
take check for some continuity now I can

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.509 
take check for some continuity now I can
see<00:03:34.590> we're<00:03:34.709> getting<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:34.919> reading<00:03:35.099> there<00:03:35.310> so

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
see we're getting a reading there so

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.509 
see we're getting a reading there so
it's<00:03:35.639> not<00:03:35.879> there<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:37.709> break<00:03:37.980> will<00:03:38.189> have<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.430> be

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
it's not there the break will have to be

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.429 
it's not there the break will have to be
somewhere<00:03:38.849> in<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.239> backup<00:03:39.569> itself<00:03:39.930> not<00:03:40.230> in

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:40.439 
somewhere in the backup itself not in

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:41.100 
somewhere in the backup itself not in
the<00:03:40.590> wires

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
the wires

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.720 
the wires
so<00:03:41.320> we<00:03:41.410> have<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.620> see<00:03:41.740> if<00:03:41.830> we<00:03:41.920> can<00:03:42.010> prize<00:03:42.400> this

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
so we have to see if we can prize this

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.620 
so we have to see if we can prize this
apart<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:45.040> looks<00:03:45.220> like<00:03:45.310> both<00:03:45.670> coils<00:03:46.030> here

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
apart so it looks like both coils here

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.560 
apart so it looks like both coils here
and<00:03:46.950> here<00:03:47.950> I've<00:03:48.520> been<00:03:48.550> cut<00:03:48.880> in<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.030> same<00:03:49.240> place

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
and here I've been cut in the same place

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.680 
and here I've been cut in the same place
where<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.430> we've<00:03:51.430> been<00:03:51.610> side<00:03:51.820> by<00:03:51.850> side<00:03:52.390> as<00:03:52.600> the

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
where the we've been side by side as the

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.720 
where the we've been side by side as the
cuts<00:03:52.900> going<00:03:53.110> through<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.500> top<00:03:53.710> and<00:03:53.950> then<00:03:54.550> to

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
cuts going through the top and then to

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.570 
cuts going through the top and then to
the<00:03:54.820> coils<00:03:55.240> so<00:03:56.850> that's<00:03:57.850> probably<00:03:58.540> why<00:03:59.580> we're

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
the coils so that's probably why we're

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.500 
the coils so that's probably why we're
not<00:04:00.700> getting<00:04:01.000> anything<00:04:01.660> through<00:04:01.990> this<00:04:02.140> backup

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
not getting anything through this backup

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.360 
not getting anything through this backup
the<00:04:04.510> damage<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:04.960> pretty<00:04:05.080> looks<00:04:05.860> pretty<00:04:06.070> severe

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
the damage is pretty looks pretty severe

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.280 
the damage is pretty looks pretty severe
at<00:04:06.430> me<00:04:06.610> so<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.570> only<00:04:07.720> thing<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:07.870> can<00:04:08.020> really<00:04:08.080> do

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
at me so the only thing I can really do

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.640 
at me so the only thing I can really do
with<00:04:08.410> these<00:04:08.500> is<00:04:08.680> be<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:08.980> complete<00:04:09.400> rewind<00:04:10.650> which

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
with these is be a complete rewind which

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.610 
with these is be a complete rewind which
I'm<00:04:12.130> not<00:04:12.340> sure<00:04:12.640> is<00:04:12.670> even<00:04:13.120> worth<00:04:13.360> doing<00:04:13.750> or<00:04:13.930> just

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
I'm not sure is even worth doing or just

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.680 
I'm not sure is even worth doing or just
buy<00:04:15.190> a<00:04:15.220> new<00:04:15.340> cheap<00:04:15.790> pack<00:04:16.000> up<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.330> throw<00:04:16.540> out
