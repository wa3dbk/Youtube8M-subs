hi<00:00:09.929> Kristin<00:00:10.290> Dynojet<00:00:10.679> here<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.190> video

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
hi Kristin Dynojet here in this video

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.530 
hi Kristin Dynojet here in this video
we're<00:00:11.639> going<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.820> talk<00:00:11.969> about<00:00:12.000> some<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
we're going to talk about some of the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.360 
we're going to talk about some of the
various<00:00:12.840> quick<00:00:13.290> shifter<00:00:13.650> ship<00:00:13.860> sensors<00:00:14.250> that

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
various quick shifter ship sensors that

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.700 
various quick shifter ship sensors that
you<00:00:14.490> can<00:00:14.639> use<00:00:14.880> now<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.450> shift<00:00:16.109> sensor<00:00:16.529> is

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
you can use now a shift sensor is

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.099 
you can use now a shift sensor is
basically<00:00:17.130> just<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.550> switch<00:00:17.880> whenever<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.900> up

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
basically just a switch whenever you up

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.920 
basically just a switch whenever you up
shift<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:20.070> want<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.520> trigger<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.510> engine<00:00:21.840> to

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
shift you want to trigger the engine to

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.570 
shift you want to trigger the engine to
kill<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.830> make<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.130> up<00:00:23.279> shift

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
kill so that you can make the up shift

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.599 
kill so that you can make the up shift
clutchless<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.720> full<00:00:24.960> throttle<00:00:25.430> what<00:00:26.430> type

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
clutchless and full throttle what type

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.189 
clutchless and full throttle what type
of<00:00:26.760> shift<00:00:27.000> linkage<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.840> your<00:00:27.990> bike

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
of shift linkage you have on your bike

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.230 
of shift linkage you have on your bike
would<00:00:28.529> determine<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.250> type<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.460> switch<00:00:29.970> that

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
would determine the type of switch that

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.460 
would determine the type of switch that
you're<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.599> use<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.900> trigger<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
you're going to use to trigger the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.500 
you're going to use to trigger the
engine<00:00:31.769> kill<00:00:32.009> now<00:00:32.759> if<00:00:32.880> your<00:00:33.000> bike<00:00:33.180> shift

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
engine kill now if your bike shift

the<00:01:10.470> tie<00:01:10.650> rod<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.280> will<00:01:12.060> trigger<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.540> engine

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the tie rod and will trigger the engine

the tie rod and will trigger the engine
to<00:01:12.869> kill<00:01:13.080> upon<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.740> appropriate<00:01:14.640> type<00:01:14.790> of

to kill upon that appropriate type of

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.170 
to kill upon that appropriate type of
