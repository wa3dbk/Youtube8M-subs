your hand further down on the band okay
it's<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> good<00:01:03.000> thing<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:04.199> do<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:04.860> if<00:01:05.010> you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
it's a good thing just do to do if you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.300 
it's a good thing just do to do if you
have<00:01:05.250> access<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.570> type<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.869> setup<00:01:07.200> as<00:01:07.560> we

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
have access to this type of setup as we

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.390 
have access to this type of setup as we
do<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.600> try<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.409> throughout

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
do you can just try to do one throughout

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.969 
do you can just try to do one throughout
the<00:01:11.460> day<00:01:11.760> each<00:01:11.970> time<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.450> walk<00:01:12.630> past<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.710> bar

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
the day each time you walk past the bar

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.770 
the day each time you walk past the bar
just<00:01:14.520> try<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.729> Baton<00:01:15.150> went<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.450> kind<00:01:15.720> of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
just try to Baton went out kind of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.830 
just try to Baton went out kind of
grease<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> group<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.100> movement<00:01:20.840> okay

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
grease the group on the movement okay

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.219 
grease the group on the movement okay
the<00:01:22.619> further<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.100> go<00:01:23.369> down<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.820> band<00:01:24.229> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
the further you go down this band the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.510 
the further you go down this band the
harder<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.920> be<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.400> do

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
harder it's going to be for you to do

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.219 
harder it's going to be for you to do
that<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:26.970> pull<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.080> use<00:01:28.200> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
that one on pull up and if you use a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.690 
that one on pull up and if you use a
lighter<00:01:28.590> band<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.310> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.640> even

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
lighter band it's going to be even

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.899 
lighter band it's going to be even
harder<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.659> kind<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.990> medium

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
harder so this is kind of a medium

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.330 
harder so this is kind of a medium
weight<00:01:32.909> band<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:34.409> thicker<00:01:34.680> band<00:01:34.920> might<00:01:35.220> be

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
weight band the thicker band might be

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.910 
weight band the thicker band might be
easier<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.200> be<00:01:37.200> able<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.439> push<00:01:37.680> off

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
easier for you to be able to push off

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.740 
easier for you to be able to push off
pull<00:01:38.640> up<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.939> arm<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.390> give<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.570> more

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
pull up that arm and give you more

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.289 
pull up that arm and give you more
assistance<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:41.100> as<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.340> move<00:01:41.579> down<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:42.000> band

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
assistance so as you move down this band

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.719 
assistance so as you move down this band
it's<00:01:43.229> going<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:43.590> more<00:01:43.860> more<00:01:44.220> difficult

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it's going to get more more difficult

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.460 
it's going to get more more difficult
and<00:01:44.909> then<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.600> actually<00:01:45.720> progress<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
and then you can actually progress to a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.160 
and then you can actually progress to a
thinner<00:01:46.799> band<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:48.060> make<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.210> even<00:01:48.420> harder<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
thinner band to make it even harder and

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.109 
thinner band to make it even harder and
eventually<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.369> should<00:01:50.579> be<00:01:50.700> able<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.060> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
eventually you should be able to get a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.030 
eventually you should be able to get a
one<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.450> pull<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.810> without<00:01:52.140> any<00:01:52.439> assistance<00:01:52.530> at

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
one on pull up without any assistance at

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.880 
one on pull up without any assistance at
