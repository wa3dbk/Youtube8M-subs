on pretty awesome I've slept without the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.690 
on pretty awesome I've slept without the
fly<00:01:03.059> many<00:01:03.329> times<00:01:03.629> keep<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.110> near<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.460> case

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
fly many times keep it near just in case

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.530 
fly many times keep it near just in case
of<00:01:05.729> an<00:01:06.030> emergency

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
of an emergency

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.140 
of an emergency
but<00:01:07.140> without<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.680> it's<00:01:07.920> mesh<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:08.820> around

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
but without it it's mesh all around

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.719 
but without it it's mesh all around
which<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.479> pretty<00:01:09.750> cool<00:01:10.549> setting<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.670> thing

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
which is pretty cool setting this thing

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.440 
which is pretty cool setting this thing
up<00:01:12.150> literally<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:13.590> takes<00:01:14.010> about<00:01:14.250> five<00:01:14.760> minutes

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.030 

so<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.540> doesn't<00:01:18.750> take<00:01:18.869> much<00:01:19.049> time<00:01:19.259> at<00:01:19.409> all<00:01:19.530> it

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
so it doesn't take much time at all it

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.590 
so it doesn't take much time at all it
does<00:01:20.280> not<00:01:20.430> come<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:22.850> tarp<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> bottom

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
does not come with a tarp for the bottom

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.700 
does not come with a tarp for the bottom
but<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.049> made<00:01:25.380> my<00:01:25.560> own<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:27.320> which<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.470> pretty

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
