00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.930
 welcome back to my channel as you will 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.550
 read from the title today I will talk about the 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.220
 new update that the rock star has 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.170
 1.08 released 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.100
 and in this short video I'll talk about 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.950
 all these new features 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.720
 introduced however I will speak to you of 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.580
 the most important ones and I will tell you in 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.309
 practice the pros and cons 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.260
 then first thing now if you do one 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.320
 race type of five rounds perceived more 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.360
 money and more experience points if you call 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.340
 mechanical now on the list in practice 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.830
 vehicles of him is written 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.659
 car was destroyed or if it was 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.390
 seized 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:51.670
 however the fundamental point we say of 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.089
 this new update is that they have 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.440
 solved that glitch that bug that trick 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.470
 that allowed us to go north of 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.989
 nothing so the snowy map is 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.780
 no one can stop succeeding 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.729
 go inside then who has seen the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.400
 my video already last week and has 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.869
 made that trick and that in practice i 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.360
 allowed to go to that map 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.180
 snow was lucky because 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.250
 those who want to try now don't 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.100
 they will never succeed they blocked it I don't know 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.630
 the reason why such a beautiful map 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.570
 because the programmers have us 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.840
 it took hours and hours to create it for later 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.000
 re block them block it I really don't 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.500
 I can understand it so as soon as I read it 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.750
 that I had what they had in practice 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.810
 blocked that map I immediately got it 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.970
 crashed to go and see if that 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.530
 trick that allowed us to enter 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.540
 inside the house of leicester 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.450
 human research laboratories home of the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.970
 Franklin and everything they had been 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.650
 also blocked, however , my surprise 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.630
 these did not block them here 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.890
 you can still get inside then 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.290
 I really can't believe it 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.640
 the only sensible thing that comes to me 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:06.970
 mind is that maybe in the future they might 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.920
 put a dlc on payment where there 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.200
 allow you to do some quests with 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.700
 the snowy map because it really doesn't 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.540
 I know why they blocked that map 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.269
 so wonderful it really is instead 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.829
 left these glitches open for 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.049
 enter inside the various houses that 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.480
 I think they could block these 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.040
 glitches and could instead 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.409
 leave it open with the map where you are 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.810
 he could amuse everyone because he was 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.819
 fabulous that is with the snow really 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.700
 you could hardly get inside the snow 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.010
 as it grew, I don't know 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.560
 really anyway then inside this one 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.239
 update 1.08 have introduced 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.769
 also new missions so it's good 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.569
 because to me they always the same 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.660
 missions so new missions are 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.329
 always welcome they introduced 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.360
 new missions also for the various crews 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:01.120
 there is a beta crew head to head so yeah 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.950
 can fight with the various crews now 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.660
 I don't really know how 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.910
 I still have to go and see well 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.670
 however he wanted to make this video for you 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.489
 update then guys also have 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.120
 fixed that bug that allowed the 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.310
 machine duplication so I think 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.620
 that the glitch just to sell the 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.269
 machine then pick it up to make money 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.560
 everything that is there too 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.720
 blocked it is no longer possible to do this 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.239
 then they also introduced for i 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.579
 players who have one tank 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.290
 extra protection because usually who 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.510
 he had the tank everyone took 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.359
 the personal means that they went to 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.220
 crash or they did 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.810
 self-destruct from the tank 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.400
 this meant that the player 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.260
 who was inside the tank that 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.840
 maybe he was unaware since he was 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.239
 others went against it in practice 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.620
 in the lobby the hacked one where 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.030
 there were all the hackers so to speak 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.609
 those that play dirty 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.430
 so now for those who use the wagon 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:02.739
 armed there is more protection than 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.169
 prevents making them go into practice in 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.519
 that lobby of where all the are 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.340
 players playing dirty 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.519
 so we say these are the most novelties 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.870
 important most striking that there are in 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.459
 this new update is nothing if 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.260
 then you want to see all the others there 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.050
 i will leave linking description so v le 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.300
 you can network to read all of them in practice 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.380
 so if you liked the video me 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.539

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.830

 is not yet concluded I want to do 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.680

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.440

 meanwhile I tell you that I am exactly here 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.210
 in front of the Leicester Leicester house 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.770
 it's here and I'm here and I discovered this 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.719
 garage in practice two put qual 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.940
 vehicle even if you die the vehicle vi 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:57.130
 will always remain in here I don't know how 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.990
 never, however, it is excellent at least when 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.070
 it won't rain from the other side 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.050
 bullshit 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.169
 I bought this beautiful black motorcycle 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.719
 orange and white entrances we build 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.750
 ktm I also made myself the helmet entity 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:12.280
 if you look because for those who don't 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.919
 knew in practice I did this 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.320
 motorbike because I have a ktm precisely if you are 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.909
