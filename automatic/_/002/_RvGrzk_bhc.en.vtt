00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.890
 armand sarfati boutron will be account 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.890
 in the calvados 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:35.220
 goals we it's a visit a day 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.940
 winter of this property and we have 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.010
 been with my family completely conquered 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.340
 and the story started 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.500
 let's say the adventure begins the bulk of the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.239
 work the bulk of reconstruction has 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.239
 was made when I met sir 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.949
 amicably and with him is a small 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.260
 team we rebuilt really 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:01.229
 around 1994 the start of the reconquest 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.059
 doubling if we can call it because in 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:07.650
 this specific case of movement there was 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:13.409
 actually an osmosis between the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.409
 garden and shock if we have a very beautiful 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.100
 set garden gardens plus building and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.100
 it's sure that 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.509
 garden more buildings are are 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:28.280
 intimately related that we could not 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:31.100
 differentiates the garden of origin has 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.340
 probably been put in place to put 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.709
 in value of the castle since the garden 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.490
 revolves around this castle is getting organized 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.950
 around the castle 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.530
 we know that the time it was created 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.090
 since it was created in 1920 by 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.429
 Mr. and Mrs. noise they were 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:52.549
 Parisian hatters so are they 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:54.110
 who really create this park in 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.090
 the spirit of French gardens 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.909
 it's not that we put back or gardens to the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.209
 French are again hand-7 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.020
 this opportunity to that of the oak would have 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:08.020
 drawn a litter of 1000 young people the 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.020
 primary 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.099
 it's typically gilles duceppe of two 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.819
 sÃ¨vres in the middle of a very whole 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:21.010
 structured very drawn very controlled 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:26.530
 there are still some parts of 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.780
 this time the pond in study so I 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.609
 still working on these bases since 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.069
 the organization the distribution of 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:35.280
 years date from that time even on 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.200
 technical basis since drainages 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.250
 the water supply dates from this time 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.250
 and still works 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.760
 there is everything there is everything 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.920
 I signed can dream here 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.260
 to know that we have equipment 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.160
 same old ones who are very very 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.210
 performant certainly he serves an orangery 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.210
 there is also the whole 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.550
 all capital that exist know capital 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.160
 are trees without being d 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.140
 essence very very complicated very 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.540
 sophisticated are trees that are 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.930
 soon centenary so who who releases 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.640
 some obvious charm that often 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.250
 do not exist in other properties 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.550
 so we had to build rebuild 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.590
 harmony around this set of 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.740
 stone with its four towers and its 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.380
 twelve turfed and the garden that was to 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.680
 to harmonize around we have been 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.140
 a lot by that by sir georges 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.120
 ayats is a landscape without which 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.240
 lay not much that traces CDU 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.770
 the plans and we execute after 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.540
 discussion 3 3 3 people in for 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.760
 to make simple that takes care of this garden 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.540
 so there is the gentleman his fatigue 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.250
 owner whoever a smart ideas 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.530
 of the landscape architect who is there 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.560
 to carry out the most successful projects 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.870
 bigger the more accomplished and to us 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.670
 the gardeners who are here to put 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.890
 in place 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.080
 then obviously it was a bit far 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.500
 to arrive at the result we know 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.500
 today 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.970
 I like the beautiful garden gardens 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.190
 classic damn very attached to the 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.430
 classicism and gardens and I try to 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.270
 give back to this garden a little shape 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.150
 little organized with normal axes and 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.860
 players towards classicism and 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.449
 especially in the classicism to 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.360
 the italian it was my desire 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:43.030
 I do not know if I succeeded but I 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.300
 tried to do it pretty good it's a 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.979
 dream and that's who realized I 80 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.599
 years now we come to the end of the 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.599
 dream I do not know what's finished
