00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
get a radio call that we want to repeat

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.999 
get a radio call that we want to repeat
what<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.229> do<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.500> there's<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.740> couple

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
what we can do is there's a couple

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.889 
what we can do is there's a couple
methods<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.430> quickly<00:01:45.180> switching<00:01:45.600> back<00:01:45.720> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
methods of quickly switching back to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.899 
methods of quickly switching back to
flight<00:01:46.140> link<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.189> first<00:01:47.430> method<00:01:47.820> is

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
flight link so the first method is

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.789 
flight link so the first method is
double<00:01:48.329> tapping<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:49.110> home<00:01:49.259> button<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
double tapping the home button on the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.920 
double tapping the home button on the
bottom<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.189> iPad<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.790> you'll<00:01:51.479> notice<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
bottom of the iPad and you'll notice the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.719 
bottom of the iPad and you'll notice the
flight<00:01:52.170> link<00:01:52.350> icon<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.100> could<00:01:53.250> tap<00:01:53.520> that

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
flight link icon here you could tap that

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.950 
flight link icon here you could tap that
and<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.000> will<00:01:54.119> take<00:01:54.299> us<00:01:54.420> back<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
and it will take us back to the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.700 
and it will take us back to the
application

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
application

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.760 
application
but<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:57.000> other<00:01:57.149> method<00:01:57.659> which<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.290> probably

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
but the other method which is probably

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010 
but the other method which is probably
my<00:01:59.009> favorite<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.700> just<00:02:00.090> tapping<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.540> red<00:02:00.750> bar

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
my favorite is just tapping the red bar

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.340 
my favorite is just tapping the red bar
at<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> top<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.689> you<00:02:03.689> can<00:02:03.810> see<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.170> quickly

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
at the top and you can see it quickly

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.300 
at the top and you can see it quickly
brought<00:02:04.740> us<00:02:04.890> back<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:06.119> flight<00:02:06.390> link<00:02:07.310> okay

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
brought us back to to flight link okay

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.339 
brought us back to to flight link okay
so<00:02:08.369> we<00:02:08.580> switch<00:02:08.849> back<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.119> flight<00:02:09.450> link<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.899> now

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
so we switch back to flight link and now

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.160 
so we switch back to flight link and now
what<00:02:10.500> we<00:02:10.560> want<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.340> replay

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
what we want to do is replay

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.930 
what we want to do is replay
a<00:02:13.290> portion<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.040> call<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.459> might<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.760> missed

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
a portion of a call we might have missed

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.300 
a portion of a call we might have missed
there's<00:02:15.420> two<00:02:15.630> methods<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:16.110> doing<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.560> one<00:02:16.830> we

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
there's two methods of doing that one we

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.850 
there's two methods of doing that one we
can<00:02:17.430> just<00:02:17.489> tap<00:02:17.940> anywhere<00:02:18.270> in<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:19.200> black<00:02:19.530> bar

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
can just tap anywhere in this black bar

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.710 
can just tap anywhere in this black bar

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
while we've talked about flat link

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.550 
while we've talked about flat link
having<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.150> two-minute<00:02:57.660> window<00:02:58.019> that<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.530> can

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
having a two-minute window that you can

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.860 
having a two-minute window that you can
instantaneously<00:02:59.489> playback<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> call<00:03:00.690> from

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
instantaneously playback a call from

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.809 
instantaneously playback a call from
what<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.500> also<00:03:01.709> want<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.010> show<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.220> is<00:03:02.549> that<00:03:02.580> you

what I also want to show you is that you
can<00:03:03.000> actually<00:03:03.450> record<00:03:03.840> your<00:03:04.110> entire<00:03:04.140> flight

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
can actually record your entire flight

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.250

the<00:03:20.340> one<00:03:20.370> we<00:03:20.670> just<00:03:20.700> created<00:03:21.030> we<00:03:21.810> can<00:03:21.959> actually

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
the one we just created we can actually

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.380 
the one we just created we can actually
highlight<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.890> file<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.430> from<00:03:23.880> here<00:03:24.090> we<00:03:24.239> can

highlight that file and from here we can

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.620 
highlight that file and from here we can
play<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:24.720> back

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
get if you're worried about space so you

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.960 
get if you're worried about space so you
have<00:04:54.800> these<00:04:54.950> different<00:04:55.010> intervals<00:04:55.730> where
