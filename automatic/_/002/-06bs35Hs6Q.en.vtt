 hello to all then only very few 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.219
 minutes of video I wanted to do 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.799

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.869
 one thing and the other today, the 23rd of 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:23.189
 December so we are there I 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:29.580
 sorry not to be there but you will understand that it is 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:31.590
 a fairly hectic period e 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.570
 let's say it's not like me either 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:41.129
 so keen to do, in short, to do 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:45.750
 video was not an easy year though and 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:51.210
 it wo n't be an easy Christmas though anyway 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:57.620
 there will be a Christmas of hope the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:02.460
 girls and and yes there are so many things 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.300
 it happened sad or ugly or painful though 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.610
 there are many others 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:12.520
 the fine even compared to other people 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.640
 in short, I had a lot so it's still 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.910
 also a thanksgiving Christmas 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.940
 I miss making videos I tell you just that 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.750
 today and yesterday are the first days when 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.470
 I 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.090
 in the last month I then touched by 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.760
 when I moved the tricks 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.760
 I'm the last thing I did wrong 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.600
 after I can just fix a little 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.260
 I show a little bit of the house that 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.560
 in any case it is quite enough 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:52.060
 still confusing though we say that more 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:56.290
 of 50 boxes that there were none 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.270
 will be 45 to open and then to fix 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.570
 determined certain things 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.320
 for the rest I am pretty good then 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.140
 is my sister so give me a 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.820
 hand with the twins that I am in today 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.959
 holiday but now I go to the office 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:21.280
 and today is the last day and then until 7 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:24.790
 morning in the fair with the twins 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.780
 who have experienced this move into 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.040
 so a little bit yes I am a lot 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.140
 enthusiastic and this is true 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.820
 I'm glad he is though I'm also 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.470
 enough camping if we are there 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.620
 working 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.070
 they are two and I'm doing enough work 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.459
 however, the rules are hard or they are done now 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:52.870
 or later it becomes impossible when 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.640
 they grow so it's a lot of 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.880
 sample led to things from 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.720
 try type ii this is what i know 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:06.120

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:10.519
 mascara yes okay then missing video making 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:14.310
 so I hope to have some time for 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.870
 sit down chatting a little you think that 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.120
 opened a box I found the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.239
 envelope of the injured products that I had 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.680

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.650

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.620
 I wish a peaceful Christmas 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.989
 it seems a sentence was not and was 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.920
 when you will be there at the table because there 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:41.129
 you will be there at the table and on time if 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.840
 will be to ignite a debate are a 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.799
 anything because families when 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.900
 get together they fight there is no 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.000
 you can love a lot but in the end a 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:56.250
 Christmas is always pulled or discussed or 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.950
 Sionko however there are disagreements let 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:04.650
 run and let it run 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.760
 enjoy yourself enjoy lunch 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.400
 Christmas 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:13.230
 enjoy the bingo and smile like 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.120
 like every year when the first one 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.630
 someone's number will be bingo 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.269
 will say both how about god I hurt you say 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.950
 because there is always one who says both 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.690
 when the first one is pulled out 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.160

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.380

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.990

 again a message to the president 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:43.740
 in short, this is what I mean by the republic 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.440
 I'm done it has nothing to do with the 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.740
 committed lipstick today but did this 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:54.500
 red or hands that are broken after 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.500
