 hello friends of 'youtube' I'm manchev to 96 and this is my first tutorial and 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.460
 will be about how to download the wind ps pro and the heart pokémon game 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.910
 of gold but it is in Japanese that is the bad thing but I will give you a page that is 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.830
 the life of the game so they do not get complicated because this one in Japanese 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.089
 good let's start first go to my web that would leave them in the description 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.209
 of the video once there they go to where it says emulators 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.470
 and an image of the nintendo ds lite will appear and next to it an image that says 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.570
 download here give you click where it says download here and send them to 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.220
 a page of four shearer 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.210
 they wait for the time and they give in to download 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.940
 when I finished downloading it will leave a set ap like this 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.200
 they install it and ready 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.330
 now the game 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.180
 they go to me I go back through but now they go where he says robberies because the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:17.080
 wrong 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.440
 an image of the nintendo ds and a window will appear 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.130
