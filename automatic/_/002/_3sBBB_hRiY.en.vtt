00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.770 
do let's just do a quick demo here just
kind<00:02:43.420> of<00:02:43.450> slide<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.990> in<00:02:44.170> you'll<00:02:45.070> feel<00:02:45.340> it

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
kind of slide that in you'll feel it

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.480 
kind of slide that in you'll feel it
feed<00:02:46.780> into<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.410> scanner<00:02:47.740> a<00:02:47.860> little<00:02:48.130> bit<00:02:48.280> and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
feed into the scanner a little bit and

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.810 
feed into the scanner a little bit and
see<00:02:49.000> it's<00:02:49.150> full-size<00:02:49.720> for<00:02:50.020> eight<00:02:50.350> and<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.500> half

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
see it's full-size for eight and a half

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.090 
see it's full-size for eight and a half
by<00:02:51.820> eleven<00:02:52.150> sheet<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.420> paper<00:02:52.570> just<00:02:53.140> click<00:02:53.440> scan

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.400 

starts<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.220> feed<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.550> through<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.870> software

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
starts to feed it through the software

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.240 
starts to feed it through the software
will<00:03:02.650> begin<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.340> think<00:03:03.660> once<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:05.100> receipt<00:03:06.100> has

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
will begin to think once the receipt has

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.290 
will begin to think once the receipt has
scanned<00:03:06.490> all<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.760> way<00:03:06.850> through<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.240> it

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
scanned all the way through and it

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:15.120 
scanned all the way through and it
happens<00:03:07.570> pretty<00:03:07.690> quickly<00:03:13.830> see<00:03:14.830> there<00:03:15.010> it's

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
happens pretty quickly see there it's

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.160 
happens pretty quickly see there it's
thinking<00:03:16.769> it's<00:03:17.769> grabbing<00:03:18.040> all<00:03:18.340> that

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
thinking it's grabbing all that

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.470 
thinking it's grabbing all that
delicious<00:03:20.170> information<00:03:20.950> off<00:03:21.100> of<00:03:21.130> this<00:03:21.480> piece

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
on the piece of paper in another cool

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.340 
on the piece of paper in another cool
thing<00:04:33.419> about<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:34.080> little<00:04:34.560> device<00:04:34.860> is<00:04:35.280> that

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
thing about this little device is that

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.230 
thing about this little device is that
you<00:04:37.350> can<00:04:37.530> take<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.800> document<00:04:38.430> that<00:04:38.729> was<00:04:38.880> printed

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
you can take a document that was printed

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.430 
you can take a document that was printed
off<00:04:39.360> of<00:04:39.570> a<00:04:39.690> computer<00:04:40.789> and<00:04:41.789> you<00:04:42.539> can<00:04:42.780> scan<00:04:43.229> it

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
off of a computer and you can scan it

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.379 
off of a computer and you can scan it
and<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.919> will<00:04:44.070> actually<00:04:45.020> transfer<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:47.389> text

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
and it will actually transfer the text

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.140 
and it will actually transfer the text
off<00:04:48.509> the<00:04:48.690> page<00:04:48.900> into<00:04:49.349> a<00:04:49.380> Word<00:04:49.590> document<00:04:49.680> a<00:04:50.370> lot

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
off the page into a Word document a lot

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.469 
off the page into a Word document a lot
of<00:04:51.330> normal<00:04:52.110> size<00:04:52.680> scanners<00:04:53.190> do<00:04:53.729> that<00:04:53.940> but<00:04:54.240> I

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
of normal size scanners do that but I

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.029 
of normal size scanners do that but I
think<00:04:54.990> this<00:04:55.320> one's<00:04:55.590> a<00:04:55.710> little<00:04:55.919> more<00:04:57.020> I<00:04:58.039> think

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
think this one's a little more I think

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.830 
think this one's a little more I think
this<00:04:59.190> one<00:04:59.340> is<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.699> little<00:05:00.180> bit<00:05:00.270> cooler<00:05:00.510> because

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
this one is a little bit cooler because

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.180 
this one is a little bit cooler because
it<00:05:00.990> has<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.289> software<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:01.860> it's<00:05:02.010> more

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
it has the software and it's more

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.520 
it has the software and it's more
compact<00:05:02.639> and<00:05:02.910> it's<00:05:03.360> quicker<00:05:03.660> than<00:05:03.780> a<00:05:03.930> than<00:05:04.500> a

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
compact and it's quicker than a than a

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.370 
compact and it's quicker than a than a
normal<00:05:04.949> scanner<00:05:05.250> so<00:05:05.659> that's<00:05:06.659> something<00:05:07.320> I

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
normal scanner so that's something I

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.560 
normal scanner so that's something I
wanted<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.740> share<00:05:07.979> with<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.190> guys<00:05:08.520> if<00:05:09.030> there

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
wanted to share with you guys if there

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.120 
wanted to share with you guys if there
are<00:05:09.690> cool<00:05:09.960> tricks<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.620> tips<00:05:10.740> that<00:05:10.979> you<00:05:11.099> have
