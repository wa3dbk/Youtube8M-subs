00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.869
 you know that you will be revived again 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.970
 and that's the topic of the video 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.300
 it's about how fast that 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:39.110
 asset class level can do that with the 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.210
 medica vision you have to get to the 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.600
 medical fashion they come to rip 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.180
 you should score at least five per round 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.440
 Reanimate your teammate 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.870
 Of course you can do more 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.430
 Reanimate if you do 10 for example 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.140
 you get two ribs already 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:00.890
 You have to catch them at least 50 times 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.670
 get medical ribs and ultimately 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.030
 different medical approach 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.270
 you have to reanimate five people around 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.150
 you'll need a résumé of that 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.810
 50 pieces to get the medals 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.110
 per resuscitation you get 100 ep 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.200
 why is that times 100 cribs 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.720
 will you get another 200 ? 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.960
 ep for the lips then goes one more 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.210
 usually that will be x times 50 times 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.869
 calculated because you are after all 50 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.570
 need if you want that for the 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:43.369
 You will receive the metal again 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:46.399
 additionally 10,000 ep attention caution 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:51.649
 Now we come to the final price and the 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:54.829
 Final price is 45,000 and that is 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:02:03.880
 Not everything is free for a dock 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:03.880
 and such a really cool yes that 's it 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.619
 Now we come to the practical part 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.380
 the most important is like saying that 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.140
 Reanimate and best you do it 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.780
 at a point where you are safe 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.650
 and the others, so to speak, before the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.920
 feet fall 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.810
 So I mean sort of the type of 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.840
 now right next to me will be 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.600
 is perfect because I is not me 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.910
 not in the endangered area and can 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.720
 revive it anyway and already 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.610
 I have my life 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.630
 and at the same time my medical 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.010
 several and in addition also mine 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.870
 manager dr 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.280
 I hope you liked the video 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.350
 and you can do something with it 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.190
 I hope he makes it to the 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.190
