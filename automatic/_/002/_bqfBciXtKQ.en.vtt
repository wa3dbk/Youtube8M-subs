00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
on the inversion method if you guys

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.810 
on the inversion method if you guys
don't<00:00:10.679> know<00:00:10.769> what<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.490> will<00:00:11.639> leave<00:00:11.790> a

called<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> how<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.559> inversion<00:00:35.370> method<00:00:36.050> you

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
called the how to inversion method you

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.560 
called the how to inversion method you
can<00:00:37.230> grow<00:00:37.410> an<00:00:37.649> inch<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:38.010> hair<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.399> 7<00:00:38.760> days<00:00:38.940> some

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
inversion method I did it in January

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.480 
inversion method I did it in January
February<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.619> I'm<00:01:13.680> gonna<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.100> again<00:01:14.159> in

doing<00:01:20.310> an<00:01:20.369> inversion<00:01:20.610> method<00:01:21.560> but<00:01:22.560> for

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
doing an inversion method but for

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.010 
doing an inversion method but for
February<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.159> got<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> little<00:01:23.820> lazy<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.479> I

didn't complete the whole seven days of
the<00:01:28.259> inversion<00:01:28.619> method<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.920> actually<00:01:29.100> ended<00:01:29.460> up

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
the inversion method I actually ended up

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.600 
the inversion method I actually ended up
doing<00:01:29.850> three<00:01:30.210> days<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.950> believe<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.040> or<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.220> I

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
still got some growth so the way I like
to<00:01:35.970> track<00:01:36.360> my<00:01:36.540> progress<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:37.229> by<00:01:37.409> using<00:01:37.740> a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
to track my progress is by using a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.510 
to track my progress is by using a
length<00:01:38.280> check<00:01:38.880> shirt<00:01:39.240> which<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.590> if

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
length check shirt which is this and if

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.429 
length check shirt which is this and if
you<00:01:41.640> guys<00:01:41.729> want<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.479> purchase<00:01:42.720> one<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.290> will
