quid<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.500> here<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.770> converted<00:00:20.189> one<00:00:20.460> earlier

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990

bog<00:00:21.990> spanner<00:00:22.289> doesn't<00:00:22.650> come<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.250> we

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
bog spanner doesn't come like this we

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.730 
bog spanner doesn't come like this we
had<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.760> weld<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.090> bar<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.960> socket<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
meat is actually on this socket we've

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.139 
meat is actually on this socket we've
got<00:00:46.829> two<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.129> them<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.579> ours

this one is an inch drive impact socket
which<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.600> use<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:55.050> HTV<00:00:55.680> vehicles<00:00:59.390> quite<00:01:00.390> an

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
which you use on HTV vehicles quite an

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.689 
which you use on HTV vehicles quite an
old<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.170> divided<00:01:01.469> quite<00:01:01.770> well<00:01:02.100> be
