00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.549
 102 more where today I bring you a 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.000
 comparison of the galaxy s3 against the 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:18.699
 iphone 5 let's see a game to see 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.560
 if you know what it runs faster because 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.470
 let's proceed to open the two games 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.130
 to no time and the first that there will be 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.130
 he wins 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.559
 iPhone 5 here and seen it already 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.379
 cargo is running easier 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:41.030
 while in the galaxy s3 just what 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:43.360
 is opening and we see that the iphone 5 already 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.360
 do not 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.950
 with playing a little while 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.420
 as they could see the iphone5 what 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.759
 he opened the game faster the 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.399
 time in run 2 while he stayed behind 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.950
 the Galaxy S3 here comes this video 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.200
 I hope you can see that the iphone 5 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.229
 follows a little more to the front than the 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.060
 galaxy s3 we ask we see you until the 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.069

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:54.539
