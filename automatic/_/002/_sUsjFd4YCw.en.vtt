show you so let's start off by doing a
quick<00:00:35.520> search<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.850> put<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.870> my<00:00:40.079> hometown<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.500 

there<00:00:46.200> we<00:00:46.350> go<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.000> will<00:00:48.120> see<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.360> is

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
there we go and I will see this is

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.959 
there we go and I will see this is
utilizing<00:00:49.050> google<00:00:49.379> maps<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> right

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
utilizing google maps and on the right

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.389 
utilizing google maps and on the right
hand<00:00:51.000> side<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.870> drop<00:00:52.710> down<00:00:52.829> menu<00:00:52.890> there

hand side we have a drop down menu there

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.599 
hand side we have a drop down menu there
so<00:00:54.180> let's<00:00:54.539> switch<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.930> weather<00:00:58.609> initial

all that say to the webpage or that
particular<00:02:14.370> image<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:17.730> can<00:02:17.760> see<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
particular image and you can see the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:27.580 
particular image and you can see the
image<00:02:19.099> let's<00:02:20.099> see<00:02:20.250> what<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.489> is<00:02:24.980> quickly

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
image let's see what this is quickly

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.759 
image let's see what this is quickly
that's<00:02:28.590> not<00:02:28.739> very<00:02:28.769> interesting<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:31.410> let's

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
that's not very interesting so let's

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.150 
that's not very interesting so let's
just<00:02:32.040> switch<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.150> off<00:02:33.650> there<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.769> train

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
just switch that off there is a train

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.850 
just switch that off there is a train
one<00:02:35.400> as<00:02:35.519> well<00:02:36.319> that's<00:02:37.319> not<00:02:37.440> going<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.650> be<00:02:37.680> much

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
one as well that's not going to be much

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.860 
one as well that's not going to be much
use<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.160> me<00:02:38.370> here<00:02:38.819> I'm<00:02:38.970> on<00:02:39.120> flat<00:02:39.360> ground<00:02:39.660> and

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
use to me here I'm on flat ground and

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.350 
use to me here I'm on flat ground and
you<00:02:40.500> can<00:02:40.650> also<00:02:40.769> switch<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.370> satellite<00:02:41.760> imagery

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
you can also switch to satellite imagery

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.610 
you can also switch to satellite imagery
as<00:02:42.450> well<00:02:44.329> if<00:02:45.329> you<00:02:45.510> want<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.200> obviously<00:02:46.440> you

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
as well if you want to and obviously you

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.559 
as well if you want to and obviously you
can<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:48.180> can<00:02:48.359> zoom<00:02:48.569> right<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:49.220> same<00:02:50.220> as<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:50.569> any

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
can you can zoom right in same as on any

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.410 
can you can zoom right in same as on any
version<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:52.019> Google<00:02:52.350> Maps<00:02:53.030> just<00:02:54.030> takes<00:02:54.239> a

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
version of Google Maps just takes a

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.809 
version of Google Maps just takes a
moment<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.049> refresh<00:02:55.470> it's<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.340> little<00:02:56.670> bit

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
moment to refresh it's a little bit

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.759 
moment to refresh it's a little bit
jerky<00:02:57.090> it's<00:02:57.510> not<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.720> smoothest<00:02:57.930> experience

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
jerky it's not the smoothest experience

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:08.360 
jerky it's not the smoothest experience
bar<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:02.250> does<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.579> job<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.680> we<00:03:07.859> can<00:03:08.010> clear<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
bar it does the job so we can clear the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.970 
bar it does the job so we can clear the
map<00:03:08.549> as<00:03:08.790> well<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.329> there<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.319> tap<00:03:10.560> also<00:03:10.920> to

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
map as well and there is a tap also to

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.750 
map as well and there is a tap also to
to<00:03:11.430> switch<00:03:11.639> between<00:03:12.620> cocs<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.799> Fahrenheit<00:03:14.250> so

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
to switch between cocs and Fahrenheit so

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.199 
to switch between cocs and Fahrenheit so
overall<00:03:15.799> yeah<00:03:16.799> it<00:03:16.920> does<00:03:17.069> a<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.549> does<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.760> pretty

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
overall yeah it does a it does a pretty

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.170 
overall yeah it does a it does a pretty
good<00:03:18.359> job<00:03:18.480> as<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.350> say<00:03:19.560> it's<00:03:19.590> ideal<00:03:19.950> for<00:03:20.180> for

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
good job as I say it's ideal for for

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.789 
good job as I say it's ideal for for
maybe<00:03:21.569> brute<00:03:21.870> planning<00:03:22.319> to<00:03:22.410> make<00:03:22.560> sure<00:03:22.650> it's

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
maybe brute planning to make sure it's

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.259 
maybe brute planning to make sure it's
