antioxidants<00:00:21.529> so<00:00:22.529> I've<00:00:22.619> recently<00:00:22.859> got<00:00:23.250> into

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
antioxidants so I've recently got into

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.700 
antioxidants so I've recently got into
the<00:00:23.699> regular<00:00:23.910> habit<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.570> using<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.109> facial<00:00:25.560> miss

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the regular habit of using a facial miss

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.560 
the regular habit of using a facial miss
prior<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.220> using<00:00:26.460> my<00:00:26.760> treatment<00:00:27.210> products

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
prior to using my treatment products

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.870 
prior to using my treatment products
such<00:00:27.720> as<00:00:27.750> my<00:00:28.019> serums<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.189> forth<00:00:29.400> and

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
such as my serums and so on so forth and

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.420 
such as my serums and so on so forth and
I<00:00:30.660> really<00:00:30.900> do<00:00:31.019> think<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.380> helps<00:00:31.740> because<00:00:32.189> my

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
I really do think this helps because my

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.160 
I really do think this helps because my
skin<00:00:32.669> slightly<00:00:33.090> damp<00:00:33.360> before<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.750> playing<00:00:34.020> in

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
skin slightly damp before I playing in

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.229 
skin slightly damp before I playing in
my<00:00:34.290> treatment<00:00:34.739> products<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:36.059> does

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
my treatment products so it really does

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.780 
my treatment products so it really does
help<00:00:36.480> absorb<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.350> moisture<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.190> locks<00:00:38.520> in

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
help absorb the moisture and it locks in

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.540 
help absorb the moisture and it locks in
that<00:00:38.820> hydration<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.960> guess<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.890> also<00:00:41.160> think

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
that hydration I guess and I also think

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.030 
that hydration I guess and I also think
that<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.420> met<00:00:42.690> many<00:00:43.230> makeup<00:00:43.829> looks

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
that you know met many makeup looks

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.040 
that you know met many makeup looks

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
fuller coverage foundation because it

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.219 
fuller coverage foundation because it
just<00:01:26.130> buffers<00:01:26.580> out<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> finish<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.600> makes<00:01:28.049> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
so you can't really see where the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.539 
so you can't really see where the
foundation<00:01:30.030> stops<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.659> starts<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:32.250> love

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
foundation stops and starts and I love

this<00:01:32.729> foundation<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.630> particular<00:01:34.229> because

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this foundation in particular because

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.530 
this foundation in particular because
it's<00:01:34.890> very<00:01:35.040> long<00:01:35.340> lasting<00:01:35.850> but<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.180> not<00:01:36.509> a

much<00:03:40.579> fullness<00:03:41.060> already<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:41.810> then<00:03:42.290> I<00:03:42.380> like<00:03:42.530> to

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
much fullness already and then I like to

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.009

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
then just focusing on the other Brown

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.330 
then just focusing on the other Brown
doing<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:47.959> same<00:03:48.169> thing<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:48.799> the<00:03:49.130> main<00:03:49.280> reason

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
doing the same thing and the main reason

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.610 
doing the same thing and the main reason
that<00:03:49.609> I<00:03:49.730> absolutely<00:03:49.940> love<00:03:50.750> this<00:03:51.079> formula<00:03:51.590> is

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
that I absolutely love this formula is

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.710 
that I absolutely love this formula is
because<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.130> does<00:03:52.340> not<00:03:52.370> move<00:03:53.120> you<00:03:53.389> could<00:03:53.540> go<00:03:53.660> to

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
because it does not move you could go to

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.960 
because it does not move you could go to
the<00:03:53.900> gym<00:03:54.169> you<00:03:54.709> could<00:03:54.889> go<00:03:55.010> scuba<00:03:55.430> diving<00:03:55.459> it

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
the gym you could go scuba diving it

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.180 
the gym you could go scuba diving it
just<00:03:56.120> would<00:03:56.239> not<00:03:56.359> move<00:03:56.569> so<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.590> give<00:03:57.829> the<00:03:57.980> brown

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
just would not move so to give the brown

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.369 
just would not move so to give the brown
more<00:03:58.430> fullness<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.030> texture<00:03:59.510> I'm<00:03:59.690> using<00:03:59.989> this

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
more fullness and texture I'm using this

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.080 
more fullness and texture I'm using this
new<00:04:00.739> discovery<00:04:00.950> which<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.579> will<00:04:01.730> talk<00:04:01.760> about

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
new discovery which I will talk about

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.539 
new discovery which I will talk about
very<00:04:02.480> soon<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:03.109> this<00:04:03.650> product<00:04:04.040> has<00:04:04.220> little

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
very soon and this product has little

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.610 
very soon and this product has little
bits<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.879> fibers<00:04:05.569> in<00:04:05.690> it<00:04:05.750> so<00:04:05.959> it<00:04:06.019> creates<00:04:06.379> more

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
bits of fibers in it so it creates more

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.770 
bits of fibers in it so it creates more
fullness<00:04:06.980> in<00:04:07.370> terms<00:04:07.669> of<00:04:07.819> hair<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.419> it<00:04:08.629> also

fullness in terms of hair and it also

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.780 
fullness in terms of hair and it also
