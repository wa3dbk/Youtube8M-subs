00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.890
 good morning everyone today I am going to teach you 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:08.410
 to prepare homemade muffins as 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.469
 from your grandmother what we need are 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.410
 250 grams of flour 250 grams of 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:19.110
 Sugar is everything if you want to measure it because 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.730
 it is better lemon zest 4 eggs 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.060
 200 milliliters of oil and 200 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.010
 milliliters of milk or cream lemon 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.020
 it is also optional you can lie down 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.980
 vanilla essence if you want or root of 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:37.090
 the orange and a sachet of yeast 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.920
 chemical powder of royal if you want 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.380
 you can also take the bicarbonate 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.460
 will make it rise better too but that already 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.280
 it is also optional 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.280
 what we do is throw the 4 eggs 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.280
 here 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.660
 then when we see this the four 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.940
 eggs we started to beat 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.390
 first we crushed the yolks and 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.390
 we beat 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.710
 Now we are adding sugar while 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.710
 that we are removing 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.000
 for example I leave a little sugar 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.909
 that I will use it to throw them 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.060
 muffins above 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.929
 then we remove stir and what 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.929
 we do now is to milk 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.929
 slowly 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.189
 so as not to splash everything 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.540
 what we would apply to everything 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.540
 and we throw the oil 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.790
 we have to remove this, it's worth it 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.340
 I picked up a pileup a little bad on 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.890
 oil can be sunflower or olive 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.650
 It's worth 7 olive using an olive oil 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.420
 soft if it's because if you do not stay with 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.940
 a lot of flavor oil I do fine 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.990
 preferential sun because it does not stay that much 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:23.610
 taste we miss 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.610
 and this same thing has to be removed 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.510
 As you can see, he changes it from a pileup because 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.760
 I did not get in so I did not get into 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.299
 one of my biggest now I take the 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.299
 lemon zest 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.650
 we take advantage of everything well and 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.170
 we keep beating then now what 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.000
 let's do is take the envelope 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.330
 yeast and I will throw it in the 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.330
 flour 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.959
 and this is also called paul also what 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.840
 called baking powder but here it 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.520
 called yeast chemistry so how do you 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.319
 call in our country I do not know me 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.749
 I imagine it will be 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.180
 the same chemical yeast or powder 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:09.769
 bake then this what we have to 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.230
 to do is how to process it while 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.269
 we are moving , we are processing it and 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.749
 we will be adding we carry 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.749
 beating 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.590
 if you have a pileup of this that 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.240
 it makes you squeeze and it goes 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.670
 walking much better because with this 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.600
 maybe it 's a little bit more because it has 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.920
 to be well loose this part does not 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.810
 I'm going to record because it took me a little bit 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.670
 because he fears calmly he is watching me and 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.770
 I have to move, I take a 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.350
 little bit more so now I'm going to cut 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.960
 As you can see, it did not take me five 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.520
 minutes really is already that is a 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.220
 uniform mass we try not to 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.780
 no group has not stayed more 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.300
 uniform by the fact that we have 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.180
 sifted so it stays that way and you have to 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.459
 sift the always 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.129
 And now what we're going to do is throw it 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.439
 a jar to go throwing it in the 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.810
 molds or in a pastry bag like 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.480
 better angelis then I already stopped 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.930
 beat already what I have told you passing the 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.060
 molds good as you will see I have had 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.400
 to put in a mold because he did not have 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.650
 those who were for muffins so 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.259
 I have put some of hearts and 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.449
 lines is valid for you to see and I 've already 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.850
 put it in the oven I just put it right now 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.949
 It takes 5 minutes for me to 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.810
 I had forgotten to record it but it is for 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.820
 you know what 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.430
 if you have the paper of the cupcakes 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.200
 you need the metal mold to 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.660
 can put the papers because if we do not 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.580
 they are going to leave and as you can see they are already 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.710
 going up those there and these 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.009
 box office are also doing well 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.680
 that when I will not teach you 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.479
 I see good as I've done in the form 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.599
 at heart but as I told you 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.249
 Office the mold and have some muffins 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:56.649
 so rich and look what we have 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.999
 done this we have filled it with chocolate 

00:04:56.649 --> 00:05:00.279
 we injected the chocolate so 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:01.599
 you have a chocolate cupcake 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:04.860
 thank you very much, do not forget to subscribe to 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:04.860

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.580
