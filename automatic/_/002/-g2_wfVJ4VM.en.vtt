00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.419 

number<00:00:00.630> 36<00:00:00.900> rates<00:00:01.350> find<00:00:01.650> an<00:00:01.800> equation<00:00:02.129> of<00:00:02.340> the

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
number 36 rates find an equation of the

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.519 
number 36 rates find an equation of the
line<00:00:02.460> passing<00:00:03.120> through<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.389> point<00:00:03.629> 6<00:00:04.020> comma<00:00:04.290> 5

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
line passing through the point 6 comma 5

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.829 
line passing through the point 6 comma 5
and<00:00:04.859> perpendicular<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.210> line<00:00:06.390> whose

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
and perpendicular to the line whose

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.209 
and perpendicular to the line whose
equation<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.710> 2y<00:00:08.309> plus<00:00:09.150> 3x<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.870> equal<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.290> 6<00:00:10.559> so

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
equation is 2y plus 3x is equal to 6 so

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.700 
equation is 2y plus 3x is equal to 6 so
the<00:00:11.309> first<00:00:11.490> thing<00:00:11.670> I'm<00:00:11.880> going<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.269> do<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.990> I'm

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.630 
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.889> take<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.700> y<00:00:14.940> plus<00:00:15.330> 3<00:00:15.540> x<00:00:16.640> equal

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
going to take this to y plus 3 x equal

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.630 
going to take this to y plus 3 x equal
to<00:00:17.730> 6<00:00:17.970> i'm<00:00:18.240> going<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.480> solve<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:18.960> for<00:00:19.230> y

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
to 6 i'm going to solve this for y

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.609 
to 6 i'm going to solve this for y
because<00:00:20.640> i<00:00:20.760> need<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.060> know<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.449> slope<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:22.020> this

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
because i need to know the slope of this

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.429 
because i need to know the slope of this
line<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:23.310> order<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.210> find<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.630> slope<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
line in order to find the slope of the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.990 
line in order to find the slope of the
line<00:00:25.590> that's<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.250> perpendicular<00:00:26.490> to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
line that's going to be perpendicular to

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.730 
line that's going to be perpendicular to
it<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.199> let's<00:00:28.380> do<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:29.720> take<00:00:30.720> away<00:00:30.900> 3<00:00:31.230> X<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
it so let's do that take away 3 X on the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.170 
it so let's do that take away 3 X on the
side<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.300> that<00:00:33.300> side<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.460> leaves<00:00:35.640> new<00:00:35.820> to

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
side and that side so that leaves new to

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.990 
side and that side so that leaves new to
Y<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> left<00:00:37.129> now<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.190> can't<00:00:38.250> combine<00:00:38.700> these

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
Y on the left now I can't combine these

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.639 
Y on the left now I can't combine these
terms<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.600> right<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.290> negative

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
terms on the right so it's just negative

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.790 
terms on the right so it's just negative
3x<00:00:41.040> plus<00:00:41.309> 6<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.350> then<00:00:43.350> i'm<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.649> divide

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
3x plus 6 and then i'm going to divide

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.569 
3x plus 6 and then i'm going to divide
both<00:00:44.219> these<00:00:44.460> by<00:00:44.730> are<00:00:44.969> both<00:00:45.239> sides<00:00:45.510> by<00:00:46.579> 2/2

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
both these by are both sides by 2/2

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.779 
both these by are both sides by 2/2
there<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.120> divide<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.600> whole<00:00:48.840> side<00:00:49.110> by<00:00:49.410> 2

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
there and divide this whole side by 2

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.689 
there and divide this whole side by 2
that<00:00:50.789> will<00:00:51.030> leave<00:00:51.270> me<00:00:51.300> y<00:00:51.840> equals<00:00:52.350> negative<00:00:53.340> 3

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that will leave me y equals negative 3

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:01.490 
that will leave me y equals negative 3
over<00:00:54.030> 2x<00:00:56.629> plus<00:00:57.629> 3<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.780> now<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> know<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
over 2x plus 3 and so now I know the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.450 
over 2x plus 3 and so now I know the
slope<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.100> line<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.670> negative<00:01:03.180> 3<00:01:03.600> halves

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
slope of this line is negative 3 halves

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.219 
slope of this line is negative 3 halves
which<00:01:05.460> will<00:01:05.729> tell<00:01:05.970> me<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.330> slope<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.810> my<00:01:06.990> new

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
which will tell me the slope of my new

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.320 
which will tell me the slope of my new
line<00:01:08.270> which<00:01:09.270> will<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.890> two<00:01:10.890> thirds<00:01:11.430> because

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
line which will be two thirds because

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.960 
line which will be two thirds because
the<00:01:12.630> slopes<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.290> perpendicular<00:01:13.710> lines<00:01:14.670> are

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the slopes of perpendicular lines are

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.730 
the slopes of perpendicular lines are
negative<00:01:15.479> reciprocals<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:16.140> each<00:01:16.320> other<00:01:16.530> which

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
negative reciprocals of each other which

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.620 
negative reciprocals of each other which
means<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.880> negative<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.390> slope<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
means if this is negative the slope is

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
means if this is negative the slope is
going<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:18.930> positive<00:01:19.140> down<00:01:19.650> here<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
going to be positive down here and the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.490 
going to be positive down here and the
reciprocal<00:01:21.270> means<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.570> flip<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.049> fraction

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
reciprocal means you flip the fraction

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.560 
reciprocal means you flip the fraction
so<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> negative<00:01:23.460> reciprocal<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:24.000> negative<00:01:24.360> 3

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
so the negative reciprocal of negative 3

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.310 
so the negative reciprocal of negative 3
halves<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.080> 2<00:01:25.530> over<00:01:25.799> 3<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.220> positive<00:01:26.850> 2<00:01:26.970> over<00:01:27.210> 3

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
halves is 2 over 3 a positive 2 over 3

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.469 
halves is 2 over 3 a positive 2 over 3
so<00:01:28.320> now<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.560> i<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.100> slope<00:01:29.729> i'm<00:01:30.180> going

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
so now that i have that slope i'm going

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.330 
so now that i have that slope i'm going
to<00:01:30.540> go<00:01:30.630> over<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:31.320> i'm<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.280> write

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
to go over here i'm just going to write

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.399 
to go over here i'm just going to write
down<00:01:32.430> y<00:01:32.850> equals<00:01:33.150> MX<00:01:33.360> plus<00:01:33.600> B<00:01:33.930> because<00:01:34.200> that's

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
down y equals MX plus B because that's

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.020 
down y equals MX plus B because that's
the<00:01:35.220> slope<00:01:35.670> intercept<00:01:35.880> form<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.720> any<00:01:36.900> line

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
the slope intercept form for any line

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.730 
the slope intercept form for any line
and<00:01:39.030> what<00:01:39.150> I'm<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.780> I'm<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.660 
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
plug<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> value<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.759> y<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.240> value<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.140> M

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
plug in a value for y a value for M

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.389 
plug in a value for y a value for M
value<00:01:44.670> for<00:01:44.909> x<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.360> get<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.350> intercept<00:01:46.979> now<00:01:47.159> of

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
value for x and get the intercept now of

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.460 
value for x and get the intercept now of
my<00:01:47.729> new<00:01:47.970> line<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.960> already<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
my new line because I already have the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.249 
my new line because I already have the
slope<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.920> need<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> intercept<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.960> is

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
slope I need the intercept so this is

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.710 
slope I need the intercept so this is
where<00:01:52.649> we<00:01:52.799> use<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.189> point<00:01:53.520> they<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> Y

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
where we use this point they with the Y

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.899 
where we use this point they with the Y
value<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.200> 5<00:01:55.590> i'm<00:01:55.920> going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.159> plug<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.549> 5

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
value is 5 i'm going to plug it in for 5

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.709 
value is 5 i'm going to plug it in for 5
the<00:01:57.840> x<00:01:58.200> value<00:01:58.619> 6<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.700> plug<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the x value 6 so you plug it in for the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.859 
the x value 6 so you plug it in for the
x<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.100> two<00:02:02.280> thirds<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.880> slope<00:02:03.600> of

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
x and then the two thirds is slope of

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.100 
x and then the two thirds is slope of
this<00:02:04.020> line<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:05.299> now<00:02:06.299> we'll<00:02:06.479> be<00:02:06.509> able<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.840> solve

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
this line and now we'll be able to solve

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.170 
this line and now we'll be able to solve
this<00:02:07.439> 5<00:02:07.950> equals<00:02:09.110> 3<00:02:10.110> reduces<00:02:10.349> with<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:11.039> 6<00:02:11.340> so

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
this 5 equals 3 reduces with this 6 so

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.790 
this 5 equals 3 reduces with this 6 so
it's<00:02:12.360> 2<00:02:12.629> &amp;<00:02:12.870> 1<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.560> it's

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
it's 2 &amp; 1 so it's

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.410 
it's 2 &amp; 1 so it's
two<00:02:13.890> times<00:02:14.160> two<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.460> four<00:02:14.930> plus<00:02:15.930> B<00:02:17.270> swing<00:02:18.270> this

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
two times two is four plus B swing this

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.380 
two times two is four plus B swing this
for<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.050> side<00:02:19.490> so<00:02:20.490> minus<00:02:20.760> four<00:02:21.150> minus

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
for to this side so minus four minus

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.490 
for to this side so minus four minus
four<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:22.280> i<00:02:23.280> have<00:02:23.520> one<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.030> equal<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.540> B<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.470> now

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
four and i have one is equal to B so now

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.560 
four and i have one is equal to B so now
I<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.220> two<00:02:26.430> parts<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.030> need<00:02:27.240> for<00:02:27.480> my

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
I have the two parts that I need for my

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.170 
I have the two parts that I need for my
new<00:02:27.600> line<00:02:27.900> two<00:02:28.890> thirds<00:02:29.160> for<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.400> slope<00:02:29.700> one

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
new line two thirds for the slope one

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.150 
new line two thirds for the slope one
from<00:02:30.450> my<00:02:30.570> intercept<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.530> let's<00:02:31.740> write<00:02:31.950> our

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
from my intercept so let's write our

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.190 
from my intercept so let's write our
equation<00:02:32.190> y<00:02:32.940> equals<00:02:32.970> MX<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:34.710> M<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:35.220> two-thirds

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
equation y equals MX the M is two-thirds

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.440 
equation y equals MX the M is two-thirds
plus<00:02:37.200> B<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:37.920> it's<00:02:38.040> plus<00:02:38.220> one<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.790> that's<00:02:39.270> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
plus B so it's plus one and that's the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.830 
plus B so it's plus one and that's the
slope<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:39.930> my<00:02:40.620> answer
