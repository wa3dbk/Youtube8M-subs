00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.330
 Hello people and welcome to the games portal branch of Schmidt Games Me 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.309
 I am for one and today I declare games number four except new wohlen 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.479
 Claque match series by Schmidt Spiele 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:18.939
 As with all pipes, it is also the special that plays here 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.529
 Pack at the same time ice cube clay can be used 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.390
 Thus, the high important are ideal for traveling because no litters 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.780
 fly more through the area 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.319
 and the whole game material is safely stowed in the firm box 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.660
 the game preparation is also quickly clarified the just mentioned Toman 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:38.420
 put the first in the middle of the table so everyone can use it well 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.270
 then put the throws and the game board ready 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.910
 each player gets 18 to 25 of these chips and depending on the number of players 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.790
 The remaining chips Lakehurst general ready and ready to go 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.340
 the players take turns and roll dice 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.040
 with all cubes 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.100
 according to his court, the player must put aside at least one dice 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.300
 but he can even if he wants to set aside several dice at once 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.500
 as long as dice are left, the same player rolls again and 10 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.290
 set aside at least one cube again 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.260
 the whole thing repeated until all litters have been put aside then then 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.770
 it comes to a rating 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.190
 in a rating then the active player has to be set aside 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.430
 laid dice 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.830
 Put chips on the board 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.120
 A game type always has to be placed on top of the next empty space 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.040
 become 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.910
 for the 1a and two rows of numbers would even have two chips on the first 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.050
 Fields are lying 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.020
 In addition, it must also pay attention to the test drives the rim because for 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.180
 every greenfield you have to put your own chips on a yellow one 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.510
 falls is likely a chip from the general 4 athletes 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.679
 So if now take my cube result as an example 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:54.490
 has to be 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.730
 put a chip on the first quad 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.070
 a chip falls on the first 5 o'clock 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.450
 for the second 5 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.360
 may I take a chip from the general before bath 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.020
 and also the money is put away 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.130
 and for sixes, you generally have no chips to live on the board 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:15.499
 if you took the last field of a series of numbers on all of you 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:19.579
 Chips in the number range accept and the other players even need chips 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.870
 according to the red numbers at the bottom of this number series 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.579
 deliver to the general spot 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.180
 then if you evaluated all the dice hard then the next player is in the 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.869
 Clockwise at the turn 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:34.450
 and you can certainly imagine playing a game called Geizen 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.489
 that it is good if you play with yours now so stingy as little as possible 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.969
 give it away 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.800
 because a player must discard his last game ships on the board 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.989
 and no plays now gets more back 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.620
 The game also ends up with tomatoes and whoever has the most chips left 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.959
 he won 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.009
 quite simply typical for Olympic Games 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:57.329
 As always, enjoy playing and see you next time
