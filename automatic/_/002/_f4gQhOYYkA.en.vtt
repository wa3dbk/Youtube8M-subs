pushed into rather than the back beat on
beat<00:00:59.250> four<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.699> previous<00:01:00.120> example<00:01:00.920> let's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
beat four in a previous example let's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.079 
beat four in a previous example let's
have<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> listen<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.460> what<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.729> drum<00:01:02.940> beat

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
have a listen to what the drum beat

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:09.160 
have a listen to what the drum beat
sounds<00:01:03.420> like

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.020 

so<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.650> pattern<00:01:29.010> we<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.160> eighth<00:01:29.640> notes

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so for this pattern we have eighth notes

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.790 
so for this pattern we have eighth notes
being<00:01:30.240> played<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.020> hi-hat

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
being played on the hi-hat

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.400 
being played on the hi-hat
we<00:01:32.550> have<00:01:32.730> snare<00:01:33.090> drum<00:01:33.300> on<00:01:33.510> beats<00:01:33.750> two<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.170> four

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
we have snare drum on beats two and four

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.250 
we have snare drum on beats two and four
and<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.640> new<00:01:35.790> baizhang<00:01:36.210> pattern<00:01:36.600> bass<00:01:37.020> drum

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
and the new baizhang pattern bass drum

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.800 
and the new baizhang pattern bass drum
on<00:01:37.350> beat<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.860> bass<00:01:38.520> drum<00:01:38.760> on<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.570> beat

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
on beat one bass drum on the and of beat

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.219 
on beat one bass drum on the and of beat
two<00:01:40.080> and<00:01:40.290> bass<00:01:40.770> drum<00:01:41.010> on<00:01:41.220> beat<00:01:41.340> three<00:01:42.229> so

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
two and bass drum on beat three so

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.110 
two and bass drum on beat three so
compared<00:01:43.800> to<00:01:43.830> our<00:01:44.010> last<00:01:44.040> example<00:01:44.400> where<00:01:44.970> we

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
compared to our last example where we

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.260 
compared to our last example where we
had<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:46.110> had<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> bass<00:01:47.070> Ramon<00:01:47.340> beat<00:01:47.550> three<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
had we had the bass Ramon beat three the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.540 
had we had the bass Ramon beat three the
anda<00:01:48.510> beat<00:01:48.690> free<00:01:48.960> followed<00:01:49.590> directly<00:01:50.250> after

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
anda beat free followed directly after

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.090 
anda beat free followed directly after
this<00:01:50.670> by<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> snare<00:01:51.240> drum<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.510> beat<00:01:51.810> four<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.830> now

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
this by a snare drum on beat four we now

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.790 
this by a snare drum on beat four we now
have<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:54.090> snare<00:01:54.390> drum<00:01:54.660> on<00:01:54.750> beat<00:01:54.960> two<00:01:55.170> followed

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
have the snare drum on beat two followed

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.620 
have the snare drum on beat two followed
by<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.979> two<00:01:56.160> bass<00:01:56.430> drums<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:57.090> there<00:01:57.540> the

hi-hat on its own then the snare drum so

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.180 
hi-hat on its own then the snare drum so
well<00:02:01.050> I<00:02:01.080> find<00:02:01.380> with<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.500> lot<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.649> pupils<00:02:02.040> when

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
well I find with a lot of pupils when

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.680 
well I find with a lot of pupils when
they're<00:02:02.310> practicing<00:02:02.540> practicing<00:02:03.540> this

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
they're practicing practicing this

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.469 
they're practicing practicing this
example<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:05.430> they<00:02:05.580> tend<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.000> play<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
example is that they tend to play the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.840 
example is that they tend to play the
snare<00:02:06.540> drum<00:02:07.020> straight<00:02:07.440> after<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.429> second

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
snare drum straight after the second

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.240 
snare drum straight after the second
bass<00:02:09.000> drum<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.390> beat<00:02:09.810> three<00:02:10.290> when<00:02:10.950> they<00:02:11.070> should

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
bass drum on beat three when they should

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.920 
bass drum on beat three when they should
be<00:02:11.340> playing<00:02:11.580> another<00:02:11.820> hi-hat<00:02:12.300> on<00:02:12.330> its<00:02:12.600> own<00:02:12.750> on

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
be playing another hi-hat on its own on

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.930 
be playing another hi-hat on its own on
the<00:02:13.020> end<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.380> beat<00:02:13.530> free<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:13.980> then<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.640> snare

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
the end of beat free and then the snare

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.790
