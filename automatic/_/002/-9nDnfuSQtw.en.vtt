00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
support in the game so I think the

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:53.060 
support in the game so I think the
support<00:00:45.190> plays<00:00:45.489> a<00:00:45.519> part<00:00:46.030> I<00:00:47.699> think<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:51.100> kind<00:00:51.400> of

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.799 
support plays a part I think the kind of
well<00:00:54.070> I<00:00:54.129> think<00:00:54.220> it's<00:00:54.699> really<00:00:55.000> support

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.679 
people would even think that well I
think<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.579> fact<00:01:36.820> that<00:01:37.679> female<00:01:38.679> rap<00:01:39.249> is<00:01:39.549> it's<00:01:40.420> a

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
think the fact that female rap is it's a

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.749 
think the fact that female rap is it's a
small<00:01:40.869> category<00:01:41.590> for<00:01:41.799> female<00:01:42.100> rap<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.520> it's

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
small category for female rap and it's

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.179 
small category for female rap and it's
not<00:01:42.939> so<00:01:43.179> many<00:01:43.359> female<00:01:43.600> rappers<00:01:44.170> out<00:01:44.320> there<00:01:44.619> so

not so many female rappers out there so

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.249

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
I think that plays a major part in the

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.410 
I think that plays a major part in the
comparing<00:01:48.130> like<00:01:48.310> they<00:01:48.490> have<00:01:48.729> no<00:01:48.880> choice<00:01:48.909> but

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
comparing like they have no choice but

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.120

the same at all um she does her own
thing<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.590> I'm<00:02:18.190> in<00:02:18.430> my<00:02:18.519> own<00:02:18.700> lane<00:02:18.940> also<00:02:19.510> our

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
thing and I'm in my own lane also our

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.420 
thing and I'm in my own lane also our
music<00:02:20.319> is<00:02:20.409> different<00:02:20.590> we<00:02:20.860> talk<00:02:21.040> about<00:02:21.159> two

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430

different<00:02:21.549> things

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
different things

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.900 
different things
I<00:02:22.410> think<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.500> fact<00:02:23.740> that<00:02:23.830> it's<00:02:24.130> just<00:02:24.400> us<00:02:24.640> in

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
I think the fact that it's just us in

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.800 
I think the fact that it's just us in
the<00:02:25.060> game

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
the game

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.500 
the game
not<00:02:26.320> necessarily<00:02:26.860> us<00:02:27.100> but<00:02:27.400> it's<00:02:27.670> just<00:02:27.880> a<00:02:28.150> few

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
not necessarily us but it's just a few

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.330 
not necessarily us but it's just a few
female<00:02:28.900> rappers<00:02:29.350> in<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.560> game<00:02:29.740> right<00:02:30.280> now

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
female rappers in the game right now

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.420 
female rappers in the game right now
that<00:02:31.150> are<00:02:31.360> really<00:02:31.750> out<00:02:32.620> there<00:02:32.980> with<00:02:33.220> their

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
that are really out there with their

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
that are really out there with their
music<00:02:34.000> so<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:36.220> plays<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.460> major<00:02:36.670> part<00:02:36.820> in<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
music so that plays a major part in the

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.960 
music so that plays a major part in the
comparison<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:39.370> don't<00:02:40.300> really<00:02:40.660> listen<00:02:41.380> to

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
comparison and I don't really listen to

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
things so I had to actually sit down and

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.190 
things so I had to actually sit down and
ask<00:03:26.380> myself<00:03:26.709> like<00:03:27.130> okay<00:03:27.490> what's<00:03:28.330> going<00:03:28.600> on<00:03:28.750> cuz

it<00:03:29.620> doesn't<00:03:29.890> even<00:03:30.100> make<00:03:30.340> sense<00:03:30.400> like<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.000> don't

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
it doesn't even make sense like I don't

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.330 
it doesn't even make sense like I don't
even<00:03:31.450> think<00:03:31.720> our<00:03:31.900> music<00:03:32.050> is<00:03:32.350> alike<00:03:32.620> in<00:03:32.860> any

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
even think our music is alike in any

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.610 
even think our music is alike in any
type<00:03:33.640> of<00:03:33.670> way<00:03:33.910> so<00:03:33.940> where's<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.990> comparison

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
type of way so where's the comparison

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
type of way so where's the comparison
coming<00:03:36.070> from<00:03:36.280> so<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:37.120> would<00:03:37.420> assume<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:38.230> know

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
coming from so I would assume you know

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.520 
coming from so I would assume you know
the<00:03:39.640> fact<00:03:39.850> that<00:03:39.940> I<00:03:40.270> listen<00:03:40.750> to<00:03:40.870> when<00:03:40.990> his<00:03:41.140> music

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
the fact that I listen to when his music

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.699 
the fact that I listen to when his music
and<00:03:41.680> Wayne<00:03:42.120> plays<00:03:43.120> a<00:03:43.420> part<00:03:43.690> in<00:03:43.840> my<00:03:44.500> foundation

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
and Wayne plays a part in my foundation

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.150 
and Wayne plays a part in my foundation
a<00:03:45.250> bit<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:46.720> comes<00:03:47.230> from<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.740> she's<00:03:47.980> his

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
a bit that comes from it and she's his

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.580 
a bit that comes from it and she's his
protege<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:48.790> found<00:03:49.030> me<00:03:49.150> so<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:49.420> know<00:03:49.720> they

protege you found me so you know they
have<00:03:50.860> I<00:03:51.310> guess<00:03:52.209> kind<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.750> similarities<00:03:53.380> but

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
have I guess kind of similarities but

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.199 
have I guess kind of similarities but
she's<00:03:53.860> in<00:03:53.980> her<00:03:54.100> only<00:03:54.310> she<00:03:54.730> does<00:03:54.910> her<00:03:55.030> own<00:03:55.090> thing

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
she's in her only she does her own thing

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.480 
she's in her only she does her own thing
our<00:03:55.570> music<00:03:55.900> is<00:03:56.020> totally<00:03:56.170> different<00:03:56.740> in<00:03:56.890> my

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
our music is totally different in my
