a<00:01:04.949> load<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.280> bugs<00:01:05.489> at<00:01:05.700> launch<00:01:05.909> especially<00:01:06.450> on

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
a load of bugs at launch especially on

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.940 
a load of bugs at launch especially on
the<00:01:06.570> console<00:01:06.930> versions<00:01:07.409> which<00:01:07.560> was<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.799> real

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the console versions which was a real

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.149 
the console versions which was a real
shame<00:01:08.159> for<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> lot<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.579> people<00:01:08.719> because<00:01:09.719> it<00:01:10.350> was

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
shame for a lot of people because it was

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.969 
shame for a lot of people because it was
fun<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.460> play<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.090> once<00:01:12.330> they<00:01:12.479> fixed<00:01:12.810> all<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
fun to play and once they fixed all the

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.130 
fun to play and once they fixed all the
issues<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.460> hoped<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.570> view<00:01:15.780> did<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
issues I hoped on view did to have a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.780 
issues I hoped on view did to have a
chance<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.440> get<00:01:16.619> into<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.979> because<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.400> was<00:01:17.430> one

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
chance to get into it because it was one

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.190 
chance to get into it because it was one
of<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> better<00:01:18.119> bike<00:01:18.360> games<00:01:18.630> released<00:01:18.810> in

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
of the better bike games released in

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.440 
of the better bike games released in
recent<00:01:19.590> years<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.670> had<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> nice<00:01:21.060> sort<00:01:21.330> of

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
recent years and it had a nice sort of

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.510 
recent years and it had a nice sort of
more<00:01:21.689> intuitive<00:01:22.290> feel<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.040> turning

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
more intuitive feel to it the turning

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.630 
more intuitive feel to it the turning
was<00:01:23.700> slightly<00:01:23.970> better<00:01:24.439> back<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.590> MotoGP<00:01:26.340> they

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
was slightly better back to MotoGP they

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.490 
was slightly better back to MotoGP they
assure<00:01:26.909> me<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.420> same<00:01:28.020> bugs<00:01:28.350> that

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
assure me that the same bugs that

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.340 
assure me that the same bugs that
affected<00:01:29.040> ride<00:01:29.250> won't<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:30.110> featured<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.200> this

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
affected ride won't be featured in this

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.140 
affected ride won't be featured in this
gain<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> lot<00:01:32.010> of<00:01:32.159> works<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.760> this<00:01:32.909> time

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
gain a lot of works going on this time

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.300 
gain a lot of works going on this time
to<00:01:33.330> make<00:01:33.479> sure<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.810> nice<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.049> solid<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.799> do

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
to make sure it's nice and solid I do

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.850 
to make sure it's nice and solid I do
hope<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.060> frame<00:01:36.630> rate<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.200> better<00:01:37.590> on

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
hope that the frame rate is better on

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.789 
hope that the frame rate is better on
the<00:01:38.340> console<00:01:38.670> versions<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.570> right<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.170> did

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the console versions then right I did

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.649 
the console versions then right I did
feel<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.250> frame<00:01:41.490> rate<00:01:41.700> again<00:01:42.450> was

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
feel that the frame rate again was

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.899 
feel that the frame rate again was
another<00:01:42.869> thing<00:01:43.080> that<00:01:43.140> let<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> game<00:01:43.770> down<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
another thing that let the game down and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.090 
another thing that let the game down and
I<00:01:44.970> ran<00:01:45.390> my<00:01:45.420> 60<00:01:45.900> frames<00:01:46.080> per<00:01:46.170> second<00:01:46.439> pc<00:01:46.799> video

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
I ran my 60 frames per second pc video

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.880 
I ran my 60 frames per second pc video
and<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.729> made<00:01:47.880> such<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> huge<00:01:48.240> difference

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
and it just made such a huge difference

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.560 
and it just made such a huge difference
so<00:01:49.890> running<00:01:50.400> on<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> ps4<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.390> will<00:01:51.509> be

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
so running on the ps4 this will be

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.600 
so running on the ps4 this will be
running<00:01:51.780> at<00:01:51.869> 30<00:01:52.079> frames<00:01:52.380> lots<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.430> reasons

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
running at 30 frames lots of reasons

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.730 
running at 30 frames lots of reasons

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
recording it has to be said at times

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.110 
recording it has to be said at times
it's<00:03:38.770> a<00:03:38.860> bit<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.160> pain<00:03:39.340> because<00:03:39.580> we<00:03:39.790> only<00:03:39.910> had

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
it's a bit of a pain because we only had

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.990 
it's a bit of a pain because we only had
one<00:03:40.420> go<00:03:40.720> on<00:03:40.990> this<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.380> record<00:03:41.740> it<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.040> hence

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
one go on this to record it and hence

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.910 
one go on this to record it and hence
that's<00:03:43.720> why<00:03:43.960> we're<00:03:44.170> having<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.440> go<00:03:44.590> with<00:03:44.770> what

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
that's why we're having to go with what

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.260 
that's why we're having to go with what
we've<00:03:45.040> got<00:03:45.220> for<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.430> moment<00:03:45.610> but<00:03:45.910> no<00:03:46.090> doubt

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
we've got for the moment but no doubt

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.300 
we've got for the moment but no doubt
we'll<00:03:46.510> have<00:03:46.630> lots<00:03:46.810> of<00:03:47.080> coverage<00:03:47.410> in<00:03:48.100> the

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
we'll have lots of coverage in the

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.300 
we'll have lots of coverage in the
future<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:49.120> we'll<00:03:49.780> be<00:03:49.990> able<00:03:50.110> to<00:03:50.440> show<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:50.950> lot

handling<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.300> think<00:05:13.510> I<00:05:13.630> found<00:05:13.930> on<00:05:14.289> this<00:05:15.220> game<00:05:15.940> I

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
handling I think I found on this game I

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.120 
handling I think I found on this game I
found<00:05:16.479> it<00:05:16.600> to<00:05:16.750> be<00:05:16.780> quite<00:05:17.110> difficult<00:05:17.500> in<00:05:17.950> terms

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
found it to be quite difficult in terms

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.580 
found it to be quite difficult in terms
of<00:05:18.310> getting<00:05:18.460> into<00:05:18.760> and<00:05:19.090> full<00:05:19.270> simulation<00:05:19.590> been

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
of getting into and full simulation been

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.580 
of getting into and full simulation been
nicer<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:20.979> have<00:05:21.190> tried<00:05:22.150> perhaps<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:22.960> semi-pro

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
nicer to have tried perhaps a semi-pro

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.170 
nicer to have tried perhaps a semi-pro
setting<00:05:24.100> or<00:05:24.280> something<00:05:24.310> like<00:05:24.640> that<00:05:24.700> they<00:05:25.000> had

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
setting or something like that they had

in there but as I say time wasn't in the
TV<00:05:27.460> why<00:05:28.210> not<00:05:28.450> why<00:05:28.930> not<00:05:28.960> just<00:05:29.289> throw<00:05:29.380> me<00:05:29.830> in<00:05:29.890> the

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
TV why not why not just throw me in the

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.330 
TV why not why not just throw me in the
deep<00:05:30.280> end<00:05:30.520> and<00:05:30.850> see<00:05:31.690> how<00:05:31.840> I<00:05:31.900> get<00:05:32.050> on<00:05:32.229> a<00:05:32.560> bit<00:05:33.070> wide

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
deep end and see how I get on a bit wide

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.890 
deep end and see how I get on a bit wide
that<00:05:33.610> time<00:05:33.940> really<00:05:34.510> going<00:05:34.660> to<00:05:34.720> know<00:05:34.780> the

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
that time really going to know the

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.080 
that time really going to know the
braking<00:05:35.229> distances<00:05:35.680> I<00:05:35.919> mean<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.310> braking

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
braking distances I mean the braking

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.510 
braking distances I mean the braking
distances<00:05:37.479> are<00:05:37.600> quite<00:05:37.780> long<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.620> if<00:05:39.370> you<00:05:39.460> miss

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
distances are quite long and if you miss

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.190 
distances are quite long and if you miss
your<00:05:39.789> breaking<00:05:40.150> point<00:05:40.389> that's<00:05:40.690> it<00:05:40.960> you're

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
your breaking point that's it you're

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.629 
your breaking point that's it you're
going<00:05:41.350> wide<00:05:41.650> and<00:05:42.039> there's<00:05:42.160> nothing<00:05:42.370> you're

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
going wide and there's nothing you're

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.510 
going wide and there's nothing you're
going<00:05:42.820> to<00:05:42.910> do<00:05:43.000> about<00:05:43.120> it<00:05:43.479> so<00:05:44.160> this<00:05:45.160> is<00:05:45.190> when<00:05:45.430> the

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
going to do about it so this is when the

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.940 
going to do about it so this is when the
corners<00:05:45.820> are<00:05:45.910> struggling<00:05:46.389> on<00:05:46.750> as<00:05:47.320> well<00:05:47.590> just

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
corners are struggling on as well just

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.680 
corners are struggling on as well just
round<00:05:48.220> here<00:05:48.490> so<00:05:48.850> we've<00:05:48.940> got<00:05:49.030> slow<00:05:49.180> corner<00:05:49.539> but

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
round here so we've got slow corner but

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.960 
round here so we've got slow corner but
fans<00:05:49.930> that<00:05:50.139> meat<00:05:50.530> to<00:05:51.100> high-speed<00:05:51.310> corners

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
fans that meat to high-speed corners

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.760 
fans that meat to high-speed corners
when<00:05:52.120> I<00:05:52.150> was<00:05:52.270> struggling<00:05:52.570> a<00:05:52.840> bit<00:05:52.870> you<00:05:53.590> actually

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
when I was struggling a bit you actually

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.430 
when I was struggling a bit you actually
make<00:05:54.039> it<00:05:54.220> this<00:05:54.340> time<00:05:54.930> still<00:05:55.930> a<00:05:55.960> bit<00:05:56.139> while<00:05:56.380> I

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
make it this time still a bit while I

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.430 
make it this time still a bit while I
was<00:05:56.740> really<00:05:56.919> struggling<00:05:57.160> on<00:05:57.400> that<00:05:57.550> corner

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
was really struggling on that corner

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.719 
was really struggling on that corner
terms<00:05:59.440> of<00:05:59.590> under<00:05:59.919> steering<00:06:00.220> and<00:06:00.490> over

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
terms of under steering and over

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.159 
terms of under steering and over
steering<00:06:01.150> through<00:06:01.300> the<00:06:01.450> corner<00:06:01.810> it<00:06:01.930> needs<00:06:02.110> a

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
steering through the corner it needs a

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:03.510 
steering through the corner it needs a
lot<00:06:02.289> more<00:06:02.350> practice<00:06:02.680> for<00:06:03.190> me<00:06:03.280> to<00:06:03.400> actually

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
lot more practice for me to actually

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.700 
lot more practice for me to actually
find<00:06:03.880> the<00:06:04.000> line<00:06:04.180> I<00:06:04.210> mean<00:06:04.539> generally<00:06:05.320> on<00:06:05.440> a<00:06:05.470> game

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
find the line I mean generally on a game

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.830 
find the line I mean generally on a game
like<00:06:05.860> this<00:06:05.919> I'd<00:06:06.220> probably<00:06:06.430> do<00:06:06.760> about<00:06:07.060> 15<00:06:07.570> to<00:06:07.720> 20

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
like this I'd probably do about 15 to 20

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.950 
like this I'd probably do about 15 to 20
laps<00:06:08.260> at<00:06:08.470> least<00:06:08.680> 20<00:06:09.220> laps<00:06:09.430> usually<00:06:09.910> to<00:06:10.120> just

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
laps at least 20 laps usually to just

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.690 
laps at least 20 laps usually to just
get<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.200> bike<00:06:11.410> settled<00:06:11.919> and<00:06:12.070> understand<00:06:12.520> well

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
get the bike settled and understand well

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.730 
get the bike settled and understand well
the<00:06:12.729> braking<00:06:13.210> points<00:06:13.600> are<00:06:13.780> and<00:06:14.080> flowing<00:06:14.560> from

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
the braking points are and flowing from

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.980 
the braking points are and flowing from
corner<00:06:15.070> to<00:06:15.099> corner<00:06:15.220> but<00:06:15.760> by<00:06:16.450> the<00:06:16.510> way<00:06:16.659> I<00:06:16.720> wanted

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
corner to corner but by the way I wanted

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.270 
corner to corner but by the way I wanted
