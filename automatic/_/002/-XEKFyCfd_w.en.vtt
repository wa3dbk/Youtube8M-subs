and water pump so I'll show you that
also<00:00:13.410> I've<00:00:13.530> finished<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.340> off<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:15.059> is

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
also I've finished it off and it is

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.700 
also I've finished it off and it is
working<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:15.599> i'll<00:00:15.900> show<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.289> running<00:00:16.590> as

well just a quick look you decide the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.509 
well just a quick look you decide the
fish<00:00:20.160> tank<00:00:20.400> as<00:00:20.580> well<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.119> see<00:00:21.300> how<00:00:21.390> put<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
fish tank as well and see how put the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.550 
fish tank as well and see how put the
old<00:00:23.519> greenhouse<00:00:24.330> over<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> top<00:00:25.080> there<00:00:25.289> just

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
old greenhouse over the top there just

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.410 
old greenhouse over the top there just
for<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.769> shade<00:00:25.980> cloth<00:00:26.160> help<00:00:27.119> keep<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
for the shade cloth help keep the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.560 
for the shade cloth help keep the
sunlight<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.730> i<00:00:29.730> will<00:00:29.910> make<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.210> look<00:00:30.359> for

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
sunlight out and i will make it look for

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.910 
sunlight out and i will make it look for
this<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:31.850> for<00:00:32.850> now<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.210> fine<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:34.710> water

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
this but for now this is fine the water

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.770 
this but for now this is fine the water
is<00:00:35.070> clearing<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.790> can't<00:00:36.030> see<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> fish<00:00:36.480> in

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
is clearing out I can't see the fish in

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.799 
is clearing out I can't see the fish in
the<00:00:36.899> water<00:00:37.079> now<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.890> still<00:00:38.129> pretty<00:00:38.280> dirty

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
the water now it is still pretty dirty

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.639 
the water now it is still pretty dirty
that's<00:00:39.809> why<00:00:39.960> I've<00:00:40.050> made<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.530> filter<00:00:41.010> box<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
that's why I've made the filter box and

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.110 
that's why I've made the filter box and
I'm<00:00:43.649> not<00:00:43.860> running<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> water<00:00:44.489> into<00:00:44.700> here<00:00:45.030> at

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
I'm not running the water into here at

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.580 
I'm not running the water into here at
the<00:00:45.180> moment<00:00:45.360> because<00:00:45.660> I'm<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:46.050> waiting<00:00:46.379> for

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the moment because I'm just waiting for

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.020 
the moment because I'm just waiting for
the<00:00:46.710> silicone<00:00:47.219> around<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.520> outside<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.879> these

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the silicone around the outside of these

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.200 
the silicone around the outside of these
pipes<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.629> drive<00:00:48.899> when<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.739> put<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.160> filter<00:00:50.910> box

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
pipes to drive when I put the filter box

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.439 
pipes to drive when I put the filter box
in<00:00:51.420> place<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.989> knocked<00:00:52.800> him<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.039> bit<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.670> started

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
in place I knocked him a bit and started

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.380 
in place I knocked him a bit and started
they<00:00:55.079> started<00:00:55.410> licking<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
they started licking you can see the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.330 
they started licking you can see the
fish<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:59.570> here<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.660> go<00:01:00.809> now<00:01:01.770> I'll<00:01:02.100> jump

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
fish in here here we go now I'll jump

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.380 
fish in here here we go now I'll jump
around<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.609> other<00:01:02.699> side<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.090> show<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.329> that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
around the other side and show you that

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.109 
around the other side and show you that
your<00:01:03.690> box<00:01:03.870> itself<00:01:05.510> yeah<00:01:06.510> I've<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:06.869> got<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
your box itself yeah I've just got the

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.330 
your box itself yeah I've just got the
silicon<00:01:09.119> driving<00:01:09.479> around<00:01:09.630> these<00:01:09.900> pipes<00:01:10.340> so

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
silicon driving around these pipes so

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.660 
silicon driving around these pipes so
i'm<00:01:12.210> using<00:01:12.510> aquariums<00:01:13.200> aquarium<00:01:13.490> silicon<00:01:14.490> but

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
i'm using aquariums aquarium silicon but

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.390 
i'm using aquariums aquarium silicon but
i<00:01:14.729> am<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:16.020> make<00:01:16.290> sure<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.650> drop<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.130> us<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
i am to make sure it's drop for us that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.770 
i am to make sure it's drop for us that
run<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.759> water<00:01:17.939> through<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.270> again<00:01:18.420> otherwise

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
run the water through it again otherwise

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.399 
run the water through it again otherwise
it'll<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.200> make<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.560> leak<00:01:19.799> again<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:21.600> cut<00:01:22.229> this

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
it'll just make it leak again I cut this

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.010 
it'll just make it leak again I cut this
pipe<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:23.040> bit<00:01:23.340> shorter<00:01:23.700> what<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> fitting<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.840> top

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
pipe a bit shorter what a fitting in top

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.580 
pipe a bit shorter what a fitting in top
of<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.200> bucket<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:27.140> that's<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.320> silly

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
of the bucket and and that's just silly

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.010 
of the bucket and and that's just silly
Kingdom<00:01:28.979> place<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> lid<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.689> bucket

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
Kingdom place in the lid of the bucket

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.190 
Kingdom place in the lid of the bucket
and<00:01:31.729> I<00:01:32.729> put<00:01:33.119> one<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> base<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.869> bucket

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and I put one of the base of the bucket

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.100 
and I put one of the base of the bucket
that's<00:01:34.920> better<00:01:35.820> another<00:01:36.659> thread<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
that's better another thread on the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.710 
that's better another thread on the
inside<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:38.310> that's<00:01:38.640> attached<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.600> i've

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.300 
inside and that's attached to it i've
also<00:01:39.869> silicon<00:01:40.409> around<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> outside<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.130> this

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
also silicon around the outside of this

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.010 
also silicon around the outside of this
one<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.610> well<00:01:41.790> just<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> make<00:01:42.630> sure<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.869> doesn't

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
one as well just to make sure it doesn't

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.190 
one as well just to make sure it doesn't
leak<00:01:43.229> now<00:01:44.220> now<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.090> feeding<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.840> glued

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
leak now now this this feeding is glued

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.120 
leak now now this this feeding is glued
and<00:01:47.210> these<00:01:48.210> ones<00:01:48.420> are<00:01:48.540> not<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> remove<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and these ones are not so to remove the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.000 
and these ones are not so to remove the
bucket<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:51.390> need<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.810> pull<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.649> pipe<00:01:52.799> out

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
bucket I just need to pull the pipe out

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.340 
bucket I just need to pull the pipe out
and<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.810> piece<00:01:56.050> comes<00:01:56.290> out<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:58.630> should

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
and this piece comes out and I should

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.850 
and this piece comes out and I should
really<00:01:59.800> need<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.310> take<00:02:00.490> it<00:02:00.610> out<00:02:00.730> anyway<00:02:01.060> and

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
really need to take it out anyway and

that's completely filled mostly going

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.410 
that's completely filled mostly going
across<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.530> outlet<00:02:18.250> there<00:02:18.430> as<00:02:18.490> well<00:02:18.700> make

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
across the outlet there as well make

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.840 
across the outlet there as well make
sure<00:02:19.540> no<00:02:19.780> particles<00:02:20.380> get<00:02:20.530> through<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:22.650> then

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850

probably for three quarters up to
three-quarters<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.510> way<00:02:28.630> I've<00:02:28.900> got<00:02:29.350> filled

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
three-quarters the way I've got filled

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.960 
three-quarters the way I've got filled
with<00:02:30.480> pillow<00:02:31.650> filling<00:02:32.650> just<00:02:33.490> bought<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.700> cheap

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
with pillow filling just bought a cheap

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.640 
with pillow filling just bought a cheap
five-dollar<00:02:34.480> pillow<00:02:34.780> pulled<00:02:35.230> all<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.440> fluff

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
five-dollar pillow pulled all the fluff

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.210 
five-dollar pillow pulled all the fluff
out<00:02:35.800> of<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.540> stuffed<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.690> if<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:37.960> and<00:02:38.470> then

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
out of it and stuffed it if you and then

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.760 
out of it and stuffed it if you and then
I've<00:02:39.340> got<00:02:39.490> another<00:02:39.700> layer<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:41.410> nylon

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
I've got another layer of the nylon

I've got another layer of the nylon
scour<00:02:42.100> pads<00:02:42.430> going<00:02:43.360> across<00:02:45.060> just<00:02:46.060> just<00:02:46.390> one

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
scour pads going across just just one

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.690 
scour pads going across just just one
layer<00:02:46.780> this<00:02:46.990> time<00:02:47.260> not<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:48.100> whole<00:02:48.430> thickness

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
layer this time not a whole thickness

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.810 
layer this time not a whole thickness
and<00:02:49.200> then<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.770> rest<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.070> its<00:02:51.190> foot<00:02:51.430> up<00:02:51.550> again

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
and then the rest of its foot up again

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.540 
and then the rest of its foot up again
with<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.120> pillows<00:02:52.390> own<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.810> way<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.140> top

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
with the pillows own the way to the top

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.130 
with the pillows own the way to the top
actually<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.580> bit<00:02:54.730> more<00:02:54.910> than<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.270> bag<00:02:55.900> and

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
actually a bit more than the bag and

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.840 
actually a bit more than the bag and
then<00:02:56.290> it's<00:02:56.440> compressed<00:02:56.800> down<00:02:56.950> with<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.670> lid

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
then it's compressed down with the lid

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.870 
then it's compressed down with the lid
on<00:02:57.880> too<00:02:58.540> close<00:02:58.770> so<00:02:59.770> it's<00:03:00.340> doing<00:03:00.550> a<00:03:00.610> really

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
on too close so it's doing a really

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.729 
on too close so it's doing a really
really<00:03:01.060> good<00:03:01.239> job<00:03:01.300> just<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.110> few<00:03:02.260> hours<00:03:02.320> of

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
outrunning today the water's cleared up

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.400 
outrunning today the water's cleared up

this one gets means 240 volt power to
this<00:04:23.670> relay<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:25.220> this<00:04:26.220> is<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.490> leader<00:04:26.670> goes

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
this relay and this is the leader goes

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.980 
this relay and this is the leader goes
to<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.240> inverter<00:04:27.710> this<00:04:28.710> one<00:04:28.950> here<00:04:29.720> goes<00:04:30.720> to

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
to the inverter this one here goes to

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.210 
to the inverter this one here goes to
whatever<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.440> is<00:04:31.560> that<00:04:31.740> you<00:04:31.830> want<00:04:31.980> to<00:04:32.040> power

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
whatever it is that you want to power

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.050 
whatever it is that you want to power
and<00:04:33.020> that'll<00:04:34.020> be<00:04:34.110> 240<00:04:34.620> volts<00:04:34.950> straight<00:04:35.820> from

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
and that'll be 240 volts straight from

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.310 
and that'll be 240 volts straight from
the<00:04:36.150> inverter<00:04:36.480> or<00:04:36.770> 240<00:04:37.770> volts<00:04:38.040> from<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.280> mains

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
switch off this and power board here you

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.420 
switch off this and power board here you
hear<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.140> relays<00:05:04.650> switch<00:05:04.950> over<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:07.430> light

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
hear the relays switch over the light

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.780 
hear the relays switch over the light
for<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:08.850> inverter<00:05:09.120> just<00:05:09.390> come<00:05:09.570> on<00:05:09.750> and<00:05:10.790> the

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
for the inverter just come on and the

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.190 
for the inverter just come on and the
air<00:05:11.940> pump<00:05:12.150> should<00:05:12.510> still<00:05:12.810> be<00:05:12.930> running

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.500 

here<00:05:15.830> we<00:05:15.920> go<00:05:16.120> I'll<00:05:17.120> switch<00:05:17.450> it<00:05:17.600> back<00:05:17.780> on<00:05:17.840> again

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
here we go I'll switch it back on again

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.090 
here we go I'll switch it back on again
you<00:05:20.510> hear<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:20.870> relays<00:05:21.200> click<00:05:21.530> and<00:05:21.920> the

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
you hear the relays click and the

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.800 
you hear the relays click and the
inverter<00:05:22.340> should<00:05:22.550> turn<00:05:22.700> off<00:05:25.600> there<00:05:26.600> we<00:05:26.660> go

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
inverter should turn off there we go

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.180 
inverter should turn off there we go
that<00:05:27.350> is<00:05:27.470> off<00:05:29.140> so<00:05:30.140> it's<00:05:30.290> now<00:05:30.440> running<00:05:30.710> from<00:05:30.980> the

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
that is off so it's now running from the

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.530 
that is off so it's now running from the
mains<00:05:31.400> power<00:05:31.670> again<00:05:32.000> and<00:05:32.290> the<00:05:33.290> air<00:05:33.440> pump<00:05:34.540> is

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
mains power again and the air pump is

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.930 
mains power again and the air pump is
running<00:05:38.650> so<00:05:39.650> yeah<00:05:40.070> backup<00:05:40.400> system<00:05:40.760> works

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
running so yeah backup system works

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.460 
running so yeah backup system works
perfectly<00:05:43.390> it<00:05:44.390> doesn't<00:05:44.720> draw<00:05:44.900> anything<00:05:45.140> from

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
perfectly it doesn't draw anything from

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.720 
perfectly it doesn't draw anything from
the<00:05:45.590> battery<00:05:45.920> while<00:05:46.190> it's<00:05:46.370> turned<00:05:46.610> off

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
the battery while it's turned off

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.500 
the battery while it's turned off
because<00:05:47.450> there's<00:05:47.870> no<00:05:47.990> power<00:05:48.230> to<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:48.710> inverter

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
because there's no power to the inverter

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:56.860 
because there's no power to the inverter
see<00:05:50.710> light<00:05:51.710> switches<00:05:52.040> off<00:05:53.140> and<00:05:55.240> yes<00:05:56.240> sir<00:05:56.420> at

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
see light switches off and yes sir at

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.900 
see light switches off and yes sir at
the<00:05:56.960> moment<00:05:57.110> it's<00:05:57.350> running<00:05:57.560> for<00:05:57.710> mains<00:05:57.950> the

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
the moment it's running for mains the

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.460 
the moment it's running for mains the
power<00:05:59.120> goes<00:05:59.330> off<00:05:59.540> it<00:05:59.750> switches<00:05:59.960> to<00:06:00.110> battery

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
power goes off it switches to battery

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.170 
power goes off it switches to battery
power<00:06:00.740> and<00:06:01.780> just<00:06:02.780> with<00:06:02.990> the<00:06:03.670> air<00:06:04.670> pump<00:06:04.700> running

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
power and just with the air pump running

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.060 
power and just with the air pump running
it<00:06:05.900> should<00:06:06.170> run<00:06:06.710> for<00:06:06.890> at<00:06:06.980> least<00:06:07.070> 10<00:06:07.400> hours<00:06:09.070> I'll

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
it should run for at least 10 hours I'll

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.220 
it should run for at least 10 hours I'll
probably<00:06:10.370> connect<00:06:10.850> the<00:06:11.060> water<00:06:11.540> pump<00:06:11.750> up<00:06:11.960> to<00:06:12.140> it

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
probably connect the water pump up to it

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.100 
probably connect the water pump up to it
as<00:06:12.350> well<00:06:12.550> because<00:06:13.550> my<00:06:13.670> powers<00:06:13.880> never<00:06:14.300> never

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
as well because my powers never never

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.480 
as well because my powers never never
normally<00:06:15.470> off<00:06:15.620> to<00:06:15.770> more<00:06:15.950> than<00:06:15.980> a<00:06:16.160> couple<00:06:16.280> of

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
normally off to more than a couple of

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.820 
normally off to more than a couple of
hours
