okay<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:10.019> third<00:00:10.380> step<00:00:10.620> in

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
okay and this is the third step in

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.980 
okay and this is the third step in
creating<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.700> halo<00:00:11.940> level<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.750> step<00:00:12.900> we're

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
creating a halo level in this step we're

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.410 
creating a halo level in this step we're
going<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.139> be<00:00:13.290> creating<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:14.240> geometry<00:00:15.240> that

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
going to be creating the geometry that

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.960 
going to be creating the geometry that
actually<00:00:15.690> makes<00:00:15.870> up<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.109> ground<00:00:16.460> so<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.820> our

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
actually makes up the ground so in our

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.340 
actually makes up the ground so in our
modifier<00:00:18.390> stack<00:00:18.510> we're<00:00:18.840> going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.199> go<00:00:19.320> to

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
modifier stack we're going to go to

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.490 
modifier stack we're going to go to
editable<00:00:20.310> mesh<00:00:20.430> go<00:00:21.420> into<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> face<00:00:21.930> selection

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
editable mesh go into a face selection

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.730 
editable mesh go into a face selection
mode<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.949> make<00:00:23.939> sure<00:00:23.970> ignore<00:00:24.960> back<00:00:25.289> facing<00:00:25.650> is

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
mode and make sure ignore back facing is

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.939 
mode and make sure ignore back facing is
turned<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.960> select<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> two<00:00:28.230> faces<00:00:28.680> that

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
turned on and select the two faces that

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.269 
turned on and select the two faces that
make<00:00:28.980> up<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:30.080> surface<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> level<00:00:31.560> we're

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
make up the surface of the level we're

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.770 
make up the surface of the level we're
going<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.489> want<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.880> create<00:00:33.120> more<00:00:33.360> than<00:00:33.420> two

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
going to want to create more than two

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.310 
going to want to create more than two
faces<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:35.100> we're<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> go<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> tessellate

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
faces so we're going to go to tessellate

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.760 
faces so we're going to go to tessellate
and<00:00:38.059> turn<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.210> down<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.540> zero<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.989> click

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
and turn that down to zero and click

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.040 
and turn that down to zero and click
desolate<00:00:41.190> four<00:00:41.579> times

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.060 

and<00:00:44.170> that's<00:00:44.739> created<00:00:45.160> for<00:00:45.340> us<00:00:45.370> 512<00:00:46.329> faces<00:00:47.070> now

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
and that's created for us 512 faces now

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.760 
and that's created for us 512 faces now
in<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.280> top<00:00:48.430> viewport<00:00:49.440> we're<00:00:50.440> going<00:00:50.559> to<00:00:50.620> want

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
in the top viewport we're going to want

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.630 
in the top viewport we're going to want
to<00:00:50.829> select<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.910> faces<00:00:52.329> that<00:00:52.360> go<00:00:53.309> around<00:00:54.309> the

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
to select the faces that go around the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.270 
to select the faces that go around the
border<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.269> second<00:00:55.690> row<00:00:55.899> in<00:00:56.170> so<00:00:57.129> we're<00:00:57.220> going

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
border the second row in so we're going

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.819 
border the second row in so we're going
to<00:00:57.399> make<00:00:57.820> sure<00:00:57.940> we<00:00:58.090> have<00:00:58.300> our<00:00:58.540> select<00:00:59.290> object

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
to make sure we have our select object

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.640 
to make sure we have our select object
cursor<00:01:00.220> selected<00:01:00.699> if<00:01:00.820> we<00:01:01.420> have<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.170> selected

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
cursor selected if we have the selected

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.899 
cursor selected if we have the selected
move<00:01:02.860> as<00:01:03.250> soon<00:01:03.879> as<00:01:04.030> you<00:01:04.119> grab<00:01:04.300> a<00:01:04.330> hold<00:01:04.570> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
move as soon as you grab a hold and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.640 
move as soon as you grab a hold and
start<00:01:06.909> doing<00:01:07.150> multiple<00:01:07.509> selections<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.229> the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
start doing multiple selections of the

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.399 
start doing multiple selections of the
faces<00:01:09.610> you'll<00:01:10.390> actually<00:01:10.570> start<00:01:10.810> moving<00:01:11.290> them

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
faces you'll actually start moving them

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.469 
faces you'll actually start moving them
so<00:01:11.740> we<00:01:12.070> don't<00:01:12.340> want<00:01:12.550> that<00:01:12.640> we<00:01:12.790> just<00:01:13.090> want<00:01:13.330> our

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
so we don't want that we just want our

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.639 
so we don't want that we just want our
select<00:01:14.110> mode<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.479> so<00:01:16.899> we'll<00:01:17.050> select<00:01:17.289> the

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
select mode and so we'll select the

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.200 
select mode and so we'll select the
second<00:01:18.009> row<00:01:18.130> in<00:01:18.310> by<00:01:18.610> holding<00:01:18.970> down<00:01:19.000> the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
second row in by holding down the

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.780 
second row in by holding down the
control<00:01:19.570> key<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:19.810> clicking<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:20.740> dragging

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.180 

now<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:25.420> we've<00:01:25.540> moved<00:01:26.530> that<00:01:26.650> second<00:01:27.040> row

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
now that we've moved that second row

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.470 
now that we've moved that second row
we'll<00:01:27.880> go<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.330> our<00:01:28.570> move<00:01:28.780> tool

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.920 

and<00:01:33.600> move<00:01:34.350> those<00:01:34.530> mountains<00:01:34.890> up

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.290 

at<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.770> point<00:01:41.010> we<00:01:41.310> want<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.700> add<00:01:41.850> some

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
at this point we want to add some

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.000 
at this point we want to add some
texture<00:01:42.900> to<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.140> mountains<00:01:43.470> we<00:01:43.590> want<00:01:43.800> to<00:01:43.860> give

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
texture to the mountains we want to give

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.880 
texture to the mountains we want to give
it<00:01:44.130> more<00:01:44.910> geometry<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.810> we'll<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.380> randomly

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
it more geometry so we'll just randomly

00:01:46.890 --> 00:02:03.720 
it more geometry so we'll just randomly
select<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:47.580> faces

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.600 

that<00:02:04.300> make<00:02:04.450> up<00:02:04.600> our<00:02:04.720> mountain<00:02:05.430> will<00:02:06.430> go<00:02:06.550> to

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
that make up our mountain will go to

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:15.690 
that make up our mountain will go to
rotate<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.440> we'll<00:02:08.440> just<00:02:08.590> simply<00:02:09.040> rotate

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:27.620 

these<00:02:16.300> faces

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.430 

it's<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> second<00:02:28.890> batch<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.040> them<00:02:29.310> and

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
it's like a second batch of them and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.090 
it's like a second batch of them and
rotate<00:02:31.440> those<00:02:31.590> faces

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.210 

now<00:02:37.610> as<00:02:37.820> you<00:02:37.850> can<00:02:38.090> see<00:02:38.330> we<00:02:39.080> have<00:02:39.220> mountains

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
now as you can see we have mountains

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.430 
now as you can see we have mountains
created<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:41.780> looks<00:02:41.960> pretty<00:02:42.080> good<00:02:42.200> at<00:02:42.410> this

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
created that looks pretty good at this

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.890 
created that looks pretty good at this
point<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:44.030> we<00:02:44.270> are<00:02:44.330> going<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.510> go<00:02:44.630> ahead<00:02:44.720> and

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
point so we are going to go ahead and

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.810 
point so we are going to go ahead and
select<00:02:45.380> all<00:02:45.770> of<00:02:45.920> them<00:02:46.040> faces<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.550> make<00:02:46.580> up

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
select all of them faces that make up

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.820 
select all of them faces that make up
the<00:02:46.940> ground<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.660> do<00:02:48.050> this<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.530> easiest

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830

and give it a material idea of number

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.750 
and give it a material idea of number
two<00:03:03.270> and<00:03:03.740> there<00:03:04.740> it<00:03:04.830> will<00:03:04.920> select<00:03:05.280> all<00:03:05.490> of<00:03:05.610> our

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
two and there it will select all of our

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.830 
two and there it will select all of our
ground<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:08.130> we'll<00:03:08.280> go<00:03:08.400> into<00:03:08.430> uvw<00:03:09.240> mapping<00:03:10.280> and

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
ground and we'll go into uvw mapping and

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.810 
ground and we'll go into uvw mapping and
you'll<00:03:12.840> notice<00:03:13.140> some<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.680> grass<00:03:14.520> has

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
you'll notice some of the grass has

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.490 
you'll notice some of the grass has
actually<00:03:15.210> gone<00:03:15.360> up<00:03:15.570> onto<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.020> hills<00:03:16.230> that's

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
actually gone up onto the hills that's

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.740 
actually gone up onto the hills that's
something<00:03:16.800> that<00:03:16.830> we<00:03:17.010> don't<00:03:17.250> want<00:03:17.570> so<00:03:18.570> we're

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
something that we don't want so we're

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.400 
something that we don't want so we're
actually<00:03:18.930> going<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.530> edit<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.930> put<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:21.960> new

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
actually going to edit a put a new

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.810 
actually going to edit a put a new
object<00:03:22.590> on<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.890> modifier<00:03:23.280> stack<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.700> that

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
object on the modifier stack and that

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:31.070 
object on the modifier stack and that
will<00:03:23.910> be<00:03:24.030> an<00:03:24.210> unwrap<00:03:24.920> UVW<00:03:25.920> map<00:03:29.270> and<00:03:30.270> we'll<00:03:30.930> go

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
will be an unwrap UVW map and we'll go

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.890 
will be an unwrap UVW map and we'll go
ahead<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.320> edit

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.690 

and<00:03:34.989> we're<00:03:35.590> going<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.769> select<00:03:35.950> all<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.459> the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
and we're going to select all of the

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.089 
and we're going to select all of the
vertexes<00:03:37.390> that<00:03:37.629> make<00:03:37.930> up<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.939> mountains<00:03:39.939> and

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
vertexes that make up the mountains and

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.979 
vertexes that make up the mountains and
we're<00:03:42.099> going<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.280> move<00:03:42.519> them<00:03:42.819> to<00:03:43.540> match<00:03:43.750> with

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
we're going to move them to match with

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:53.230 
we're going to move them to match with
the<00:03:44.110> bitmap

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:24.600 

you

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.460 

okay<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:25.820> once<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.180> have<00:04:26.300> successfully<00:04:26.510> gone

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
okay and once you have successfully gone

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.700 
okay and once you have successfully gone
through<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.010> unwrapped<00:04:28.700> that<00:04:28.910> UV<00:04:29.240> w<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:30.590> will

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
through and unwrapped that UV w you will

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.830 
through and unwrapped that UV w you will
just<00:04:30.860> go<00:04:31.040> up<00:04:31.100> to<00:04:31.160> file<00:04:31.760> and<00:04:31.790> we<00:04:32.420> want<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.660> save

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
just go up to file and we want to save

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.900 
just go up to file and we want to save
the<00:04:32.990> file<00:04:33.200> at<00:04:33.380> this<00:04:33.530> point<00:04:33.830> okay<00:04:34.670> and<00:04:34.820> that

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
the file at this point okay and that

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.970 
the file at this point okay and that
does<00:04:35.030> it<00:04:35.150> for<00:04:35.180> step<00:04:35.570> number<00:04:35.600> three<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.260> step

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
does it for step number three and step

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
does it for step number three and step
number<00:04:37.160> 4<00:04:37.400> we're<00:04:37.550> actually<00:04:37.640> going<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:37.940> be

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
number 4 we're actually going to be

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.120 
number 4 we're actually going to be
editing<00:04:38.450> the<00:04:38.720> surface<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.590> makes<00:04:39.830> up<00:04:40.100> the
