00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.120
 the gt academy 2013 was by sony 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.790
 started and that means for us 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.290
 racing fans there is a kind of first 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.690
 outlook on gran turismo 6 because the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.910
 demo based on the new racing game which 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.690
 only in the autumn comes here to compare 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.760
 Let's be brief 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.480
 the menu that it is from gran turismo 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.490
 5 and that was yes say so yourself 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.750
 with updates not exactly perfect forever 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.550
 loading cluttered chaos in gran 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.019
 turismo 6 or just now the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.210
 academy demo is all that 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.890
 clearly tidier though 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.500
 of course, due to the lower 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.030
 content but you can see it that way 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.980
 has learned songs and that it then after 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.770
 front is also on the style here is 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.500
 all a bit cooler and modern 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.000
 not quite so packed with unnecessary 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.940
 stuff in things loading times is the gt 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.329
 academy and thus the motto of the mi6 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.530
 amazingly cool 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.020
 Of course, the whole thing is 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.640
 gigabyte the thing is great too 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.559
 installed on the hard disk yet 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.670
 we hope the finale also plays like that 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.670
 has short loading times 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.880
 here now faced the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.800
 physics and that means of course at 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.630
 granturismo always as realistic as possible 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.340
 we have almost all driving aids here 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.950
 off in both games 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.030
 with both also the same car selected 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.920
 at nissan 370z and same route and 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.680
 You can see it here very well afterwards 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.920
 even better the gran turismo 6 still 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.020
 times significantly more realism offers the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.970
 Cars are just harder and you can 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.040
 you better move around the border here 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.840
 in gran turismo 5 it was often like that 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.340
 that if the box breaks out then 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.710
 he breaks out it was all so one 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.690
 little bit the digital touch what should 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.670
 the car behave one has indeed 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.530
 felt a lot but not as much as 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.300
 Here in Gran Turismo 6 where you really are 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.490
 when drifting in the curves really like that 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.560
 can counter-millimeter accurate 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.210
 slip into the curves as it is clear 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.080
 got better and clearer again 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.090
 step forward 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.190
 this will definitely be one of the big ones 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.190
 things gran turismo 6 1 driving physics top 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.090
 the sound of the engines, too 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.000
 the same car in comparison and there 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.620
 we first thought of gran turismo 6 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.900
 who a bit crisp a bit 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.190
 Dirty still in the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.210
 direct comparison then you realize so big 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.210
 is the difference not 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.710
 The graphic as always very important 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.120
 a racing game and here you can see 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.700
 the shadows in gran turismo were him 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.050
 a problem in the sixth part only sees 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.370
 as if the much better 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.030
 much softer, much cleaner 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.580
 become 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.000
 However, that is not the same everywhere 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.130
 right now here they are us already 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.840
 this podium shadow good it is 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.490
 still a ps3 game and no ps4 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.870
 Still, it would be cool and fun to play 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.380
 could mend a bit until the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.210
 release 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.910
 in general , graphics only has 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.680
 a little bit done, although turismo can 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.510
 6 a little bit at first 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.660
 However, one of the better looks 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.010
 Problems is that on 1080p resolution 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.570
 really jerky currently I hope 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.790
 that is only because of the advance version 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.380
 for very light effects very nice here 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.350
 right pulls by the sun through the trees 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.320
 through the fence , though 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.030
 It's a bit like that too 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.250
 problems if you look closer 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.200
 and of course we did that too 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.000
 And that's especially true of the trees 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.370
 because they have always been so 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.440
 cardboard displays now they are one 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.110
 a bit more chic and modern 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.810
 but it has its own 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.609
 price 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.469
 as you can see here right now are the 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.249
 so rick and hole something 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.019
 is not quite right there 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.159
 that is probably a bit graphic error 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.870
 which hopefully also until the 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.310
 release still fixes 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.319
 to conclude our videos one more 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.090
 little something new silverstone one 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.680
 new courses which are now in gran 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.810
 turismo 6 will be in there 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.280
 actually amazing that 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.120
 tradition course not yet in gran 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.010
 turismo was in it 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.659
 here comes and here we go 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.830
 just with the nissan gt-r that's too 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.110
 the last car what you in the demo 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.760
 can unlock over the course and 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.620
 have to fight because the 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.319
 tasks of the gt academy are quite nice 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.870
 nasty and hard but all the more 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.980
 fun and that will be gran turismo 6 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.980
 when it comes out in the fall
