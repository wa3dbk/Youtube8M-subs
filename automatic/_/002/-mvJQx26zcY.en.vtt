00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.590
 which I am particularly sure that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.680
 A lot of people were expecting a certain 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.359
 time there that adds some beautiful 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.710

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.549
 and upload in intensity of this not in 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.210
 system settings 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.060
 network 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.799
 select the network choose statistics from 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.509

 save with your account balance 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.369
 microsoft now appears in the corner 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.110
 upper right of the xbox to disable 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.780
 the security profile settings of the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.640
 account and choose the option to display the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.979
 money in microsoft's account 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.960
 Good people, what I have to say to you. 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.930
 this update 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.409
 I particularly caught my attention. 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.840
 two is the two points of this update 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.229
 windows information whats it says 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.159
 collected and network statistics 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.520
 I think it's two people. 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.340
 extremely useful, perhaps the second is 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.479
 much do not even think it 's much more useful until 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.790
 for us 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.009
 if this network tactic and shows the 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.390
 download and upload speed and 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.070
 Tested said no matter different 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.439
 to know how our internet is like 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.080
 Is the download progress you are? 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.600
 doing something that was missing a lot 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.760
 xbox 360 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.490
 but without taking the merit of the first option 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.780
 in the case is the first to change 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.610
 it was the hard drive 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.530
 I think it was more expected by us. 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.650
 gamers so mainly because it has 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.580
 a 4 gigabyte model in the case of xbox 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.290
 is the slim 4g of the workshop anyway you can 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.050
 put the hd extends up to 2 terabytes 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.520
 to be able to store your games 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.460
 I think it is one of the great changes that 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.800
 comes to be able to greatly improve our 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.600
 game experience only put one hd 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.790
 also what you want and up to 2 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.890
 terabytes and and save your games by making 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.560
 long will not have more balance the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.080
 Storage space problem does not 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.150
 There is something very good, very cool. 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.720
 even if it comes to help people too much 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.850
 this is how everyone has been another 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.710
 if you did not get calm that soon 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.470
 you will be getting download 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.390
 if you have not downloaded by the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.490
 video games and you can enter 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.280
 on the Microsoft website the support and 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.600
 download this update that will be 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.490
 solving the problem right? 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.500
 but there are people plus a small video 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.090
 comment on the update that 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.370
 really came to be able to 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.320
 much our experience games by 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.210
 cent for those who still have video games or 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.330
 Who 's going to start now? 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.880
 A wonder even you can get away 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.980
 then the pen drives or even the lack of 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.540
 space that entails nÃ© 2 terabytes 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.630
 space, fuck it, it's all taken care of 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.520
 when to format hd as you are saying 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.020
 if you have two gigabytes 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.180
 You will lose that citizen make a 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.640
 backup before you do not want to lose in 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.590
 your hd only after you format it new 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.180
 video game where I hope you have 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.850
 liked the video anything like it 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.950
 said what you found civilization in 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.200
 you would expect species expected 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.580
 I hope that there in the next updates 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.640
 something that I must improve on 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.950
 more on xbox 360 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.680
 but goiÃ¡s feeling no on 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.870
 xbox ask the year 2014 will buy 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.300
 the two again now at the end of the year if 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.200
 God, I want to do a good job 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.850
 Really cool 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.620

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.820
