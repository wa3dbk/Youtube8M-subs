00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.759 
like this really lovely grid pattern
it's<00:03:45.519> got<00:03:45.700> a<00:03:45.730> nice<00:03:46.000> sort<00:03:46.299> of<00:03:46.390> like<00:03:46.570> bow<00:03:47.290> thing

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
it's got a nice sort of like bow thing

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.220 
it's got a nice sort of like bow thing
in<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.010> front<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.580> it<00:03:49.120> cinches<00:03:49.750> in<00:03:50.019> at<00:03:50.140> the

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
in the front and it cinches in at the

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.440 
in the front and it cinches in at the
waist<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:50.790> really<00:03:51.790> underlined<00:03:52.209> like<00:03:52.420> a

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
waist so really underlined like a

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.380 
waist so really underlined like a
feminine<00:03:52.989> sort<00:03:53.799> of<00:03:53.890> waist<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.519> it<00:03:54.940> goes<00:03:55.060> just

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
feminine sort of waist and it goes just

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.509 
feminine sort of waist and it goes just
above<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.750> knee<00:03:56.019> so<00:03:56.680> quite<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.070> good<00:03:57.280> length

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
above the knee so quite a good length

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.789 
above the knee so quite a good length
and<00:03:57.820> again<00:03:58.420> I<00:03:58.600> think<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.989> quality<00:03:59.380> is<00:03:59.410> really

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
and again I think the quality is really

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.979 
and again I think the quality is really
good<00:04:00.070> I<00:04:00.310> think<00:04:00.850> it's<00:04:01.000> gonna<00:04:01.150> be<00:04:01.330> great<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.750> sort

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
good I think it's gonna be great to sort

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.660 
good I think it's gonna be great to sort
of<00:04:02.080> layer<00:04:02.320> up<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:02.830> yeah<00:04:03.010> it's<00:04:03.190> just<00:04:03.340> a<00:04:03.430> really

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
of layer up and yeah it's just a really

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.070
