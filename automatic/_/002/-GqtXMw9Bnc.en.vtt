believe are all the new weapons because

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.420 
believe are all the new weapons because

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
let's start off with the new Wonder

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.970 
let's start off with the new Wonder
weapon<00:00:42.480> shall<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.590> called<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
weapon shall we this is called the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.459 
weapon shall we this is called the
paralyzer<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.120> paralyzer<00:00:45.600> actually<00:00:46.230> has

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
paralyzer the paralyzer actually has

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.590 
paralyzer the paralyzer actually has
unlimited<00:00:46.920> ammo<00:00:47.610> all<00:00:47.820> you've<00:00:48.000> got<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.329> do<00:00:48.450> is

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
unlimited ammo all you've got to do is

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.240 
unlimited ammo all you've got to do is
make<00:00:48.750> sure<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.200> don't<00:00:49.320> overheat<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
make sure that you don't overheat it and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.250 
make sure that you don't overheat it and
you'll<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.489> fine<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.910> use<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.079> can

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
you'll be fine to use it and as you can

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.229 
you'll be fine to use it and as you can
see<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.829> does<00:00:53.070> actually<00:00:53.309> kill<00:00:53.699> them<00:00:53.879> if<00:00:54.059> you

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
see it does actually kill them if you

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.000 
see it does actually kill them if you
hit<00:00:54.600> them<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.110> long<00:00:55.289> enough<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
hit them with it long enough the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.099 
hit them with it long enough the
paralyzer<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.699> also<00:00:57.210> used<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.719> one<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.989> these

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
paralyzer is also used for one of these

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.450 
paralyzer is also used for one of these
steps<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> east<00:00:58.770> break<00:00:59.010> which<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.280> may

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
steps of the east break which I may

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.400 
steps of the east break which I may
cover<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.059> video<00:01:00.300> tomorrow<00:01:00.510> once<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.199> map

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
cover in a video tomorrow once the map

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.680 
cover in a video tomorrow once the map
is<00:01:01.620> officially<00:01:02.129> released<00:01:02.280> I'm<00:01:02.760> pretty<00:01:03.449> sure

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
is officially released I'm pretty sure

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.870 
is officially released I'm pretty sure
it<00:01:03.840> isn't<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.290> actual<00:01:04.799> first<00:01:05.159> step<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
it isn't the actual first step of the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.820 
it isn't the actual first step of the
Easter<00:01:06.240> Egg<00:01:06.360> however<00:01:06.750> I'm<00:01:06.990> certain<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
Easter Egg however I'm certain it is a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.980 
Easter Egg however I'm certain it is a
step<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.310> part<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> easter<00:01:09.240> egg<00:01:09.360> later<00:01:09.689> on

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
step in part of the easter egg later on

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.350 
step in part of the easter egg later on
possibly<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.010> second<00:01:11.430> new<00:01:11.520> weapon<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
possibly the second new weapon is the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.140 
possibly the second new weapon is the
Remington<00:01:13.110> New<00:01:13.470> Model<00:01:13.500> Army<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.030> can

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
Remington New Model Army and as you can

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.179 
Remington New Model Army and as you can
see<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> gameplay<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.320> an<00:01:16.560> incredibly

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
see in the gameplay is an incredibly

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.370 
see in the gameplay is an incredibly
powerful<00:01:17.460> pistol<00:01:18.090> however<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.869> did<00:01:19.049> manage<00:01:19.290> to

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
powerful pistol however we did manage to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.440 
powerful pistol however we did manage to
test<00:01:19.740> how<00:01:19.979> many<00:01:20.189> rounds<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.820> one-hit<00:01:21.210> kill

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
test how many rounds it's a one-hit kill

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.020 
test how many rounds it's a one-hit kill
at<00:01:21.720> however<00:01:22.350> most<00:01:22.830> likely<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.580> very<00:01:23.790> similar

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
at however most likely it's very similar

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.760 
at however most likely it's very similar
to<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.450> Python<00:01:24.960> which<00:01:25.229> we're<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.590> sure<00:01:25.740> if

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
to be Python which we're not sure if

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.080 
to be Python which we're not sure if
it's<00:01:26.040> still<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.280> there<00:01:26.460> zombie<00:01:26.700> map<00:01:26.880> maybe

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
it's still in there zombie map maybe

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.850 
it's still in there zombie map maybe
this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.450> replacing<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.470> see<00:01:28.680> these<00:01:28.829> two

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
this is replacing it but I see these two

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.530 
this is replacing it but I see these two
pistol<00:01:29.340> thing<00:01:29.520> very<00:01:29.700> similar<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.479> can

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
pistol thing very similar but as you can

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.450 
pistol thing very similar but as you can
see<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> gameplay<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> one-hit<00:01:32.189> kill

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
see in the gameplay it is a one-hit kill

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.490 
see in the gameplay it is a one-hit kill
on<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.119> current<00:01:33.390> round<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.780> was<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
on the current round that I was on and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.800 
on the current round that I was on and
we're<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.310> quite<00:01:35.520> sure<00:01:35.579> how<00:01:36.030> many<00:01:36.090> rounds<00:01:36.450> it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
we're not quite sure how many rounds it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.960 
we're not quite sure how many rounds it
may<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.049> more<00:01:37.380> powerful<00:01:37.530> than<00:01:37.829> Python<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.520> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
may be more powerful than Python and it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
awesome when I saw it pop out of the box

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.800 
awesome when I saw it pop out of the box
this<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.430> called<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.000> time<00:01:48.299> bomb<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
this one is called the time bomb and

rewrite history now basically this

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.670 
rewrite history now basically this
device<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.610> really<00:01:57.180> awesome<00:01:57.390> what<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.110> does<00:01:58.380> is

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
device is really awesome what it does is

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.800 
device is really awesome what it does is
literally<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.430> what<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.670> says<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> tin<00:02:00.390> it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
literally and what it says on the tin it

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.260

lets<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.290> go<00:02:01.469> back<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.890> time<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.520> basically

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
lets you go back in time so basically

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420 
lets you go back in time so basically
what<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.750> do<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.320> throw<00:02:04.619> down<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.040> device

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
what you do is throw down the device

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.089 
what you do is throw down the device
anywhere<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.570> map<00:02:06.780> where<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.560> want<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.950> be

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
then going back in time so you lose it

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.100 
then going back in time so you lose it
so<00:03:05.610> I'm<00:03:05.700> assuming<00:03:05.970> this<00:03:06.209> is<00:03:06.360> only<00:03:06.600> going<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.989> be

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
so I'm assuming this is only going to be

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.020 
so I'm assuming this is only going to be
in<00:03:07.200> single-player<00:03:07.590> as<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.700> know<00:03:08.819> there<00:03:09.000> are

with like a ticking noise so maybe we've

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.490

awesome new weapon in black ops two's

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.120 
awesome new weapon in black ops two's
buried<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:46.260> going<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.560> be<00:03:46.680> really<00:03:47.070> useful

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
buried and is going to be really useful

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.160 
buried and is going to be really useful
and<00:03:47.700> what's<00:03:47.880> even<00:03:48.000> better<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.900> fact<00:03:48.930> that

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
and what's even better is the fact that

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.259 
and what's even better is the fact that
you<00:03:49.350> don't<00:03:49.650> lose<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.430> as<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.880> can<00:03:50.970> see<00:03:51.060> when<00:03:51.239> I

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
you don't lose it as you can see when I

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.330 
you don't lose it as you can see when I
fire<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.570> I<00:03:51.750> then<00:03:51.900> have<00:03:52.109> zero<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.950> when<00:03:53.100> we<00:03:53.220> get

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
fire it I then have zero so when we get

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.039 
fire it I then have zero so when we get
an<00:03:53.459> ammo<00:03:53.820> of<00:03:54.030> them<00:03:54.209> probably<00:03:54.510> get<00:03:54.630> another<00:03:54.840> one

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
an ammo of them probably get another one

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.840 
an ammo of them probably get another one
or<00:03:55.350> maybe<00:03:55.680> if<00:03:55.859> it's<00:03:56.040> time-based<00:03:56.549> I'm<00:03:56.730> not

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
or maybe if it's time-based I'm not

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.310 
or maybe if it's time-based I'm not
quite<00:03:57.000> sure<00:03:57.030> because<00:03:57.359> it<00:03:57.600> doesn't<00:03:57.900> count<00:03:58.109> as

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
quite sure because it doesn't count as

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.349 
quite sure because it doesn't count as
like<00:03:58.440> an<00:03:58.560> equipment<00:03:58.920> as<00:03:59.220> one<00:03:59.459> you<00:03:59.609> throw<00:03:59.910> it

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
like an equipment as one you throw it

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.630 
like an equipment as one you throw it
countersign<00:04:01.019> on<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.290> d-pad<00:04:01.709> so<00:04:02.010> maybe<00:04:02.340> you

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
countersign on the d-pad so maybe you

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.220 
countersign on the d-pad so maybe you
get<00:04:02.850> off<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.120> certain<00:04:03.420> number<00:04:03.570> of<00:04:03.720> rounds<00:04:04.109> I

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
get off a certain number of rounds I

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.720 
get off a certain number of rounds I
