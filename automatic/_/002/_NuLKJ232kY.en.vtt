00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
think I like it a little higher and it

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.230 
think I like it a little higher and it
looks<00:02:28.630> rather<00:02:29.500> pretty<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.940> me<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.640> little

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
looks rather pretty to me it is a little

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.360 
looks rather pretty to me it is a little
bit<00:02:34.420> on<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.660> shiny<00:02:34.930> side<00:02:35.260> just<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.950> little<00:02:36.220> bit

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:55.640 
but I think that looks kind of nice with
a<00:02:38.740> dark<00:02:39.190> long<00:02:40.150> dark<00:02:40.510> hair<00:02:40.780> so
