00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.029
 in this video we will study various 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.979
 methods to get the shadows of a 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.280
 prism that we have drawn in perspective 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:12.010
 oblique conical 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.809
 we place the land line on the line 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.450
 of horizon and on the line of 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.869
 horizon we have calculated the points of 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.050
 leakage 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:23.140
 efe efe prima and the metric points mym 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.240
 premium to start drawing the prism 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.970
 we will have to choose any point 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.750
 of the land line and from the directing 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:35.530
 two lines one axis and another f premium if the 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.200
 premium measures 30 x 40 of base we will measure 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.410
 to the left 30 and we will send it to 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.379
 point my to the right 40 and what 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.170
 we will send to point m prime one 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.059
 measured those segments of 30 and 40 in 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.879
 the corresponding lines will trace 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.800
 the base of the prism drawing a line 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.230
 towards efe and another time that premium 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.449
 where it is cut we get the fourth 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.839
 vertex to give height we have to 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.750
 place the farewell of 25 at the point 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.360
 of the bonus that is touching the line of 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.730
 land 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.460
 and then we will draw two lines 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.890
 a f and another f prime to get the 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.110
 side faces we will simply climb 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.320
 two verticals a certain polis and another 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.300
 on the right 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.490
 to close the prism box 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.340
 we will draw a line towards 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.469
 efe and another 100 bonus 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.140
 we now do the first method the 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.969
 stripes parallel to the plane of the frame and with 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.299
 an inclination with respect to the plane 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.770
 general 45 degrees for which 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.929
 we will have to analyze the four 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.670
 vertices of the first box of the 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.850
 top we start with the the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.490
 point to when making the inclined line of 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.310
 45 degrees as the point to premium is 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.750
 touching the earth line his shadow 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.319
 matches them and we now do the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.869
 point p we make a line again 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.700
 inclined by 45 degrees per b and in the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.189
 projection of point b in the plane 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.409
 commercial we make a parallel line to 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:06.179
 the land line that will give us the 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:09.179
 shadows of the face to observe that the 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:12.880
 line is shadow of the bird points to 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.280
 prolong the would match with this bonus 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.300
 we now calculate the point ce by the 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.330
 same parallel procedure 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.580
 to the bright beam 45 degrees and parallel to 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.410
 the land line we observe that the 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.230
 shadow of the shadow spots of the 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.380
 point sees that line by prolonging the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.560
 it would reach point f and we no longer need 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.840
 trace the shadow of the point of position 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.450
 it would be inside the figure and it is not no 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.580
 it would be necessary 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.590
 we would therefore have the image that 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.940
 we are looking at which we have given 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.880
 colors to the face in shadow of the prism 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.520
 we are now studying a second method of 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.550
 shadow that would be when the sun 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.900
 in front of the viewer we place the 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.630
 figure that was the one that we have calculated 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.140
 previously and the point s premium has 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.860
 to be on the horizon line 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.890
 the point s in a vertical to the line 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.960
 from the front above the point of that 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.320
 1st 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.390
 we study first the point to 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.420
 we draw from that a line that passes 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.790
 that's why we prolong it and from that 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.550
 prism we draw a line that passes through 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.380
 the point to projected is point to 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.540
 in the plane geometry that matches 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.510
 the land line until it 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.440
 find the line above 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.650
 it's there we have the shadow point d 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.580
 the vertex below we do what 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.550
 same with the vertex of and we join both 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.830
 points 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.920
 of the union of both points we asked that 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.000
 would come to him if we do the same with the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.390
 point p 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.330
 we would see that the shadow line 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.180
 the bird segment would take us to this 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.630
 premium and so on we would go 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:06.100
 calculating each of the points 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.530
 finally we color the figures 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.660
 there is a more illuminated face because it has 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.300
 the closest sun and another one 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.850
 the third method would be when the sun 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.220
 is behind the viewer we place 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.640
 the point s premium on the line of 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.380
 horizon and the point s in a vertical 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.150
 below the horizon line 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.820
 coinciding a vertical that goes through 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.390
 that prism 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.390
 we study the vertex we unite the vertex 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:38.110
 a with the point says and the projection of 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.900
 vertex on geometry we join it with 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.620
 s raw where is cut we have the point 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.120
 from shadow of the vertex to below 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.000
 we do the same operation with the 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.280
 vertex of we join the vertex of with the 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.200
 point s and the projection of in the 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.600
 flat geometers we join him with s 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.450
 where we cut we have the shadow of the 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.310
 vertex of in the plan in another meter and 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.130
 so we could go on 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.190
 calculating the different points for 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.900
 get the shadows of our figure of 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.770
 way that when coloring what 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.180
 we would see which faces are hidden 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.400
 that is in shadow or illuminated 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.250
 we finally see the method of light 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:24.169
 artificial we assume a sphere to mode 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:26.960
 of lamp post with a staff and in the sphere 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.960
 we draw the light beam that passes 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.810
 by the point and at the base of the staff 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.390
 we draw a line that goes through it 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.820
 the point to projected 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.880
 we perform the same process in the 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.580
 vertex p we draw a line from the 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.490
 sphere of the lamp post let's say towards the 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.560
 point d we extend it and from the base 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.660
 from the lamppost we draw a line that passes 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.060
 by the point of projected on the ground 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.490
 in the plane comes until it is cut 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.830
 the shadow of the bird segment on the 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.750
 central and united plane 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.150
 we see that the extension reaches efe 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.840
 premium just as if it were an edge of the 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.760
 course 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.760
 if we now place the surface 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:18.490
 on our cell phone that by the position 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:21.789
 of the vertex of does not generate the shadow 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.590
 although it follows the vertex as it looks 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.470
 in representation 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.930
 we have painted the shadow on the plane 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.110
 metra the works hopefully and the shadows 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.630
 on the same figure of the prism 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.420
 if you want to see more drawing videos 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:41.020
 I recommend that you enter the 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:45.070
 internet search engines and you think blog 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:50.100
 draw carlo and remember that for 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.100
 learn to draw you have to practice
