longer<00:00:50.460> glowing<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.360> those<00:00:51.480> glowing<00:00:51.719> rocks

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
longer glowing so those glowing rocks

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.720 
longer glowing so those glowing rocks
you<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.620> those<00:00:52.739> YouTube<00:00:53.100> videos<00:00:53.129> are

you see in those YouTube videos are

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.340 
you see in those YouTube videos are
really<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.300> meteorites<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.989> haven't

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
really just meteorites that haven't

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.959 
really just meteorites that haven't
entered<00:00:55.710> dark<00:00:55.980> flight<00:00:56.250> yet<00:00:56.489> once<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
entered dark flight yet once the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.430 
entered dark flight yet once the
brightness<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.449> gone<00:00:57.629> they<00:00:58.050> are<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.379> course

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
brightness is gone they are of course

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.500 
brightness is gone they are of course
much<00:00:58.829> harder<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.190> detect<00:00:59.430> which<00:00:59.969> explains<00:01:00.329> why

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
much harder to detect which explains why

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.869 
much harder to detect which explains why
this<00:01:00.570> video<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> sky<00:01:01.829> diver<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.370> also<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
this video of the sky diver is also the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.789 
this video of the sky diver is also the
first<00:01:03.210> ever<00:01:03.510> recorded<00:01:03.899> footage<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.710> a

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
meteorite in dark flight so not only did

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.050 
meteorite in dark flight so not only did
the<00:01:07.049> sky<00:01:07.229> diver<00:01:07.470> make<00:01:07.740> history<00:01:08.220> by<00:01:08.610> capturing

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the sky diver make history by capturing

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.359 
the sky diver make history by capturing
this<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.390> film<00:01:09.720> he's<00:01:10.350> also<00:01:10.560> probably<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
this on film he's also probably the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.530 
this on film he's also probably the
luckiest<00:01:11.820> guy<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.000> earth<00:01:12.119> right<00:01:12.510> now

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
luckiest guy on earth right now

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.600 
luckiest guy on earth right now
geologists<00:01:13.350> say<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.680> he<00:01:13.830> had<00:01:13.920> jumped<00:01:14.130> even<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
geologists say if he had jumped even a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.340 
geologists say if he had jumped even a
second<00:01:15.180> later<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.659> meteorite<00:01:16.080> would<00:01:16.229> have

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
second later the meteorite would have

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.200 
second later the meteorite would have
almost<00:01:16.590> certainly<00:01:16.860> killed<00:01:17.610> him<00:01:17.790> which<00:01:18.000> got<00:01:18.180> me

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
almost certainly killed him which got me

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.240 
almost certainly killed him which got me
thinking<00:01:18.330> what<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.590> chances<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.009> being

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
thinking what are the chances of being

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.070 
thinking what are the chances of being
hit<00:01:20.460> by<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.640> meteorite<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.330> are<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:21.840> high

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
hit by a meteorite and are they high

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.990 
hit by a meteorite and are they high
enough<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.710> justify<00:01:23.040> me<00:01:23.369> never<00:01:23.610> leaving<00:01:23.939> the
