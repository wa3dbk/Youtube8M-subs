00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
can love Finding Nemo has a solid story

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.510 
can love Finding Nemo has a solid story
and<00:01:45.540> some<00:01:45.720> solid<00:01:46.170> characters<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.920> think<00:01:47.130> this

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and some solid characters I think this

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.370 
and some solid characters I think this
one<00:01:47.700> plays<00:01:47.939> up<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> drama<00:01:48.479> even<00:01:48.810> more<00:01:49.200> than

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
one plays up the drama even more than

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.440 
one plays up the drama even more than
the<00:01:49.470> previous<00:01:49.680> Pixar<00:01:50.369> films<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.000> took<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.270> few

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the previous Pixar films it took a few

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.910 
the previous Pixar films it took a few
more<00:01:51.630> chances<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:52.229> what<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.560> could<00:01:52.680> get<00:01:52.799> away

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
more chances with what it could get away

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.980 
more chances with what it could get away
with<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.700> how<00:01:53.880> serious<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.659> could<00:01:54.810> take

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
with and just how serious it could take

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.959 
with and just how serious it could take
itself<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.680> not<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.219> with<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> characters

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
itself and not just with the characters

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.240 
itself and not just with the characters
I<00:01:57.119> think<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.450> environment<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.590> music<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
I think the environment the music and

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.580 
I think the environment the music and
the<00:01:59.340> colors<00:01:59.729> really<00:02:00.060> play<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> big<00:02:01.110> part<00:02:01.140> in

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the colors really play a big part in

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.350 
the colors really play a big part in
making<00:02:01.829> everything<00:02:02.520> come<00:02:02.729> together<00:02:02.880> from<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
making everything come together from a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.899 
making everything come together from a
dramatic<00:02:03.780> standpoint<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.920> sea<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> very

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
dramatic standpoint the sea is a very
