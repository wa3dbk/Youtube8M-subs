handy<00:02:13.280> for<00:02:13.430> me<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.580> build<00:02:13.819> up<00:02:14.000> those<00:02:14.150> kills<00:02:14.450> and

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.030 
this isn't a little mistake I didn't - I
didn't<00:03:54.980> account<00:03:55.190> for<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:56.440> my<00:03:57.440> little<00:03:57.680> reload

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
didn't account for the my little reload

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.729 
didn't account for the my little reload
having<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.549> prime<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.359> weapon<00:03:59.660> so<00:03:59.900> I<00:04:00.440> jumped

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
having to prime the weapon so I jumped

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.170 
having to prime the weapon so I jumped
out<00:04:00.799> a<00:04:00.859> little<00:04:01.069> bit<00:04:01.250> too<00:04:01.400> soon<00:04:01.639> and<00:04:01.880> that<00:04:02.000> gave

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
out a little bit too soon and that gave

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.469 
out a little bit too soon and that gave
the<00:04:02.450> other<00:04:02.989> guy<00:04:03.019> an<00:04:03.230> advantage<00:04:03.910> so<00:04:04.910> I<00:04:04.940> still

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:05.479 
the other guy an advantage so I still

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.420 
the other guy an advantage so I still
got<00:04:05.600> a<00:04:05.630> lot<00:04:05.750> of<00:04:05.810> napalm<00:04:06.380> strike<00:04:06.620> sucking<00:04:07.130> up<00:04:07.250> so

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
got a lot of napalm strike sucking up so

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.710 
got a lot of napalm strike sucking up so
I<00:04:07.459> dropped<00:04:07.760> my<00:04:07.850> little<00:04:08.000> Claymore<00:04:08.359> down<00:04:08.540> and

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
I dropped my little Claymore down and

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.930 
I dropped my little Claymore down and
hide<00:04:08.840> in<00:04:09.019> this<00:04:09.139> room<00:04:09.350> but

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
hide in this room but

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.460 
hide in this room but
someone<00:04:10.270> sees<00:04:10.540> me<00:04:10.570> through<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.990> window<00:04:11.290> so

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
someone sees me through the window so

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.730 
someone sees me through the window so
that<00:04:12.000> that<00:04:13.000> takes<00:04:13.210> me<00:04:13.330> by<00:04:13.450> surprise<00:04:13.620> look<00:04:14.620> at

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
that that takes me by surprise look at

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.949 
that that takes me by surprise look at
that<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:14.920> claim<00:04:15.160> or<00:04:15.340> just<00:04:15.630> alerts<00:04:16.630> me<00:04:16.810> when

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
that the claim or just alerts me when

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.240 
that the claim or just alerts me when
he's<00:04:17.049> trying<00:04:17.200> to<00:04:17.290> get<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.500> get<00:04:18.010> through<00:04:18.160> the

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
he's trying to get to get through the

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.660 
he's trying to get to get through the
opposite<00:04:18.489> door<00:04:19.019> so<00:04:20.019> I<00:04:20.830> decided<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.519> try<00:04:21.640> and

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
opposite door so I decided to try and

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.490 
opposite door so I decided to try and
find<00:04:21.850> somewhere<00:04:22.120> else<00:04:22.240> but<00:04:22.480> and<00:04:22.960> I'm<00:04:23.230> getting

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
find somewhere else but and I'm getting

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.460 
find somewhere else but and I'm getting
shot<00:04:23.890> in<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.070> process<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:24.910> I<00:04:25.240> think<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.780> decided

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
shot in the process so I think I decided

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.020 
shot in the process so I think I decided
I<00:04:26.590> just<00:04:26.800> did<00:04:26.950> like<00:04:27.370> stuff<00:04:27.670> wait<00:04:27.820> I'll<00:04:27.910> just

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
I just did like stuff wait I'll just

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.010 
I just did like stuff wait I'll just
call<00:04:28.210> them<00:04:28.390> all<00:04:28.480> in<00:04:28.630> at<00:04:28.720> once

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
call them all in at once

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.860 
call them all in at once
unfortunately<00:04:29.890> yeah<00:04:30.690> someone<00:04:31.690> was<00:04:31.810> just

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
unfortunately yeah someone was just

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.540 
unfortunately yeah someone was just
conveniently<00:04:32.500> walking<00:04:32.950> into<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.250> room<00:04:33.400> at

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
conveniently walking into the room at

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.340 
conveniently walking into the room at
the<00:04:33.640> same<00:04:33.790> time<00:04:34.060> so<00:04:34.300> that's<00:04:34.390> another<00:04:34.900> death<00:04:35.170> on

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
the same time so that's another death on

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.990 
the same time so that's another death on
there<00:04:35.560> yeah<00:04:35.860> on<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.160> scoreboard<00:04:36.640> I<00:04:36.820> could

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
there yeah on the scoreboard I could

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.550 
there yeah on the scoreboard I could
have<00:04:37.120> probably<00:04:37.390> avoided<00:04:38.670> so<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:39.910> game's

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
have probably avoided so the game's

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.260 
have probably avoided so the game's
coming<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:41.710> close<00:04:41.860> now<00:04:42.100> I've<00:04:42.220> just

where it was 30 and 5 to 2 to finish the
game<00:05:11.950> like<00:05:12.400> I<00:05:12.430> said<00:05:12.670> there's<00:05:12.820> a<00:05:12.880> couple<00:05:13.180> of

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270

deaths<00:05:13.450> in<00:05:13.690> there<00:05:13.840> that<00:05:13.990> could<00:05:14.110> probably

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
deaths in there that could probably

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.470 
deaths in there that could probably
could<00:05:15.010> have<00:05:15.100> avoided<00:05:15.400> but<00:05:15.730> like<00:05:16.180> so<00:05:16.330> that's

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
could have avoided but like so that's

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.450 
could have avoided but like so that's
the<00:05:16.570> great<00:05:16.750> thing<00:05:16.780> about<00:05:17.050> their<00:05:17.830> sumo<00:05:18.130> you<00:05:18.160> can
