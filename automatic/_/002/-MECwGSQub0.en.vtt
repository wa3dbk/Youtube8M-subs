hi today I'll be teaching you how to
make<00:00:08.430> a<00:00:08.610> point<00:00:08.880> Sanjaya<00:00:09.389> flower<00:00:09.720> out<00:00:09.930> of<00:00:09.990> paper

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
make a point Sanjaya flower out of paper

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.960 
make a point Sanjaya flower out of paper
we'll<00:00:12.210> start<00:00:12.540> with<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> square<00:00:13.080> piece<00:00:13.140> of<00:00:13.380> paper

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:13.970 
we'll start with a square piece of paper

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.730 
we'll start with a square piece of paper
we'll<00:00:14.970> take<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.720> color<00:00:15.960> green<00:00:16.289> for<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
we'll take the color green for the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.160 
we'll take the color green for the
leaves<00:00:17.480> we<00:00:18.480> will<00:00:18.510> fold<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.140> half

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
leaves we will fold it in half

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.520 
leaves we will fold it in half
diagonally

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.359 

and<00:00:27.430> then<00:00:27.580> we<00:00:28.230> turn<00:00:29.230> it<00:00:29.380> over<00:00:29.500> and<00:00:29.920> fold<00:00:30.190> it

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
and then we turn it over and fold it

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.260 
and then we turn it over and fold it
from<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.700> other<00:00:30.850> side

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.190 

now<00:00:35.140> this<00:00:35.590> corner<00:00:36.130> will<00:00:36.820> bring<00:00:37.180> it<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.600> meet

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
now this corner will bring it to meet

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.170 
now this corner will bring it to meet
this<00:00:38.560> point<00:00:38.920> here<00:00:41.700> make<00:00:42.700> a<00:00:42.910> crease

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
this point here make a crease

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.020 
this point here make a crease
we'll<00:00:45.750> fold<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.350> edge<00:00:46.620> again<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.399> meet<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
we'll fold this edge again to meet the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.770 
we'll fold this edge again to meet the
center<00:00:48.390> crease<00:00:48.629> cap<00:00:50.120> now<00:00:51.120> we'll<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.449> same

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
center crease cap now we'll do the same

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:03.090 
center crease cap now we'll do the same
on<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> other<00:00:52.140> side

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.310 

now<00:01:04.100> we're<00:01:04.250> going<00:01:04.400> to<00:01:04.520> bring<00:01:04.699> in<00:01:05.020> this<00:01:06.020> right

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
now we're going to bring in this right

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.540 
now we're going to bring in this right
side<00:01:06.710> over<00:01:07.370> to<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.790> left<00:01:08.560> so<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:09.590> this<00:01:10.070> point

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
side over to the left so that this point

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:18.109 
side over to the left so that this point
needs<00:01:11.510> this<00:01:12.010> centerline

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.480 

just<00:01:19.119> make<00:01:19.330> a<00:01:19.600> light<00:01:19.869> crease<00:01:20.320> so<00:01:20.710> that<00:01:20.740> we<00:01:21.280> just

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
just make a light crease so that we just

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.370 
just make a light crease so that we just
get<00:01:21.880> a<00:01:22.210> very<00:01:22.900> light<00:01:23.320> line<00:01:23.799> here<00:01:25.080> I'll<00:01:26.080> tell<00:01:26.260> you

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
get a very light line here I'll tell you

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.670 
get a very light line here I'll tell you
that<00:01:26.560> later<00:01:26.680> why<00:01:27.100> we<00:01:27.340> need<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.640> do<00:01:27.760> that<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:29.530> do

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
that later why we need to do that we do

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.030 
that later why we need to do that we do
the<00:01:29.830> same<00:01:30.070> for<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.520> right<00:01:30.850> side<00:01:31.860> now<00:01:32.860> we're

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
the same for the right side now we're

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.200 
the same for the right side now we're
going<00:01:33.159> to<00:01:33.220> make<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.520> crease<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.890> way<00:01:36.159> so<00:01:37.149> I'm

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
going to make a crease this way so I'm

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.469 
going to make a crease this way so I'm
starting<00:01:37.659> from<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:37.990> point<00:01:38.320> till<00:01:38.740> here<00:01:39.479> fold

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
starting from this point till here fold

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.630 
starting from this point till here fold
this<00:01:40.720> down

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.800 

and<00:01:45.480> now<00:01:45.690> using<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:47.100> point<00:01:47.630> we're<00:01:48.630> gonna

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and now using this point we're gonna

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:59.140 
and now using this point we're gonna
fold<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.740> down<00:01:50.550> again

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.720 

you<00:02:00.150> can<00:02:00.300> adjust<00:02:00.510> this<00:02:00.900> so<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.260> you<00:02:01.380> get<00:02:01.730> even

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
you can adjust this so that you get even

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.320 
you can adjust this so that you get even
leaves<00:02:02.970> on<00:02:03.180> either<00:02:03.390> side<00:02:04.700> now<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.760> need<00:02:06.120> to

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
leaves on either side now we need to

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.850 
leaves on either side now we need to
make<00:02:06.540> two<00:02:06.960> more<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.470> this<00:02:07.740> kind<00:02:09.619> which<00:02:10.619> I've

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
make two more of this kind which I've

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.080
