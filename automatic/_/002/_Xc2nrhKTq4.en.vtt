lever there is two cup of contact this
is<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.450> drum<00:01:36.660> chip<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.860> are<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.490> use

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
is the drum chip and we are going to use

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:54.550 
is the drum chip and we are going to use
this<00:01:39.330> chip<00:01:39.690> to<00:01:39.899> cover<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:45.200> firstly<00:01:46.250> peel<00:01:47.250> it

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:03.230 

and<00:01:55.560> stick<00:01:56.340> it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.240 

it's<00:02:04.240> done<00:02:04.450> it<00:02:05.320> shouldn't<00:02:05.740> take<00:02:05.799> more<00:02:06.189> than

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
it's done it shouldn't take more than

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.180 
it's done it shouldn't take more than
one<00:02:06.609> minute<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.319> can<00:02:08.530> put<00:02:08.739> this<00:02:08.920> drawn

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
one minute and you can put this drawn

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:20.869 
one minute and you can put this drawn
unit<00:02:09.429> cap<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.989> switch<00:02:13.989> on<00:02:14.230> your<00:02:14.379> back

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.120 

so<00:02:21.879> trunk<00:02:22.180> count<00:02:22.420> will<00:02:22.629> be<00:02:22.810> with<00:02:22.959> that

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
so trunk count will be with that

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.080 
so trunk count will be with that
it<00:02:24.730> will<00:02:25.150> take<00:02:25.420> longer<00:02:25.900> than<00:02:26.830> usual<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.580> photo

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
it will take longer than usual the photo

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.750 
it will take longer than usual the photo
procedure<00:02:28.800> because<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.070> resetting<00:02:30.640> the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
procedure because it is resetting the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.880 
procedure because it is resetting the
count<00:02:31.000> at<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.330> moment

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
count at the moment

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.340 
count at the moment
once<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.100> count<00:02:33.310> reset<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.790> done<00:02:34.060> then<00:02:34.750> I<00:02:35.020> will

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
once the count reset is done then I will

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.290 
once the count reset is done then I will
print<00:02:35.680> out<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.160> supplies<00:02:36.520> information<00:02:37.120> page

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
print out the supplies information page

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.600 
print out the supplies information page
again<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.810> show<00:02:38.020> you<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:39.040> if<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.310> rosetta

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
now the drum reset is done and I'm going

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.280 
now the drum reset is done and I'm going
to<00:04:19.770> print<00:04:20.160> out<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.790> status<00:04:21.210> pages<00:04:21.660> by<00:04:21.840> holding

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
okay now you can see the sky on drum

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.460 
okay now you can see the sky on drum
unit<00:04:52.390> live<00:04:52.720> least<00:04:53.140> 99%<00:04:53.800> it<00:04:54.550> was<00:04:54.730> 93%<00:04:55.270> before<00:04:55.960> so

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
unit live least 99% it was 93% before so

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.580 
unit live least 99% it was 93% before so
