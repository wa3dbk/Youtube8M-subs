00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 be very attentive because later 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.000
 we will have a very rich recipe for how 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.000
 make some mobile 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:15.450
 for you but well let's talk 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.670
 now what was said about the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.890
 transgenic foods and the method 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.430
 used to achieve better products 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.619
 quality 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.930
 well they talk about having disadvantages 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.330
 others of which no and good of these 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.849
 disadvantages have these products 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.059
 genetically modified can reach 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.800
 to affect our health how to avoid them 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.690
 then in the next note we are going 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.690
 to expand more on this topic 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.370
 the transgenics are those foods 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.470
 to which genes of 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.690
 other plants or animals in their codes 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.000
 genetic resources to obtain species of 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.559
 most desirable features some of 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.989
 the benefits attributed to the 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.300
 transgenic are in theory more food 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.940
 nutritious foods more appetizing 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.430
 resistant plants decrease in the 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.410
 use of faster growing pesticides 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.510
 obtaining medicinal products that 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.670
 they could be used as vaccines or other 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.560
 medications however some 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.290
 experts do not recommend their consumption 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.440
 several studies claim that those from 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.229
 the nutritional side of food 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.320
 GMOs have a great relationship 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.780
 with some types of cancer problems 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.830
 gastrointestinal intolerances 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.690
 greater allergies of toxins than if 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.110
 it is stated that this is going to see 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.270
 mid let's say long-term there 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.130
 the importance of reading the labels that 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.170
 now they are already included in our in 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.390
 our medium transgenic foods the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.729
 most known is soy 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.260
 is if it is known that soybeans 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.530
 introduced in our country is a food 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.540
 it is a transgenic soybean then for 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.790
 who want to avoid the consumption of 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.830
 these foods I the first thing that 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.590
 I recommend is to inform us a little more 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.780
 have a greater criterion that is that 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.910
 we should and should avoid if there are older 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.619
 studies that have been done now and 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.080
 for whom we should want to avoid 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.789
 Transgenic foods I recommend reading 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.280
 the labels that is very important 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.530
 especially if they contain food 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.690
 derived from soybeans and for those who 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.310
 they want to opt for the natural insurance 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.370
 This type of food does not meet the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.370
 Requirements
