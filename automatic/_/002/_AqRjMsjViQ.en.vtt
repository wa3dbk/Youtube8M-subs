00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.920
 meanwhile relaxed about it 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.779
 Clock 

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:13.029
 to the complex coat 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.169
 ignorant does not care 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:16.480
 we will be ready 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.900
 A strict instructions will get you well 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.900
 what is healthy because that's what you do with your wife 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.980
 it's about the basics 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.230
 what fashion-conscious eighth thing is important that it is not important no 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.990
 I can reasonably say it 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.070
 if that's not aluminum foil Machnig the ball goes he only sat Schmitt all that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.030
 Heavy cooked and cooked female like grilled and that's what it's all about -wort 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.100
 we have a typical one 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.430
 Consolation everywhere, we buy discounters for the hitzig gut of me 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.110
 I talked to the butcher and work gives something 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.150
 behind it 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.060
 how do you consciously get why place that 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.690
 The key is there is such a Voest Cutter 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.950
 that means big meat quantities are crushed to witch and become too 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.230
 Sausages processed but with this bus cutter creates heat because fast 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.020
 turning is Axelrod 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.320
 then they have to 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.880
 Mass operations 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.570
 1 who knew z 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.360
 1 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.110
 and since they trust the amount of fluid racers the square way backlash and 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.780
 so unfavorable exactly that is a hip we are looking for in terms of premium 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.590
 foods 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.670
 we want good things on the grill 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.570
 Should I have a product from the butchery outside in the Fichtelgebirge 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.700
 very tasty 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.510
 which he takes care that no glutamate no preservatives or what 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.030
 otherwise no ice cream will come very much to just natural products 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.030
 I think we should be eating food again and like West 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.300
 Sundern today's topic healthy percent 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.610
 we invited our expert 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.900
 I question myself 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.260
 Can I still eat that? 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.339
 he announces his international match 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:11.779
 lighter 4 equals a rent and 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.779
 So right and percent it's not just 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.369
 Underworld but also not tasty 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:20.649
 but 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.599
 if I did not invite that 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.629
 during the nights 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.350
 especially if it's a personal favorite track, for example 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.880
 good opportunity in a on by Monaco wants there's the equipment too 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.200
 on 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.709
 that pleases the expansion 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.230
 Handelfmeter participant 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.569
 that he was there 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.319
 the traffic of Bavaria 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.859
 Matching 5 percent of exercise football will be regional 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:42.390
 societies 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.019
 You can not do that 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.949
 if there is no other way 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:49.499
 Tack Tack Tack Tack Possibility to also allow for the meeting 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:51.619
 the places moved VK Fr 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:56.859
 a Mass Effect austerity package is Galenica percent or even many i 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.539
 dapd if that does not meet 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.469
 and if I change something now 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.469
 His defense was enough for the judge 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:05.139
 Years pass 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.889
 so also those who were dispatched simply changed powerfully 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.849
 whether the comment is unlocked Wenger inflame 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.809
 the fatal correspond in oxygen 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.619
 and there I have around 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:20.629
 but that changes 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.639
 I am thankful that you have named the last two alternatives 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.639
 «And if we then question if the other was worth it 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.899
 Now that the practice I'm looking forward to something very special conflict and sausage 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:36.359
 I have never had food 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.449
 Austria's highest time 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.079
 you would like to have two of them natural and two of them 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.319
 Convert mass products once I convert 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.279
 Button «I'm doing this here 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.699
 a Ubert Resse he a 3 50 meters 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.699
 Not everyone is beautiful, we're talking 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.999
 and also take nice SCO coma 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:00.469
 in action there is something that is not the stuff you have in my here 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:01.949
 Cupboard has stood 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.359
 but good we have the NRZ Razor 13 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.709
 what we do not always bread in the classical one 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.429
 test before with 1 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:14.000
 but this is just cheering on hot summer days like today 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.429
 very refreshing 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:17.989
 I mix everything just by 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.870
 who does not work we have 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.870
 that fits we also have a sign so it's very special 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.849
 lemongrass 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.849
 that also gives business fresh 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.490
 so 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.809
 that is not reasonable 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:41.419
 until after lemon browser 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.740
 but now we are doing without it 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.740
 and have the perfect mix for our sausages 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.490
 Let's be wonderful world here 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.669
 and per share and have a very nice 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.240
 because of coat 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.770
 lifepr eu-countries now the time has come 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.669
 the sausage comes on the grill 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:08.020
 we have our natural corn / ferry place, Hawkins is on one 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.029
 Paintings which have ways to make winners full of heat 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:12.960
 It's just time to lead three 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.809
 I packed again 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:18.409
 looking for the veins sausages 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.520
 as a comparison neutral 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.800
 and in the beige coat 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.800
 if we are allowed to enjoy it right away 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.219
 a little patience 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:31.520
 Lowered bleacher 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.699
 Erfurt so here we have an intermediate state I have to say at 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.420
 the complex was he must be extremely careful 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.300
 not easy to use the user percent and not too early for that 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.319
 Music Festival St St 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:48.659
 but still as it is from the outside it was summer sausage 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.120
 which also makes good work 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:01.669
 to taste with 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.789
 Dr 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:06.569
 also perfect 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:07.689
 the Frankfurt Opera
