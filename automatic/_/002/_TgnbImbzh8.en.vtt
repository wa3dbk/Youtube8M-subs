00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.130
 this rise of 5% these little ones in the ears it is unfortunate but that makes 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.579
 smile and ukraine on all these waterholes 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.479
 especially regional pull-flank we will all play and hello to all these 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:17.949
 women who sparkle 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.999
 I was shy in his head sparkling in his eyes and so his life and 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.980
 today he will dance and valette disguise himself 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.930
 with us 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.930
 To our delight 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.509
 the incidences of death 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.910
 no one answered the bar at the same time it's normal people there 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.870
 so 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.200
 we evacuate this gesture elsewhere it's a fight of friends jazz guard 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.520
 three farm for a little bit 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.390
 the man has already looked and we will already looked if you want 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.450
 a little turn around the city the playlist and it goes wrong 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.270
 so for you it becomes clear that I have cut the floor 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.700
 to the typhoon victims 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.510
 future want to do it I'm sorry for it's edited and 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.140
 developed by google without excess of retinas game 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.480
 it was released on November 26 revised figure of + 0 37 euro 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.500
 for 100 e for me that cost me I do not know I think star wars I 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.299
 I'll try it I do not think it's too much too bad 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.689
 at last good to cream explained then I'm sad that it takes more than 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.480
 I did not know what to expect 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.430
 I will not try just before 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.260
 paris re cheated and he has the secret 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.060
 cj access to the inheritance do not believe it 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.020
 I had a nice surprise actually by discovering the playlist because even 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.470
 if currently followed but about thirty pieces they are rather 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.390
 well chosen 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.450
 and actually no but it's true that there is a way to win an evening we are rather 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.740
 friendly - and serious with the Netherlands lilac aruba is not bad at all 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.320
 the same yes 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.590
 the message has gone eclectic 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.590
 and sympathetic there was a dangerous escalation 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.109
 so frankly we can not stop the first good surprise the voice of the north 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:50.100
 speeches to deeds going through the insurer for a bit of everything in fact 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.100
 now what are the targets in what form ford genk 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.600
 and champagne 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.140
 we exchanged such blackmail if you're doing an endorsement to a 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.360
 little point behind datsyuk have helped some kind of directory i'm going to play 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.549
 against you as you want 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.940
 you have to produce only on the boards 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.729
 barack obama full board 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:20.169
 a meeting 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.799
 what has a lot of changes in a hat not on a very good 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.889
 center towards happens happened to the force 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:28.969
 Thursday is supersonic where she denounces a bonus after a head 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:33.269
 of ram when in fact art for now a little room for hope 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.839
 so percent actually 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:36.269
 you just have to breed 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.269
 the movement the other is doing in their complaint 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.919
 agree in another place it is rather 2% a year before leighton 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:45.919
 must admit that we are sitting as behind 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.849
 like not very serious people 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.230
 was supposed to reproduce the same movement I absolutely do not arrive 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.029
 no more 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:54.150
 okay for the highest authority in the country 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.379
 for delay in this area 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.179
 nothing was done 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.629
 I'll try to do their job and that's something you play at 4 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.829
 up to four 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.829
 they have to start beating up a committee that can be 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.399
 the principle is simple take the road 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:15.259
 for those who do not see 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:17.479
 is this normal in a context 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.109
 he was able 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.540
 while we hold the wiimote in the right hand we tried to reproduce 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.269
 - the choreographies for the choreographies are nice 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:31.309
 so there's no way to see all the cards in your left hand 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:33.769
 I bring my agreement it's part of the problems 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.769
 it's not done anything you have to do a little sulky movements for whom the 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:37.649
 hate 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:40.659
 yes really it is rather the timing of the movements that will start sooner than 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.129
 the real question to which I will do what it is not compatible they 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.049
 no longer are the blue or the red side under rock daily press 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.169
 these employ in a sense of rhythm pretty much like 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.949
 e as a Spanish cow what did not tell me malouda 6 baskets at the 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.029
 little touch of sobriety me I think 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:00.209
 we are good boat passing by explained that in front of the apple iphone 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.729
 alleluia 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:04.429
 so everything they say is true that it collapses you realize that in 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:08.069
 makes 10% of a month motion detection 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.630
 and not necessarily forever 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.989
 super great party launched by m 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.920
 to mark what the prince does not go to just 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.489
 the poem the genome is to be won now in the united states aaron hill and 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.079
 then it's the stuff of phew 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.079
 so go on to tell you a title 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.180
 mike falls are simply for mexico tak have admitted the advanced 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.449
 in the lead is like a mirror in the head is supposed to govern release 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:31.210
 so I went 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.350
 he believes that another song that would count what these same homework 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.300
 we can not really 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.300
 a lot of things for one at the afp but it's good for that no 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:43.740
 pity four years later small mixture a little more about him 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.029
 so we did not see Mandelieu any more before sending it 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:51.790
 for 100 euros more to show that the click was represented 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.790
 but these health reasons it is to be excluded from the woman was snatched 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.610
 they are also a sonar is very popular with actors 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.919
 while in others 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.270
 stÃ©phane vigneault who still seems 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.430
 m6 comes first for the hard law, but he does not operate 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.650
 no more Thursday asia just to see anyway 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.470
 just go go veil it's an hour drive from my team us 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.520
 said they would not tell me to the happy it's always good 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.759
 musical tubes and fermentation also counts 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:18.830
 then short version 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.479
 we are democratic about the countries that took 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.479
 that's what I write the true blood that's attention 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.349
 so when we're ready it's gone 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.279
 and we see the little lady who does not know 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:32.159
 and also this device which 407 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.110
 montespan 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.009
 niblock week club life bernstein is a fake fake it will take a little there 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:41.680
 there is only one step alas we are it's very good and they did what they 

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:43.220
 intend to grant access to this leave 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.550
 there can be a little table and do things like that we thought 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.550
 very manly also a surprising choice 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.819
 the fault midway which is very very good 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.939
 so it's true that at the detection level and provides some small worries 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.770
 but what is very very good is already not moving your body 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.090
 It went very well 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.699
 I feel we can put a cartridge moment amauta care add to the 25% 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.980
 euros already you move your body you lose calories that's not bad 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.389
 and maybe I can learn to dance 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.419
 - yes well I do not know what I would not like is not pathogenic in his 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:18.449
 meetings to do anything but also what it is 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:19.439
 true choreographic 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.489
 for the moment the little moment of the final packaging are not necessarily 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:26.199
 and if the cdp choreography so it's not either to 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:28.889
 the hardest thing is not anything in fact 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.830
 it corresponds to the song each time 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.280
 we must recognize that in this room they did choreographies 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.960
 which perfectly matches the music 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.150
 m I say that when we ensured the catch a free site that fails 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.330
 we accompany each time 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.710
 article 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.309
 do not say anything 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:49.709
 and on the menu a good playlist hendricks world moves we could really because 

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:53.290
 what to dance is true if we can maybe learn a few steps 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.850
 why by the biggest chance for us parents who are really 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.790
 no war about 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.719
 swimming 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:02.229
 the disco dance 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:04.909
 you are the mobile disco when you were young runner 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:08.069
 you see two weeks with these Roma sintis exactly it's a job that 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:10.669
 have given in to instincts and I do not want to know anything I do not want to know anything 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:13.289
 on the busy dsk and all curly access 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:17.919
 she is honest for a moderate but one thing is sure a rhythm game 2 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.310
 I think that if it is killing each other, he will not hold back if he 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.460
 must read it 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.280
 to let go I say I must let go after these past months 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.699
 in the evening if it may interest to conceive of it with the help of 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:33.639
 your titles are going to be honest okay for the future go 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:34.430
 it's gone
