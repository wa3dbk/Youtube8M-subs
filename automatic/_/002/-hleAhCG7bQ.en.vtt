00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.630
 help is pleased that we say 3d half too 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.700
 micro application in this church 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.530
 and we will do a second lesson 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.330
 not how are we going to follow the chronology 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.119
 before the arrival at the jogging ass 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.800
 ie to the esc white reindeer 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.869
 on your pc and that's still very 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.010
 very well laurent know how that 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:32.120
 also seems to know so essential to me 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:35.190
 against adel so we will do the driving 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:39.750
 improving conditions 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:45.960
 particular to maybe more often 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:48.539
 on the duration ok it's gone 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.789
 on the other hand for traffic in sense 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.530
 reverse to the glory night game I 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.090
 found the rivers day and company 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.539
 at the risk of skidding you can 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.539
 advanced 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.640
 funny wrote by a button 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.030
 control-command my kids behind 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.180
 so it's not that it 's definitely going 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:12.860
 able to go back to modeling in 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.880
 hoping you noted his exit I 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.980
 will start you educate last 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.270
 times what's the game on one side the side 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.450
 he's going to consider a left-wing film 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.590
 there must be that they move through 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.150
 default is to say that when there is 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.070
 a single voice that tell me that the actress 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.040
 of gossip is you the city ​​where the 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.450
 cars certainly in fact they think themselves 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.100
 that the program will not have preterite 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.750
 highways in this taste 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.270
 cars always drive left 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.510
 this is an aberration what is 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.510
 I will do 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.070
 this is repeated to shackle instructions I 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.250
 guess it's possible 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.450
 Crémant enough food market 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.100
 easy to do crimes want to 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:55.780
 nothing because in i'm ready people 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:58.550
 who complain about niches okay 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.740
 here is nothing to do obviously it's 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.080
 to sanction this is normal we found 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.460
 that behind you see the helicopters 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.570
 jérôme hegeled version dvd taken any 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.610
 advanced put the pressure of the day before 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:15.610
 in obama is really not talk about 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.890
 we go straight ahead 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.270
 yeah these people are coming back from small 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:44.560
 kind of little mistakes we forget 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:46.150
 rather quickly project a direct control 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.430
 even if you do not look at lestiac 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.770
 governance and the auxerrois dress themselves 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.860
 against this is this instance in 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.500
 realistic with returns but I think that 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.440
 if there really are people who would be 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.360
 motivated for how to say for 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.090
 program to a realistic savior I 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.120
 think it would go to make a 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.800
 reference in the problem is that 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.370
 service to the cure is coming 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.870
 compete with self schools and people 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.400
 who spend 40 and the free is 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.410
 possible because the child was going to you 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.970
 inscribe 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.410
 the only fault is clear deadlines and 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.940
 that we can not pass the permit 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.210
 everything did not seem to be 38 years old for 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.020
 him to go to trial for offense all 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.230

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.790
 1st accident 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.170
 I think it's the first time 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:49.640

 the challenges of management at 51 52 54 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:06.980
 there is even 75 by sub but it's 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:14.620
 well it takes the driver game to another 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.620
 thing but left 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.570
 finally be careful with this tuesday 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.670

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.720
 the advised sending to perform the left 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.720
