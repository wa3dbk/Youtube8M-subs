 hello to all water followers repairs 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.120
 in this new video I want to show you fine the washing machine 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.430
 specifically to check whether the brushes of that engine that are 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.049
 married or not 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.490
 in this case in particular the entire shipowner Galician model 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.339
 the problem of biofuel to promising mobile crashes a strong failure of 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.119
 brushes engine failure plate failure 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.839
 I proceeded to disassemble the engine tdi good let's check now yes the 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.079
 brushes are crushed 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.079
 to disassemble them simply from the bread 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.920
 we access the two screws that lead to the side of their meals 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.460
 we remove the clients get 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
 avda 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 we drive the first 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.990
 this first one that initially seems to be fine because we see that it has a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.070
 certain length 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.070
 let's proceed against the osasuna 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.329
 we will not get that the average of these second quotes 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.430
 is smaller than the first 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.390
 we remove your ashton miss 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.390
 with a small piece they were armed 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.150
 yolanda fuentes y las familias 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.500
 as you see these blanket is totally food 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.620
 one of the references that tells us that it is totally eaten before 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.619
 first the measure 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.589
 if we introduce the collas to the bottom 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:21.299
 we see that all this measure is missing 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.120
 the second thing is that in the reference of the blankets we already know poking around here 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.329
 which would be in this case 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.579
 the 94 mf 7 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.819
 it would be the model that we would have to do with going to the store to 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.509
 buy spare 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:39.439
 The most important challenge is that if we compare old helmet the ounce 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.849
 we will see what one 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:53.509
 the bright coal 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.269
 as a secret of this band 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.509
 and the other coal is copaco 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:59.959
 what it tells us 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.299
 that is not making good contact 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.779
 comparing it with author we see that totally 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:08.779
 there is one that is totally comical 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:14.579
 and only so the opposite then go with the quotes and its little 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.419
 brushes as we see in the picture 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.930
 directly to the store seeks replacement always providing the model of the 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:22.159
 washing machine 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.159
 and that is possible if we have a preference as in this case 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.659
 we want it to benefit 94 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:34.689
 I hope you liked the castle as a link for the next few 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.619
 stockings you have at home 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:40.019
 greetings and I hope you continue and visit the web on your part mexico
