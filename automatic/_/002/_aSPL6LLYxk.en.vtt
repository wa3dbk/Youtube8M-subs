00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.430
 two 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.570
 that we lose as they were welcome to 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.639
 another one of my videos 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.070
 I am marine and like every Monday 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.740
 I bring a new video and today the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.020
 I'm really fascinated because I bring a 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.510
 recipe and at the same time a craft 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.329
 and let me tell you that as 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.520
 says in the title of this video we are going to 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.040
 make a pot of coke and the truth 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.950
 It is very very beautiful but above all 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.680
 delicious and will save you most 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.500
 our table or a small table of sweets 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.720
 verb no I do not want to do so much 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.150
 boast and be explaining better if 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.910
 you want to learn how to do this 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.520
 pot of cupcakes better think to see a 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.220
 video to prepare the cupcakes 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.130
 first what we are going to do this 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.990
 I personally do not use this 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.700
 cake box of those that already sell 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.100
 in the super because I want to focus on 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.410
 the decoration then what are we going to 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.150
 do then simply follow the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.189
 instructions that suggest the box 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.860
 to prepare this cake that 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.499
 we need with a bowl later 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.390
 we will also need three eggs 

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:14.220
 that are preferably art 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.320
 All environment height that is tempted 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.050
 per environment half a cup of oil 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.420
 vegetable and finally a cup of water 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.550
 that I am substituting for milk 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.800
 because I think the truth is more 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.260
 rich the pies but good can 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.390
 use water later we go to 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.580
 mix all these ingredients to 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.090
 that we have a very smooth consistency 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.280
 like this one and we're going to start putting this 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.729
 mix in the k corridors and in our 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.770
 molds for cupcake and it is very important 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.930
 that you are not going to fill it up 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.940
 the stop but in the middle because as you 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.610
 let's put some bit of bitumen not 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.310
 we want it to slip all that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.020
 so since we have our cupcakes 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.590
 ready let's put it in the oven 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.250
 pre-heated to 180 degrees 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.560
 15 to 20 minutes to assemble and decorate the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.050
 pot what we need is 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.550
 first a ball of unicel as 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.030
 is that I am using it in the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.290
 number 13 we will also occupy a pot 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.010
 of unicel that I have 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.799
 I show you we are going to also occupy a 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.780
 brush I have this thick but if 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.689
 you do not have to take the one you have to 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.840
 the hand will also occupy painting 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.640
 acrylic if you wish so 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.730
 to occupy a mold he cited and finally 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.129
 green paper because 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.439
 let's decorate it let's add 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.239
 our painting in a written mold and 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.730
 let's start painting all our 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.389
 pot and it is very important that we stay 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.670
 well painted are going to need between 2 to 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:51.310
 3 layers more or less so that it is very 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.739
 well painted and well I the truth nothing 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.200
 most need two layers because it looks very 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.599
 very well the lid perfectly to the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.519
 second layer and good with our paper 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.500
 from China what we are going to do is that what 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.799
 we are going to cut into strips because they are going to 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.180
 simulate the leaves of the roses we're going 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.400
 to do with cupcakes and we're going to need 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.829
 many strips but we are going to put them 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.900
 side to prepare now the bitumen of 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.700
 butter we will occupy 90 grams of 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.409
 butter and let's go to the 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.699
 half 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.319
 later we will split half of the 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:23.049
 half because we only occupy 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.319
 the parties and we're going to do them in a 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.999
 bowl and the other one we are not going to occupy 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.980
 let's start to beat the butter 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:32.650
 that is also at room temperature 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.019
 to start smoothing the and 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.620
 later we are going to add a 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.620
 soup spoon 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.780
 vanilla and we're going to add it to 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.910
 preference do not stop beating but good 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.080
 I could not so keep beating and 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.360
 let's incorporate all the 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.700
 ingredients we are going to occupy also 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.680
 half philadelphia cheese bar here 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.950
 you can see that he adds all but really 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.990
 just buy half of cheese and let's go 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.050
 keep beating until they join 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.540
 these ingredients and finally we are going to 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.930
 occupy 2 cups of icing sugar that 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.080
 we will be putting a little bit in little 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.390
 until it's 2 cups and well let's go 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.040
 to do the color now let's give it 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.410
 color to our arturo that I'm 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.290
 using red dye because what 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.870
 I want a soft pink color of 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.180
 color of the pot we made and occupy 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.610
 around about 20 drops so you do not 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.010
 be neither too pink nor red or anything like that 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.140
 but that we have a nice color or 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.210
 well I liked this color we are going to 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.880
 empty the mixture either in a sleeve 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.060
 pastry 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.230
 in these molds milestones that I have and if 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.060
 you do not have this, you do not know 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.550
 worry up a bag can 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.070
 use and well let's start from 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.500
 center outward I truthfully 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.320
 I recommend that you use a bitumen 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.940
 firmer consistency because this one 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.650
 It slides a lot, you have to put it in 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.420
 Refri but as my sister loves 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.000
 I did so because butter is 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.070
 an option and well let's start 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.530
 declare our pot we're going to put the 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.890
 little ball and let's put two toothpicks 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.890
 this way to start putting our 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.670
 cupcakes very carefully so that 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.130
 let us not slip any 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.630
 in this way until they are all 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.700
 pegaditos the idea is that they remain 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.890
 Pegaditos but good I'll confess 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.660
 I stay me the truth super super 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.730
 separated those from above because I did not 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.030
 reached we will need 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.800
 I think more than 20 cupcakes and 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.610
 then what I did with these strips 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.730
 was to wrap the cupcakes so that 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.440
 look like the leaves there is another way very 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.670
 nice to decorate it but as I say 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.370
 these spaces that were left 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.170
 disgustingly horrible spaces 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.840
 but the truth is that the cupcakes 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.090
 they are delicious the bitumen is delicious 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.160
 and we're going to start putting sheets 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.250
 all the blanks so that 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.010
 simulate the leaves of our roses that 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.110
 as we are putting a pot and 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.470
 Well the truth is that we will stay 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.510
 very very beautiful and we know stages see 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.340
 I put it on the table because the day of 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.800
 my sister's birthday as we ate 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.150
 all and I put it as decoration then 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.890
 then we were grabbing the 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.380
 guests and good the truth is that it is 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.830
 a very nice craft and above all 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.760
 very 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.710
 very tasty that is also not there but 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.900
 very dear this manuality the saving is 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.210
 that far from being close is 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.070
 delicious and the truth is that I 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.280
 take this opportunity because the day 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.410
 yesterday my sister turned years yesterday 5 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.840
 April turned years and we made a 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.820
 very familiar food and then I took advantage 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.130
 to do these types of blog the 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.140
 centerpiece and the truth to all the 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.240
 world liked it and I want to take advantage of 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.070
