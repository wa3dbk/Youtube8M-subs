00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.150
 Grill 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.799
 since the grill is hot we are going to 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.040
 place our meat to put here entered 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.040
 with 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.140
 we are going to leave well cooked because we are going to 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.140
 have the burrito 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.360
 and at the same time to take care of it 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.360
 Let's put the avocado a lot 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.030
 good lady you have to leave it to be marked 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.080
 a little bit the grill they make a 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.110
 little bit of color 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.920
 it's not going to take long will it be there 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.509
 a new 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.509
 two minutes of the grill 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.899
 while our flesh is something we will 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.860
 prepare our two dressings we are going to 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.570
 start with the cream 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.160
 in this recipe it is very important to use 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.159
 this dress must be applied first well 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.289
 the coriander 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.990
 and we are going to add in a container the 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.070
 cream 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.070
 today with the ico 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.330
 and the cilantro 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.340
 We are also going to add a little lemon 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.110
 and a little health 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.110
 we stir it well 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.300
 and we have our first ready 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.300
 dressing 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.040
 now although the good dressing this is 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.670
 the chipotle we are going to add 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.900
 about two chipotle chilies 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.900
 a little bit of pickle 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.739
 and some yogurt 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.390
 this yogurt does not have sugar citizens 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.860
 yogurt with sugar no longer adds the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.860
 sugar I'm going to put a little 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.260
 a little bit of salt 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.930

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.740
 tortilla 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.170
 let's see it warm up a little bit 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.620
 this side we are going to put cheese with just 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.620
 the quesadilla 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.340

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.420

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.170

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.110

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.250
