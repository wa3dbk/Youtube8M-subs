the<00:03:12.610> majority<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.239> my<00:03:13.329> Chum<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.739> locals

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
the majority of my Chum of the locals

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.069 
the majority of my Chum of the locals
with<00:03:15.310> giorgia<00:03:15.760> firefish<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:16.299> spell<00:03:16.690> book<00:03:16.840> so

i guess maybe my top 10 video wasn't too
far<00:03:19.810> off<00:03:19.840> it's<00:03:20.139> pretty<00:03:20.350> accurate<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:20.829> far<00:03:20.859> but

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
that brought me most attention to my

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.240 
that brought me most attention to my

was<00:03:27.400> taking<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.910> opportunity<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.750> teach<00:03:28.959> me

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
was taking the opportunity to teach me

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.170 
was taking the opportunity to teach me
things<00:03:29.349> even<00:03:30.190> though<00:03:30.310> he<00:03:30.340> didn't<00:03:30.609> have<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.790> and

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
things even though he didn't have to and

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.120 
things even though he didn't have to and
he<00:03:32.079> actually<00:03:32.170> cost<00:03:32.590> him<00:03:32.769> one<00:03:32.889> of<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.099> games

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
he actually cost him one of the games

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.470

because<00:03:33.639> once<00:03:33.819> I<00:03:33.910> got<00:03:34.030> used<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.329> playing

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
because once I got used to playing

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.110 
because once I got used to playing
against<00:03:34.750> his<00:03:34.900> deck<00:03:35.049> we<00:03:35.620> got<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:35.950> game<00:03:36.099> 3<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.639> he

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
against his deck we got to game 3 and he

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.250 
against his deck we got to game 3 and he
actually<00:03:37.239> had<00:03:37.480> a<00:03:37.510> beating<00:03:37.840> me<00:03:37.959> in<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.109> match

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.990 
actually had a beating me in the match
but<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.590> point<00:03:38.799> was<00:03:38.889> he<00:03:39.370> was<00:03:39.519> like<00:03:39.639> letting<00:03:39.910> me

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
but the point was he was like letting me

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.520 
but the point was he was like letting me
take<00:03:40.180> back<00:03:40.450> small<00:03:40.750> things<00:03:40.989> because<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.349> wasn't

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
take back small things because I wasn't

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.960

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.670 
rulings in stuff like complex rulings
and<00:03:49.120> he<00:03:49.239> was<00:03:49.359> taking<00:03:49.569> the<00:03:49.630> opportunity<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:50.590> be

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
and he was taking the opportunity to be
