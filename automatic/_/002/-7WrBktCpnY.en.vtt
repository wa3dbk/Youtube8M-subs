00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.510 
like zero to five percent in just a few
minutes<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:46.170> one<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.189> most

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
minutes and it was one of the most

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.130 
minutes and it was one of the most
exciting<00:01:47.790> parts<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.479> phone<00:01:48.659> hands-down

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
exciting parts of this phone hands-down

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.859 
exciting parts of this phone hands-down
but<00:01:49.829> aside<00:01:50.040> from<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.579> also<00:01:50.759> get<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
but aside from that we also get the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.469 
but aside from that we also get the
micro<00:01:52.170> USB<00:01:52.380> charging<00:01:53.159> cable<00:01:53.460> now<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
micro USB charging cable now this is a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.749 
micro USB charging cable now this is a
non-proprietary<00:01:55.320> one<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.189> see<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> little

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
non-proprietary one you can see a little

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.990 
non-proprietary one you can see a little
cable<00:01:57.210> coming<00:01:57.390> out<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.750> here<00:01:58.049> yes<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.000> cable

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
cable coming out of here yes the cable

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.319 
cable coming out of here yes the cable
from<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.689> actual<00:02:01.439> Luke<00:02:02.189> charger<00:02:02.549> itself<00:02:02.969> does

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
from the actual Luke charger itself does

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.580 
from the actual Luke charger itself does
require<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.110> use

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
require you to use

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.859 
require you to use
it<00:02:06.189> does<00:02:06.340> require<00:02:06.579> you<00:02:06.789> to<00:02:06.820> use<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:07.719> order

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
it does require you to use it in order

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.630 
it does require you to use it in order
to<00:02:07.960> get<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.229> fast-charging<00:02:08.649> done<00:02:09.039> but<00:02:09.429> if<00:02:09.550> you

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
to get the fast-charging done but if you

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.940 
to get the fast-charging done but if you
just<00:02:09.849> want<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.330> use<00:02:10.660> a<00:02:10.690> regular<00:02:11.050> USB<00:02:11.590> cable

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
just want to use a regular USB cable

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.320 
just want to use a regular USB cable
because<00:02:12.220> maybe<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.550> don't<00:02:12.760> have<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.910> time<00:02:13.209> to

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
because maybe you don't have the time to

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.000 
because maybe you don't have the time to
use<00:02:13.480> this<00:02:13.720> or<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:13.989> place<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.260> use<00:02:14.560> this<00:02:14.769> rather

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
use this or a place to use this rather

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.580 
use this or a place to use this rather
then<00:02:15.519> you'll<00:02:15.670> get<00:02:15.849> more<00:02:16.209> more<00:02:17.050> traditional

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
then you'll get more more traditional

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.979 
then you'll get more more traditional
charging<00:02:18.010> speeds<00:02:18.310> than<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.450> would<00:02:19.629> with<00:02:19.810> this

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
charging speeds than you would with this

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.809 
charging speeds than you would with this
so<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.590> get<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.739> micro<00:02:20.980> USB<00:02:21.310> charging<00:02:21.610> cable

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
so you get a micro USB charging cable

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.780 
so you get a micro USB charging cable
here<00:02:22.299> or<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.540> connector<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.890> computer<00:02:24.340> but

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
here or a connector to the computer but

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.670 
here or a connector to the computer but
the<00:02:25.000> VUCA<00:02:25.150> charger<00:02:25.510> comes<00:02:25.720> with<00:02:25.900> its<00:02:26.049> own<00:02:26.260> cord

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
the VUCA charger comes with its own cord

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.000 
the VUCA charger comes with its own cord
that<00:02:26.980> snakes<00:02:27.760> around<00:02:27.940> over<00:02:28.390> here<00:02:28.750> after<00:02:29.590> that

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
that snakes around over here after that

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.430 
that snakes around over here after that
we<00:02:30.160> also<00:02:30.340> have<00:02:30.760> these<00:02:31.540> headphones<00:02:31.810> right<00:02:32.230> here

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
we also have these headphones right here

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.050 
we also have these headphones right here
which<00:02:32.620> I'm<00:02:32.739> going<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:32.980> take<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> look<00:02:33.549> at<00:02:33.760> in<00:02:33.970> a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
which I'm going to take a look at in a

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.550 
which I'm going to take a look at in a
little<00:02:34.269> bit<00:02:34.480> these<00:02:34.840> look<00:02:35.170> like<00:02:35.349> they<00:02:35.530> are

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
little bit these look like they are

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.800 
little bit these look like they are
somewhat<00:02:36.459> higher<00:02:36.640> quality<00:02:37.150> than<00:02:37.360> most<00:02:37.599> of<00:02:37.720> the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
somewhat higher quality than most of the

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.110 
somewhat higher quality than most of the
standard<00:02:38.140> fare<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.349> you<00:02:38.590> get<00:02:38.829> and<00:02:39.120> there's

standard fare that you get and there's
also<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.569> microphone<00:02:41.079> inline<00:02:41.860> on<00:02:42.130> these

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
also a microphone inline on these

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.830 
also a microphone inline on these
headphones<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.209> course<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.510> have<00:02:43.660> the

cover in a future focus video so you'll

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.509 
cover in a future focus video so you'll
see<00:03:09.910> what<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.750> evolution<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.709> charging<00:03:12.310> looks

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
see what the evolution of charging looks

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.500 
see what the evolution of charging looks
