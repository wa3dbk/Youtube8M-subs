wondering if perhaps the d600 is a

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
better camera for them to be shooting

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.630 
better camera for them to be shooting

this camera was going to have an

this camera was going to have an

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
excellent sensor be a great all-round

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.940 
excellent sensor be a great all-round
camera<00:03:30.329> and<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.930> looks<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.350> me<00:03:31.500> like<00:03:31.530> it's

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
camera and it looks to me like it's

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.819 
camera and it looks to me like it's
perfect<00:03:32.579> for<00:03:32.760> my<00:03:33.299> needs<00:03:33.329> I'm<00:03:34.019> not<00:03:34.410> sure<00:03:34.709> if

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
perfect for my needs I'm not sure if

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.380 
perfect for my needs I'm not sure if
it's<00:03:34.920> going<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.160> be<00:03:35.250> perfect<00:03:35.459> for<00:03:35.730> your<00:03:36.090> needs

if you're heavily invested in the Canon

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.520 
if you're heavily invested in the Canon
system<00:03:39.239> then<00:03:39.390> it's<00:03:39.569> probably<00:03:39.930> not<00:03:40.170> worth<00:03:40.200> it

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
system then it's probably not worth it
