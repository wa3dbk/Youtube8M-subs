00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
good it used to be the case we thought

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.960

you've lost brain sort of function for a
long<00:02:31.610> time<00:02:31.910> we<00:02:32.209> now<00:02:33.020> know<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:33.230> if<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.500> get

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
long time we now know that if you get

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.390 
long time we now know that if you get
people<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.730> repeatedly<00:02:35.600> make<00:02:36.290> our<00:02:36.560> movements

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
people to repeatedly make our movements

practice physical movements then they

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.120 
practice physical movements then they
can<00:02:40.490> get<00:02:40.580> some<00:02:40.640> return<00:02:41.270> a<00:02:41.480> function<00:02:41.980> now<00:02:42.980> when

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
can get some return a function now when

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.040 
can get some return a function now when
I<00:02:43.160> first<00:02:43.459> saw<00:02:43.670> fruit<00:02:44.090> ninja<00:02:44.480> thought<00:02:44.780> okay

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
there's a game that we could use to get

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.509 
there's a game that we could use to get
people<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.390> do<00:02:47.540> lots<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.400> would

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
people to do lots of this and it would

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.160 
people to do lots of this and it would
be<00:02:49.640> fun<00:02:49.940> for<00:02:49.970> them<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.630> engage<00:02:50.780> in<00:02:51.080> that

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
be fun for them to engage in that

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.979 
be fun for them to engage in that
rehabilitation<00:02:51.489> but<00:02:52.489> for<00:02:52.760> some<00:02:52.940> patients<00:02:53.330> if

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
rehabilitation but for some patients if

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.350 
rehabilitation but for some patients if
they<00:02:54.019> can't<00:02:54.680> move<00:02:54.920> their<00:02:54.980> arms<00:02:55.730> very<00:02:56.000> quickly

they can't move their arms very quickly

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.540 
they can't move their arms very quickly
then<00:02:57.290> they'll<00:02:57.530> never<00:02:57.680> be<00:02:57.890> able<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.160> swap<00:02:58.400> the

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
your balance we know that exercise is a

your balance we know that exercise is a
really<00:03:58.610> good<00:03:58.790> way<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:59.000> reduce<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.750> risk<00:03:59.960> of

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
really good way to reduce the risk of

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.410 
really good way to reduce the risk of
falls<00:04:00.350> in<00:04:00.650> older<00:04:00.830> people<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:01.460> so<00:04:01.910> one<00:04:02.270> of<00:04:02.300> the

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
sufficiently so that we can slow it down

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.890 
sufficiently so that we can slow it down
and<00:04:15.140> put<00:04:15.830> in<00:04:15.950> age-appropriate<00:04:16.390> music<00:04:17.390> so<00:04:17.720> that
