from<00:00:08.870> Keystone<00:00:09.110> motors<00:00:09.590> we're<00:00:09.710> going<00:00:09.830> to<00:00:09.889> take

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
from Keystone motors we're going to take

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.810 
from Keystone motors we're going to take
a<00:00:10.099> look<00:00:10.280> at<00:00:10.549> these

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
a look at these

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.370 
a look at these
phile<00:00:12.230> crossbars

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
phile crossbars

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.430 
phile crossbars
system<00:00:13.680> for<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
system for the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.990 
system for the
g60<00:00:15.860> now<00:00:16.070> notice<00:00:16.580> the<00:00:16.730> xc60<00:00:17.539> has<00:00:18.230> the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
g60 now notice the xc60 has the

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.880 
g60 now notice the xc60 has the
low-profile<00:00:20.000> rails<00:00:20.449> not<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:21.320> high<00:00:21.470> up<00:00:21.650> ones

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
low-profile rails not the high up ones

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.819 
low-profile rails not the high up ones
like<00:00:22.130> on<00:00:22.279> most<00:00:22.660> SUVs<00:00:23.660> that's<00:00:23.930> for<00:00:24.140> a<00:00:24.169> less<00:00:24.590> wind

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:24.829 
like on most SUVs that's for a less wind

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.790 
like on most SUVs that's for a less wind
resistance<00:00:25.630> so<00:00:26.630> a<00:00:26.660> quieter<00:00:27.199> ride<00:00:27.349> so<00:00:27.680> you've

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
resistance so a quieter ride so you've

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.589 
resistance so a quieter ride so you've
got<00:00:27.949> the<00:00:28.099> covers<00:00:28.489> here<00:00:29.980> and<00:00:31.329> here<00:00:32.329> you<00:00:32.480> can

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
got the covers here and here you can

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.200 
got the covers here and here you can
tighten<00:00:33.050> up<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:34.160> rails<00:00:34.430> once<00:00:34.820> you've<00:00:34.969> gotten

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
tighten up the rails once you've gotten

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.170 
tighten up the rails once you've gotten
them<00:00:35.300> into<00:00:35.540> position<00:00:35.989> and<00:00:36.890> use<00:00:37.219> a<00:00:37.250> torque

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
them into position and use a torque

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.490 
them into position and use a torque
wrench<00:00:38.390> for<00:00:38.600> that<00:00:38.750> so<00:00:38.960> it'll<00:00:39.050> tighten<00:00:39.290> um<00:00:39.410> of

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
wrench for that so it'll tighten um of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.959 
wrench for that so it'll tighten um of
the<00:00:39.620> exact<00:00:39.980> tightness<00:00:40.670> that<00:00:40.820> they're

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
the exact tightness that they're

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.790 
the exact tightness that they're
supposed<00:00:41.210> to<00:00:41.270> be<00:00:41.450> you<00:00:41.930> can<00:00:42.110> move<00:00:42.320> these<00:00:42.500> back

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
supposed to be you can move these back

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.040 
supposed to be you can move these back
and<00:00:43.039> forth<00:00:43.309> so<00:00:43.969> that<00:00:44.090> you<00:00:44.149> can<00:00:44.329> equalize<00:00:44.809> them

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
and forth so that you can equalize them

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.110 
and forth so that you can equalize them
on<00:00:45.140> both<00:00:45.289> sides<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:46.370> also<00:00:46.550> want<00:00:46.879> to<00:00:46.940> make

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
on both sides and you also want to make

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.329 
on both sides and you also want to make
sure<00:00:47.149> that<00:00:47.390> this<00:00:47.539> is<00:00:47.690> not<00:00:47.809> too<00:00:48.109> far<00:00:48.320> forward<00:00:48.679> be

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
sure that this is not too far forward be

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:50.979 
sure that this is not too far forward be
advised<00:00:49.609> that<00:00:49.640> this<00:00:50.059> will<00:00:50.359> also<00:00:50.510> come<00:00:50.809> in<00:00:50.929> a

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
advised that this will also come in a

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.950 
advised that this will also come in a
wing<00:00:51.199> profile<00:00:52.539> configuration<00:00:53.539> but<00:00:53.690> it's<00:00:53.809> not

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
wing profile configuration but it's not

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.069 
wing profile configuration but it's not
quite<00:00:54.230> as<00:00:54.879> universal<00:00:55.879> as<00:00:56.059> these<00:00:56.449> square<00:00:56.839> ones

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
quite as universal as these square ones

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.169 
quite as universal as these square ones
so<00:00:57.649> I<00:00:57.710> recommend<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:58.190> square<00:00:58.460> wings<00:00:58.670> myself

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
so I recommend the square wings myself

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.869 
so I recommend the square wings myself
and<00:00:59.870> then<00:01:00.019> you<00:01:00.050> just<00:01:00.319> tighten<00:01:00.499> them<00:01:00.679> down<00:01:00.879> put

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
and then you just tighten them down put

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.229 
and then you just tighten them down put
the<00:01:01.969> locking<00:01:02.300> cover<00:01:02.479> on<00:01:02.749> and<00:01:03.050> you're<00:01:03.199> all<00:01:03.319> set

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
the locking cover on and you're all set

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.590 
the locking cover on and you're all set
okay<00:01:05.239> now<00:01:05.600> we've<00:01:05.810> placed<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:06.680> bike<00:01:07.340> holder<00:01:08.000> on

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
okay now we've placed the bike holder on

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.490 
okay now we've placed the bike holder on
the<00:01:08.630> square<00:01:09.620> profile<00:01:10.250> rack<00:01:10.810> crossbars<00:01:11.810> are

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
the square profile rack crossbars are

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.960 
the square profile rack crossbars are
taking<00:01:12.979> this<00:01:13.670> flange<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:15.490> it<00:01:16.490> clamps<00:01:16.940> down

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
taking this flange and it clamps down

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.520 
taking this flange and it clamps down
using<00:01:17.810> this<00:01:18.110> piece<00:01:18.979> here<00:01:19.370> looks<00:01:19.580> like<00:01:19.640> this

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
using this piece here looks like this

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.930 
using this piece here looks like this
now<00:01:21.530> in<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.800> back<00:01:22.040> we've<00:01:22.400> got<00:01:22.430> one<00:01:22.790> that

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
now in the back we've got one that

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.450 
now in the back we've got one that
hasn't<00:01:23.150> been<00:01:23.360> tightened<00:01:23.930> yet<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:25.280> key

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
hasn't been tightened yet the key

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.580 
hasn't been tightened yet the key
securing<00:01:25.880> device<00:01:26.150> looks<00:01:26.390> like<00:01:26.540> that<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:27.020> the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
securing device looks like that and the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.000 
securing device looks like that and the
two<00:01:27.830> teeth<00:01:28.670> go<00:01:28.970> around<00:01:29.420> that<00:01:30.050> post<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.740> then

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
two teeth go around that post and then

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.940 
two teeth go around that post and then
the<00:01:31.100> post<00:01:31.310> clamps<00:01:31.790> down<00:01:32.260> once<00:01:33.260> everything<00:01:33.830> is

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
the post clamps down once everything is

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.820 
the post clamps down once everything is
secured<00:01:34.930> we're<00:01:35.930> gonna<00:01:36.020> put<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.350> bike<00:01:36.500> on<00:01:36.650> so

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
secured we're gonna put the bike on so

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.740 
secured we're gonna put the bike on so
imagine<00:01:37.220> that<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.370> bike<00:01:37.640> is<00:01:37.820> in<00:01:37.970> this<00:01:38.120> track<00:01:38.420> and

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
imagine that a bike is in this track and

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.770 
imagine that a bike is in this track and
the<00:01:38.870> tires<00:01:39.140> are<00:01:39.350> in<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.500> track<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.040> these

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
the tires are in the track and these

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.730 
the tires are in the track and these
mounts<00:01:41.780> have<00:01:41.840> been<00:01:42.020> pushed<00:01:42.260> out<00:01:42.410> of<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.590> way

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
mounts have been pushed out of the way

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.500 
mounts have been pushed out of the way
so<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:43.070> tires<00:01:43.310> can<00:01:43.580> take<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:43.910> proper<00:01:44.270> place

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
so the tires can take the proper place

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.240 
so the tires can take the proper place
now<00:01:45.170> what<00:01:45.380> we're<00:01:45.500> gonna<00:01:45.620> do<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:45.980> there's<00:01:46.190> a

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
now what we're gonna do is there's a

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.140 
now what we're gonna do is there's a
lever<00:01:46.610> on<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.910> base<00:01:47.450> of<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:48.520> clamp<00:01:49.520> here<00:01:49.880> and

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
lever on the base of the clamp here and

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.810 
lever on the base of the clamp here and
push<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.020> clamp<00:01:51.260> a<00:01:51.500> little<00:01:51.740> lever<00:01:52.010> back<00:01:52.280> the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
push the clamp a little lever back the

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.140

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
clamp opens up that clamps onto the down

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.090 
clamp opens up that clamps onto the down
tube<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.630> frame<00:01:56.930> of<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.170> bike<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:57.680> then

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
tube of the frame of the bike and then

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.670 
tube of the frame of the bike and then
you<00:01:58.250> use<00:01:58.520> that<00:01:59.920> lever<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.400> flip<00:02:01.640> it<00:02:01.760> back<00:02:01.970> up

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
you use that lever to flip it back up

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.860 
you use that lever to flip it back up
clamps<00:02:03.680> back<00:02:03.890> down<00:02:04.220> now<00:02:04.700> that's<00:02:05.030> secured<00:02:05.600> and

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
clamps back down now that's secured and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.350
