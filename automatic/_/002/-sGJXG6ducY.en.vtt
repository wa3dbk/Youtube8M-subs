00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.540
 best friend of the moment so it's 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.430

 day and make hold of my makeup and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.390

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.619
 foundation as well as a minor art 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.420
 in the form of cream 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.480
 this is going to make a nice complexion well 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.180
 worked well but while giving this 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.590
 glowy side that I like for this 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.930
 kind of event 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.450
 I'm now correcting my eyebrows with 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.680
 shouting from dior which I can not 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.090
 not to pass me in fact I'm trying 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.610
 other products but I come back from 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.440
 June this one to hold but 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.899
 do all day a scoop is 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:55.440
 indispensable I use the soft offer of 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.420
 at mac and play there present to sting my 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.329
 little novelty of the moment of chez josie 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.359
 maran is this eye shadow under 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.979
 cream shape with a gloss tip that 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.229
 I will apply on my eyelid 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.170
 it will allow me to create a base to 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.210
 6 bright to come apply 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.040
 other lighthouse on top I leave 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.720
 fall like that by tapping with the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.369
 finger so she does not lose her 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.360
 brightness and they blend 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.360
 perfectly to my eyelid 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.909
 for this makeup I decided 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.930
 to use the year that three quarters I 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.360
 find that the colors are just 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.440
 beautiful dance on tones like that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.720
 a little bit romantic 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.119
 so I saw who it is the limit far who 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.940
 is deft of the brush which is a lighthouse 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.520
 transition that is matte to come 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.810
 so blur the edges of the cream blush and 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.920
 start giving a little bit of 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.049
 hollow upstream definition of eyelids 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.210
 julie mine immediately in arcade on 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.940
 sider with the clearest color of 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.440
 the palette 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.240
 I'm now using the Farm Honor which 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.429
 is a lighthouse mate a little bit more 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.470
 dark than the lighthouse that we put on the 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.929
 hollow eyelids to give a little 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.330
 little more definition and with the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.769
 beveled brush it's easier to 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.840
 come 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.610
 go for the outer corner I really want 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.610
 that this color stays in outer corner 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.920
 I'm using the burden now is that 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.320
 I will say proud with my water from home 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.020
 smashbox to give a little more 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.450
 of brightness that I apply to my 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.080
 eyelid up to 3/4 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.080
 my eyelid 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.940
 gesture have again the edges of 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.709
 my makeup and games make those signed 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.170
 these greenhouses still a little bit more my 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.730
 outer corner 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.739
 we go to the jet liner which for me a 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.750
 indispensable you know it well so 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.520
 it's the one at mac blackjack 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.140
 is new to me but for 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.760
 the moment I find it really very 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.250
 very well I find that the texture is 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.750
 very very much the only small problem I 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.910
 would say that I thought he was 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.160
 a little bit stronger than what we 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.500
 So I'll come see their touch 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.500
 with a liquid liner gel 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.770
 before passing will he have lower I 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.690
 will come and illuminate and correct 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.550
 all that is certain and fall 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.550
 possible eyeshadow 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.460
 gestamp my corrector up 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.510
 inside my inner corner for a 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.510
 look a little cooler 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.600
 for a more lifted effect and with the 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.880
 stays in him when if their jeans 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.830
 apply under the brow here is I 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.600
 think it looks cleaner prettier 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.519
 and that's how it really looks 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.519
 congratulations that I like of the eye 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.170
 it's a daytime makeup and 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.000
 evening at the same time I do not want too much 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.920
 load the underside of my eye so I 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.440
 just going to apply the lighthouse limit 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.760
 for an effect a little bit more this word 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.760
 which is not too 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.720
 I will now apply the lighthouse 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.270
 dust in the inner corner and at the level of the 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.220
 internal lashes also to give 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.450
 this little touch of light to my 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.730
 eyes and I'm also going with the lighthouse 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.919
 what is the name of the cruel farce 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.130
 excuse me waltz the strange lighthouse that 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.410
 I'm going to internal corner for an effect 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.930
 fresh in the day it's free 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.870
 that's if you're tired at least 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.060
 will not see the breasts the last touch 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.850
 final for the eyes so this is the 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.550
 mascara to use without moderation 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.490
