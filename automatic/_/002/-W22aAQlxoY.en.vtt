00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
they can beat us but I'm thinking this

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.639 
they can beat us but I'm thinking this
game<00:00:47.329> it's<00:00:48.329> gonna<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.780> really<00:00:48.960> close<00:00:49.230> I've<00:00:49.440> got

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
the same feeling I had before the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.750 
the same feeling I had before the
washington<00:00:51.960> game<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.440> knew<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.129> would<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.460> win
