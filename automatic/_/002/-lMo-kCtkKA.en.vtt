00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.040

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.040

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.180

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.550
 no holidays are not hanging 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.940
 events nothing nothing 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.100
 but that's tomorrow on the sixth day 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.239
 of frozen food in 2013 so who would have 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.670
 thought that could tomorrow school 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.290
 and my god knows all tell 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.630
 as it is now with a total useless 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.660
 megabrain that's the madness and 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.119
 I am the sudan and labg 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.410
 and yes today is without exception times 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.640
 not environment like stupid topics though 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.500
 it did not fit with the internet 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.880
 definitely 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.670
 today it's about partnership and 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.670
 caravan that's nice does not fit 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.440
 caravan fitting partner city subscribed 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.119
 this channel will not be in any case 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.070
 I now something about the partners 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.759
 By the way, havanna counts all of them 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.560
 background fashion new town i became 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.970
 God say if it is still so channels 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.950
 yes I am so stupid here but that is 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.110
 no matter if partner projects warrior has one 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.630
 video clear half world leads avant 2.0 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.069
 there are still many many many 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.360
 many many many many people participated 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.500
 have only very very very completely 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.630
 very very very little 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.399
 So the two are really good 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.720
 three four people are really there 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.740
 well so in the deserved and where 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.880
 I also really imagine that 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.729
 I therefore purely create that would be 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.259
 the thing of impossibility if this 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.149
 would not succeed but that is 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.920
 A matter of taste from warriors indicates much 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.500
 now ask hey i get tips from 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.119
 because I'm also involved with and and doing 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.770
 you know him and you already have 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.770
 join in you can be determined again 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.209
 a few tips give yes to the people 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.679
 I can only say yes skin a bit 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.090
 edding pen has a good quality 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.649
 that's what you say for me then 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.179
 just to keep you entertained 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.770
 I can not do more than that 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.720
 say 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.760
 actually staging for the people 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.080
 create people when I'm at it 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.069
 I think this semi-final and 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.720
 I do not know warriors before 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.040
 said that he writes me on if I am 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.230
 because even come in any case 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.400
 people when you come in you know you 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.319
 does not always get the opponent 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.099
 it did not sound quite that way but me 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.260
 have to say that I'm a pretty 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.970
 tough opponent will because this time wants 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.220
 I really win, I want to win 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.520
 I want to win, I want to win 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.850
 goes up in flames 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.230
 well now let's set up but only about 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.510
 the partnership because i have im 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.470
 Last patchday video I said 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.360
 never partner 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.400
 that is quite there I am just mine 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.620
 creativity limited bla bla bla 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.130
 and I have it with the type of game 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.870
 insider talked to the stefan that was 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.980
 determined stefan definitely family 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.290
 I said so yes here I feel 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.280
 creatively constrained the mandala and 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.530
 has told me that it just 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.450
 nonsense is but I should be like this or 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.980
 I do not pay attention to things like that 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.930
 can prevent and so for example the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.100
 bude comes missing behind that I may yes 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.650
 make the country because I have no 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.180
 right for you have inquired immediately and 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.040
 it could happen anytime that 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.050
 someone comes and says hey here you 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.120
 christen strike not displayed to you 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.800
 or any worse 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.960
 things are now day by day 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.970
 or sometime today or tomorrow 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.130
 a few videos have been taken out 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.690
 measures such as the assembly a pity 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.250
 I 'm really not the signal 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.200
 closed how do we shit that then 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.270
 simply start a criticism of zero 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.400
 10,000 of married couples because that's me 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.830
 a bit too much effort, say 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.160
 Hump ​​Nebu had to show the deadline 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.080
 from Latin then what makes as to the 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.740
 then I'm so incredibly stupid here 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.570
 just do not care 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.400
 so I will now soon 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.560
 take out some videos and synonymous to 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.270
 example, the 1111 but not to 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.040
 for example when I take out and also 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.560
 you get that with the clam 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.270
 yes, that's a pity, though 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.070
 well if you want to watch it again 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.500
 or done so now or measure down 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.110
 then you have it forever and ever 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:08.180
 really likely when video over 1000m 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:10.790
 get 1000 good that's a reason 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.780
 why is really gonna paravan panama 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.700
 namely we deny soon 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.020
 partner because it's completely irrelevant 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.700
 now because we have to go now anyway 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.470
 to pay attention to license fees 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.320
 would know and that's why it is 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.540
 will happen or not 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.040
 I'll tell you a shit ammonite this 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.410

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.890
 Subscribed in any case would be now 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.110

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.090
 Anyway 88 must be intro and as I said 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.590
 We keep that and beats inside 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.210
 we would also be kept natural 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.220
 it will not change much except 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.150
 that we earn money with it 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.490
