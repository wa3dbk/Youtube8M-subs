left hand now the the quick answer that
is<00:00:31.809> that<00:00:32.050> there<00:00:32.259> is<00:00:32.349> no<00:00:32.559> one<00:00:33.100> way<00:00:33.460> because<00:00:33.700> it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
is that there is no one way because it

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.740 
is that there is no one way because it
all<00:00:34.510> depends<00:00:34.930> on<00:00:34.989> what<00:00:35.140> you're<00:00:35.290> going<00:00:35.410> to<00:00:35.500> play

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
that being said generalization is this

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.200 
that being said generalization is this
this<00:00:41.440> is<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:41.980> correct<00:00:42.280> way<00:00:42.730> to<00:00:42.760> hold<00:00:43.059> the

this is the correct way to hold the
guitar<00:00:43.480> it's<00:00:43.719> not<00:00:43.899> not<00:00:44.230> like<00:00:44.260> this<00:00:44.679> that<00:00:44.980> you

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
guitar it's not not like this that you

see in the guitar magazine sometime or
you<00:00:47.589> know<00:00:47.710> like<00:00:48.039> that<00:00:48.309> it's<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:48.969> easiest<00:00:49.449> most

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
you know like that it's the easiest most

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.950 
you know like that it's the easiest most
ergonomic<00:00:50.469> wrist<00:00:51.370> is<00:00:51.519> fairly<00:00:51.879> straight<00:00:52.239> like

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
ergonomic wrist is fairly straight like

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.630 
ergonomic wrist is fairly straight like
this<00:00:53.489> now<00:00:54.489> as<00:00:54.850> I<00:00:54.999> go<00:00:55.120> up<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.359> neck<00:00:56.370> my<00:00:57.370> thumb

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
this now as I go up the neck my thumb

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.040 
this now as I go up the neck my thumb
might<00:00:57.850> want<00:00:58.059> to<00:00:58.120> come<00:00:58.300> up<00:00:58.449> which<00:00:58.749> is<00:00:58.899> actually

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
might want to come up which is actually

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.439 
might want to come up which is actually
good<00:00:59.620> because<00:00:59.819> often<00:01:00.819> times<00:01:01.030> when<00:01:01.269> we're

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
good because often times when we're

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.029 
good because often times when we're
playing<00:01:01.719> up<00:01:01.899> here<00:01:02.260> we're<00:01:02.649> going<00:01:02.769> to<00:01:02.829> be<00:01:02.920> doing

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
playing up here we're going to be doing

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.009 
playing up here we're going to be doing
string<00:01:03.429> bendings<00:01:03.850> and<00:01:04.089> you<00:01:04.180> really<00:01:04.570> need<00:01:04.839> the

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
string bendings and you really need the

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.050 
string bendings and you really need the
thumb<00:01:05.290> for<00:01:05.590> leverage<00:01:05.950> when<00:01:06.159> you<00:01:06.220> do<00:01:06.370> that<00:01:06.520> look

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
thumb for leverage when you do that look

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.640 
thumb for leverage when you do that look
at<00:01:07.150> all<00:01:07.300> pictures<00:01:07.810> of<00:01:07.960> all<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.200> great<00:01:08.380> players

at all pictures of all the great players

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.490 
at all pictures of all the great players
Stevie<00:01:09.580> Ray<00:01:09.670> Vaughan<00:01:09.910> Jimi<00:01:10.570> Hendrix<00:01:11.050> they<00:01:11.350> all

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
Stevie Ray Vaughan Jimi Hendrix they all

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.810 
Stevie Ray Vaughan Jimi Hendrix they all
got<00:01:11.740> their<00:01:11.860> thumb<00:01:12.070> peaking<00:01:12.370> over<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.640> top

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
got their thumb peaking over the top

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.070 
got their thumb peaking over the top
especially<00:01:15.360> Clapton<00:01:16.360> when<00:01:16.690> they're<00:01:16.840> playing

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
especially Clapton when they're playing

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.110 
especially Clapton when they're playing
when<00:01:17.380> they're<00:01:17.500> bending<00:01:17.680> notes<00:01:18.010> because<00:01:18.520> if<00:01:18.910> I

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
when they're bending notes because if I

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.900 
when they're bending notes because if I
don't<00:01:19.180> have<00:01:19.540> my<00:01:19.690> thumb<00:01:19.900> up<00:01:20.020> here<00:01:20.260> what<00:01:20.530> happens

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
don't have my thumb up here what happens

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.170 
don't have my thumb up here what happens
my<00:01:21.910> hand<00:01:22.120> wants<00:01:22.480> to<00:01:22.600> wants<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.140> do<00:01:23.260> that<00:01:23.470> so

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
my hand wants to wants to do that so

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.120 
my hand wants to wants to do that so
left<00:01:25.180> hand<00:01:25.470> positioning<00:01:26.470> is<00:01:26.590> very<00:01:26.680> dynamic

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
left hand positioning is very dynamic

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.280 
left hand positioning is very dynamic
which<00:01:27.730> means<00:01:27.970> if<00:01:28.420> you're<00:01:28.600> play<00:01:28.840> it's<00:01:29.080> going<00:01:29.170> to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
which means if you're play it's going to

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.930 
which means if you're play it's going to
look<00:01:29.410> one<00:01:29.650> way<00:01:29.800> here<00:01:30.220> it's<00:01:30.580> going<00:01:30.730> to<00:01:30.790> look

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
look one way here it's going to look

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.330 
look one way here it's going to look
another<00:01:31.180> way<00:01:31.360> here<00:01:31.750> but<00:01:32.350> generally<00:01:32.650> speaking

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
another way here but generally speaking

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.120 
another way here but generally speaking
it's<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.970> very<00:01:34.180> relaxed<00:01:34.660> grab<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:35.170> next<00:01:35.860> very

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
it's a very relaxed grab a next very

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.190 
it's a very relaxed grab a next very
important<00:01:36.610> concept<00:01:37.030> is<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.360> always<00:01:37.690> play<00:01:37.960> as

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
important concept is to always play as

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.770 
important concept is to always play as
close<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:39.010> the<00:01:39.130> fret<00:01:39.370> as<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.240> can<00:01:40.420> get<00:01:40.570> without

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
close to the fret as you can get without

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.070 
close to the fret as you can get without
actually<00:01:41.170> being<00:01:41.680> on<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:44.020> this<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.960> you

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
actually being on it like this if you

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.570 
actually being on it like this if you
take<00:01:47.290> notice<00:01:47.560> I'm<00:01:47.770> not<00:01:47.890> even<00:01:48.100> looking<00:01:48.340> at<00:01:48.430> the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
take notice I'm not even looking at the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.039 
take notice I'm not even looking at the
guitar

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.749 

but<00:01:53.049> each<00:01:53.319> finger<00:01:53.740> is<00:01:53.950> right<00:01:53.979> next<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.670> the

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
but each finger is right next to the

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.809 
but each finger is right next to the
fret<00:01:54.999> and<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:55.390> importance<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.319> is<00:01:56.819> the

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
fret and the importance of that is the

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.240 
fret and the importance of that is the
