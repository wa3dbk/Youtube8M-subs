00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
sense and another thing you could do

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.020 
sense and another thing you could do
with<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.140> guns<00:02:36.350> is<00:02:36.590> be<00:02:37.040> able<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.459> pack<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.730> punch

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
with the guns is be able to pack a punch

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.170 
with the guns is be able to pack a punch
them<00:02:38.270> more<00:02:38.540> than<00:02:38.750> once<00:02:39.040> obviously<00:02:40.040> it's<00:02:40.180> 5,000

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
them more than once obviously it's 5,000

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.110 
them more than once obviously it's 5,000
to<00:02:41.360> pack<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.570> punch<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:41.989> weapon<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.760> could

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
to pack a punch a weapon so it could

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.380 
to pack a punch a weapon so it could
cost<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.750> ten<00:02:45.290> thousand<00:02:45.800> army<00:02:46.040> more<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.760> you

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
cost you ten thousand army more and you

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.949 
cost you ten thousand army more and you
could<00:02:47.570> pack<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.810> punch<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.350> twice<00:02:48.709> because

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
could pack a punch it twice because

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.030 
could pack a punch it twice because
obviously<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.260> pack<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.470> punch<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.860> very

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
obviously the pack a punch is very

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.070 
obviously the pack a punch is very
effective<00:02:52.340> but<00:02:52.760> are<00:02:52.910> still<00:02:53.360> after<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.780> certain

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
effective but are still after a certain

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.180 
effective but are still after a certain
round<00:02:54.709> it<00:02:55.340> then<00:02:55.489> becomes<00:02:55.820> useless<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:57.190> very

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
round it then becomes useless and very

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.770 
round it then becomes useless and very
hard<00:02:58.459> to<00:02:58.640> get<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.820> kills<00:02:59.060> with<00:02:59.269> it<00:02:59.420> so<00:02:59.630> when

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
hard to get the kills with it so when

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.050 
hard to get the kills with it so when
they<00:02:59.870> pack<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.080> Polish<00:03:00.380> it<00:03:00.500> again<00:03:00.920> then<00:03:01.880> it

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
they pack a Polish it again then it

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.300 
they pack a Polish it again then it
could<00:03:02.269> be<00:03:02.480> as<00:03:02.720> useful<00:03:02.959> as<00:03:03.260> when<00:03:03.800> you<00:03:03.890> first<00:03:04.130> buy

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
you should this should bring in better

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.550 
you should this should bring in better
perks<00:03:09.350> may<00:03:10.100> be<00:03:10.160> upgradeable<00:03:11.000> birds<00:03:11.500> so<00:03:12.500> I've

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
places Ombey I don't know how that would
