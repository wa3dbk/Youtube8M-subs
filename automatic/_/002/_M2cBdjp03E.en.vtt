00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.180 
to do for the future of this channel um
basically<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.150> reason<00:04:06.300> is<00:04:06.540> because

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
basically the reason is because

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.980 
basically the reason is because
partially<00:04:08.190> I've<00:04:08.370> been<00:04:08.610> focusing<00:04:09.300> a<00:04:09.510> lot<00:04:09.720> more

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
partially I've been focusing a lot more

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.920 
partially I've been focusing a lot more
on<00:04:10.230> quantity<00:04:10.860> than<00:04:11.100> quality<00:04:11.360> with<00:04:12.360> my<00:04:12.540> videos

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
on quantity than quality with my videos

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.560 
on quantity than quality with my videos
and<00:04:13.200> stuff<00:04:13.350> like<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:13.620> before<00:04:14.580> like<00:04:15.090> before

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
and stuff like that before like before

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.060 
and stuff like that before like before
my<00:04:15.930> sickness<00:04:16.290> came<00:04:16.410> down<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.890> whole

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
my sickness came down and the whole

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.349 
my sickness came down and the whole
reason<00:04:17.370> why<00:04:17.640> I'm<00:04:17.700> doing<00:04:17.760> this<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.239> because

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
reason why I'm doing this is because

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.240 
reason why I'm doing this is because
while<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:18.840> was<00:04:19.140> sick<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.500> have<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.680> lot<00:04:19.890> of<00:04:19.920> times

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
while I was sick I have a lot of times

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.599 
while I was sick I have a lot of times
think<00:04:20.580> about<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.910> channel<00:04:21.239> instead

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
think about the channel instead

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.999 
think about the channel instead
I<00:04:21.669> kind<00:04:22.479> of<00:04:22.599> wanted<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:22.990> decide<00:04:23.379> what<00:04:23.680> I<00:04:23.710> wanted

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:24.009 
I kind of wanted to decide what I wanted

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.399 
I kind of wanted to decide what I wanted
to<00:04:24.069> do<00:04:24.280> with<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:24.789> basically<00:04:25.419> I'm<00:04:26.020> gonna

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
to do with it and basically I'm gonna

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.770 
to do with it and basically I'm gonna
focus<00:04:26.770> on<00:04:27.129> making<00:04:27.340> some<00:04:27.699> better<00:04:27.939> videos<00:04:28.300> mit

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
focus on making some better videos mit

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.649 
focus on making some better videos mit
more<00:04:29.439> than<00:04:29.710> making<00:04:30.039> a<00:04:30.400> lot<00:04:30.789> of<00:04:30.819> videos<00:04:31.270> because

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:31.659 
more than making a lot of videos because

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:33.240 
more than making a lot of videos because
in<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.289> past<00:04:32.439> I<00:04:32.650> would<00:04:32.800> just<00:04:32.949> worry<00:04:33.189> about

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
in the past I would just worry about

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.760 
in the past I would just worry about
making<00:04:34.240> sure<00:04:34.599> that<00:04:34.780> I<00:04:34.810> upload<00:04:35.199> a<00:04:35.229> video<00:04:35.439> a<00:04:35.560> day
