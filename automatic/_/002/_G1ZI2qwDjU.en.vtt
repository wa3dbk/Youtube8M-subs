00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.910 
normally closed normally open we
recommend<00:01:05.409> to<00:01:05.740> use<00:01:05.979> a<00:01:06.479> double<00:01:07.500> solid<00:01:08.500> on<00:01:08.710> that

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
recommend to use a double solid on that

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.459 
recommend to use a double solid on that
or<00:01:09.549> single<00:01:10.119> solenoid<00:01:10.539> it<00:01:10.659> has<00:01:10.780> a<00:01:10.810> double<00:01:11.140> entry

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
or single solenoid it has a double entry

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:15.630 
or single solenoid it has a double entry
we<00:01:12.189> put<00:01:12.430> air<00:01:12.700> in<00:01:12.820> both<00:01:13.329> ends<00:01:14.170> even<00:01:15.130> though<00:01:15.310> the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
we put air in both ends even though the

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.840 
we put air in both ends even though the
air<00:01:15.729> is<00:01:15.880> going<00:01:16.119> into<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.390> spring<00:01:16.600> end<00:01:17.850> it's

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
air is going into the spring end it's

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.789 
air is going into the spring end it's
better<00:01:19.149> than<00:01:19.359> having<00:01:19.539> second<00:01:20.229> year<00:01:20.469> and<00:01:20.619> from

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
better than having second year and from

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.160 
better than having second year and from
the<00:01:20.890> outside<00:01:22.380> we<00:01:23.380> recommend<00:01:23.950> a<00:01:24.159> port<00:01:24.899> signs<00:01:25.899> so

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
the outside we recommend a port signs so

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.029 
the outside we recommend a port signs so
they<00:01:26.259> go<00:01:26.409> in<00:01:26.530> here<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:29.049> allows<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.770> unit

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
they go in here and that allows the unit

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.300 
they go in here and that allows the unit
to<00:01:30.070> lease<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:31.119> stop<00:01:31.530> dust<00:01:32.530> being<00:01:32.859> pulled<00:01:33.130> into

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
to lease to stop dust being pulled into

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.789 
to lease to stop dust being pulled into
it<00:01:33.490> as<00:01:33.670> it's<00:01:33.880> sucked<00:01:34.119> back<00:01:34.299> in<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:35.590> better

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
it as it's sucked back in it's better

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.709 
it as it's sucked back in it's better
ready<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.340> operate<00:01:36.490> it<00:01:36.850> with<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:36.969> double
