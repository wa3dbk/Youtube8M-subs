of<00:04:43.479> the<00:04:43.570> target<00:04:46.470> superelevation<00:04:47.470> increases

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
of the target superelevation increases

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.219 
of the target superelevation increases
as<00:04:48.370> advanced<00:04:49.330> range<00:04:49.690> increases<00:04:51.810> but<00:04:52.810> not<00:04:53.050> in

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
as advanced range increases but not in
