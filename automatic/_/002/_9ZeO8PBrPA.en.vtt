00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello together in this video I may 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.009
 imagine what a product 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.660
 created for me is and acts 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.150
 it is a protective foil for the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.889
 front and back of the iphone 5 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.660
 with me it was like this I got the phone 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.860
 but have won only once it 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.880
 apart from me a protective cover 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.230
 zuzukaufen 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.520
 not because I was spiritual but 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.560
 just because I like this beautiful 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.480
 Mobile phone did not want to hide - but 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.699
 unfortunately so in the pants pocket too 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.560
 Scratches can come easily through sand 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.090
 and dust on the iphone 5 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.189
 especially greedy side too 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.789
 prone to finger brave and even 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.679
 scratch 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.540
 This product offers us a good one 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.040
 But protection is invisible 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.320
 I can point out that that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.239
 whole for 499 in the first two 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.100
 december weeks as the action price too 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.420
 buy the link he will be in the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.309
 description spox under this video 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.680
 its ok then let's have the slides 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.059
 Apply before it starts shows you 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.460
 still fast what in this scope 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.110
 Included is a microfiber cloth and that 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.809
 to clean mobile phone and then overall 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.329
 four foil sets at these two sets 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.399
 so here's that for that at the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.350
 Foil for the back of the phone that 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.670
 Apple logo excreted here I am 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.240
 hope you can see that in the camera 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.010
 and this is because otherwise it will be 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.140
 blistering can come - but not 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.270
 so bothers the two can use 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.619
 there it is not cut out 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.540
 I'll be here this once 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.549
 use field where just the back 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.330
 cut out is we start but on 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.790
 with the front and here is the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.189
 spin off the martian like before fiction too 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.740
 German that please pull down 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.329
 before we put the foil on where I am 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.710
 would almost have forgotten displays 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.509
 that of course we went the wrong 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.020
 if the dust is from there then that is 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.520
 not nice 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:48.659
 So clean it quickly and check it for a short time 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.659
 she looks good well as I said this 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.170
 pull down and I have help us 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.479
 still my mensa card brought here 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.540
 with whom I then pull the bubbles away 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.229
 So, of course, the whole thing must be very 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.229
 fit exactly 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:14.360
 I do not even like it yet 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.290
 further back 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.630
 What he is allowed to do a little bit of time 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.000
 you wasting so really a 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.110
 can achieve a nice result 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.709
 and now this is good because now 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.930
 Slowly the plastic protection is in front of her 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.700
 undergo and then beautiful after 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:45.050
 stripes look that no bubbles 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:47.820
 imprisoned are okay and now here 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.760
 oil flows on the knife remained ation 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.130
 completed means pulling this film down 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.959
 if you get the first slide right 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.500
 attached is what we did 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.350
 because they are down here I already see 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:07.730
 a big bubble I now with the 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.730
 bring mensa map away 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.269
 So I do not see any bubbles anymore 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.530
 the whole time 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.470
 So I can call the phone beautiful 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.860
 operate as always feels on solid 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.860
 on and the color reproduction is also 1 1 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.660
 then we come to the back I have 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.250
 she just cleaned and here 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.220
 is in the film just like the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.380
 iphone itself that the back in three 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.790
 different parts is here it looks 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.560
 here once with relax for the 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.019
 camera then the main part with the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.360
 cut out apple logo and here 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:49.709
 below the rounded like the iphone 5 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.209
 itself also included are these 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.790
 The two red stripes make us easy 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.690
 Here are these small parts and help 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.090
 better access below and indeed lies 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.780
 we just can here in the factory and 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.150
 then subtract nicely without being around big 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.730
 to have to fidget with the fingers 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.500
 Ok then, even as with the procedure itself 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.040
 front here just look that 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.040
 exactly 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:19.560
 So let the camera nice here 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.910
 you only take pictures and can take 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.049
 then down here I do draw on 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.190
 I need the receiver for that now 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.200
 no mensa card 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.850
 I think that should complain as well 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.350
 ok then just nice here 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.860
 stripes look that no air underneath 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.300
 stays and the whole thing really great 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.979
 worked right in the first attempt 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.300
 ok we go with the big 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.000
 I will be the main part for that again 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.940
 I need my mensa map and we 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.389
 pull out the foil here free me 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.030
 be aware of them down to the very edge 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:05:02.729
 to start here 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:05:03.600
 not quite okay either and then 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.240
 is it good 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:11.340
 so here course streak if the 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:20.220
 grab a map and get stuck here 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:21.800
 Come see if that fits too 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.539
 exactly was made by me here 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.900
 i would say pass is good indicator 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:29.039
 this is the circle for the apple logo 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.550
 cut out just as you thought 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.289
 is 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.180
 so and now the last part of the 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.419
 back I have to help again 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:41.000
 The red stripes are now taken 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.000
 install foil here in the bottom 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:47.729
 so find the corner here and then from 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:51.360
 overlap left to right 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.550
 if all this then just stick the 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.830
 red stripes tighten again 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.510
 to check whether also 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:02.720
 no bubbles are locked up 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:05.720
 Here is a lasso out knead and 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.099
 then let's have a look at the result 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.740
 front and back are now the slides 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:13.320
 on it and the mobile phone has a solid 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.900
 protection and is it really invisible 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.400
 but no function is limited 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.539
 my conclusion to this film 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.890
 I've had them for a few now 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.050
 on it and I have to say really 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.630
 The display operability is ever 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.760
 does not affect the color reproduction 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.860
 you can change text razor sharp 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.930
 also read the foil application 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.980
 it was very easy that gives me one 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.270
 clear purchase recommendation 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.440
 I thank all the audience 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.440
 until the next video
