00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:18.759
 times to the eyes and legends such a question 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.180

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.160

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.169
 what inside could call 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.689
 What are the merits of the training center? 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:32.770
 flaws and help or whether you 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:34.510
 learning at work or starting 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.690
 center opens because when 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.850

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.310

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.240
 ok here 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.840
 practice is good here 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.440
 then take care as usual 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.809
 are provided 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:02.059
 further learning and smile want them 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.950
 problems answering questions, etc. 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:09.700
 i.e 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:12.070
 what care dignity disadvantages but 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.320
 disadvantages honestly well you even on 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.229
 3 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.560
 we jumped up mind couldn't find yet 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.760
 for me there is no dignity inside 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.370
 their dinner hall is very nice to her 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.550
 nice talking 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.310
 quality training focused on 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.100
 result to release decent 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.770
 masters 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.770
 country soup but what is it strong 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.130
 said the job is also very important whale 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:47.780
 we can buy after training 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:51.740
 right here on the material for work 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.360
 and polite staff advertising what would you 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.470
 could advise the master that 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.860
 just starting to work from the south and here 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.680
 for a start we should improve our 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.259
 technique but this is exactly my opinion 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.220
 that is, the technique of this 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:13.900
 procedures and court i would have included and 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.790
 After processing let's shugaring 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.060
 probably this is the most basic feeling 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.130
 start practicing the practice of practice here 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.019
 then develop further that is 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.790
 acquire additional knowledge 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:31.130
 expand customer base create website 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.130
 a page on the internet, that is, I don't know 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:39.069
 it is generally a large field of activity 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:41.390
 It seems I can you customers on the twine or 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.390
 until 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.840
 I think that bye because bye 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.910
 consider and here I am a beginner master 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.310
 there are not many customers yet 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.670
 so we actually ended up here 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.180
 at the alumni meeting and talented 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.980

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.340
