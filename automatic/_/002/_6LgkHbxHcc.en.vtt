to<00:05:34.390> me<00:05:34.420> I<00:05:34.630> talked<00:05:35.200> about<00:05:35.290> in<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:35.560> other<00:05:35.710> video

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
to me I talked about in the other video

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.710 
to me I talked about in the other video
how<00:05:36.250> I<00:05:36.280> thought<00:05:36.640> maybe<00:05:36.940> the<00:05:37.330> world<00:05:37.540> was

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
how I thought maybe the world was

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.380 
how I thought maybe the world was
smaller<00:05:38.580> maybe<00:05:39.580> that's<00:05:39.850> just<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.210> world

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
smaller maybe that's just the world

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.090 
smaller maybe that's just the world
maybe<00:05:40.570> we're<00:05:40.750> going<00:05:40.840> to<00:05:40.930> see<00:05:41.110> more<00:05:41.410> off<00:05:41.650> in<00:05:42.010> the

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
maybe we're going to see more off in the

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.400 
maybe we're going to see more off in the
right<00:05:42.310> here<00:05:42.550> I<00:05:42.580> don't<00:05:42.940> know<00:05:43.120> but<00:05:43.390> to<00:05:44.110> me<00:05:44.260> this

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
right here I don't know but to me this

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.900 
right here I don't know but to me this
looks<00:05:44.470> like<00:05:44.740> a<00:05:44.800> residential<00:05:45.220> area<00:05:45.490> in<00:05:45.730> the

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
looks like a residential area in the

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.700 
looks like a residential area in the
center<00:05:46.150> here<00:05:46.300> on<00:05:46.570> to<00:05:46.690> the<00:05:46.780> left<00:05:47.020> to<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.620> right

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
center here on to the left to the right

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.530 
center here on to the left to the right

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
and up a bit I think that's a commercial

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.330 
and up a bit I think that's a commercial
area<00:05:49.750> it's<00:05:50.170> like<00:05:50.260> a<00:05:50.320> little<00:05:50.410> Riviera<00:05:50.920> place

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
area it's like a little Riviera place

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.830 
area it's like a little Riviera place
