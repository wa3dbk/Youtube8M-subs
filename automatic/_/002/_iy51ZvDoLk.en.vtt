00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:41.859 
trouble and not put a new one in it but

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:43.109

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.380 
I'm gonna clean it and see how much
light<00:01:43.479> passes<00:01:44.110> through<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.469> then<00:01:45.239> alright<00:01:46.239> I

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
light passes through it then alright I

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.699 
light passes through it then alright I
used<00:01:46.539> took<00:01:46.689> a<00:01:46.719> little<00:01:46.989> brake<00:01:47.200> cleaner<00:01:47.530> and

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
used took a little brake cleaner and

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.109 
used took a little brake cleaner and
blew<00:01:47.890> through<00:01:48.159> it<00:01:49.409> blew<00:01:50.409> arity<00:01:51.159> plumb<00:01:51.579> clean

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
blew through it blew arity plumb clean

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.510 
blew through it blew arity plumb clean
but<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:54.579> quite<00:01:54.939> a<00:01:54.969> difference<00:01:55.539> I<00:01:56.159> think<00:01:57.159> it's

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
but it's quite a difference I think it's

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.819 
but it's quite a difference I think it's
our<00:01:57.700> problem<00:02:00.989> it's<00:02:01.989> a<00:02:02.079> very<00:02:02.289> border<00:02:02.619> some

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
our problem it's a very border some

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.109 
our problem it's a very border some
