00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello everyone on the other side of the monitor and you 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.910
 probably already thought that this movie 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.490
 another raid on stupid schoolchildren 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.519
 Well, almost would not say that the rage rather 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.670
 clearly accessible explanation in PM to me 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.800
 already a dozen messages 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:22.769
 again I find the slope and so on 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.920
 guys i like most of those whom you 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.410
 ask and am not an employee 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.910
 rockstar and know how much fps you will have 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.759
 or will the game go on your pc 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.399
 I just can not physically know how 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.890
 nobody else listen we all remember 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.020
 unity or problems with Danila there who 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.660
 There they fixed in a month or even two 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.510
 do not think that gta 5 on pc will 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.730
 written out for any bugs and 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.039
 other which rockstar will go along 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.230
 affairs fix another question more often those who 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.930
 ask the question will go whether plans 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.920
 buy gta 5 thereby burying the exit 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.620
 next gta 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.629
 I will explain my point of view clearly that 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.820
 the five were so exclusive to themselves 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.519
 old and new consoles first 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.950
 due to the failure of 4 parts on p. 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.080
 I may be mistaken for a four on the console 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.200
 bought about 30 million 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.450
 she is still only three that is in essence 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.640
 rockstar made a gift to the owners 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.070
 while buying four for a long time and deciding 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.080
 I do not think to earn extra money 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.030
 do year after year for degree 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.549
 mistrust is growing with every download 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.100
 pirate better copy 50 rubles a day 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.560
 and buy somewhere you get more buzz than 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.930
 from any other game I guarantee it 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.119
 brother kay drive around the bands tusu and cleaving 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.220
 expanses of the ocean on boats and so I 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.880
 a little distracted by the system 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.490
 requirements 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.439
 as you know, I have in fact comp 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.200
 consists of minimum requirements for 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.710
