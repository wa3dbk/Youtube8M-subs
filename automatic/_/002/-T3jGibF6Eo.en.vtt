00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.910

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.190
 chopping his flesh and bones his head 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.390
 falls to the floor before he felt 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.969
 new pain from hitting 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.809

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.080
 I know who gets the data, I know only that 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.930
 after returning

 victims are always waiting for me new skulls 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.750
 heaped up in my line of duty 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.659
 no one will surpass my score today 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.740
 the old legion encouraged the contest 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.320
 undoubtedly when I first appeared 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.369

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.310
 shifted on the views of this giant 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.479
 his naked torso pulsed 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.459
 superhuman strength and flaunted 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.130
 artfully made by a tattoo of some kind 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.770
 canid predator drunkard 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.540
 in sacrifice though the scars from intensifying 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.910
 the surgeries were still fresh 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.580
 we were considered ready to start training 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.670
 legionnaires we will start not with bolters and 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.350
 axes he continued and I will not tell you 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.050

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.940
 the subject of the key bear on the hip and 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.780
 respectfully handed it to us in dim 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.940
 in the light of dawn 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.400
 because of the huge fingers looked empty 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.790
 eye socket smooth bone was polished 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.770
 almost to shine all legionnaires are involved 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.680
 in competition the rules are simple 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.230
 first to collect a thousand skulls in a group 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.960
 ran a nervous rumble one 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.710
 neophyte raised his hand my lord what we 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.420
 win the groomer shrugged unknown 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.780
 no one else gets close enough 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.930
 close when he carefully put the skull 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.750
 into place I gently raised my hand my lord 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.060
 where do we get the skull 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.710
 tattooed giant roaring with laughter 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.290
 attracting the attention of other legionaries and 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.440
 neophytes who witnessed my 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.350
 first humiliation several times convulsively 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.840
 blinking and getting rid of my memories 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.680
 feelings came back I charged the flamethrower on 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.830
 shoulder and quickened the road under your feet 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.170
 unreliable blood which is before free 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.420
 flowed over the plates now freezes and over 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.380
 fast-moving rock 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.650
 through sky nights 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.110
 the armor of the fallen covers frost and there 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.140
 where the child of their bloodshed worked 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.000
 mark darker spots cinnabar i 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.600
 definitely not faced with such 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.300
 cold 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.120
 this is a shallow street from the tundra on the hydra not 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.830
 5 and no ice storms that cleaned up 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.190
 mountain road to Tekeli 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.680
 this cold burns and bites the cold 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.330
 which threatens to abduct an internal fire 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.780
 but not me 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:10.290
 victory or death the price is huge never 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.130
 no longer lose i won't let ours 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.770
 enemies will fall 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.070
 or instead of them we will offer a correspondent 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.769
 yourself to the west in the dark is a howl 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.299
 regular sound attack my shoes 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.090
 glide over the wreckage 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.940
 when i go back to the sound inside me 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.520
 rage fulgrim again rises 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.850
 maybe threw them but his bastard 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.160
 the kids will pay for me too late 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.380
 noticed an ambush 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.710
 time slows the shadows around me 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.630
 burst outbreaks were tyrnovo fire 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.090
 shells are torn and punched by splinters 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.640
 the flesh of my bare hand behind 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.240
 milliseconds to jump, I count 3 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.890
 shooters and another naked figure 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.500
 the gun is in my hand before 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.600
 as I get off the ground and flash 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.330
 hot plasma vaporizes head 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.900
 nearest hitter fleeting 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.900
 regret for the loss of the skull 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.940
 1303 stray shell beats my bib 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.919
 changing the direction of my jump and 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.800
 force me to kill 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.200
 warrior spontaneous kickback I 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.940
 turn around to chop the bolter 3 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.820
 after which I upset him 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.430
 unconscious body to the ground and fling 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.470
 child of bloodshed to the left chain ax 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.930
 stabs deep into the throat of the last 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.930
 legionary and arterial blood beats with 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.440
 Here I read the roof of the arcade 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:37.140
 1305 furious hla I am standing over prostrate 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.710
 warriors who fumbles for 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.690
 weapons 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:45.030
 words of anger his face is familiar to me gruner 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.790
 he lies among the bodies of our fallen brothers 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.490
 and speaks of madness and betrayal 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.500
 he curses me berserker champion 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.590
 who will keep his legion 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.650
 again and again puppy carer who are you 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.220
 such as to doubt me first 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.990
 climbed the walls of the imperial palace 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.180
 the last to leave is terou when take and 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.160
 lion's gate my body was worn out 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.979
 killing one million servants 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.030
 no one will ever surpass the emperor 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:16.320
 my score 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:18.830
 the match is over i won the reason for 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.600
 which we were defeated by the weakness of others 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.240
 weakness in other regions and our 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.800
 own if that's all that's left of 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.860
 Honor World Eaters 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:33.530
