00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.320
 hello people welcome and welcome 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.500
 again today I want to make another one with easy 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.530
 and this time I will try my gelatin 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.919
 or mine coil if you want to see how the 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.300
 I do from here I'll leave the nasa 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.950
 to go directly to the video 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.670
 then this is gelatin 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:30.000
 has oils that as you can see this is the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.780
 the consistency that is thrown away is similar 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.280
 that of sticky ghostbusters 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.090
 and well I have my hair washed as 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.360
 always maybe I'm not going to wet it just 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.360
 bit 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.239
 to make the application easier 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.530
 because after it's water it's going to be 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.530
 Social 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.790
 i 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.749
 ah 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.590
 and now as the application has finished 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.299
 I'm going to dry it and show you how 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.539
 the difference between the side that already has 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.049
 and the one that now we see now I have the 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.789
 hair 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.950
 on this side 80% dry more or less and 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.810
 in this also what happens is that today 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.310
 I'm in a great hurry and I do not have much 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.290
 time and I have to do this fast 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.670
 so I can not wait for me to be 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.790
 completely dry I have to do this 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.349
 part already because if I 'm going to be late 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.750
 the question is to see here 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.989
 even how is the curl defined 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.989
 ideal 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.550
 this is the part that has nothing 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.500
 Y 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.330
 as always obvious that if I get 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.910
 something that has oils that I 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.650
 try to have water the hair is going to 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.350
 see better with anything that without 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.380
 nothing but to see the difference 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.300
 one thing and another besides that I like 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.300
 because it lengthens me a lot 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.540
 I'm here, we have to wait for it to be dry 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.540
 dry all 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.720
 I'm going to put myself in this part now and 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.920
 I will show you the final result 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.800
 variant and this is the end result there 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.050
 they are completely dry because I have prey 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.020
 As I already told you and well I will take a photo 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.910
 when they are 100% dry you will have 5% 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.920
 for drying is nothing more and good has 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.480
 I really liked to tell you that I've 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.430
 used all the amount of the 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.120
 gelatin that I had prepared because as 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.560
 I only got gelatin 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.500
 needed water and absorbed water from the 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.540
 gelatin when I use it with a living 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.430
 then he usually uses only half but 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.020
 it does not matter is another way to use it has 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.840
 liked a lot so it does not define the curl 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:58.190
 as it has the oils is in the 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:01.310
 moisture sealed and also is with something 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.170
 of brightness and nourished I liked what 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.880
 I would continue to use so too tell them that 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.610
 I like to use it for when you want 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.160
 rekindle the curl because as it has a lot 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.590
 water gives me more nutrition hydration 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.420
 that when I just use a weird 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.100
 atomizer because my kisses do not like 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.890
 that is that those spray 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.130
 since they want more water and what 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.860
 does it is that the frizz is put in order 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.720
 so I hope you also what 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.330
 try because this jelly has the 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.180
 3b good nice and cheap this ecological 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.640
 economic is practical you can save it 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.530
 in the fridge you can add your oil 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.180
 is that you want you can add the oil 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.180
 essential of some value of your 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.980
 preference and it goes pretty well what can you 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.600
 use it to comb it so that you 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.670
 define the hairstyle the risk as the 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.230
 gelatin like the bovine they sell in 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.680
 all sides so can you 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:54.920
 use it and well I hope you try it 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:59.090

 love doing this with easy and apart 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.510
 that I teach you that I am

 testing myself also things that there was 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:11.740
