00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.619
 that you friends so here to name 59 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.990
 so today I'm not going to do 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.689
 tutorials but I'm going to make a 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.919
 comparison of mobile games then to 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.130
 every time in this series I'm going 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:29.829
 go out about a video a month and I 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.349
 will make a ranking of the top five 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.320
 games for mobiles while it's for 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.290
 mobile tablets we do not care it will 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.990
 walk for both and that is to 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.450
 ios or android games will always be 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.860
 compatible for both without more 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.410
 delay I will let you discover 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.730
 the first five games for this 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.950
 first video the game in fifth 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.230
 position is of course that ety crooked 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.000
 saga even though this game is really very 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.730
 well frozen put in last position 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.489
 since it's a game 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.379
 endless and lasts after a while 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.810
 However, while the game was very well 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.980
 thought the connection with facebook allows 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.740
 to your friends that 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.810
 see lives though is a big 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.420
 negative point in we were picking up guys 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.659
 golden we were limited to 5 hours 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.119
 maximum and we only have to keur 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.090
 and a half hour game good train another 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.770
 negative point also it is that we 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.170
 have to ask our friends from us 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.700
 unlock at certain game places this 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.219
 which is really not very practical 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.689
 that's why I put when 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.689
 dropouts in last position 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.280
 fourth in my ranking 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.900
 is surfing the game is 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.790
 escaped the guard who is chasing you 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.250
 following the damage caused to 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.470
 rods going the player will weigh 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.750
 pieces there to then improve his 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.140
 equipment or buy new ones 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.140
 objects 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.530
 in third position I placed jetpack 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.060
 ried 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.680
 as you can see this 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.560
 scientist and that sees by going 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.140
 work a magnificent getac he does 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.209
 so can not help stealing it your 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.030
 mission if you accept it is to finish 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.769
 of plowing the goal is to go the most 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.720
 far possible without being touched by 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.519
 panels and pediatricians 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.220

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.879

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.390
 if we 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.889
 in second place I placed of course 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.870
 that top this little green man always 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.919

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.630
 hamas guitar candy in is pink is 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.940
 managed starting in three seasons with

 shakir several cartons after one 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.410
 moment the game becomes more and more 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.449
 hard but that's nothing when we start 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.030

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:52.479
