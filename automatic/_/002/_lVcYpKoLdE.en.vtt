00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.370
 By popular request, I say today times 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.400
 a small practical helper and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.320
 although from the company monster tronic in the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.740
 feeder where other batteries 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.740
 can send 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.300
 in one of my videos I have yes 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.520
 Explains that it is not good if you 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.620
 batteries in micro batteries full or or 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.320
 especially empty stores then take the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.340
 damage batteries 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.140
 many have the difficulties too 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.010
 recognize yes Christmas is full 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.550
 my battery is empty 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.520
 That's what this little helper is good for 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.760
 how is the checker and based on a 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.910
 Lipo batteries from Kyoto a 3 cell battery 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.219
 with 2500 milliampere I show you once 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.469
 how the thing works connection 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:04.019
 his device then shows the device 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.000
 first time the complete battery 11.4 clouds 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.479
 this case and then you can cell 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.259
 Send the individual cells through 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:20.490
 cell 1 3789 cell 2 3 811 cell 338 04 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.500
 special feature in the checker he is still 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.150
 whatever he can balance that is 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.040
 if i have longer time on this type 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:32.460
 can push button to beep and shows 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.590
 me in the ad to the cells yes 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.920
 furthest apart are so in this 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.840
 2 trap cell single cell which it is 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.409
 So now producing again a 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.409
 easy to install 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.049
 which is a bit annoying by the way 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.659
 the checker is balancing this 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.119
 must continue to be on running to 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.020
 This type button is about 20 seconds 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.880
 Press to keep this mode 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.659
 he should indicate by flashing 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.420
 type in this case hypo and the 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.209
 count the asians in the case as stated 1 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.060
 and 2 that should blink when he does that 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.530
 do not do so then do not balance 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.300
 that we have now canceled lenzen 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.209
 because we still have the functions of 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.450
 Fashion buttons wanted to show fashion like that 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:27.709
 button there you can still recognize show 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.180
 I'll give you the difference now 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.459
 between the worst and the worst 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.269
 best cell in the trap is it count 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.930
 single cell two as I said then at 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.470
 Next time press the best cell in 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.330
 In the trap it is the cell 2 and the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.269
 worst cell in the case the cell 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.019
 next time press one times 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:54.140
 again on the total number of wood with the 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.060
 You can use the middle cell button 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.160
 individual just stop by just checking 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.349
 now when I press on it the doctor 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.599
 1 to how much they wanted was still 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.349
 times on it press cell 2 and again 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.690
 press on it 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.950
 celle 3 and the next time again the 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:13.190
 We have all the total wood numbers 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.459
 parameter the depot batteries with the 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.560
 small checker queried if you more 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.450
 learn about the construction of a lipo battery 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.079
 Just click here on the bottom right 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.079
 on the video 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.410
 and as always if you liked it

 thumbs up 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.220
 otherwise we are happy about everyone
