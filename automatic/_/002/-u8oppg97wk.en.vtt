micro<00:02:07.460> beading<00:02:07.790> obviously<00:02:08.330> or<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.540> mean<00:02:08.750> caviar

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
micro beading obviously or I mean caviar

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.389 
micro beading obviously or I mean caviar
nails<00:02:09.410> because<00:02:09.830> obviously<00:02:10.009> they're

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
nails because obviously they're

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.200 
nails because obviously they're
microbeads<00:02:11.030> but<00:02:11.690> these<00:02:12.470> are<00:02:12.680> clear<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.400> they

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
microbeads but these are clear and they

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.470 
microbeads but these are clear and they
kind<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.510> adapt<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:15.260> any<00:02:15.680> any<00:02:16.490> color<00:02:16.790> polish<00:02:17.270> so

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
kind of adapt to any any color polish so

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.630 
kind of adapt to any any color polish so
it<00:02:17.630> works<00:02:17.810> out<00:02:17.960> perfect<00:02:18.320> because<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:19.400> was

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
it works out perfect because this was

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.210 
it works out perfect because this was
only<00:02:19.790> 399<00:02:20.570> and<00:02:20.600> I<00:02:20.900> think<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.200> used<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.500> 40%<00:02:22.160> off

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
only 399 and I think I used a 40% off

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.240 
only 399 and I think I used a 40% off
coupon<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:23.240> for<00:02:23.480> like<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.630> dollar<00:02:23.870> 75<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:25.070> can

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
coupon so for like a dollar 75 you can

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.520 
coupon so for like a dollar 75 you can
get<00:02:25.430> pretty<00:02:26.150> much<00:02:26.270> any<00:02:26.690> kind<00:02:26.990> of<00:02:27.110> caviar

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
get pretty much any kind of caviar

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.410 
get pretty much any kind of caviar
colored<00:02:27.890> nail<00:02:28.100> you<00:02:28.310> like<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.910> they<00:02:29.120> have<00:02:29.270> like

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
colored nail you like and they have like

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.390 
colored nail you like and they have like
a<00:02:29.450> rainbow<00:02:29.750> tint<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.800> them<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:31.040> doubt<00:02:31.250> the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
a rainbow tint to them I doubt the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.520 
a rainbow tint to them I doubt the
lighting<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:31.790> picking<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.180> up<00:02:32.300> but<00:02:32.900> they<00:02:33.320> have

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
lighting is picking it up but they have

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.890 
lighting is picking it up but they have
like<00:02:33.709> a<00:02:33.820> iridescent<00:02:34.820> glow<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.300> them<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:35.690> yeah

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
like a iridescent glow to them so yeah

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.840 
like a iridescent glow to them so yeah
this<00:02:36.140> is<00:02:36.320> absolutely<00:02:36.860> perfect<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.490> I<00:02:37.580> love

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
this is absolutely perfect and I love

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.790 
this is absolutely perfect and I love
the<00:02:38.030> top<00:02:38.240> of<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.540> because<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.930> has<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.350> sifter

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
the top of it because it has a sifter

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.900 
the top of it because it has a sifter
and<00:02:39.950> then<00:02:40.490> an<00:02:40.610> actual<00:02:40.910> hole<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.420> pour<00:02:41.690> out<00:02:41.930> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
and then an actual hole to pour out the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.070 
and then an actual hole to pour out the
microbeads<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.300> then<00:02:44.450> I'm<00:02:44.540> also<00:02:44.690> going<00:02:44.990> to

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
microbeads and then I'm also going to

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.960 
microbeads and then I'm also going to
use<00:02:45.170> just<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.650> little<00:02:45.680> Bowl<00:02:46.130> anything<00:02:46.730> really

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
use just a little Bowl anything really

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.730 
use just a little Bowl anything really
to<00:02:47.120> catch<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.750> excess<00:02:47.900> beads<00:02:48.350> is<00:02:48.530> going<00:02:48.680> to

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
to catch the excess beads is going to

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.890 
to catch the excess beads is going to
work<00:02:48.860> perfect<00:02:49.310> once<00:02:49.640> I've<00:02:49.850> applied<00:02:49.970> one<00:02:50.420> one

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
work perfect once I've applied one one

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.930 
work perfect once I've applied one one

soon as I put that second coat I'm gonna
take<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.440> microbeads<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.310> just<00:03:01.519> dump<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.480> all

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:09.340 
take the microbeads and just dump it all
over<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:03.170> over<00:03:03.410> this<00:03:03.980> bowl<00:03:04.220> like<00:03:04.430> this<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:09.200> you

over it over this bowl like this and you

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.930 
over it over this bowl like this and you
can<00:03:09.470> apply<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.890> kind<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.250> thickly<00:03:10.489> cuz<00:03:10.790> it

can apply it kind of thickly cuz it
really<00:03:10.970> doesn't<00:03:11.480> matter<00:03:11.570> once<00:03:12.290> I've<00:03:12.410> applied

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
really doesn't matter once I've applied

that second coat I'm gonna take my bowl

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.290 
that second coat I'm gonna take my bowl
like<00:03:14.720> I<00:03:14.870> said<00:03:15.260> I'm<00:03:16.250> gonna<00:03:16.400> hold<00:03:16.670> my<00:03:16.760> thumb<00:03:17.060> over

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
like I said I'm gonna hold my thumb over

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.410 
like I said I'm gonna hold my thumb over
the<00:03:17.600> bowl<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.560> I'm<00:03:19.430> just<00:03:19.610> gonna<00:03:19.730> take<00:03:20.060> the

the bowl and I'm just gonna take the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.750 
the bowl and I'm just gonna take the
like<00:03:21.019> unfiltered<00:03:21.769> side<00:03:22.040> of<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.280> microbeads

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
like unfiltered side of the microbeads

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.729 
like unfiltered side of the microbeads
and<00:03:23.030> dump<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:24.050> right<00:03:24.320> over<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.830> nails<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:27.620> as

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
and dump it right over the nails and as

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.380 
and dump it right over the nails and as
you<00:03:27.890> can<00:03:28.010> see<00:03:28.190> like<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.550> bowl<00:03:28.760> catches<00:03:29.300> the

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
you can see like the bowl catches the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.850 
you can see like the bowl catches the
excess<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.050> then<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:32.510> wet<00:03:32.720> polish<00:03:33.110> has<00:03:33.350> taken

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
excess and then the wet polish has taken

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.130 
excess and then the wet polish has taken
all<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.370> actual<00:03:34.820> little<00:03:35.390> microbeads<00:03:35.810> so

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
all of the actual little microbeads so

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.650 
all of the actual little microbeads so
the<00:03:37.070> way<00:03:37.190> that<00:03:37.220> I<00:03:37.400> feel<00:03:37.670> like<00:03:37.700> makes<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.330> stick

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
the way that I feel like makes it stick

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.020 
the way that I feel like makes it stick
really<00:03:39.140> well<00:03:39.350> it's<00:03:39.680> once<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.430> microbeads<00:03:40.880> are

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
really well it's once the microbeads are

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.530 
really well it's once the microbeads are
on<00:03:41.180> there

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
on there

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.150 
on there
zoomy<00:03:42.200> essence<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:42.650> could<00:03:42.769> see<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:42.920> little<00:03:43.040> bit

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
zoomy essence you could see a little bit

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.770 
zoomy essence you could see a little bit
better<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.430> kind<00:03:43.700> of<00:03:43.820> touch<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.269> top<00:03:44.480> of<00:03:44.660> it

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
better I kind of touch the top of it

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.720 
better I kind of touch the top of it
just<00:03:44.989> like<00:03:45.110> this<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:46.100> make<00:03:46.250> sure<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.580> the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
just like this to make sure that the

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.180 
just like this to make sure that the
beads<00:03:46.880> are<00:03:47.090> even<00:03:47.450> on<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.660> top<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.230> then<00:03:48.440> I<00:03:48.680> go

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
beads are even on the top and then I go

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.130 
beads are even on the top and then I go
around<00:03:49.549> and<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.150> kind<00:03:50.450> of<00:03:50.540> just<00:03:50.720> very<00:03:51.260> lightly

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
around and I kind of just very lightly

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.090

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
first it looks kind of like when I first

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.939 
first it looks kind of like when I first
did<00:05:40.509> this<00:05:40.659> and<00:05:40.840> I<00:05:40.900> saw<00:05:41.319> the<00:05:41.379> way<00:05:41.680> that<00:05:41.860> the

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
did this and I saw the way that the

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.249 
did this and I saw the way that the
topcoat<00:05:42.340> was<00:05:42.460> came<00:05:43.210> out<00:05:43.389> over<00:05:43.599> the<00:05:43.810> beads<00:05:44.050> I

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
topcoat was came out over the beads I

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:45.719 
topcoat was came out over the beads I
was<00:05:44.380> like<00:05:44.469> oh<00:05:44.590> it's<00:05:44.830> not<00:05:44.919> gonna<00:05:45.069> be<00:05:45.219> pretty<00:05:45.370> I

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
was like oh it's not gonna be pretty I

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.249 
was like oh it's not gonna be pretty I
don't<00:05:46.120> really<00:05:46.300> like<00:05:46.539> the<00:05:46.690> way<00:05:46.780> that<00:05:46.930> it<00:05:47.050> looks

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:47.259 
don't really like the way that it looks

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:48.600 
don't really like the way that it looks
but<00:05:47.440> it<00:05:47.530> actually<00:05:47.949> holds<00:05:48.130> them<00:05:48.340> in<00:05:48.460> and

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
but it actually holds them in and

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.730 
but it actually holds them in and
secures<00:05:48.909> them<00:05:49.090> pretty<00:05:49.690> well<00:05:49.750> and<00:05:50.139> I<00:05:50.259> like<00:05:50.469> the

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
secures them pretty well and I like the

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.320 
secures them pretty well and I like the
finish<00:05:50.949> of<00:05:51.219> it<00:05:51.370> it<00:05:51.520> doesn't<00:05:51.699> make<00:05:51.969> them<00:05:52.120> look

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
finish of it it doesn't make them look

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.149 
finish of it it doesn't make them look
it<00:05:52.599> makes<00:05:52.750> it<00:05:52.930> look<00:05:53.259> like<00:05:53.409> all<00:05:53.650> one<00:05:53.889> nail

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
it makes it look like all one nail

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.540 
it makes it look like all one nail
instead<00:05:54.669> of<00:05:54.819> multiple<00:05:55.779> little<00:05:56.289> beads<00:05:57.069> stuck

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
instead of multiple little beads stuck

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.930
