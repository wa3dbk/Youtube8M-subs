that's<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.640> small<00:00:41.940> bug<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:44.340> may

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
that's a small bug but it it's it may

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.310 
that's a small bug but it it's it may
get<00:00:44.730> fixed<00:00:45.059> one<00:00:45.180> day<00:00:45.329> but<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.719> some<00:00:45.899> reason

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
get fixed one day but for some reason

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.270 
get fixed one day but for some reason
it's<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:47.149> while<00:00:48.149> away<00:00:48.329> mg<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:50.070> been

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
it's a while away mg and I have been

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.540 
it's a while away mg and I have been
very<00:00:50.520> busy<00:00:50.820> I'm<00:00:51.120> afraid<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.160> imaginator<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
very busy I'm afraid so imaginator you

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.689 
very busy I'm afraid so imaginator you
can<00:00:53.699> change<00:00:54.500> basically<00:00:55.500> all<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.460> lighting

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
can change basically all the lighting

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
can change basically all the lighting
settings<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.629> example<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
settings so for example if we get to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.819 
settings so for example if we get to
contrast<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.640> change<00:00:59.940> brightness

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
contrast that you can change brightness

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.740 
contrast that you can change brightness
let's<00:01:01.829> make<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.460> little<00:01:03.090> brighter<00:01:03.329> I'm

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
let's make it a little brighter I'm

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.380 
let's make it a little brighter I'm
going<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.960> increase<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.350> brightness<00:01:04.439> by<00:01:04.920> 10

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
going to increase the brightness by 10

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.170 
going to increase the brightness by 10
so<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.630> rightness<00:01:07.470> increased<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.700> can

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
so you see rightness increased I can

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.980 
so you see rightness increased I can
decrease<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.500> all<00:01:10.680> reset<00:01:11.869> you<00:01:12.869> can

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
decrease it and so on all reset you can

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.999 
decrease it and so on all reset you can
do<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> same<00:01:13.409> for<00:01:13.920> contrast<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.770> even<00:01:16.770> things

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
do the same for contrast and even things

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.240 
do the same for contrast and even things
like<00:01:17.390> saturation<00:01:18.390> if<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
like saturation if you if you like the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.859 
like saturation if you if you like the
deep<00:01:21.180> fantasy<00:01:22.080> look<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.610> very<00:01:23.610> vibrant<00:01:24.420> colors

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
deep fantasy look of very vibrant colors

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.999 
deep fantasy look of very vibrant colors
you<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:26.210> crank<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.810> saturation<00:01:28.409> right

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
you can just crank the saturation right

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:29.960 
you can just crank the saturation right
up<00:01:29.220> there<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.640> go

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
up there you go

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.700 
up there you go
you<00:01:30.119> can<00:01:30.240> see<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.049> greens<00:01:31.380> are<00:01:31.619> now

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
you can see the greens are now

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.460 
you can see the greens are now
exceptionally<00:01:32.460> green<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.090> sunsets<00:01:33.720> become

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
exceptionally green the sunsets become

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.090 
exceptionally green the sunsets become
very<00:01:35.400> sort<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> red<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.299> purple<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:37.619> reset

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
very sort of red and purple you reset

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.670 
very sort of red and purple you reset
that<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.360> that's<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.900> mod<00:01:40.140> does<00:01:40.170> in

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that and so that's what this mod does in

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.819 
that and so that's what this mod does in
but<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.560> simple<00:01:43.560> things<00:01:43.619> like

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
but it's not just for simple things like

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.170 
but it's not just for simple things like
contrast<00:01:44.729> light<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.509> set<00:01:46.340> saturation<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.640> is

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
contrast light and set saturation it is

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.069 
contrast light and set saturation it is
also<00:01:48.479> for<00:01:49.110> some<00:01:49.380> more<00:01:50.060> mm<00:01:51.060> well<00:01:51.750> more

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
also for some more mm well more

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.929 
also for some more mm well more
impressive<00:01:52.890> things<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:53.520> change<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
impressive things you can change the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.270 
impressive things you can change the
tint<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> game<00:01:54.810> make<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.320> redder<00:01:55.619> bluer

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
tint of the game make it redder bluer

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.510

greener<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:58.159> but<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.280> when<00:01:59.430> you

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.910 
greener and so on but it's when you
start<00:01:59.579> getting<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.299> cinematic<00:02:01.200> settings

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
start getting to the cinematic settings

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.520

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
see the bloom appearing over the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.450 
see the bloom appearing over the
mountains<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:09.560> keep<00:02:10.560> cranking<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.220> bloom

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
mountains it's keep cranking the bloom

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.510 
mountains it's keep cranking the bloom
up<00:02:11.580> as<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.820> can<00:02:11.940> see<00:02:12.150> here<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> lot<00:02:12.690> more<00:02:12.930> bloom

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520

strongly if you have a look where was

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.390 
strongly if you have a look where was
the<00:03:08.760> one<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:08.910> wanted<00:03:09.540> magic<00:03:10.500> hour<00:03:10.620> for<00:03:10.950> example

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
the one I wanted magic hour for example

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.440 
the one I wanted magic hour for example
there<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.090> go

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
there you go

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.590 
there you go
you'll<00:03:12.900> see<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.110> slight<00:03:13.680> increase<00:03:13.709> in

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
you'll see a slight increase in

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.910 
you'll see a slight increase in
saturation<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:16.320> gives<00:03:16.500> everything<00:03:16.769> a

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
saturation and it gives everything a

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.210 
saturation and it gives everything a
slightly<00:03:17.250> softer<00:03:17.940> look<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.769> so<00:03:19.769> on<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.040> every

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
slightly softer look and so on and every

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.580 
slightly softer look and so on and every
time<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.489> click<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:21.090> increases<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.989> by<00:03:22.170> one

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
time I click this it increases it by one

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.000 
time I click this it increases it by one
and<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:22.920> can<00:03:23.790> stack<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.720> presets<00:03:25.200> I'm<00:03:25.860> going

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
and you can stack the presets I'm going

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.190 
and you can stack the presets I'm going
to<00:03:26.070> remove<00:03:26.280> them<00:03:26.489> all<00:03:26.610> now

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
to remove them all now

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.170 
to remove them all now
so<00:03:28.200> that's<00:03:28.769> how<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.040> do<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.370> but<00:03:29.850> as<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.000> can

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
so that's how you do it but as you can

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.050 
so that's how you do it but as you can

saturation<00:04:31.860> a<00:04:32.460> little<00:04:32.760> bit<00:04:34.400> decrease<00:04:35.400> the

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
saturation a little bit decrease the

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.230 
saturation a little bit decrease the
contrast<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:37.400> increase<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.550> brightness<00:04:38.820> a

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
contrast and increase the brightness a

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.700 
contrast and increase the brightness a
fraction<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:39.810> have<00:04:39.930> no<00:04:40.169> idea<00:04:40.440> what<00:04:40.560> this<00:04:40.650> is

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
fraction I have no idea what this is

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.890 
fraction I have no idea what this is
going<00:04:40.949> to<00:04:41.039> look<00:04:41.160> like<00:04:41.310> but<00:04:42.120> you<00:04:42.300> can<00:04:42.479> see<00:04:42.600> I<00:04:42.630> can

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
going to look like but you can see I can

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.170 
going to look like but you can see I can
play<00:04:43.110> around<00:04:43.229> with<00:04:43.500> it<00:04:43.710> go<00:04:44.370> back<00:04:44.550> in<00:04:44.699> game<00:04:44.910> and

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
play around with it go back in game and

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.240 
play around with it go back in game and
there<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:45.960> go<00:04:46.139> a<00:04:46.380> sort<00:04:47.100> of<00:04:47.280> Oh<00:04:49.010> slightly<00:04:50.010> old

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
there you go a sort of Oh slightly old

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.570

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
obviously any changes that you make you

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.370 
obviously any changes that you make you
can't<00:05:09.360> see<00:05:09.780> until<00:05:10.620> you<00:05:10.680> leave<00:05:11.780> so<00:05:12.780> you<00:05:13.110> know<00:05:13.289> if

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
can't see until you leave so you know if

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.640 
can't see until you leave so you know if
I<00:05:13.530> crank<00:05:13.949> up<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:15.210> warm<00:05:15.479> Northern<00:05:15.930> Lights<00:05:16.199> to

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
I crank up the warm Northern Lights to

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.550 
I crank up the warm Northern Lights to
not<00:05:17.010> 0.4<00:05:17.520> which<00:05:17.699> is<00:05:17.940> by<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.150> way<00:05:18.270> overkill<00:05:19.080> if

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
not 0.4 which is by the way overkill if

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.560 
not 0.4 which is by the way overkill if
you<00:05:19.800> set<00:05:20.039> any<00:05:20.190> of<00:05:20.340> these<00:05:20.430> above<00:05:20.699> about<00:05:20.970> not<00:05:21.210> 0.3

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
you set any of these above about not 0.3

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.020 
you set any of these above about not 0.3
not<00:05:21.720> before<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.560> effect<00:05:22.889> is<00:05:23.099> as<00:05:23.310> you<00:05:23.849> can<00:05:23.880> see

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
not before the effect is as you can see

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.900 
not before the effect is as you can see
very<00:05:24.780> powerful<00:05:25.289> indeed<00:05:25.440> so<00:05:26.070> perhaps<00:05:26.729> you'd

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
very powerful indeed so perhaps you'd

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.290 
very powerful indeed so perhaps you'd
like<00:05:27.060> to<00:05:27.120> play<00:05:27.360> that<00:05:27.510> way<00:05:27.690> it's<00:05:28.470> a<00:05:28.530> little

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
like to play that way it's a little

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.330 
like to play that way it's a little
little<00:05:30.300> over-the-top<00:05:30.539> to<00:05:30.990> me<00:05:31.110> but<00:05:31.289> hey<00:05:31.770> used

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
little over-the-top to me but hey used

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.860 
little over-the-top to me but hey used
to<00:05:32.460> be<00:05:32.520> zone<00:05:32.729> that's<00:05:33.210> the<00:05:33.330> whole<00:05:33.449> idea<00:05:33.840> of

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
to be zone that's the whole idea of

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.990 
to be zone that's the whole idea of
imaginator<00:05:34.590> but<00:05:35.130> as<00:05:35.220> you<00:05:35.340> could<00:05:35.490> see<00:05:35.789> I

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
imaginator but as you could see I

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.600 
imaginator but as you could see I
couldn't<00:05:36.419> see<00:05:36.780> the<00:05:36.990> effect<00:05:37.349> until<00:05:37.949> I<00:05:37.979> exited

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
couldn't see the effect until I exited

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.180 
couldn't see the effect until I exited
the<00:05:38.789> menu<00:05:39.210> where<00:05:39.539> does<00:05:39.690> with<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:40.139> help<00:05:40.650> dialog

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
the menu where does with the help dialog

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.850 
the menu where does with the help dialog
you<00:05:41.760> see<00:05:42.030> it<00:05:42.120> as<00:05:42.360> it<00:05:42.510> goes<00:05:42.539> along<00:05:42.840> so<00:05:43.560> that<00:05:43.590> is

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
you see it as it goes along so that is

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.339 
you see it as it goes along so that is
one<00:05:44.190> disadvantage<00:05:44.599> what<00:05:45.599> I<00:05:45.630> really<00:05:46.229> would

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
one disadvantage what I really would

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.980 
one disadvantage what I really would
like<00:05:46.500> to<00:05:46.560> create<00:05:47.310> for<00:05:47.669> imaginator<00:05:48.479> is<00:05:48.750> a

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
like to create for imaginator is a

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.520 
like to create for imaginator is a
heads-up<00:05:49.710> display<00:05:50.340> menu<00:05:50.909> system<00:05:51.659> that<00:05:52.289> is

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
heads-up display menu system that is

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.980 
heads-up display menu system that is
easy<00:05:52.770> to<00:05:53.039> use<00:05:53.070> and<00:05:53.669> allows<00:05:54.210> you<00:05:54.599> to<00:05:54.750> change

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
easy to use and allows you to change

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.350 
easy to use and allows you to change
things<00:05:55.289> real<00:05:55.620> time<00:05:55.979> very<00:05:56.760> similar<00:05:57.120> to<00:05:57.270> the

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
things real time very similar to the

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.240 
things real time very similar to the
director's<00:05:57.990> chair<00:05:58.020> in<00:05:58.530> fallout<00:05:58.889> 3<00:05:59.220> and

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
director's chair in fallout 3 and

director's chair in fallout 3 and
Fallout<00:05:59.460> New<00:05:59.789> Vegas<00:06:00.169> but<00:06:01.169> I<00:06:01.400> that<00:06:02.400> is<00:06:02.610> quite

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
Fallout New Vegas but I that is quite

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.320 
Fallout New Vegas but I that is quite
some<00:06:03.630> time<00:06:04.139> away<00:06:04.409> I'm<00:06:04.560> afraid<00:06:04.699> so<00:06:05.699> until<00:06:06.120> then

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
some time away I'm afraid so until then

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.650 
some time away I'm afraid so until then
MCM<00:06:07.130> system<00:06:08.130> seems<00:06:08.430> to<00:06:08.550> be<00:06:08.669> the

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
MCM system seems to be the

the other best option so give it a try

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.720 
the other best option so give it a try
