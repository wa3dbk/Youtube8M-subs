00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.400
 of gta 5 read and good today I bring you a 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.200
 RPP infinite trick and Well 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.030
 we will simply have to go online 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.460
 activities of the fiction of a 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.740
 Careers activity created by rockstar 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.230
 and we will have to look for a career that 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.360
 it's called under the center it's worth then 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.130
 good if there are many many cases that 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.810
 He has since has not left the race 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.280
 So then, look for the 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.439
 image because the truth is that it does not have 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.489
 loss is worth a tunnel so good 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.170
 simply because once we have 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.360
 located we have found it we are going 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.370
 to cease is therefore good one of the 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.950
 accepted let's put a spin and 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.420
 We will confirm the adjustments once 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.460
 we have confirmed the adjustments we are going to 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.200
 choose our car and once we have 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.090
 chosen our car what we are going to 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.650
 to do simply is to wait for us 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.780
 load the numbers I've been in the 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.310
 countdown is what you see here and a 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.050
 once we have charged the countdown what 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.030
 what we are going to do is go over the bridge 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.559
 this on the right and you have to follow 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.600
 all the time the route that had followed 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.760
 so then good, let's continue with 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.310
 the bridge and what it's about now is 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.140
 to fall always well is worth no no it is not 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.299
 stick ostias or anything then good 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.000
 As you can see here, I fall well and they give me 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.310
 100 drp every time I fall like this 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.260
 this serves mainly in levels 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.700
 low and you want to do it so good 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.360
 much better than many missions there 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.850
 Over there 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.470
 today raised but this is 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.630
 mainly for low levels 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.550
 So, you know, at 50 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.200
