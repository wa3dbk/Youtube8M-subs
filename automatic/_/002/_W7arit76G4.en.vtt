00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
the fact that is one foot in brings me

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.750 
the fact that is one foot in brings me
off<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.349> 10<00:02:31.530> out<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.650> 10<00:02:31.829> rate<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.189> it<00:02:32.370> really

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
off that 10 out of 10 rate and it really

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.610 
off that 10 out of 10 rate and it really
really<00:02:32.849> does<00:02:33.209> because<00:02:33.480> it's<00:02:34.170> just<00:02:34.319> not<00:02:34.470> good

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
really does because it's just not good

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.140 
really does because it's just not good
enough<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.890> his<00:02:35.010> right<00:02:35.159> foot<00:02:35.340> otherwise<00:02:35.700> it

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
enough on his right foot otherwise it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.039 
enough on his right foot otherwise it
would<00:02:36.269> have<00:02:36.359> been<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.510> 10<00:02:36.659> out<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.780> 10<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:36.989> it's

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
would have been a 10 out of 10 but it's

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.170 
would have been a 10 out of 10 but it's
a<00:02:37.170> nun<00:02:37.409> out<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.859> 10<00:02:38.010> for<00:02:38.040> me<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.459> yet

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
a nun out of 10 for me and yet

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.149 
a nun out of 10 for me and yet

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
definitely a fun play to use but it is
