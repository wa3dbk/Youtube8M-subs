reason<00:00:57.729> why<00:00:57.909> they've<00:00:58.149> made<00:00:58.179> so<00:00:58.629> many<00:00:58.749> changes

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
reason why they've made so many changes

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.200 
reason why they've made so many changes
is<00:00:59.530> they<00:00:59.769> wanted<00:01:00.129> Windows<00:01:00.489> 8<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.879> run<00:01:01.059> on

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
is they wanted Windows 8 to run on

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.820 
is they wanted Windows 8 to run on
tablets<00:01:01.690> as<00:01:01.870> well<00:01:01.929> as<00:01:02.319> desktops<00:01:02.499> and<00:01:03.280> laptops

there<00:01:05.830> are<00:01:05.979> actually<00:01:06.549> two<00:01:06.790> different<00:01:06.820> views

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
there are actually two different views

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.990 
there are actually two different views
in<00:01:07.600> Windows<00:01:08.049> 8<00:01:08.320> right<00:01:08.560> now<00:01:08.920> we're<00:01:09.549> looking<00:01:09.700> at

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
in Windows 8 right now we're looking at

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.270 
in Windows 8 right now we're looking at
the<00:01:10.090> Start<00:01:10.390> screen<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:11.320> other<00:01:11.530> view<00:01:11.860> is<00:01:11.890> the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
the Start screen the other view is the

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.730 
the Start screen the other view is the
desktop<00:01:12.790> which<00:01:13.630> looks<00:01:13.930> very<00:01:14.020> similar<00:01:14.350> to

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
desktop which looks very similar to

desktop which looks very similar to
earlier<00:01:15.310> versions<00:01:15.730> of<00:01:15.850> Windows<00:01:16.410> chances<00:01:17.410> are

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
earlier versions of Windows chances are

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.350 
earlier versions of Windows chances are
you'll<00:01:18.010> use<00:01:18.220> both<00:01:18.460> of<00:01:18.490> these<00:01:18.760> views<00:01:19.060> for

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
you'll use both of these views for

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.180 
you'll use both of these views for
different<00:01:19.690> tasks<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:20.260> you'll<00:01:20.740> get<00:01:20.860> used<00:01:21.070> to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
different tasks and you'll get used to

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.700 
different tasks and you'll get used to
switching<00:01:21.520> back<00:01:21.790> and<00:01:21.850> forth<00:01:22.440> let's<00:01:23.440> take<00:01:23.680> a

earlier versions of Windows but it's
gone<00:02:02.710> through<00:02:02.920> some<00:02:03.159> changes<00:02:03.400> most<00:02:04.240> notably

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
gone through some changes most notably

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.260 
gone through some changes most notably
involving<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.470> start<00:02:05.740> button<00:02:06.010> when<00:02:06.850> Windows
