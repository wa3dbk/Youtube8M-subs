00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 this review has been made possible 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.850
 thanks to keys king to learn more 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.850
 check the video description 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.000
 Hello everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.230
 this new computer review 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.060
 gaming it 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.740
 in this video I would see many gis a 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.630
 twin tower heat sink produced by 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.650
 rising tech with a price of around 60 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.150
 EUR 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.400
 it is an improved version of the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.529
 previous nemesis always liked the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.000
 rising tide let's not get lost in 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.949
 chat we immediately see the content 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.290
 of the package inside we find 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.850
 an installation guide a 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.129
 star screwdriver long enough 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.680
 to reach all the two screws 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.079
 145 mm fans 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.280
 the sink and two bags that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.399
 contain the necessary for 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.460
 the installation in detail we find a 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.640
 backplate intel mounting clip of 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.890
 mounting to myths crossbar 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.680
 thermal paste in sachet anti screws 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.219
 plastic spacer vibration 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:07.460
 against nuts and nuts in metal screws for 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.460
 lga2011 and finally two m3 screws 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.030
 let's analyze thesis starting from 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.509
 fans in the package we find two 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.030
 both with a diameter of 145 mm lo 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.890
 25 mm thick 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.299
 given the size even all air flow is 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.100
 high enough 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.490
 in fact the single fan can arrive 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.950
 at around 70 cfm they are equipped with a motor 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.110
 brushless therefore without brushes and the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.840
 speed of them can vary from 600 to 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.950
 1000 rpm with a starting voltage from 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.259
 ten times is the normal 12- volt one 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.200
 one of the fans at the pvm 4 connector 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.750
 pin while the other three then the pin 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.409
 spring used as a cpu fan while 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.659
 the second as a system fan like I said 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.979
 at the beginning of the review the tg is a 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.170
 doubler heat sink from the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.000
 bloated size erice dissipate 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.990
 up to 200 va of heat 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.969
 it is as high as two 66.5 mm so it is not 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.530
 compatible with all cakes but only with 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.990
 those with a higher width 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.530
 at 18 cm 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.000
 the heat sink and 140 mm wide at one 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.069
 depth of 130 million 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.140
 the complete surface from there pipe alle 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.330
 fins and revisited in nickel as now 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.370
 this rising tech has got us used to 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.140
 operation slightly increases the cost 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.150
 production however preserves the alloy 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.489
 from oscillation and improves aesthetics 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.830
 the fins are well 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.379
 welded together and at various points e 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.190
 they are glacier and there are as many as 45 per 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:39.440
 thor then 90 in total to carry the 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.900
 heat from the processor to the heat sink ci 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.069
 there are five copper heatpipes 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.569
 divided on the two towers 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.519
 distribute the heat over the whole 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.920
 radiant mass 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.959
 they have a diameter of 8 mm and are 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.609
 joined together in a sandwich base that 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.609
 will be placed above all accessories 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.519
 whereas it has a design 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.170
 has dubbed the fans now can 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.690
 be positioned as we please e 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.040
 according to our needs 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.109
 the important and position it so that 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.599
 hot air comes out of it and not 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.519
 I can get trapped inside like 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.840
 fan configuration used 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.470
 what's also on the packaging 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.609
 that even the most beautiful aesthetically 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.389
 despite being a big sink 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.769
 dimensions 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.079
 installation was not difficult 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.760
 but as I said before you have to have 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.889
 a cash large enough to be able to 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.480
 install the heatsink in my case 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.560
 protrudes laterally by some 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.709
 centimeter therefore it is not possible 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.180
 put the side bulkhead 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.100
 let's see though the large dimensions 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.440
 also equivalent to good performance 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.680
 as usual I performed the tests with the 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.050
 amd fx 2320 processor at stop frequencies 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.650
 and with the ambient temperature of approx 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.140
 20 degrees 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.970
 I decided to compare thesis with 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.620
 the stock sink to see the 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.390
 comparison with other sinks vi 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.069
 just look at the other reviews where 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.400
 temperatures were measured with 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.110
 the same test with normal use e 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.730
 the stock heatsink that is provided 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.550
 with the processor has reached a 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.800
 maximum temperature of 35 degrees while 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.690
 the thesis with the same use has 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.470
 reached a maximum temperature of 20 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.380
 degrees stressing the processor instead 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.760
 one hundred percent through and v.lo ad per 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.500
 about 15 minutes 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.690
 the maximum temperature reached by the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.940
 stock heatsink was 61 degrees 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.490
 while the tg manages to hold the 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.410
 processor at 39 degrees thus guaranteeing 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.410
 also a large overclocking margin 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.800
 let us now turn to the final considerations 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.260
 build quality as it now has 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.000
 used the rising tech is very good the 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.860
 heatsink is compatible with all 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.470
 sockets and we are all provided 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.479
 Accessories for the installation of the 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.190
 performance is obviously very good 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.960
 and also allows us to create a 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.950
 good overclock 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.490
 despite the large size 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.229
 the installation is not difficult what there 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.750
 they are also some negative aspects though 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.770
 first of all the clutter to succeed 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.070
 to install it you will have to use 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.950
 for low-profile ram strength and above all 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.260
 pretty wide keys on the fans 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.990
 low rpm is fine though once 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.900
 reached higher rpm are a bit 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.100
 noisy also suited me annoyance 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.900
 find among the accessories for a 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.280
 heatsink the same pasta 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.789
 thermal in sachet and radiant 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.620
 provides for the basic models for 15 euros 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.669
 it is a good dissipator for performance 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.979
 but I saw the negative aspects 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.930
 I think it's better to spend those ten 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:29.760
 euro more and take a nice noctua nh 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.620
 d14 the review has come to an end 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.270
 thank the kay skin guys that 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.100
 have made this review possible 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.260
 remember to check the link in 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.000
 description there is the review there is 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.800
 liked remember to leave a nice one 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.030
 I like it's a comment on what it does 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.550
 think of this thesis 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.270
 a greeting from our marius and see you 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.270
 in the next review
