00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:07.460
 hello and welcome to gameblog.fr 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.630
 for the video test of this platoon occurred 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.880
 so this plateau world is a big 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.059
 risk taking for nintendo since the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.350
 builder ventures into the tps 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.100
 discipline he had rather left to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.380
 other studios 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.210
 and it's even more risky that the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.720
 does without the support of his characters 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.300
 stars 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.510
 so do not expect to see mario 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.800
 or luigi at least for the moment 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.000
 so we guess that if nintendo 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.130
 takes such a risk 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.489
 it's still going to have found a 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.350
 formula if my opinion that in any case very 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.660
 original 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.340
 so what makes the originality 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.579
 of this all-white dish simply 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.649
 to have replaced bullets with 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.480
 drops of paint 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.520
 said like that one would think that this 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.860
 is limited to transforming the parts into 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.980
 baseball match the colors of the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.690
 painting coming to sweeten the fights and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.160
 in fact these boats are not going much 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.350
 far since it relies on 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.530
 properties of the painting to begin 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.270
 by the fact that it spreads on the ground 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.650
 usually in the time it is 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.479
 especially to knock out a maximum 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.270
 opponents 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.130
 while in this dish all the lens 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.520
 principal is to cover the most 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.840
 large area of paint possible 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.119
 this principle stems some 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.700
 particularities 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.979
 first of all in terms of scope 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.979
 since it becomes decisive 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.020
 given that necessarily the painting does not 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.880
 does not behave exactly like the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.079
 lead then in matters of displacement 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.869
 since once we covered the 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.460
 paint floor turn into 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.259
 calamari helps to move a lot 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.350
 faster which also offers a 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.149
 some form of coverage given 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.409
 that she does not protect bullets and 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.040
 that it allows at least to move 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.130
 a little discreetly 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.600
 finally 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.219
 the last particularity is in the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.270
 management of space since in 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.759
 spraying paint on the walls 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.220
 we can climb them at the speed of 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.689
 the lightning in the form of a squid this 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.780
 which offers new perspectives in 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.430
 verticality 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.200
 the other essential component of the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.290
 formula of this platoon lies in 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.140
 the operation of the gamepad on the one hand 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.900
 to notify him which is done by the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.099
 through the gyroscope 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.200
 while lovers of the method 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.790
 traditional reassures this is 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.790
 an option 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.900
 it is always possible to direct the 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.970
 reticle only with the right stick 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.220
 however we strongly advise to opt 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.000
 for this new configuration with 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.430
 the gyroscope 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.489
 even if it requires a little time 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.739
 of adaptation because it turns out 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:51.400
 extremely effective indeed the 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.860
 gyroscope brings a net increase of 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.540
 finesse of precision reactivity 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.329
 we had just never seen 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.470
 on console 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:06.069
 on the other hand the gamepad screen displays 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.690
 the map and so it allows to visualize 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.670
 the evolution of hostilities so 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.350
 very comfortable 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.920
 knowing that we have the possibility 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.680
 after a respawn of almost joining 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.319
 instantly his colleagues 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.170
 just by pressing on it so via 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:30.010
 the touch screen 7 knowing that this 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.910
 maneuver also serves to trigger 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.620
 some special weapons 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.139
 so for all these reasons it goes without 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.889
 to say that this platoon turns out very very 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:45.060
 refreshing only here it is necessary 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:48.130
 to be 8 to enjoy it fully 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.549
 of course this dish all does have 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:55.040
 a solo campaign with mechanics 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:59.359
 rather ingenious and there this content 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.870
 to this solo dimension and there is also a 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:05.269
 local two player mode and the fact that 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:10.209
 one of them must use the 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:16.489
 pro handle decreases all its interest 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:20.000
 because clearly this platoon reveals everything 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.300
 its potential to many and therefore in 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.669
 line it's both the strength and the 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.009
 weakness of this platoon since suddenly 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.310
 we have maps that are perfectly 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:33.110
 built to accommodate eight players 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.310
 weapons and roles the different 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.580
 resulting roles that are 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.949
 perfectly suited to teams of 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.750
 four and at the same time it must be well 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.280
 to admit that we are bored a little bit 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.860
 time the eighth player arrives and 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.639
 that we can finally start the game by 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.199
 line and it's all the more regrettable 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.750
 the absence of voice chat 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:57.530
 even though we can easily reach 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:01.460
 guess the tactics that will apply 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:04.980
 each of the teammates and that this is 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:09.090
 justified by the atmosphere 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:11.420
 bonenfant of the game that said we do not 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.910
 too many worries about attendance 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.550
 servers online since of 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.340
 many updates are already planned 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.220
 and not least 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.140
 currently we have two modes the mode the 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.050
 more classic the simplest of access 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.510
 but also the most effective which actually 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.990
 territory war and a second 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:37.500
 time a second mode which is rather 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.500
 competition-oriented it also 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.740
 unfolds in the context of the pros matches 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.120
 it's the zone defense 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.920
 but what's good is that as we 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.390
 can see it there just by this 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:54.180
 cutting the good-natured atmosphere of which 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:57.600
 I spoke also spoke through 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.610
 this this phase is competitive which 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.370
 is never ever invasive 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:07.020
 has the right to want to be confined to 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:09.330
 party we will say with friends even if for 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.210
 the moment we can not yet formed 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:15.060
 teams with his friends anyway if we 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.910
 want to simply enjoy the 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:22.420
 most classic fashion is perfectly 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:24.880
 indicated is also in the state 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.040
 what can be said is that this dish 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.000
 he already has everything he needs to 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:33.130
 fun is just waiting to recover 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.560
 a layer see in resume a layer 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.610
 and that's why they constitute 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.020
 one of the best experiences 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.200
 multiplayer 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.950
 to my knowledge in the image of bomberman 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:48.220
 in the image of mario kart really something 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.770
 worthy thing is able to which comes back 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.510
 always with pleasure 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.730
 that's why they deserve four and 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.910
 half and of course an indispensable 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.830
 Gameblog is on this I'll meet 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:03.570
 you very soon for new 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.570
