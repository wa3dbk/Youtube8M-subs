see there's also join curry squadrons
you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.320> create<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.590> squadron<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.820> get

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
you can create a squadron and you get

this<00:02:03.119> yep<00:02:03.659> servers<00:02:04.170> are<00:02:04.200> down<00:02:04.490> up<00:02:05.570> earlier<00:02:06.570> we

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
this yep servers are down up earlier we

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.570 
this yep servers are down up earlier we
could<00:02:07.020> create<00:02:07.259> our<00:02:07.409> own<00:02:07.439> squadrons<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.220> join

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.320 
could create our own squadrons and join
them<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.000> basically<00:02:09.840> that's<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.670> guess

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.890 
that we were connecting to the servers
and<00:02:26.490> they<00:02:26.580> turned<00:02:26.880> them<00:02:27.000> off<00:02:27.090> line<00:02:27.330> but

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
and they turned them off line but

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.150 
and they turned them off line but
