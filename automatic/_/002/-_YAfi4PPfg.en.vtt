00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.020
 today new tutorial video so 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.020

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:22.750

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:26.900
 will teach you how to do the two facchi 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.989
 figures of France after the boeny 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.130
 finally it's not bad it stops all 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:35.120
 180 rollback something like that so the 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:45.350
 paper show you he knows what 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:48.890
 that's it, then, finally, if he turns around 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.140
 when we roll back so like 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.910
 you can see it against attack so 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.980
 I was going to do that on seedlings in and 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.570
 courses which can go up that can 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.620
 go back down almost to the top 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.239
 go back and so has it like 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.680
 you can see the pedals and 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.990
 turns alone it's normal so a 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.640
 time you know you're in 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.150
 outside you back away I have to 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:20.480
 accompany the movement of this more 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:22.370
 quickly faster here is a 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.680
 times jean made lambada race goes 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.570
 have your tour handlebars so that you 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.060
 do a little bit leaning towards the and so by 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.710
 example if your pedal like all the 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.550
 accompany him like that if you want 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:43.670
 turn to the gonna have to press 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:46.210
 your pedal boats and you're going to turn for 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.210
 turn 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:59.060
 so I show you and I will try 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:02:00.590
 to do it not too much understood the most 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.120

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.040

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.600
 turn to yours pedal will 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.070
 necessarily here if you turn to the 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.900
 will necessarily be like that so according to 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.280
 you just have to train a lot of 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.700
