my<00:03:24.510> recipe<00:03:24.959> is<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.110> bit<00:03:25.319> dry<00:03:25.819> so<00:03:26.819> then<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.150> would

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
my recipe is a bit dry so then you would

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.880 
my recipe is a bit dry so then you would
just<00:03:27.420> add<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.870> little<00:03:28.110> more<00:03:28.319> milk<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.770> the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
just add a little more milk to the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.990 
just add a little more milk to the
recipe<00:03:33.769> chopped<00:03:34.769> around<00:03:35.100> 5<00:03:35.340> or<00:03:35.370> 10<00:03:35.670> minutes

on<00:03:37.920> low<00:03:38.160> heat<00:03:38.430> you're<00:03:39.060> going<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.269> get

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
on low heat you're going to get

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.970 
on low heat you're going to get
something<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:39.930> looks<00:03:40.170> like<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.590> if<00:03:40.890> it

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
something that looks like that if it

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.920 
something that looks like that if it
doesn't<00:03:41.310> look<00:03:41.400> like<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.670> or<00:03:42.180> it's<00:03:42.330> too<00:03:42.600> dry

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
doesn't look like that or it's too dry

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.259 
doesn't look like that or it's too dry
just<00:03:43.380> keep<00:03:43.560> adding<00:03:43.800> milk<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.519> until<00:03:45.150> it

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
just keep adding milk to it until it

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.949 
just keep adding milk to it until it
looks<00:03:45.480> like<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:47.390> once<00:03:48.390> everything<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:48.900> mixed

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
looks like that once everything is mixed

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.809 
looks like that once everything is mixed
together<00:03:49.260> go<00:03:49.709> ahead<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:49.950> shut<00:03:50.280> your<00:03:50.370> oven<00:03:50.670> off

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
together go ahead and shut your oven off

together go ahead and shut your oven off
take<00:03:51.569> out<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.780> pan<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.380> think<00:03:52.650> this<00:03:52.800> is<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:52.980> 9<00:03:53.250> by<00:03:53.430> 9

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
take out a pan I think this is a 9 by 9

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.059 
take out a pan I think this is a 9 by 9
pan<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.810> we're<00:03:54.989> simply<00:03:55.350> just<00:03:55.380> going<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.739> press

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
pan and we're simply just going to press

pan and we're simply just going to press
the<00:03:56.670> mix<00:03:56.970> onto<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.750> pan<00:04:01.100> make<00:04:02.100> sure<00:04:02.280> your

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
the mix onto the pan make sure your

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:11.290 
the mix onto the pan make sure your
hands<00:04:02.760> are<00:04:02.850> clean<00:04:03.000> before<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.570> do<00:04:03.720> this

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.690 

and<00:04:12.500> your<00:04:13.500> end<00:04:13.680> result<00:04:13.890> should<00:04:14.310> look

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
and your end result should look

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.590 
and your end result should look
something<00:04:14.970> like<00:04:15.270> that<00:04:17.090> now<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.150> don't<00:04:18.420> have

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
something like that now you don't have

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.360 
something like that now you don't have
to<00:04:18.690> add<00:04:18.930> these<00:04:19.200> but<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:19.590> like<00:04:19.860> to<00:04:19.980> add<00:04:20.100> two

minutes and then we can go ahead and cut

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.410 
minutes and then we can go ahead and cut
them<00:04:54.920> after<00:04:55.920> they've<00:04:56.100> cooled<00:04:56.370> for<00:04:56.700> around<00:04:56.910> 15

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
them after they've cooled for around 15

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.630 
them after they've cooled for around 15
to<00:04:57.570> 20<00:04:57.870> minutes<00:04:58.170> just<00:04:58.710> go<00:04:58.860> ahead<00:04:58.980> and<00:04:59.310> cut<00:04:59.490> them

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
to 20 minutes just go ahead and cut them

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:09.749 
to 20 minutes just go ahead and cut them
into<00:04:59.940> ten<00:05:00.330> bars

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.059 

so<00:05:10.719> I<00:05:10.749> forgot<00:05:10.960> to<00:05:11.080> turn<00:05:11.319> on<00:05:11.379> the<00:05:11.499> camera<00:05:11.770> before

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.119 
these are extremely dense as you can see
there's<00:05:19.599> still<00:05:19.689> a<00:05:19.809> bit<00:05:19.990> warm<00:05:20.199> if<00:05:20.860> you<00:05:20.949> want

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
there's still a bit warm if you want

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:22.619 
there's still a bit warm if you want
them<00:05:21.249> to<00:05:21.370> cool<00:05:21.550> off<00:05:21.669> faster<00:05:22.120> put<00:05:22.360> them<00:05:22.449> in<00:05:22.569> the

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
them to cool off faster put them in the

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:26.489 
them to cool off faster put them in the
fridge<00:05:22.839> and<00:05:23.169> they<00:05:23.979> will<00:05:24.189> harden<00:05:24.639> up<00:05:24.759> a<00:05:24.909> bit<00:05:25.499> so

00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:26.499 
fridge and they will harden up a bit so
