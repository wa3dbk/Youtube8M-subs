00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
played but I liked our secondary I think

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.980 
played but I liked our secondary I think
that<00:05:45.710> if<00:05:46.669> we<00:05:46.729> kicked<00:05:47.030> it<00:05:47.150> off<00:05:47.270> pretty<00:05:47.479> good<00:05:47.630> I

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
that if we kicked it off pretty good I

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.270 
that if we kicked it off pretty good I
think<00:05:48.380> there's<00:05:48.500> a<00:05:48.590> bunch<00:05:48.830> of<00:05:48.919> things<00:05:49.130> we're

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
think there's a bunch of things we're

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.590 
think there's a bunch of things we're
doing<00:05:49.310> better<00:05:49.700> and<00:05:49.820> we<00:05:49.910> got<00:05:50.060> to<00:05:50.150> improve<00:05:50.419> on
