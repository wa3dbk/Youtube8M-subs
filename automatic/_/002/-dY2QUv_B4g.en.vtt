very<00:03:38.190> light<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.640> natural-looking<00:03:39.209> because

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
very light and natural-looking because

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.390 
very light and natural-looking because
if<00:03:39.690> they're<00:03:39.870> just<00:03:40.410> too<00:03:40.620> severe<00:03:40.950> that<00:03:41.130> doesn't

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
if they're just too severe that doesn't

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.550 
if they're just too severe that doesn't
make<00:03:41.489> sense<00:03:41.549> so<00:03:42.090> I'm<00:03:42.209> gonna<00:03:42.329> use<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:43.200> Sigma

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.970 
make sense so I'm gonna use the Sigma
brow<00:03:43.920> powder<00:03:44.250> duo<00:03:44.370> in<00:03:44.959> light<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.350> mostly<00:03:46.769> the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
lighter side to just very lightly fill

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.340 
lighter side to just very lightly fill
in<00:03:51.239> any<00:03:51.570> bare<00:03:52.230> spots<00:03:52.590> on<00:03:52.799> my<00:03:52.920> brows<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:54.350> I'm

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
in any bare spots on my brows and I'm

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.610 
in any bare spots on my brows and I'm
using<00:03:55.560> an<00:03:55.829> e<00:03:55.950> 65<00:03:56.730> Yan<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.209> 65<00:03:57.720> angled<00:03:58.140> brush<00:03:58.320> just

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
using an e 65 Yan a 65 angled brush just

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.710 
using an e 65 Yan a 65 angled brush just
to<00:03:58.859> very<00:03:59.070> lightly<00:03:59.310> go<00:03:59.609> through<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.540> best

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
to very lightly go through and the best

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.660 
to very lightly go through and the best
part<00:04:00.930> about<00:04:00.989> this<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:02.130> can<00:04:02.280> really

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
part about this is that you can really

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.180 
part about this is that you can really
do<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:03.000> very<00:04:03.390> quickly<00:04:03.780> because<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.650> powder<00:04:04.890> is

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
do it very quickly because the powder is

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.729 
do it very quickly because the powder is
definitely<00:04:05.820> way<00:04:06.239> more<00:04:06.269> forgiving<00:04:07.260> than<00:04:07.440> a

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
definitely way more forgiving than a

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.530 
definitely way more forgiving than a
pencil<00:04:08.190> or<00:04:08.519> something<00:04:08.910> like<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.420> I'm<00:04:09.480> not

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
pencil or something like that so I'm not

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.880 
pencil or something like that so I'm not
going<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.810> be<00:04:09.870> doing<00:04:10.079> too<00:04:10.290> much<00:04:10.470> with<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.739> eyes

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
going to be doing too much with the eyes

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.130 
going to be doing too much with the eyes
but<00:04:11.220> there's<00:04:11.370> definitely<00:04:11.549> a<00:04:12.150> few<00:04:12.720> tricks<00:04:12.989> you

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
but there's definitely a few tricks you

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.979 
but there's definitely a few tricks you
can<00:04:13.170> do<00:04:13.530> that<00:04:14.480> emphasize<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.510> eyes<00:04:15.750> without

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
can do that emphasize the eyes without

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.320 
can do that emphasize the eyes without
looking<00:04:16.560> like<00:04:16.709> obvious<00:04:17.130> makeup<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:18.060> I'm<00:04:18.180> going

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
looking like obvious makeup so I'm going

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.849 
looking like obvious makeup so I'm going

the<00:04:37.800> brow<00:04:38.010> bone<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:38.610> kind<00:04:38.850> of<00:04:38.910> frames<00:04:39.180> up<00:04:39.510> the

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
the brow bone it kind of frames up the

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.910 
the brow bone it kind of frames up the
eyes<00:04:39.780> by<00:04:40.140> creating<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:40.740> really

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
eyes by creating a really

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.890 
eyes by creating a really
natural-looking<00:04:41.430> shadow<00:04:41.940> but<00:04:42.420> it<00:04:42.600> doesn't

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
natural-looking shadow but it doesn't

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.380 
natural-looking shadow but it doesn't
read<00:04:43.200> as<00:04:43.530> makeup<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:44.670> then<00:04:44.940> I'm<00:04:45.060> going<00:04:45.270> to

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
read as makeup and then I'm going to

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.840 
read as makeup and then I'm going to
take<00:04:46.200> this<00:04:46.440> color<00:04:46.740> in<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.190> same<00:04:47.400> palette

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
take this color in the same palette

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.030 
take this color in the same palette
which<00:04:48.360> is<00:04:48.480> called<00:04:48.690> faint<00:04:48.960> basically<00:04:49.680> just<00:04:49.860> a

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
which is called faint basically just a

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.070 
which is called faint basically just a
dark<00:04:50.310> brown<00:04:50.610> any<00:04:50.970> darker<00:04:51.750> brown<00:04:51.900> eyeshadow

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
dark brown any darker brown eyeshadow

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.560 
dark brown any darker brown eyeshadow
will<00:04:52.650> work<00:04:52.890> placing<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:53.520> color<00:04:53.790> halfway

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
will work placing that color halfway

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.810 
will work placing that color halfway
onto<00:04:55.170> the<00:04:55.320> base<00:04:55.470> of<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.800> lashes<00:04:56.070> and<00:04:56.550> then

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
onto the base of the lashes and then

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.780 
onto the base of the lashes and then
half<00:04:57.390> onto<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.020> lid<00:04:58.290> so<00:04:58.710> it's<00:04:59.370> not<00:04:59.610> even

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
half onto the lid so it's not even

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.590 
half onto the lid so it's not even
really<00:04:59.940> lining<00:05:00.600> the<00:05:00.690> eye<00:05:00.720> it's<00:05:01.110> almost<00:05:02.600> just

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
really lining the eye it's almost just

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.900 
really lining the eye it's almost just
darkening<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:04.620> lash<00:05:04.860> line<00:05:04.890> in<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:05.490> area

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
darkening the lash line in that area

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.880 
darkening the lash line in that area
where<00:05:06.210> it<00:05:06.600> would<00:05:06.960> be<00:05:07.110> darker<00:05:07.470> you<00:05:07.710> had

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
where it would be darker you had

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.500 
where it would be darker you had
naturally<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:08.460> little<00:05:08.730> bit<00:05:08.820> thicker<00:05:09.180> lashes

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
naturally a little bit thicker lashes

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.500 
naturally a little bit thicker lashes
resist<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.530> urge<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.820> smudge<00:05:11.820> this<00:05:12.090> and<00:05:12.300> blend

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
resist the urge to smudge this and blend

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.240 
resist the urge to smudge this and blend
it<00:05:12.690> I<00:05:12.990> don't<00:05:13.140> think<00:05:13.200> that<00:05:13.620> I<00:05:13.650> think<00:05:13.890> it<00:05:14.100> looks

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
it I don't think that I think it looks

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.650 
it I don't think that I think it looks
more<00:05:14.370> natural<00:05:14.520> when<00:05:14.880> you<00:05:14.940> gonna<00:05:15.090> press<00:05:15.360> it<00:05:15.420> in

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
more natural when you gonna press it in

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.590 
more natural when you gonna press it in

away<00:05:35.850> from<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.240> lid<00:05:36.450> because<00:05:36.660> it<00:05:37.020> is<00:05:37.110> a<00:05:37.140> creamy

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500

inner corner of the eye and it's nice

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.650 
inner corner of the eye and it's nice
