on p 0 or PS to be honest that gets
boring<00:02:00.340> after<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:00.880> do<00:02:01.000> it<00:02:01.030> for<00:02:01.329> such<00:02:01.899> a<00:02:01.929> long

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
boring after you do it for such a long

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.169 
boring after you do it for such a long
time<00:02:02.170> I've<00:02:03.130> ever<00:02:03.250> using<00:02:03.610> similar<00:02:03.849> reasons

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
time I've ever using similar reasons

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.289 
time I've ever using similar reasons
like<00:02:04.270> shoddy<00:02:04.599> battle<00:02:04.689> that's<00:02:05.789> for<00:02:06.789> something

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
like shoddy battle that's for something

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.569 
like shoddy battle that's for something
years<00:02:07.920> probably<00:02:08.920> longer<00:02:11.010> feels<00:02:12.010> been<00:02:12.220> out<00:02:12.340> for

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
years probably longer feels been out for

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.759 
years probably longer feels been out for
about<00:02:12.670> four<00:02:13.000> years<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:14.730> think<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.880> has<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.060> do

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
about four years so I think it has to do

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.309 
about four years so I think it has to do
yeah<00:02:17.769> so<00:02:18.519> it's<00:02:19.239> been<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.420> while<00:02:19.599> since<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:20.110> didn't

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
yeah so it's been a while since I didn't

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.830 
yeah so it's been a while since I didn't
using<00:02:20.970> simulated<00:02:21.970> I'm<00:02:22.269> sorry<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.510> just<00:02:22.660> gets

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
using simulated I'm sorry I just gets

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.440 
using simulated I'm sorry I just gets
boring<00:02:23.500> like<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.340> do<00:02:24.400> enjoy<00:02:24.640> playing<00:02:25.000> pokemon

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
boring like I do enjoy playing pokemon

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.780 
boring like I do enjoy playing pokemon
like<00:02:25.569> in<00:02:25.750> game<00:02:25.989> it's<00:02:26.200> up<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.769> just<00:02:27.609> can't

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
like in game it's up to I just can't

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.910 
like in game it's up to I just can't
right<00:02:28.060> now<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.480> there's<00:02:29.319> other<00:02:29.500> games<00:02:29.769> like

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
right now and there's other games like

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.039 
right now and there's other games like
League<00:02:30.280> for<00:02:30.579> example<00:02:31.030> or<00:02:31.420> other<00:02:31.660> games<00:02:31.900> on

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
League for example or other games on

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.110 
League for example or other games on
Steam<00:02:32.319> right<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.739> just<00:02:32.950> experience<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.670> game

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
Steam right and just experience the game

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.009 
Steam right and just experience the game
as<00:02:34.359> a<00:02:34.389> whole<00:02:34.769> so<00:02:35.769> they're<00:02:36.370> more<00:02:37.150> interesting

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
as a whole so they're more interesting

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.030 
as a whole so they're more interesting
so<00:02:39.930> probably<00:02:40.930> won't<00:02:41.109> be<00:02:41.230> uploading<00:02:41.440> too<00:02:41.829> much

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
so probably won't be uploading too much

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.140 
so probably won't be uploading too much
if<00:02:42.310> any<00:02:42.609> Pokemon<00:02:43.889> future<00:02:44.889> and<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.819> guess<00:02:46.030> this

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
if any Pokemon future and I guess this

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.900 
if any Pokemon future and I guess this
