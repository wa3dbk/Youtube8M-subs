00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.109
 This priest does have something amazing. 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:14.669
 What the hell is that? What is the visitor looking for? 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.999
 They need a way to be single-on-one with the Lord Jesus. 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:21.679
 And I think Saint Jean-Marie Vianney, 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.810
 Let people see the light of the Lord Jesus. 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.279
 I believe in the eyes of Saint Jean-Marie Vianney 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.399
 Can make people feel hope. 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.220
 Because it is as if the Lord Jesus Christ looked at us with my own eyes. 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.960
 Saint Jean-Marie Vianney is absolutely barren. 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.180
 On the whole, he is also a poor person, both intellectually and as a person. On the way to becoming a priest, he faced a lot of difficulties. 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.120
 He has a bad memory 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.380
 Often nervous and afraid of speaking. 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.950
 These are the taboos of the priest. 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.000
 But he entrusted himself to the hands of God. 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.500
 The life of St. Jean-Marie Vianney has only fulfilled the duties of a general priest. 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.130
 Tell and visit prisoners 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.000
 Bring the Eucharist to the patient, 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.700
 Hold mass, confess, etc. Just like other priests. 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.440
 The difference lies in the belief in Guzhong that this belief makes people feel the existence of the Lord. 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.210
 Imagine a new task just getting started, 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.430
 Your priest career, 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.270
 You will want to offer you all the talents and want to be the leader of the believers. 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.540
 It is not for personal desire, but for the church and evangelism. 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.390
 But think of people like St. Jean-Marie Vianney. 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.580
 I learned that I can complete the evangelism every day. 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.510
 And more practical, is to let the Lord work in my shortcomings. 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.060
 About Saint Jean-Marie Vianney, 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.740
 We may have heard how long he confessed every day and 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.350
 How does he hold the mass. 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.900
 He is the Lord's person, 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.700
 But maybe more accurate, we should say 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.490
 He is the people of all. 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.490
 "I've seen God in a man"
