00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 Again, there is no evidence that the current mesh is harmful to the human body. 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.120
 But I have never been in advertising. 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.870
 Andago not to say that it may be harmful to the human body against free per cent 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.279
 Because it is not 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.439
 What is not optically safe is physiological and fatal damage. 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.669
 Does not mean g 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:30.589
 It's not that everyone has a problem to eat. 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:34.649
 So, in the food x file, the manufacturer or related producer 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:39.539
 I would like to make one proposal from a government agency. 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.039
 Let's experiment with how the seasonings affect the human body. 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.500
 It is. 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:47.520
 By broadcasting the results of the week 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.200
 The adjourned debate on the three parties to build an end 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.200
 I'll be waiting for contact with your gossip and your passion. 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.960
 But there are other problems with artificially shoot 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.960
 Maybe it's a big problem. 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:08.050
 There are two squid here. 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.240
 Yeah, this is also the color that is calm gaze learned today and this is Matthew 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.650
 I bought it a few days ago 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.140
 It's definitely nine minutes from the freshness of the universe . 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:22.770
 If you 're cooking with Io employees 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:28.070
 Danielle is not fresh, it must be tasteless today 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.070
 But what would happen if I had an artificial seasoning gun here ? 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:42.670
 Ah, there are two types of spacesuits that showed a difference in freshness. 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:50.140
 Yes, and now you see me, and clearly demonstrate Also if you do a comparison 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:56.680
 4. it does require some shoulder Red John is turning white and circling again 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:02:00.210
 So here's how it 's so much more like this 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:06.430
 I know that you can spread your kid or do so as posting status 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:11.950
 Our customers also require you see me ah Have to see soon 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:17.190
 Of course I'm going to do a simple test using these two 50s 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.190
 First of all, there is the world . 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.900
 Oh, and the first is now a fresh squid. 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.310
 Second third third puts 50 fresh 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.670
 But I do not place the prepared separately are wondering flavor coming 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:46.130
 Xing Xian new things or live fish are called second color of urine itself 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:52.160
 Nucleic acid is in your body. 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:54.620
 4 In a fresh state, but without applying, living nucleic acid 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:00.650
 Dissipates did disappear 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:06.980
 4 Because why when writing to boil the soup should have fresh fish products 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:13.130
 Oh well, you do not have to put a lot of ingredients in it, 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:14.840
 So there is no mistake to make a stroke of five formula artificial seasoning 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.570
 Solved it. 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.570
 The universe itself will have seen the compressed taste of rock preparation 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:30.560
 The queen made with faithful five enemies. 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:34.209
 And also it hits the world that are not fresh squid artificial flavors tribe people 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.209
 What do you feel is the most delicious 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:46.310
 The preliminary line of the diagonal was tested for the scholar single 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:49.610
 Can students find fresh 17 tastes of pure 10,000 years ? 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:54.319
 But the results were amazing. 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.819
 From the shop Beach embellish the taste of artificial flavors are not fresh squid molpyo 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.129
 Will 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.310
 Our young people 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.050
 nsc 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:08.000

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:11.750
 Chauncey felt'm a lover Tasty once a cool rain now 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:17.299
 You know what always comes yireongeo stew taste or not taste What then just go 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:21.680
 I have to say that after the birds, the squid's golden grave is caught and boiled in broth. 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:25.010
 Does it taste the taste is delicious with more than 100 strong brewing of squid 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.120
 There was no squid butter on top of it. 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:33.650
 It is the same as the material but the artificial seasoning additives 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.930
 Students who are in the ears, and when he wrote the ingredients do feel the difference 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.040
 I did not feel it. 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:45.920
 Rain had just wasnt pulling ahkkan body taste City 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.810
 * I did not do anything that tastes like a better future, I can keep the future 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.110
 To a person who relies on 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:57.140
 Gajigi better quality even if the talk sseudaga 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.140
 So I think the taste haejuji not get that amount in Burr 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:04.600
 A lot of things. 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:09.310
 Artificial zombie, you can feel the power of this amazing intensity 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.750
 If you add a lot of ingredients that are right for your taste, you can taste different flavors. 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:16.090
 It's made sense. 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.770
 So now I do not feel that subtle difference from the other ingredients 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:22.030
 There will be a written purchase to 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:26.470
 Uh so I was standing making it difficult to find people holding right once more 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.280
 I mean, it's happening. So the difference between what you eat and what you do is very big. 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.850
 silver 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:36.940
 I do not think there's any difference. 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:42.330
 But now there's a neurotransmitter in the brain that's like its opium. 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.330
 When you eat delicious food.
