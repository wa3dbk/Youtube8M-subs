other possibilities with with all of our
mini<00:01:30.580> games<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.960> process<00:01:35.110> that<00:01:35.500> we

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
mini games so the process that we

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.200 
mini games so the process that we
usually<00:01:35.800> go<00:01:36.130> through<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.430> make<00:01:36.550> pets<00:01:36.790> is<00:01:37.030> will

usually go through to make pets is will

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.520 
usually go through to make pets is will
base<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.570> off<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.810> show<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.140> we'll<00:01:38.290> think

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
base it off the show and we'll think

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.190 
base it off the show and we'll think
about<00:01:38.619> what<00:01:38.890> would<00:01:39.010> be<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.190> fun<00:01:39.460> pet<00:01:39.700> so<00:01:40.060> in<00:01:41.050> this

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
about what would be a fun pet so in this

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.389 
about what would be a fun pet so in this
case<00:01:41.410> we<00:01:41.619> thought<00:01:41.770> well<00:01:41.920> droids<00:01:42.160> would<00:01:42.280> be

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
case we thought well droids would be

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.370 
case we thought well droids would be
really<00:01:42.550> fun<00:01:42.820> so<00:01:43.179> we<00:01:43.509> concept<00:01:43.960> it<00:01:44.050> a<00:01:44.110> bunch<00:01:44.259> of

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
really fun so we concept it a bunch of

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.620 
really fun so we concept it a bunch of
droids<00:01:44.679> and<00:01:44.979> then<00:01:45.280> came<00:01:46.240> up<00:01:46.360> with<00:01:46.479> all<00:01:46.600> kinds

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
droids and then came up with all kinds

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.749 
droids and then came up with all kinds
of<00:01:46.990> fun<00:01:47.229> little<00:01:47.410> animations<00:01:48.039> interactions

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
of fun little animations interactions

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.270 
of fun little animations interactions
and<00:01:49.090> ends<00:01:50.080> up<00:01:50.170> with<00:01:50.350> this<00:01:50.440> great<00:01:50.619> set<00:01:51.009> of<00:01:51.039> pets
