00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.800 
cover my hair when I'm in the shower
because<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:58.670> moisture<00:02:59.120> from<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.420> heat

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
because the the moisture from the heat

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.479 
because the the moisture from the heat
and<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.049> steam<00:03:00.319> rising<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:00.980> actually<00:03:01.189> is

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
and the steam rising and it actually is

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.830 
and the steam rising and it actually is
rate<00:03:01.700> greater<00:03:01.849> because<00:03:02.120> he<00:03:02.269> here<00:03:02.450> loves

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
rate greater because he here loves

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.050 
trying to alternate between the two but
it's<00:05:14.470> not<00:05:14.680> a<00:05:14.710> matter<00:05:14.949> of<00:05:15.159> if<00:05:15.550> you're<00:05:15.909> using

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
it's not a matter of if you're using

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.760 
it's not a matter of if you're using
product<00:05:16.509> or<00:05:16.659> if<00:05:16.750> you're<00:05:16.870> not<00:05:17.050> it's<00:05:17.349> just<00:05:17.620> the

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
product or if you're not it's just the

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.189 
product or if you're not it's just the
act<00:05:18.310> of<00:05:18.550> twisting<00:05:19.150> that's<00:05:19.449> weakening<00:05:20.080> your

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
act of twisting that's weakening your

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.100

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
roots and its not its own getting

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.290 
roots and its not its own getting
stronger<00:05:23.440> so<00:05:24.009> you<00:05:24.070> have<00:05:24.370> to<00:05:24.550> be<00:05:24.820> mindful<00:05:25.030> of

stronger so you have to be mindful of

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.870 
stronger so you have to be mindful of
that<00:05:25.360> and<00:05:25.479> then<00:05:26.139> try<00:05:26.409> to<00:05:26.440> not<00:05:26.919> over<00:05:27.460> twist<00:05:27.669> your
