00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.010
 good welcome I have a rose 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.110
 interesting for which my son 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.119
 hanged labor we have the samsung galaxy 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.119
 s 5 with the ski com 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.030
 They also make this phone be 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.860
 water resistant since it brings the 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.050
 packaging needed to maintain the 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.460
 water on the outside 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.530
 we can see that the unit is 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.890
 fully functional we have the cover 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.040
 all right 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.910
 installed to guarantee 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.480
 that all the stamps are in place and 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.810
 we can keep that seal that prevents 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.910
 that the water is going to pass the phone to 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.910
 child to immerse them in the water 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.780
 let's do the tests 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.400
 corresponding the open the phone 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.400
 is trying to work 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.610
 enjoy just adore immerse him in the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.610
 Water 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.860
 let's ask her that close one 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.580
 little and submerges it in the water 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.460
 completely 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.560
 Now, look for the phone 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.000
 he keeps testing if the phone is still 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.000
 completely water resistant 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.790
 is showing us all the 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.290
 characteristics of this unit and its 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.290
 ip67 certification 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.740
 now immerse the other bit let's leave it 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.740
 to sink 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.620
 again he takes it out and continues to prove that 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.550
 the phone is completely cheating 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.370
 we have already removed the unit from the water 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.430
 this is full of drops we are going to 

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.880
 proceed to dry it before removing the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.880
 blanket 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.790
 and it works perfectly 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.360
 here we have the stamps that the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.960
 original govern for the s5 that do that 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.950
 conserve 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.840
 and the seal its ip67 certification this what 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.660
 we just removed from the phone 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.960
 obviously the water enters these sides and 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.280
 to the splattered I enter here at the time of 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.590
 remove it you have to dry it very well 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.340
 phone so that this does not happen and 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.080
 splash 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.850
 of the rest of the phone is in perfect 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.040
 conditions does not suffer any damage 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.950
 nor did the inmates get wet as we can 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.920
 see the packaging 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.250
 covers this sector of the phone here 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.650
 then all this area is supposed to 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.780
 it must be completely dry as 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.290
 it is really completely dry 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.470
 absolutely nothing happened because of 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.470
 humidity 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.360
 once again this has been a short video 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.080
 of something is testing the 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.080
 ip67 features of samsung galaxy 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.540
 with its original view cover that brings 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.320
 the packaging to protect the phone 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.320
 against water
