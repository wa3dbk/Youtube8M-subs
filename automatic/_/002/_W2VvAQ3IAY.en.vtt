00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello we'll see today how 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.220
 to install a railing at the edge of a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.770
 mask to read outside for 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.330
 persons with reduced mobility or 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.640
 elderly a railing and when 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.620
 even well effective then started to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.120
 dig holes 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.450
 so the holes we did some stuff do 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.730
 about 25 by 25 by 35 cm of 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.390
 depth 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.700
 that's how we use to put 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.260
 poles that make ten per disc we have 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.989
 previously treated and that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.340
 rework proposed so we're going to 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.920
 install two levels this way 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:48.239
 so flowing into the concrete and a 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:53.760
 once they are dry and we 'll put 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:57.839
 so serve and they are doing very well on 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.839
 a plan to make this railing of 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.150
 economically we recovered from the month 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.610
 the old back so the next 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.210
 step it's going to be closing plots in 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.670
 concrete to let dry two days - and 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:20.010
 and then I can continue my 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:25.790
 guardrail game but where mix of concrete 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.790
 basically if I miss you back 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:35.689
 the moment I do not worry too much about 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.960
 level of unemployment us who hold I 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.960
 garnished 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:55.759
 about m about each side tap on 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.929
 for well packed that to do well 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:03.440
 to slide the concrete is long but my 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:08.630
 post and then I'm going downright 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.190
 level post also move too much I 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.690
 will put one or two at the base 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.080
 big stones to stall time 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.080
 that it dries 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.920
 at 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.280
 Well, here you go, I find you two 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.040
 days after our return to dry a 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.480
 little trick as we are at the beginning of the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.880
 late autumn earlier early winter and 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.880
 which is a bit cold to cover but 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.040
 concrete pads that I had made the gemmi 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.420
 of acid on top we could avoid that 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.800
 as the nights are a bit chilly 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.590
 for there is not yet a real frost but 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:58.610
 to prevent my dives laurent 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:03:01.190
 barbeau sight of the kind and so we see 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.220
 the tracks and moaned on one side a screw this 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:10.130
 which will allow me to make her hold on to 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:13.640
 but on the other hand I crash and so my 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.400
 cut because I hope 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.620
 amy pole to get started 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.050
 the other then there are two solutions either 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.360
 we make up the length of the pole 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.860
 to screw and put the other railing 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.810
 but I do not like it so much 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.569
 find it does not look pretty either 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.709
 trace half we cut and finally the same 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.709
 thing for the other party 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.120
 so once I cut my 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.400
 boards I'm going to close near hole for 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:53.330
 able to put so but screw after in 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:57.150
 the post so I started to trace 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.470
 So there I set my handrail 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.730
 the other side and then there I close and 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:15.239
 accurate in this pack to be able to 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:19.289
 then fix my shots so must the 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:29.580
 put waxes do like that gig 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:32.010
 with a key here we will do the same 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.930
 thing on all the handrails and 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.090
 then then it's good we 'll treat the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.850
 fence 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.100
 here and well listen to the barrier and 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.330
 goes up so have you seen the couples the 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.580
 pushes poles 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.009
 my asset set and now he's going us 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.860
 to stay more than a step to do is to 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.270
 so pass the stain protection where he 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.620
 had already been forced it must but 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.870
 she will need good protection 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.069
 second time and hoping that you 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.719
 will give an idea to make the injection 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.719
 also see you soon
