00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
it here's a cup of sugar just plain old

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.310 
it here's a cup of sugar just plain old
white<00:01:47.250> sugar<00:01:47.520> now<00:01:48.180> over<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.479> holidays<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.140> use

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
white sugar now over the holidays I use

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.749 
white sugar now over the holidays I use
brown<00:01:49.560> sugar<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> little<00:01:50.670> more

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
brown sugar just to get a little more

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.069 
brown sugar just to get a little more
flavor<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.780> little<00:01:51.899> more

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
flavor it's just a little more

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.069 
flavor it's just a little more
interesting<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.210> that's<00:01:54.210> what's<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.659> kind<00:01:54.990> of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
interesting and that's what's up kind of

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:55.730

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
brown sugar right so you're going to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.840 
brown sugar right so you're going to
stir<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.500> till<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:58.860> all<00:01:59.040> dissolves

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
I have also two bay leaves BAM I'm going

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.289 
I have also two bay leaves BAM I'm going
to<00:02:04.649> put<00:02:04.770> some<00:02:04.890> peppercorns<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.640> about<00:02:06.270> a

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
to put some peppercorns in about a

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.809 
to put some peppercorns in about a
tablespoon<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:08.390> have<00:02:09.390> three<00:02:10.459> whole<00:02:11.459> garlic

I'm going to just I don't have a lot of

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.879 
I'm going to just I don't have a lot of
time<00:02:38.560> today

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
time today

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.000 
time today

you can brine overnight which is usually

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.089 
you can brine overnight which is usually
what<00:02:46.719> I<00:02:46.750> do<00:02:46.870> but<00:02:47.169> today<00:02:47.290> I'm<00:02:47.680> kind<00:02:47.980> of

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099

what I do but today I'm kind of
constrained<00:02:48.969> by<00:02:49.090> time<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:50.079> I<00:02:50.409> chopped<00:02:50.859> up<00:02:51.069> the

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
constrained by time so I chopped up the

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.619 
constrained by time so I chopped up the
onion<00:02:51.519> instead<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:51.909> just<00:02:52.060> throwing<00:02:52.239> it<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.599> a

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
onion instead of just throwing it in a

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.330 
onion instead of just throwing it in a
hole<00:02:52.900> like<00:02:53.049> a<00:02:53.109> half<00:02:53.379> right<00:02:53.739> half<00:02:54.069> an<00:02:54.280> onion

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
hole like a half right half an onion

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.750 
hole like a half right half an onion
like<00:02:54.849> all<00:02:55.269> together<00:02:55.599> not<00:02:55.810> chopped<00:02:56.109> up<00:02:56.760> so

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
like all together not chopped up so

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.689 
like all together not chopped up so
again<00:02:58.329> make<00:02:58.810> sure<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:59.139> stir<00:02:59.530> stir<00:03:00.370> stir<00:03:00.400> stir

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:00.699

you want to but again I'm just looking

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:13.949 
you want to but again I'm just looking
for<00:03:12.430> something<00:03:12.639> flavorful<00:03:13.329> I'm<00:03:13.480> showing<00:03:13.840> you

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
for something flavorful I'm showing you

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.649 
for something flavorful I'm showing you
the<00:03:14.079> basics<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:15.060> there<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.209> go

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
the basics of it there you go

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.199 
the basics of it there you go
so<00:03:17.079> now<00:03:17.199> it's<00:03:17.379> stirred<00:03:17.680> right<00:03:18.189> now<00:03:18.849> what<00:03:19.060> do<00:03:19.120> I

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
so now it's stirred right now what do I

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:19.559 
so now it's stirred right now what do I
do

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
do

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.179 
do
only<00:03:19.900> thing<00:03:20.079> left<00:03:20.259> to<00:03:20.379> do<00:03:20.500> is<00:03:20.650> throw<00:03:20.829> this<00:03:20.979> bird

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:21.189 
only thing left to do is throw this bird

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.860 
only thing left to do is throw this bird
in<00:03:21.370> here<00:03:21.579> and<00:03:22.359> that's<00:03:22.599> so<00:03:22.959> simple<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.689> bird

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
in here and that's so simple so the bird

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.229 
in here and that's so simple so the bird
is<00:03:26.019> going<00:03:26.290> in<00:03:26.439> here<00:03:26.859> we<00:03:26.979> go<00:03:27.159> it's<00:03:28.000> actually

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
is going in here we go it's actually

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.599 
is going in here we go it's actually
tied<00:03:28.720> up<00:03:28.930> it's<00:03:29.139> trussed<00:03:29.409> up<00:03:29.590> I'm<00:03:30.220> just<00:03:30.459> leaving

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
tied up it's trussed up I'm just leaving

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.249 
tied up it's trussed up I'm just leaving
it<00:03:30.879> doesn't<00:03:31.269> really<00:03:31.359> matter<00:03:31.599> make<00:03:31.959> sure<00:03:32.109> that

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:32.259
