00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.549 
in love with it right now my favorite
primary<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.559> far<00:00:46.129> yeah<00:00:47.129> that's<00:00:47.460> all<00:00:48.559> alright

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
primary so far yeah that's all alright

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.319 
primary so far yeah that's all alright
so<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> cftc<00:00:50.550> we're<00:00:50.820> eight<00:00:50.969> guns<00:00:51.149> in

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
so here at the cftc we're eight guns in

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.500 
so here at the cftc we're eight guns in
a<00:00:51.390> file<00:00:51.600> sharing<00:00:52.050> system<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.559> five<00:00:53.039> categories

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
a file sharing system in five categories

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.619 
a file sharing system in five categories
thus<00:00:54.510> categories<00:00:55.110> beam<00:00:55.289> power

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
thus categories beam power

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.930 
thus categories beam power
maneuverability<00:00:57.629> rate<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.410> fire<00:00:58.940> accuracy

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
maneuverability rate of fire accuracy

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.119 
maneuverability rate of fire accuracy
and<00:01:00.260> ammo<00:01:01.260> /<00:01:01.680> reload<00:01:02.070> rate<00:01:03.530> alright<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and ammo / reload rate alright so the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.340 
and ammo / reload rate alright so the
power<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.610> gun<00:01:05.990> better<00:01:06.990> than<00:01:07.140> average

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
power on this gun better than average

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.730 
power on this gun better than average
but<00:01:09.470> it's<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:11.100> not<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.640> best<00:01:12.530> personally<00:01:13.530> I

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
but it's it's not the best personally I

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.969 
but it's it's not the best personally I
think<00:01:14.689> they<00:01:15.689> could<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.140> if<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.619> wanted

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
think they could have if they wanted

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.370 
think they could have if they wanted
this<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.580> really<00:01:17.880> good<00:01:18.479> crate<00:01:18.810> gun<00:01:19.020> they

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
this to be a really good crate gun they

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.300 
this to be a really good crate gun they
should<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.619> boosted<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> power

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.800 

maneuverability<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.490> think<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.360> probably

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
maneuverability I think this is probably

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.480 
maneuverability I think this is probably
one<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> lightest<00:01:25.650> assault<00:01:25.950> rifles<00:01:26.310> in

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
one of the lightest assault rifles in

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.740 
one of the lightest assault rifles in
the<00:01:26.580> game<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:26.939> far<00:01:29.240> you're<00:01:30.240> able<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.570> run

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the game so far you're able to run

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.700 
the game so far you're able to run
pretty<00:01:31.020> fast<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.560> gun<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.960> get

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
pretty fast with this gun and and get

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.960 
pretty fast with this gun and and get
where<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.920> need<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.640> your<00:01:35.790> primary

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
where you need to go with your primary

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.880 
where you need to go with your primary
out<00:01:36.299> which<00:01:36.479> which<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.320> helpful<00:01:39.860> rate<00:01:40.860> of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
out which which can be helpful rate of

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.639 
out which which can be helpful rate of
fire<00:01:41.360> red<00:01:42.360> fire<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.899> gun<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.259> just

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
fire red fire on this gun is just

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.560 
fire red fire on this gun is just
fantastic<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.759> think<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.270> perfect<00:01:47.570> it's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
fantastic I think it's perfect it's

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.300 
fantastic I think it's perfect it's
pretty<00:01:49.320> fast<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.890> my<00:01:50.009> opinion<00:01:52.130> right<00:01:53.390> accuracy

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
pretty fast in my opinion right accuracy

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.830 
pretty fast in my opinion right accuracy
accuracy<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.270> gun<00:01:59.390> probably<00:02:00.390> gonna<00:02:00.630> be

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
accuracy on this gun probably gonna be

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.100 
accuracy on this gun probably gonna be
its<00:02:00.990> downfall<00:02:01.560> um

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
its downfall um

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.340 
its downfall um
you<00:02:03.650> know<00:02:03.740> i<00:02:04.040> don't<00:02:04.790> i<00:02:05.270> don't<00:02:05.510> see<00:02:05.900> this<00:02:06.110> gun

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
you know i don't i don't see this gun

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.950 
you know i don't i don't see this gun
being<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:06.860> really<00:02:07.130> good<00:02:07.190> lot<00:02:07.960> long-range

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
being a really good lot long-range

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.470 
being a really good lot long-range
weapon<00:02:09.410> I<00:02:09.619> think<00:02:10.610> it's<00:02:10.729> pretty<00:02:10.880> accurate<00:02:11.120> to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
weapon I think it's pretty accurate to

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.920 
weapon I think it's pretty accurate to
medium<00:02:11.840> in<00:02:11.990> short<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.920> that's<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.630> but<00:02:14.630> that's

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
medium in short and that's it but that's

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.140 
medium in short and that's it but that's
just<00:02:15.050> me<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:18.260> ammo<00:02:18.440> on<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:18.770> gun<00:02:18.950> ml<00:02:19.940> comes

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
just me the ammo on this gun ml comes

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.970 
just me the ammo on this gun ml comes
with<00:02:20.330> 35<00:02:20.900> out<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:22.270> 105<00:02:23.270> which<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.620> lot

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
with 35 out of 105 which is a lot

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.670 
with 35 out of 105 which is a lot
compared<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.910> most<00:02:26.510> other<00:02:26.840> assault<00:02:27.620> rifles

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
compared to most other assault rifles

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.330 
compared to most other assault rifles
you<00:02:28.190> know<00:02:28.310> like<00:02:28.490> 3<00:02:28.700> 8<00:02:28.790> 30<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.420> 90<00:02:30.100> so<00:02:31.100> that's

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
you know like 3 8 30 and 90 so that's

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.400 
you know like 3 8 30 and 90 so that's
always<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.700> plus<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.330> know<00:02:32.480> if<00:02:32.810> especially<00:02:33.320> if

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
always a plus you know if especially if

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.340 
always a plus you know if especially if
you<00:02:33.470> like<00:02:33.650> tea<00:02:34.310> if<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.760> go<00:02:34.880> through<00:02:35.150> your<00:02:35.390> mo<00:02:36.320> a

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
firing rate all right let's start

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.130 
firing rate all right let's start
scoring<00:02:44.800> of<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:46.430> power<00:02:46.720> going<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.840> have<00:02:47.989> to

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
scoring of the power going to have to

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.010 
scoring of the power going to have to
