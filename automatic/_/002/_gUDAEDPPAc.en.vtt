advantage and temple now card advantage
in<00:00:14.910> tempo<00:00:15.240> both<00:00:15.570> apply<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.020> magic<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.130> general

in tempo both apply to magic in general
not<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:17.789> limited<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:19.080> they're<00:00:19.230> still<00:00:19.410> very

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
not just limited but they're still very

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.800 
not just limited but they're still very
important<00:00:20.279> when<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.580> are<00:00:20.609> evaluating<00:00:21.449> cards

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
important when you are evaluating cards

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.380 
important when you are evaluating cards
while<00:00:21.960> drafting<00:00:22.400> so<00:00:23.400> let's<00:00:23.789> start<00:00:23.970> off<00:00:24.090> by

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
while drafting so let's start off by

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.890 
while drafting so let's start off by
saying<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.439> fact<00:00:26.220> which<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.609> basically<00:00:26.910> magic

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
saying a fact which is basically magic

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.339 
saying a fact which is basically magic
is<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> game<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.680> limited<00:00:29.160> resources<00:00:30.260> for<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
is a game of limited resources for the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.959 
is a game of limited resources for the
ball<00:00:31.439> part<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.710> start<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.099> seven<00:00:32.399> cards<00:00:32.790> in

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
ball part you start with seven cards in

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.540 
ball part you start with seven cards in
your<00:00:33.000> hand<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.960> draw<00:00:34.320> one<00:00:34.649> card<00:00:34.890> per<00:00:35.100> turn

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
your hand and you draw one card per turn

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.889 
your hand and you draw one card per turn
you<00:00:35.790> know<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.059> skip<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.450> if<00:00:36.540> you're<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.690> first

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you know you skip it if you're the first

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.720 
you know you skip it if you're the first
player<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.890> know<00:00:37.980> seven<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.340> hand<00:00:38.579> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
player but you know seven in hand and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.959 
player but you know seven in hand and
one<00:00:38.820> per<00:00:38.940> turn<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.329> then<00:00:40.230> uh<00:00:40.550> in<00:00:41.550> terms<00:00:41.760> of

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
one per turn and then uh in terms of

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:42.410 
one per turn and then uh in terms of
mana

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
mana

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.600 
mana
you<00:00:42.960> restrict<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.440> putting<00:00:43.800> down<00:00:44.010> one<00:00:44.309> land

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
you restrict it to putting down one land

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.540 
you restrict it to putting down one land
per<00:00:44.820> turn<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.930> mana<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.649> also<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.309> know<00:00:47.340> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
per turn so mana is also you know a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.639 
per turn so mana is also you know a
limited<00:00:48.000> resource<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.170> course<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.469> also

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
limited resource and of course you also

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.439 
limited resource and of course you also
start<00:00:50.010> with<00:00:50.100> twenty<00:00:50.399> life<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.120> lose<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
start with twenty life and you lose it

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.930 
start with twenty life and you lose it
when<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.629> get<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.870> zero<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.460> mean<00:00:53.610> those<00:00:53.789> are

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
when you get to zero so I mean those are

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.520 
when you get to zero so I mean those are
the<00:00:53.969> three<00:00:54.270> major<00:00:54.449> resources<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> game

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the three major resources in the game

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.430 
the three major resources in the game
cards<00:00:56.280> life<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.030> mana<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.510> all<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.289> them<00:00:58.410> are

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
cards life and mana and all of them are

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.689 
cards life and mana and all of them are
limited<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.219> so<00:01:00.590> this<00:01:01.590> let's<00:01:02.190> go<00:01:02.309> ahead<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
limited and so this let's go ahead and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.359 
limited and so this let's go ahead and
explain<00:01:03.300> why<00:01:03.629> cards<00:01:04.409> are<00:01:04.650> one<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> most

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
explain why cards are one of the most

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.920 
explain why cards are one of the most
important<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:05.939> limited<00:01:06.210> resources

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
important and limited resources

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.690 
important and limited resources
now<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.130> basic<00:01:08.850> premise<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.590> cards<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:11.159> things

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
now the basic premise is cards do things

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.090 
now the basic premise is cards do things
you<00:01:12.030> know<00:01:12.119> obviously<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:13.439> can't<00:01:13.710> do<00:01:13.860> anything

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
you know obviously you can't do anything

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.950 
you know obviously you can't do anything
without<00:01:14.310> cards<00:01:14.790> cards<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.659> things<00:01:15.840> that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
without cards cards are the things that

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.740 
without cards cards are the things that
actually<00:01:16.200> let<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.830> things<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.570> more

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
actually let you do things and the more

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.630 
actually let you do things and the more
cards<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.890> more<00:01:20.100> things<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.549> can

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
cards you have the more things you can

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.149 
cards you have the more things you can
do<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.180> let's<00:01:22.170> go<00:01:22.290> ahead<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.500> dive<00:01:22.860> right<00:01:22.890> into

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
do so let's go ahead and dive right into

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.490 
do so let's go ahead and dive right into
an<00:01:23.369> example<00:01:23.790> from<00:01:23.909> AVR<00:01:24.360> let's<00:01:25.170> look<00:01:25.320> at<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
an example from AVR let's look at the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.160 
an example from AVR let's look at the
fleeting<00:01:25.830> distraction<00:01:26.330> now<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.509> card<00:01:27.810> it's

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
fleeting distraction now this card it's

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.200 
fleeting distraction now this card it's
not<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.710> best<00:01:29.340> card<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> world<00:01:29.970> but

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
not the the best card in the world but

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.420 
not the the best card in the world but
it's<00:01:30.360> playable<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.740> actually<00:01:32.220> only

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
it's playable and it's actually only

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.749 
it's playable and it's actually only
playable<00:01:32.909> because<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.750> one<00:01:34.070> fact<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.280> that's

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
playable because of one fact and that's

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.850 
playable because of one fact and that's
because<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:37.020> trip<00:01:37.290> sorry

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
because it's a can trip sorry

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.770 
because it's a can trip sorry
so<00:01:38.369> what<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.820> trip<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> card<00:01:39.750> that

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
so what a can trip is is a card that

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.480 
so what a can trip is is a card that
replaces<00:01:40.259> itself<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.340> look

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
replaces itself and if you if you look

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.340 
replaces itself and if you if you look
in<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.729> text<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.180> see<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.570> when<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.170> play

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
in the text you see that when you play

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.990 
in the text you see that when you play
feeding<00:01:43.710> cleaning<00:01:44.040> distraction<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.790> get<00:01:44.909> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
feeding cleaning distraction you get to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.450 
feeding cleaning distraction you get to
draw<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> card<00:01:45.380> because<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> effect<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.950> it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
draw a card because the effect that it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.310 
draw a card because the effect that it
has<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.820> board<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.299> not<00:01:48.720> major<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.229> know

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
has on the board is not major you know

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.179 
has on the board is not major you know
it<00:01:49.680> gives<00:01:50.130> minus<00:01:50.490> 1-0<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.390> target<00:01:51.659> creature

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
it gives minus 1-0 to target creature

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.520 
it gives minus 1-0 to target creature
and<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.310> very<00:01:53.549> best<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.659> save<00:01:55.020> one<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
and it's very best that can save one of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.929 
and it's very best that can save one of
your<00:01:55.619> creatures<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.219> know<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.490> kill<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:56.909> of

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
your creatures you know and kill one of

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.179 
your creatures you know and kill one of
your<00:01:57.090> points<00:01:57.270> creatures<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.960> combat<00:01:58.350> say<00:01:58.950> if

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
your points creatures in combat say if

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.190 
your points creatures in combat say if
you<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> 2/2<00:01:59.909> was<00:02:00.119> blocking<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.540> 2/2<00:02:00.930> and

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
you know a 2/2 was blocking a 2/2 and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.050 
you know a 2/2 was blocking a 2/2 and
then<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.860> give<00:02:02.100> -<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:02.490> -<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.759> go<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.880> your

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
then you give - one - to go to your

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.910 
then you give - one - to go to your
opponent's<00:02:03.420> -<00:02:03.540> -<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:04.350> way<00:02:04.469> your<00:02:04.619> creature

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
opponent's - - that way your creature

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.830 
opponent's - - that way your creature
lives<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.250> bear's<00:02:05.430> dies<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.450> that's<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
lives in bear's dies and that's the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.589 
lives in bear's dies and that's the
best-case<00:02:07.079> scenario<00:02:07.580> but<00:02:08.580> if<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.119> was<00:02:09.270> just

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
best-case scenario but if it was just

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.240 
best-case scenario but if it was just
that<00:02:09.780> effect<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.440> would<00:02:10.649> still<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.160> an

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
that effect it would still be an

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.370 
that effect it would still be an
unplayable<00:02:11.580> card<00:02:12.090> because

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
unplayable card because

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.590 
unplayable card because
you<00:02:13.740> wasted<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.340> card<00:02:14.610> slot<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:15.000> your<00:02:15.120> deck<00:02:15.330> on

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
you wasted a card slot in your deck on

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.740 
you wasted a card slot in your deck on
something<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.500> doesn't<00:02:16.680> do<00:02:16.890> much<00:02:17.270> into<00:02:18.270> you

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
something that doesn't do much into you

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.390 
something that doesn't do much into you
know<00:02:18.870> like<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.230> said<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.740> start<00:02:20.010> with<00:02:20.130> seven

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
know like I said you start with seven

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.830 
know like I said you start with seven
cards<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.850> brought<00:02:21.030> one<00:02:21.270> per<00:02:21.420> turn

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
cards and you brought one per turn

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.990 
cards and you brought one per turn
you<00:02:22.260> want<00:02:22.470> your<00:02:22.620> cards<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.070> as<00:02:23.190> efficient

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
you want your cards to be as efficient

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.870 
you want your cards to be as efficient
as<00:02:24.150> possible<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:25.410> if<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:26.040> did<00:02:26.250> not<00:02:26.430> have<00:02:26.700> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
as possible so if it did not have the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.210 
as possible so if it did not have the
can<00:02:27.090> trip<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:28.020> would<00:02:28.110> be<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> terrible<00:02:28.560> card<00:02:28.950> but

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
can trip it would be a terrible card but

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.910 
can trip it would be a terrible card but
because<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.910> has<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.390> draw<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.630> card<00:02:31.080> it's<00:02:31.560> a

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
because it has the draw a card it's a

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.900 
because it has the draw a card it's a
playable<00:02:32.190> card<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.230> other<00:02:34.560> cards<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.430> AVR

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
playable card and so other cards in AVR

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.550 
playable card and so other cards in AVR
that<00:02:36.240> are<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.570> trips<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.230> can<00:02:37.350> look<00:02:37.440> at

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
that are can trips you can look at

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.950 
that are can trips you can look at
Griffin<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.100> guard<00:02:38.310> it's<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.180> 3-2<00:02:39.510> flying<00:02:39.780> for

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
Griffin and guard it's a 3-2 flying for

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.750 
Griffin and guard it's a 3-2 flying for
five<00:02:40.140> mana<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.770> when<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.250> comes<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.580> play

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
five mana and when it comes to to play

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.940 
five mana and when it comes to to play
draw<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> card<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.230> know<00:02:43.290> not<00:02:43.470> only<00:02:43.740> do<00:02:43.860> you

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
draw a card so you know not only do you

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.040 
draw a card so you know not only do you
get<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.160> 3-2<00:02:44.610> flying<00:02:44.910> body<00:02:45.180> which<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.690> worth<00:02:45.870> you

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
get a 3-2 flying body which is worth you

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.590 
get a 3-2 flying body which is worth you
know<00:02:46.080> three<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.440> four<00:02:46.620> mana<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:46.920> itself<00:02:47.600> the

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
know three to four mana in itself the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.910 
know three to four mana in itself the
reason<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.140> five<00:02:49.350> mana<00:02:49.560> because

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
reason it's that five mana because

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.530 
reason it's that five mana because
Wizards<00:02:50.250> wants<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.490> up<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.730> cost<00:02:50.940> because<00:02:51.420> it

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
Wizards wants to up the cost because it

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.680 
Wizards wants to up the cost because it
replaces<00:02:51.810> itself<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:54.060> yeah<00:02:54.390> card

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
replaces itself and so yeah card

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.690 
replaces itself and so yeah card
advantage<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.320> very<00:02:55.830> important<00:02:56.220> because<00:02:56.370> you

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
advantage is very important because you

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.040 
advantage is very important because you
know<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.090> more<00:02:57.270> cards<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.540> have<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.870> more

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
know the more cards you have the more

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.530 
know the more cards you have the more
stuff<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.290> do<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:59.340> anything<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.180> lets<00:03:00.450> you

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
stuff you do and anything that lets you

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.450 
stuff you do and anything that lets you
draw<00:03:00.780> more<00:03:00.990> cards<00:03:01.260> lets<00:03:01.710> you<00:03:01.860> do<00:03:02.010> more<00:03:02.190> things

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
draw more cards lets you do more things

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.180 
draw more cards lets you do more things
so<00:03:03.330> I<00:03:03.690> mean<00:03:03.780> any<00:03:04.170> card<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.500> gives<00:03:04.710> you<00:03:04.830> card

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
so I mean any card that gives you card

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.520 
so I mean any card that gives you card
advantage<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.940> pretty<00:03:06.690> good<00:03:06.840> when<00:03:07.350> drafting

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
advantage is pretty good when drafting

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.250 
advantage is pretty good when drafting
and<00:03:08.250> we're<00:03:09.030> gonna<00:03:09.180> go<00:03:09.360> ahead<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.540> segue<00:03:09.900> into

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
and we're gonna go ahead and segue into

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.890 
and we're gonna go ahead and segue into
temple<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.190> like<00:03:12.120> if<00:03:12.240> you<00:03:12.360> look<00:03:12.450> at<00:03:12.540> Griffin

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
temple and like if you look at Griffin

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.230 
temple and like if you look at Griffin
dark<00:03:13.170> its<00:03:13.410> card<00:03:13.710> advantage<00:03:13.800> but<00:03:14.760> it's<00:03:15.000> not<00:03:15.210> a

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
dark its card advantage but it's not a

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.210 
dark its card advantage but it's not a
super<00:03:15.750> high<00:03:15.870> pick<00:03:16.170> because<00:03:16.530> it's<00:03:16.680> five<00:03:16.920> mana

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
super high pick because it's five mana

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.580 
super high pick because it's five mana
and<00:03:17.520> that<00:03:18.120> means<00:03:18.360> it's<00:03:18.570> not<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.930> good<00:03:19.200> temple

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
and that means it's not a good temple

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.350 
and that means it's not a good temple
play<00:03:19.770> you<00:03:20.310> know<00:03:20.400> it's<00:03:20.610> it's<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:20.970> good<00:03:21.090> card

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
play you know it's it's a good card

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.660 
play you know it's it's a good card
advantage<00:03:21.480> play<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.170> replaces<00:03:22.500> itself<00:03:22.890> but

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
advantage play it replaces itself but

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.550

the reason this is so important is you

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.500 
the reason this is so important is you
know<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.280> in<00:03:44.400> my<00:03:44.580> previous<00:03:44.940> episode<00:03:45.090> when<00:03:45.420> it

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
know like in my previous episode when it

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.330 
know like in my previous episode when it
talks<00:03:45.660> about<00:03:45.720> mana<00:03:46.080> curves<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:47.010> want<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.250> be

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
talks about mana curves you want to be

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.640 
talks about mana curves you want to be
using<00:03:47.760> all<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.330> your<00:03:48.690> mana<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.440> want<00:03:49.590> to

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
be using it as efficiently as possible

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.720 
be using it as efficiently as possible
so<00:03:52.110> temple<00:03:52.470> is<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.620> concept<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.220> using<00:03:53.580> your

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
it's actually both the most important

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.120 
it's actually both the most important
resource<00:05:23.080> because<00:05:23.470> if<00:05:23.590> you<00:05:23.650> have<00:05:23.770> zero<00:05:24.010> you

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
resource because if you have zero you

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.430 
resource because if you have zero you
die<00:05:24.340> but<00:05:25.150> it's<00:05:25.270> also<00:05:25.480> the<00:05:25.750> least<00:05:25.870> important

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
die but it's also the least important

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.260 
die but it's also the least important
because<00:05:26.620> you<00:05:26.920> have<00:05:27.100> 20<00:05:27.490> you<00:05:27.670> start<00:05:27.880> with<00:05:27.970> 20<00:05:28.210> of

because you have 20 you start with 20 of
it<00:05:28.390> basically<00:05:28.750> and<00:05:29.430> the<00:05:30.430> thing<00:05:30.610> is<00:05:30.790> you'll

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
it basically and the thing is you'll

the game whereas when you have more
cards<00:05:40.060> you<00:05:40.840> can<00:05:40.990> do<00:05:41.140> more<00:05:41.350> things<00:05:41.650> and<00:05:42.010> when

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
cards you can do more things and when

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.010 
cards you can do more things and when
you<00:05:42.490> have<00:05:42.640> more<00:05:42.850> mana<00:05:43.180> you<00:05:43.419> can<00:05:43.570> do<00:05:43.660> bigger<00:05:43.930> and

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
you have more mana you can do bigger and

you have more mana you can do bigger and
better<00:05:44.230> things<00:05:44.380> more<00:05:44.860> quickly<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:46.330> you<00:05:46.960> know

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
better things more quickly and you know

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.630 
better things more quickly and you know
