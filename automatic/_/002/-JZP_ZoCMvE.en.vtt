00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.660
 welcome to my dry 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.730
 come today style himself three times 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.500
 special i will do something again today 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.390
 make sweet if you have a pumpkin pie 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.580
 maybe without thinking now 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.189
 some pumpkin cake that is even possible 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.259
 I will not be the opposite today 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.960
 I convince this pumpkin pie 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.900
 that's how delicious it is 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.279
 my top favorite among the cakes is 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.560
 so I have you so many times now 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.120
 baked last year already have 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.250
 then the people did not say that it was 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.690
 in pumpkin pie is and really no 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.059
 comes up with the idea that the pumpkin 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.250
 You can put the pumpkin in there 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.219
 of course also exchange for example 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.930
 against carrots or against zucchini then 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.399
 Do you have carrots? 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.410
 I say I now just the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.100
 ingredients and then show you how it is 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.350
 continues 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.350
 for the batter you need four eggs 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.999
 210 grams of sugar 180 grams of oil that is 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.710
 neutral sunflower oil 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.720
 theoretically you can also pumpkin 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.799
 use oil or walnut oil or something 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.119
 similar to a pack of baking powder 250 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.040
 gram flour a tablespoon of cinnamon not so 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.670
 all the way marc takes away but me 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.310
 think that fits perfectly pure 80 g 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.710
 chopped almonds 80 grams ground 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.170
 almonds and of course a pumpkin i 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.399
 I need an idea now 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.630
 her 300 grams 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:35.040
 that's one of those now weighs about 1700 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.560
 I have now washed at the likely 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.990
 namely the shell with used and the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.820
 Pumpkin is also the first thing now 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.350
 I have to prepare as I said 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.399
 that a stool which may times the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.290
 bowl with food 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.600
 I think he is suitable for the cake 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.250
 actually best because he just 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.930
 also has this beautiful orange color 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.930
 he misses on pump very hard 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.100
 that can get out of here 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:15.870
 and then I cut myself all the way 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:18.930
 Big will need other gourds 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.580
 Peel zucchini as I said they can 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.210
 Apply ever let in carrots 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.560
 it will also tell and the pieces 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.230
 I will be in thermomix for a short time now 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.090
 we can chop small in each other 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.460
 mixa make but the bowl is pretty 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.170
 hard so not everyone packs mixa 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.000
 if you have the mixer he does not have it 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.520
 I would pack in their place of 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.190
 small rests or just before cooking 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.350
 and that's how it looks when the pumpkin 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.959
 small chopped is you see the right 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.970
 Great orange color and it right 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.230
 nice juicy 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.470
 I already have a cake shape 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.940
 prepared I take as a box form 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.280
 and it is a bit bigger 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.040
 box shape which has 30 inches in 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.500
 the length and I have already 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.320
 chosen and greased as first 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.260
 endangered and pleasant in mine 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.720
 direction I now give the eggs and the 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.410
 Then as always first with the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.410
 mix sugar 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.030
 maybe that was not 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.219
 be biscuitteig 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.150
 and now everyone else is coming 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.150
 ingredients with pure 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.550
 and now it has everything 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.550
 introduced 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.950
 as soon as everything is done, dough is ready and ready 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.030
 can be filled them the form 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.450
 Now I'm doing as I said in my 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.820
 You could also have another box shape 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.270
 form taking springform or a form 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.430
 baking sheet as I said this 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.390
 box shape has the perfect size animal 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:13.070
 a length of 30 cm 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.480
 because the dough fits in really well then 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.200
 just a little bit back and forth 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.780
 support 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.160
 so that the dough is distributed evenly 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.650
 and I can already see that 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.590
 pretty much dough for the baking pan though 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.870
 that's a solid and fixed rateike 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.950
 wet dough and net and bisky takter 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.500
 just loose is now becomes like that 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.080
 at 170 degrees, please do not higher at upper 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.790
 baked for about 75 minutes 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.710
 After that I will definitely do that 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.510
 probe rod and dates it goes straight 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.950
 continue 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.090
 I already have something for the cake 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.190
 let cool down 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:54.340
 the hand now just supports itself 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:05:00.860
 out of shape and then I give it to him 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:03.980
 on my cake the really nice 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.010
 soft now I think with a cloth 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.620
 shut it off and shut it down later 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.780
 there's just the cast on it and 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.610
 then this ready if the cake then 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.860
 Of course, you can finish baking 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.900
 Just eat like you can take him with you 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.490
 dusting powdered sugar or with a 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.740
 show CÃ´te d'Azur cover 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.590
 I like him most, though 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.050
 a lemon powdered sugar in front of it because of me 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.780
 find that friendly glaze 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.940
 just perfect matches and runs 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.860
 like to shred the whole then with 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.820
 a little chocolate and how I do it 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.010
 I'll show you now 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.930
 and for that you need 100 grams 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:43.810
 powdered sugar two to three tablespoons 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.810
 lemon juice and a teaspoon of cinnamon 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:53.380
 I have the lemon in here and go 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.380
 the here with this since the 10th 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:04.900
 so he should be under control so it was 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:11.320
 not too thin 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.320
 And then the cake will help you with that 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:24.550
 and then who wants to take something 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:27.970
 tender chocolate and brought the 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:30.700
 simply because over it and then I'll give 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:36.250
 likes to make a few changes 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:38.050
 about it if you previously with for example 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.510
 walnuts have worked so if you 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.460
 character choice must with yes 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:46.750
 then he is now completely 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:49.750
 nice so what help on that and give 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.040
 decorate it just really nice the 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.460
 almonds must now a bit 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.460
 to press 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.220
 and if the cake is then complete 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:03.760
 cooled and the cruze is dry 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.300

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.770
