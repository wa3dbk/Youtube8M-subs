you<00:00:49.920> probably<00:00:50.100> seen<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.579> link<00:00:50.760> below<00:00:51.410> it<00:00:52.410> was

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
you probably seen a link below it was

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.770 
you probably seen a link below it was
about<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:53.059> 25%<00:00:54.059> chance<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.539> might

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
about a 25% chance that you might

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.080 
about a 25% chance that you might
actually<00:00:55.020> get<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.070> found<00:00:56.280> another<00:00:56.610> way

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
actually get in but I found another way

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.840 
actually get in but I found another way
that<00:00:57.120> seems<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.079> be<00:00:58.109> working<00:00:58.260> 100%<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:59.190> me<00:00:59.280> so

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
that seems to be working 100% for me so

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.819 
that seems to be working 100% for me so
what<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.719> press<00:01:00.989> triangle

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
what I do is that I press triangle

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.579 
what I do is that I press triangle
