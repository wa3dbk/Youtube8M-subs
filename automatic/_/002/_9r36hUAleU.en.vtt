00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
let's say uh you are in the gold section

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.080 
let's say uh you are in the gold section
which<00:02:33.150> i<00:02:33.360> am<00:02:33.450> at<00:02:33.630> right<00:02:33.660> now<00:02:33.870> i'm<00:02:34.290> at<00:02:35.090> 1432

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
which i am at right now i'm at 1432

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.750 
which i am at right now i'm at 1432
trophies<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:36.720> if<00:02:37.170> i<00:02:37.590> get<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.010> one-star<00:02:38.550> let's

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
trophies so if i get a one-star let's

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.510 
trophies so if i get a one-star let's
say<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.940> get<00:02:39.360> 200<00:02:39.720> dark<00:02:39.900> elixir<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.560> get<00:02:40.950> 40k

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
say I get 200 dark elixir I get 40k

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.000 
say I get 200 dark elixir I get 40k
regular<00:02:42.240> /<00:02:42.600> /<00:02:42.750> elixir<00:02:44.840> 40,000<00:02:45.840> gold<00:02:46.050> and

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
regular / / elixir 40,000 gold and

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.680 
regular / / elixir 40,000 gold and
that's<00:02:47.190> per<00:02:47.460> battle<00:02:47.700> won<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:48.270> I'm<00:02:48.510> guessing

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
that's per battle won so I'm guessing

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.200 
that's per battle won so I'm guessing
that's<00:02:48.990> just<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:50.040> just<00:02:50.190> need<00:02:50.310> one<00:02:50.460> star<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.150> if

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
that's just you just need one star so if

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.820 
that's just you just need one star so if
you<00:02:51.270> get<00:02:51.360> 3<00:02:51.570> stars<00:02:51.630> or<00:02:52.020> 1<00:02:52.170> star<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.650> won't

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
you get 3 stars or 1 star it won't

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.340 
you get 3 stars or 1 star it won't
matter<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.250> still<00:02:53.310> get<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.730> same<00:02:53.760> amount<00:02:54.350> so

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
matter you still get the same amount so

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.040 
matter you still get the same amount so
that<00:02:55.770> will<00:02:56.220> make<00:02:57.030> probably<00:02:57.510> lots<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.810> people

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
that will make probably lots of people

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.080 
that will make probably lots of people
happy<00:02:58.410> because<00:02:58.680> now<00:02:58.740> clans<00:02:59.610> will<00:02:59.760> actually<00:03:00.000> be

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
happy because now clans will actually be

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.640 
happy because now clans will actually be
more<00:03:00.270> competitive<00:03:00.540> since<00:03:00.960> everybody<00:03:01.410> wants

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
more competitive since everybody wants

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.400 
more competitive since everybody wants
to<00:03:01.680> get<00:03:01.860> more<00:03:02.780> bonuses<00:03:03.780> for<00:03:03.930> measurement

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
to get more bonuses for measurement

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.380 
to get more bonuses for measurement
every<00:03:04.800> battle<00:03:05.340> won<00:03:05.490> so<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.240> great

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
every battle won so this is great

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.650 
every battle won so this is great
because<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.950> don't<00:03:08.310> know<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.580> adds<00:03:09.150> on<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.450> the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
because I don't know it adds on to the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.690 
because I don't know it adds on to the
loot<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.080> already<00:03:10.530> got<00:03:10.770> from<00:03:11.070> their<00:03:11.190> storages

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
loot you already got from their storages

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.990 
loot you already got from their storages
but<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.060> also<00:03:12.270> gives<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.900> bonus<00:03:13.580> so<00:03:14.580> this

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
but it also gives you a bonus so this

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.940 
but it also gives you a bonus so this
will<00:03:15.150> really<00:03:15.420> help<00:03:15.510> towards<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.590> elixir

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
will really help towards the elixir

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.650 
will really help towards the elixir
where<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.460> bonus<00:03:17.730> elixir<00:03:18.060> will<00:03:18.210> really<00:03:18.540> help

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
where the bonus elixir will really help

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.350 
where the bonus elixir will really help
towards<00:03:19.370> covering<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.460> cost<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.820> your<00:03:20.850> army

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360

so you won't have to worry as much about

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.420 
so you won't have to worry as much about
you<00:03:24.570> know<00:03:24.690> spending<00:03:25.230> your<00:03:25.380> army<00:03:25.650> +<00:03:25.920> gaining
