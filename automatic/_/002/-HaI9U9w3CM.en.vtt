perimeter that is greater than 300 feet

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.090 
perimeter that is greater than 300 feet
or<00:00:15.870> another<00:00:16.260> way<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.440> think<00:00:16.560> about<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
or another way to think about it the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.599 
or another way to think about it the
perimeter<00:00:17.580> has<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.060> 300<00:00:18.779> feet<00:00:18.960> or<00:00:19.170> less

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
perimeter has to be 300 feet or less

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.550 
perimeter has to be 300 feet or less
find<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.789> perimeter<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.869> porch<00:00:22.140> using

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
find the perimeter of the porch using

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.470 
find the perimeter of the porch using
the<00:00:22.650> floor<00:00:22.859> plan<00:00:23.130> below<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.760> determine

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
the floor plan below and determine

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.179 
the floor plan below and determine
whether<00:00:24.630> or<00:00:24.750> not<00:00:24.900> its<00:00:25.140> perimeter<00:00:25.500> meets<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
whether or not its perimeter meets the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.640 
whether or not its perimeter meets the
city's<00:00:26.369> code<00:00:27.019> requirements<00:00:28.019> all<00:00:28.230> right<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.590> we

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
city's code requirements all right so we

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.740 
city's code requirements all right so we
need<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.830> find<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.099> perimeter<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:30.359> porch

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
need to find the perimeter of this porch

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.659 
need to find the perimeter of this porch
and<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.019> as<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> reminder<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.099> perimeter<00:00:32.579> is

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and just as a reminder the perimeter is

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.670 
and just as a reminder the perimeter is
the<00:00:32.700> distance<00:00:32.850> around<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:34.050> object<00:00:34.590> or

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the distance around the object or

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
the distance around the object or
another<00:00:34.860> way<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.010> thinking<00:00:35.370> about<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.579> it's

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
another way of thinking about it it's

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.850 
another way of thinking about it it's
the<00:00:35.730> sum<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.600> lengths<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.290> sides<00:00:37.320> of

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the sum of the lengths of the sides of

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.799 
the sum of the lengths of the sides of
the<00:00:37.950> object<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.910> find<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.360> perimeter<00:00:39.540> of

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the object so to find the perimeter of

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.840 
the object so to find the perimeter of
this<00:00:40.050> porch<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.160> add<00:00:41.280> up<00:00:41.309> these

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
this porch we just have to add up these

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.030 
this porch we just have to add up these
lengths<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.719> different<00:00:43.079> sides<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:44.010> let's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
lengths of the different sides so let's

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.639 
lengths of the different sides so let's
do<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.760> we're<00:00:44.879> gonna<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> 40<00:00:45.649> we're

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
do that so we're gonna have a 40 we're

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.850 
do that so we're gonna have a 40 we're
going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> add<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.100> 40<00:00:47.640> plus<00:00:48.390> 20<00:00:48.719> plus<00:00:50.120> 55<00:00:51.860> plus

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
going to add up 40 plus 20 plus 55 plus

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.650 
going to add up 40 plus 20 plus 55 plus
30<00:00:53.309> plus<00:00:54.620> 95<00:00:56.570> plus<00:00:57.570> 50<00:00:58.430> plus<00:00:59.430> 50<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.539> we're

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
30 plus 95 plus 50 plus 50 and we're

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.000 
30 plus 95 plus 50 plus 50 and we're
adding<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.410> make<00:01:01.530> sure<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.770> know<00:01:01.890> what

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
adding just to make sure we know what

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.920 
adding just to make sure we know what
we're<00:01:02.129> doing<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:03.239> make<00:01:03.510> sure<00:01:03.539> we've

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
we're doing and we make sure we've

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.509 
we're doing and we make sure we've
aligned<00:01:04.320> them<00:01:04.500> by<00:01:04.619> place<00:01:04.920> which<00:01:05.159> we've<00:01:05.339> done

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
aligned them by place which we've done

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.490 
aligned them by place which we've done
here<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.060> ones<00:01:06.270> places<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:06.869> all<00:01:06.990> aligned<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
here the ones places are all aligned the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.410 
here the ones places are all aligned the
tens<00:01:07.740> places<00:01:08.010> are<00:01:08.250> all<00:01:08.310> aligned<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.150> now<00:01:09.270> let's

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
tens places are all aligned so now let's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.640 
tens places are all aligned so now let's
start<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> ones<00:01:10.020> place

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
start on the ones place

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.300 
start on the ones place
what<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.780> zero<00:01:12.780> plus<00:01:13.049> zero<00:01:13.080> plus<00:01:13.470> five<00:01:13.920> plus

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
what is zero plus zero plus five plus

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.130 
what is zero plus zero plus five plus
zero<00:01:14.340> plus<00:01:14.909> five<00:01:15.090> plus<00:01:15.479> zero<00:01:15.509> well<00:01:15.990> that's

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
zero plus five plus zero well that's

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.780 
zero plus five plus zero well that's
really<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> same<00:01:16.770> thing<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.100> 5<00:01:17.310> plus<00:01:17.610> 5

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
really just the same thing as 5 plus 5

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.499 
really just the same thing as 5 plus 5
which<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.600> 10<00:01:18.960> right<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.130> zero<00:01:20.460> carry<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> 1

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
which is 10 right the zero carry the 1

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.820 
which is 10 right the zero carry the 1
or<00:01:21.869> another<00:01:22.110> way<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.259> thinking<00:01:22.380> about<00:01:22.740> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
or another way of thinking about it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.980 
or another way of thinking about it
regroup<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:23.850> which<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.689> 10

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
regroup the one which is really a 10

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.580 
regroup the one which is really a 10
right<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:26.580> 10<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.479> one<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> tens

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
right it's it's 10 the one in the tens

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.550 
right it's it's 10 the one in the tens
place<00:01:28.650> literally<00:01:29.130> represents<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.320> 10<00:01:31.320> so

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
place literally represents or the 10 so

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.109 
place literally represents or the 10 so
we<00:01:31.650> put<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> tens<00:01:32.400> place<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.850> now<00:01:33.060> we

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
we put it in the tens place and now we

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.190 
we put it in the tens place and now we
add<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.540> all<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> tens<00:01:34.079> places<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:35.670> have

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
add up all of the tens places so we have

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.050 
add up all of the tens places so we have
1<00:01:37.200> plus<00:01:37.500> 4<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.979> 5<00:01:38.220> plus<00:01:38.759> 2<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.030> 7<00:01:39.259> plus<00:01:40.259> 5<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.590> 12

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
1 plus 4 is 5 plus 2 is 7 plus 5 is 12

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.010 
1 plus 4 is 5 plus 2 is 7 plus 5 is 12
plus<00:01:42.060> 3<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.659> 15<00:01:43.170> plus<00:01:43.799> 9<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:45.149> 20<00:01:45.630> 4<00:01:45.899> plus<00:01:46.619> 5<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.220> 29

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
plus 3 is 15 plus 9 is 20 4 plus 5 is 29

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.620 
plus 3 is 15 plus 9 is 20 4 plus 5 is 29
so<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> total<00:01:49.409> perimeter<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.280> Mike's<00:01:51.149> porch

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
so the total perimeter of Mike's porch

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.749 
so the total perimeter of Mike's porch
ears<00:01:52.700> 290<00:01:53.700> feet<00:01:53.939> which<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.869> less<00:01:55.590> than<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.219> is

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
ears 290 feet which is less than it is

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.560 
ears 290 feet which is less than it is
less<00:01:57.299> than<00:01:57.829> 300<00:01:58.829> feet<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.850> meets<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.360> city

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
less than 300 feet so it meets the city

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.240 
less than 300 feet so it meets the city
code<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.049> could<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.290> even<00:02:01.350> been<00:02:01.619> equal<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
code it could have even been equal to

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.310 
code it could have even been equal to
300<00:02:02.909> feet<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.659> could<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:03.869> even<00:02:03.990> said<00:02:04.200> it

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
300 feet so we could have even said it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.709 
300 feet so we could have even said it
just<00:02:04.560> has<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.799> be<00:02:04.920> less<00:02:05.130> than<00:02:05.159> or<00:02:05.520> equal<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.420> 300

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
just has to be less than or equal to 300

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.660 
just has to be less than or equal to 300
feet<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.200> we<00:02:07.290> meet<00:02:07.500> our<00:02:07.680> city<00:02:07.950> code<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.399> he<00:02:08.520> can

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
feet and we meet our city code so he can

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.560 
feet and we meet our city code so he can
go<00:02:08.849> ahead<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.270> build<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.050> porch
