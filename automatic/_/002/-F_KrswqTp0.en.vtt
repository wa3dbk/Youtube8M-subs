00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.219
 what's happening here right now and today 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.660
 I bring the guide of garín also has 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.950
 asked a lot of people is a champion that 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.720
 well after the ugly nerd that 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.489
 they did a long time ago, it's great and 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.200
 by god and it's very opera so nothing 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.820
 I leave you with your good skills 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.649
 kids, I'm here with garen and 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.869
 now let's talk about your skills 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:32.899
 and his passive as always is worth to start 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.609
 by their passive perseverance garen when 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.050
 one suffers from damage or skills 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.690
 enemies during the nine seconds 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.149
 last regenerates 0.5 of your life 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.550
 maximum per second is worth and the damage of 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.790
 subjects where you have this passive 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.530
 and we continue for the decisive blow karen 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.290
 because it is released from any effect of 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.910
 slow down and get 35% of 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.500
 movement speed during 2 with 25 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.600
 seconds not for three seconds to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.790
 level 3 forgiveness and his next attack 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.190
 basic, it inflicts 80 plus a 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.290
 a hundred of your attack damage that is here 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.060
 obviously concede it and silence its 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.659
 objective for two seconds is worth 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.220
 level 3 move here the courage, then the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.320
 passive armor and resistance 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.170
 of garen go are increased in 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.289
 20% and activates it because we put a 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.580
 defensive shield for two seconds 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.220
 decreasing the damage received by 30% 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.490
 and enjoying one of 30% of 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.710
 reduction of adversary control is worth 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.830
 the e the trial that is also very 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.140
 known as spin to win vale 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.300
 garen then quickly rotate your for your 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.479
 sword around your body during 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.729
 three seconds inflicting 20 plus 70% 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.009
 of their attack as physical damage to the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.210
 nearby enemies every second is worth and 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.310
 galen can move between units 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.619
 while it rotates but it moves 20% more 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.450
 slow to go through them directly here 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.429
 puts you can cause good effects 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.550
 critical impacts inflicting damage 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:59.489
 additional and deals 25% less damage 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.410
 to the subjects and monsters is worth 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.039
 it works it 's good then I know what 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.690
 I will explain 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.709
 now we are going from his last injustice 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.530
 too much garen invokes the power of 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.810
 others already to try to execute then to 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.819
 a champion directing therefore 175 points of 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.069
 Physical damage plus one point of damage per 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.319
 every 35 points of life that it lacks in 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.879
 the goal or the less how much 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.590
 less life have more we will take away with 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.800
 the last one is now talking a 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.569
 little of care for her these these two 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.129
 skills work with impact 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.200
 critical the two valuable that we will have 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.610
 Potential potential added a bit with 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.630
 the issue of critical impact objects 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.390
 then I will talk to you 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.950
 let's talk now about what are the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.320
 priorities of this champion is always worth 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.460
 we should give at the beginning a point in 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.920
 the q after we will only give the ea the w 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.320
 and we will continue giving priority to the voucher 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.910
 although the q is very important the e 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.650
 After all, with Karen 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.440
 removing quite more then 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.690
 always prioritize which is a point 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.190
 from w to the last and from the levels 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.980
 corresponding that are 6 on 11 and the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.990
 16 and so the priority would be worth and 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.610
 against monsters because it would be something like that 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.100
 keep in mind that we move a bit more 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.630
 slower if we have the q 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.380
 silencing and masters and we could run more 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.380
 as you see here is worth 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.230
 and the last one after will then be in the 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.599
 phase of tim fain good kids 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.390
 now let's talk a little about the subject of 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.280
 the concepts that this champion has 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.069
 tell us that we have a champion who 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.060
 after the angel is ugly and 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.530
 retouched the mushrooms and all this continues 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.209
 having a lot of trouble with ganen vale 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.370
 for the issue that when we go towards 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.380
 our land that we are going to throw 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.150
 because our combo is going to escape with 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.000
 the w and then he's going to put us up 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.130
 with his cv and with his unique and with his poison 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.480
 worth another treatment that should 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.310
 always avoid with those who are worth as 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.240
 I'm seeing here is a very champion 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.670
 dangerous although it will not touch us 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.489
 our line but we should not go to 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.470
 never put another would be yorick sorry 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.790
 worth in top would be very problematic for 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.910
 the theme that would not stop healing 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.250
 life and it would be quite complicated 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.660
 that fight is worth and the last one would be 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.280
 plan ok we have to be careful 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.080
 also because of his fault 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.580
 critical impacts but by in principle 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.720
 we would not have any problem with the 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.190
 other good lads and we'll 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.440
 explain how we would have to use 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.750
 our skills contract attacker 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.519
 you can imagine that they attack us like this 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.519
 we always throw in principle the q that is worth 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.019
 to silence it then the e as 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.060
 you are watching here 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.349
 we will follow him if we see that it was us 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.000
 be quite and they are throwing us many 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:29.289
 things to fix, that's how we would end up with 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.639
 she is also a carry but as 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.770
 we will have to do the combo the topic is 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.300
 we silenced him we keep giving him the 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.879
 critical impact with the Xs do not have 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.650
 enough objects if we see that the spotlights 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.569
 many are left we throw the w to absorb 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.099
 a little bit of damage with our shield and 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.659
 we will lose it almost never des 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.909
 confrontation unless it's a 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:47.770
 champion that is against skin like the one 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:50.319
 I 've talked to you before, it's worth but in 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.930
 principle that would be the simple vale combo 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:54.069
 we throw the cv then the e and follow him 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.229
 ok because we can move with 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.699
 stability as you already know and finally 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.590
 the ultimate if it were necessary that there 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.780
 I would have little life but good for 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.310
 show you the good thing also to tell you that 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.430
 for summoner spells would come very 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.300
 well the subject of igniting and flashing 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.500
 exhaustion and from this carry and if 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.389
 we want more offensive we would have 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.680
 shrink us always turn good 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.270
 kids, now we're in the store 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.680
 and I'm going to show you the objects that 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.469
 we should buy with this champion 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.629
 It's worth as we always have to start then 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.759
 although it sends us that other items we must 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:24.310
 always start with the boots and the three 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:26.130
 positions that we have worth after 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.590
 that we could buy 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.690
 22 doran swords at most 2 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.950
 then what is the object that 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.720
 we will have to recover from first 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.380
 we will have to review this object worth 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.850
 the bacteriophage we should properly 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.440
 get us with the side deck as soon as 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.050
 we can, it would be our first 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.460
 object of the second object we 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.440
 we would buy the infinite edge for the 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.820
 cool parallel critical impacts are I worth 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.140
 on top of the pot lots of damage 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.510
 basically this object is going to be the one 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.270
 will strengthen us garen voucher 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.610
 I won that they made a faith or they do 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.140
 pretty much it's a player who has 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.900
 a lot of stability online and with a 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.100
 object of life or of armor endures 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.540
 quite well and it does the function of 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.270
 tank one on top better because it has 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.700
 damage then second object would be the 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.900
 cycle is worth the third object we should 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.420
 of buying a guardian angel always 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.880
 with this champion, it is very good this 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.190
 item and it gives us very good stands 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.290
 fourth object we should buy some 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.450
 last words worth is an item that goes 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.520
 really good with this champion and he gives us 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:27.850
 a lot of armor penetration so 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.620
 it would be very good this item is valid for 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.449
 boots you know as always in which 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.400
 which I recommend with this champion 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:35.449
 the mercury is worth without any doubt 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.370
 although he recommends us the speed 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.229
 they are not worth anything to always listen to me 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.509
 those of mercury or this one biden in ya 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:43.729
 those of armor and then we could 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:45.860
 choose between three objects we would have to 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:49.819
 catch another two vouchers since they would be 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:52.610
 the boots 1 the deck 2 the deck the side of 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:55.490
 third on the edge of the room the angel 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.219
 of the guardian of 5th last words and of 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.560
 his three would take another one that could be 

00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:01.090
 a 'warm up' 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.820
 that would be very very good to have 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.820
 pretty life 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.500
 a bloodthirsty that would also be very 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.540
 well for the subject of potential more attack 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.370
 and recover life or finally we 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.950
 we should buy a omen of randín 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.140
 ok and that would be the build of this 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.850
 champion and would be very good this kind of 

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.620
 good build now let's move on to the 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.510
 runas the runes that we should 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.640
 put us would be fifths and marks of damage 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.710
 physical seals of armor and glyphs of 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.210
 Magic resistance is worth it if you want to have 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.980
 rather more endurance at the beginning 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.210
 we would put the flat and if you want to 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.890
 end then we would put the by 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.300
 good level kids and finally I'm going 

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.860
 to leave the stars as they always are 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.050
 21 points in attack and we strengthen 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.940
 cooling and physical damage and 9 in 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.320
 defense that are life and resistances 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.910
 if you liked the guide and the 

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.470
 preference so give favorites 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.340
 subscribe and see you in the next 

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.340
