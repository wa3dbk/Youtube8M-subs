 moisture to wind what to 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:31.110
 leads colds and recoup this has 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.550
 now the effect that, so to speak, everything 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.470

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.520
 just to put on those you can not 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.289

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.880
 circulation of the musculature triggers thereby 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.739
 they'll slap on it specifically 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.630
