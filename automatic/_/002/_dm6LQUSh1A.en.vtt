00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
it's jason said I mean he's not the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.069 
it's jason said I mean he's not the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
answer but it is a nice pickup I mean I

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.990 
answer but it is a nice pickup I mean I
think<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.409> low-risk<00:01:31.860> move<00:01:32.220> he<00:01:32.820> could

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
think it's a low-risk move he could

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.910 
think it's a low-risk move he could
probably<00:01:33.030> fit<00:01:33.750> into<00:01:33.869> some<00:01:34.079> special<00:01:34.500> team<00:01:34.680> they

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
probably fit into some special team they

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.499 
probably fit into some special team they
got<00:01:35.100> him<00:01:35.250> early<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.790> they<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:35.939> get<00:01:36.150> him<00:01:36.299> into

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
got him early so they can get him into

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.719 
got him early so they can get him into
some<00:01:36.659> offseason<00:01:37.320> workouts<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.400> what<00:01:38.549> type

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
some offseason workouts to see what type

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.219 
some offseason workouts to see what type
of<00:01:38.759> shape<00:01:39.090> he's<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.360> order<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
of shape he's in order to get in the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.390 
of shape he's in order to get in the
shape<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.470> they<00:01:40.680> feel<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.979> gonna<00:01:41.100> be<00:01:41.280> an

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
shape that they feel is gonna be an

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.429 
shape that they feel is gonna be an
integral<00:01:41.670> part<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.720> Jamie<00:01:42.960> he's<00:01:43.140> somebody

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
integral part but Jamie he's somebody

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.780 
integral part but Jamie he's somebody
who<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.649> stretch<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.040> field<00:01:44.189> he<00:01:44.460> had<00:01:44.610> some

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
who can stretch the field he had some

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.980 
who can stretch the field he had some
hands<00:01:44.970> he<00:01:45.090> made<00:01:45.270> some<00:01:45.479> good<00:01:45.570> plays<00:01:45.750> in

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
hands he made some good plays in

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.960 
hands he made some good plays in
Cleveland<00:01:46.470> when<00:01:46.590> he<00:01:46.680> was<00:01:46.860> there<00:01:47.070> he's<00:01:47.759> had

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
Cleveland when he was there he's had

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.789 
Cleveland when he was there he's had
some<00:01:48.180> up<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.540> downs<00:01:48.720> during<00:01:48.990> his<00:01:49.200> career<00:01:49.409> but

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
some up and downs during his career but

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.950 
some up and downs during his career but
he's<00:01:49.920> somebody<00:01:50.280> who<00:01:50.369> might

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
he's somebody who might

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.230 
he's somebody who might
as<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.440> piece<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.340> that<00:01:52.370> receiving<00:01:52.790> part<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.180> I

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
as a piece to that receiving part and I

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.090 
as a piece to that receiving part and I
think<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.659> key<00:01:53.869> here<00:01:53.900> is<00:01:54.260> that<00:01:54.409> what<00:01:54.830> he<00:01:54.950> does

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
think the key here is that what he does

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.280 
think the key here is that what he does
is<00:01:55.369> he<00:01:55.400> gives<00:01:55.760> them<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.060> guy<00:01:56.210> who<00:01:56.270> can<00:01:56.750> stretch

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
is he gives them the guy who can stretch

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.620 
is he gives them the guy who can stretch
the<00:01:57.650> field<00:01:57.830> so<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.130> makes<00:01:58.490> an<00:01:59.000> Anquan<00:01:59.600> Boldin

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
the field so that makes an Anquan Boldin

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.770 
the field so that makes an Anquan Boldin
/<00:02:00.590> possibly<00:02:01.220> brandon<00:02:01.670> marshall<00:02:02.119> equation

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
/ possibly brandon marshall equation

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.810 
/ possibly brandon marshall equation
more<00:02:03.260> palatable<00:02:03.770> because<00:02:04.159> think<00:02:04.369> about<00:02:04.430> it<00:02:04.670> I

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
more palatable because think about it I

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.850 
more palatable because think about it I
mean<00:02:05.119> you<00:02:05.659> know<00:02:05.780> Marshall<00:02:06.170> has<00:02:06.320> good<00:02:06.650> speed

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
mean you know Marshall has good speed

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.800 
mean you know Marshall has good speed
not<00:02:07.130> great<00:02:07.400> blazing<00:02:07.909> speed<00:02:08.119> like<00:02:08.390> Star<00:02:08.780> Wars

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
not great blazing speed like Star Wars

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.840 
not great blazing speed like Star Wars
so<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.440> problem<00:02:09.709> that<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:09.979> saw<00:02:10.220> when<00:02:10.610> you

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
so the problem that you saw when you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.790 
so the problem that you saw when you
looked<00:02:10.910> at<00:02:11.209> this<00:02:11.360> Ravens<00:02:11.780> team<00:02:11.930> was<00:02:12.170> they<00:02:12.560> had

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
looked at this Ravens team was they had

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.890 
looked at this Ravens team was they had
problems<00:02:13.400> finding<00:02:13.730> guys<00:02:14.090> who<00:02:14.150> could<00:02:14.510> trust<00:02:14.750> a

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
problems finding guys who could trust a

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.420 
problems finding guys who could trust a
field<00:02:15.080> derek<00:02:15.319> mason<00:02:15.560> did<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:15.980> great<00:02:16.160> job<00:02:16.190> of

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
field derek mason did a great job of

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.920 
field derek mason did a great job of
being<00:02:16.730> kind<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.180> possession<00:02:17.510> receiver

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
being kind of that possession receiver

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.020 
being kind of that possession receiver
but<00:02:18.380> nobody<00:02:18.739> stretch<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.220> field<00:02:19.400> form<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:19.910> so

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
but nobody stretch the field form and so

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.000 
but nobody stretch the field form and so
start<00:02:20.660> by<00:02:20.780> thinking<00:02:20.840> at<00:02:21.170> least<00:02:21.350> give<00:02:21.650> them<00:02:21.800> at

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
start by thinking at least give them at

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.140 
start by thinking at least give them at
a<00:02:22.040> guy<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.550> it's<00:02:22.640> going<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.850> make<00:02:22.970> the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
a guy that it's going to make the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.360 
a guy that it's going to make the
defense<00:02:23.570> play<00:02:23.840> all<00:02:24.170> three<00:02:24.800> levels<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.250> the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
defense play all three levels of the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.590 
defense play all three levels of the
second<00:02:25.640> specially<00:02:26.030> with<00:02:26.120> lacking<00:02:26.390> with<00:02:26.480> that

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
second specially with lacking with that

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.910 
second specially with lacking with that
big<00:02:26.780> arm<00:02:26.989> they've<00:02:27.230> got<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.440> let<00:02:27.560> him<00:02:27.620> cut<00:02:27.800> it

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
big arm they've got to let him cut it

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.710 
big arm they've got to let him cut it
loose<00:02:28.040> every<00:02:28.310> now<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:29.030> knowing<00:02:29.330> they<00:02:29.480> still

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
loose every now so knowing they still

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.000

the<00:02:34.700> needs<00:02:35.030> in<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.540> defensive<00:02:35.959> backfield<00:02:35.989> uh

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
the needs in the defensive backfield uh

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.790 
the needs in the defensive backfield uh
it<00:02:38.120> just<00:02:38.180> depends<00:02:38.660> on<00:02:38.750> Ozzy's<00:02:39.230> bored<00:02:39.500> words<00:02:39.709> I

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
it just depends on Ozzy's bored words I

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.080 
it just depends on Ozzy's bored words I
think<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.070> was<00:02:40.160> going<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.459> stay<00:02:40.580> true<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:40.970> his

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
think I was going to stay true to his

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.699 
think I was going to stay true to his
board<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.810> question<00:02:42.170> becomes<00:02:42.410> if<00:02:42.560> this

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
board and the question becomes if this

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.290 
board and the question becomes if this
receiver<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.459> there<00:02:43.670> based<00:02:43.940> on<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.150> way

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
receiver that is there based on the way

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.030 
receiver that is there based on the way
he<00:02:44.330> has<00:02:44.630> players<00:02:44.959> ranked<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.560> that's<00:02:45.830> one

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
he has players ranked that that's one

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.740 
he has players ranked that that's one
thing<00:02:46.250> but<00:02:46.310> again<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.670> would<00:02:47.000> not<00:02:47.180> be<00:02:47.300> surprised

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
thing but again I would not be surprised

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.600 
thing but again I would not be surprised
because<00:02:47.900> if<00:02:48.350> you<00:02:48.680> believe<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.010> reports<00:02:49.489> that

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
because if you believe the reports that

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.360 
because if you believe the reports that
are<00:02:49.730> out<00:02:49.850> there<00:02:49.989> Anquan<00:02:50.989> Boldin<00:02:51.019> or<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:52.250> know

are out there Anquan Boldin or you know

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.949 
are out there Anquan Boldin or you know
possibly<00:02:52.610> Brandon<00:02:53.269> Marshall<00:02:53.660> could<00:02:53.840> be

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
possibly Brandon Marshall could be

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.350 
possibly Brandon Marshall could be
available<00:02:54.440> for<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.650> two<00:02:54.800> may<00:02:55.340> be<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.519> late<00:02:55.820> one<00:02:55.850> or

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
available for a two may be a late one or

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.539 
available for a two may be a late one or
something<00:02:56.720> like<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.320> know<00:02:57.590> so<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.220> mean

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
something like that you know so I mean
