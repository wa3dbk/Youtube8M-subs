purple and pink man is a shade of purple

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.500 
purple and pink man is a shade of purple
and<00:05:42.770> it<00:05:42.860> over<00:05:43.280> time<00:05:43.550> from<00:05:43.820> the<00:05:43.970> beginning<00:05:44.090> it's

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
and it over time from the beginning it's

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.080 
and it over time from the beginning it's
pink<00:05:44.870> going<00:05:45.410> on<00:05:45.620> to<00:05:45.770> a<00:05:45.800> really<00:05:46.190> dark<00:05:46.460> purple<00:05:46.760> at

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
the end for me it seems logical because

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.570 
the end for me it seems logical because
Scott<00:05:50.720> has<00:05:50.930> a<00:05:50.960> represented<00:05:51.800> pink<00:05:52.039> man<00:05:52.250> again

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.640 
personally think that pink man is purple
and<00:06:06.580> he<00:06:07.580> was<00:06:07.940> the<00:06:08.120> guy<00:06:08.300> who<00:06:08.870> killed<00:06:09.169> the<00:06:09.350> kids

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
and he was the guy who killed the kids

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.770 
and he was the guy who killed the kids
which<00:06:10.250> is<00:06:10.280> why<00:06:10.520> the<00:06:10.580> kids<00:06:10.910> wanted<00:06:11.210> revenge<00:06:11.360> on
