how we reporting live I'm a TV reporter
by<00:01:48.119> career<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.189> can't<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.670> go<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
by career and I can't really go on the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.480 
by career and I can't really go on the
air<00:01:51.240> right<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.990> return<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.439> my<00:01:52.470> field<00:01:52.590> with

air right now to return to my field with

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.149 
air right now to return to my field with
all<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.880> fat<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.780> double<00:01:55.740> triple

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
all this fat it's like double triple

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.630 
all this fat it's like double triple
chin<00:01:56.549> here<00:01:57.500> so<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.530> think<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.340> would<00:01:59.520> be
