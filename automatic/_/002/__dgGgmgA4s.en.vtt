the hi-hat dynamics dynamics refers to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.770 
the hi-hat dynamics dynamics refers to
how<00:01:04.129> loudly<00:01:04.400> or<00:01:04.670> softly<00:01:04.699> you<00:01:05.210> play<00:01:05.420> something

and<00:01:06.110> in<00:01:06.560> this<00:01:06.710> case<00:01:06.920> we're<00:01:07.070> gonna<00:01:07.190> be<00:01:07.340> adding

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
and in this case we're gonna be adding

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.240 
and in this case we're gonna be adding
some<00:01:07.610> accents<00:01:08.270> number<00:01:08.900> one<00:01:09.140> accents<00:01:09.890> every

other<00:01:10.370> stroke<00:01:12.790> this<00:01:13.790> is<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.120> most<00:01:14.270> common

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
other stroke this is the most common

dynamic<00:01:15.620> pattern<00:01:16.100> for<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.550> hi-hat<00:01:16.940> but<00:01:17.180> there

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
dynamic pattern for the hi-hat but there

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.360 
dynamic pattern for the hi-hat but there
are<00:01:17.870> a<00:01:17.900> couple<00:01:18.260> techniques<00:01:18.770> that<00:01:18.920> you<00:01:19.010> can<00:01:19.160> use

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
are a couple techniques that you can use

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.700 
are a couple techniques that you can use
to<00:01:19.520> do<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:19.850> you<00:01:20.000> can<00:01:20.150> hit<00:01:20.270> it<00:01:20.360> hard<00:01:20.630> using<00:01:21.470> the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
to do that you can hit it hard using the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.530 
to do that you can hit it hard using the
tip<00:01:21.920> of<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.100> stick<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.550> then<00:01:22.910> light<00:01:24.820> or<00:01:25.820> a<00:01:26.360> lot

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
tip of the stick and then light or a lot

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.880 
tip of the stick and then light or a lot
of<00:01:26.570> people<00:01:26.720> choose<00:01:26.900> to<00:01:27.380> actually<00:01:27.650> use<00:01:27.740> the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
of people choose to actually use the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.220 
of people choose to actually use the
shoulder<00:01:28.280> of<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.490> stick<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.060> hit<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.840> edge

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
shoulder of the stick and hit the edge

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.040 
shoulder of the stick and hit the edge
of<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.040> high-hat<00:01:31.400> cymbal<00:01:31.570> so<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:32.660> got<00:01:32.810> one

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
of the high-hat cymbal so you got one

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.510 
of the high-hat cymbal so you got one
and<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:33.740> then<00:01:33.980> the<00:01:34.100> tip<00:01:34.250> one<00:01:36.010> shoulder<00:01:37.010> tip

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
and and then the tip one shoulder tip

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.800 
and and then the tip one shoulder tip
shoulder<00:01:38.240> tip<00:01:39.670> I'll<00:01:40.670> play<00:01:40.940> number<00:01:41.210> one<00:01:41.570> with

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
shoulder tip I'll play number one with

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.550 
shoulder tip I'll play number one with
the<00:01:41.930> accents<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:46.840> now<00:01:47.840> I'll<00:01:48.020> play<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.320> without

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
the accents and now I'll play it without

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.900 
the accents and now I'll play it without
the<00:01:48.770> accents<00:01:49.220> just<00:01:49.400> so<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:49.550> can<00:01:49.670> hear<00:01:49.820> the

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
the accents just so you can hear the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:02:00.580 
the accents just so you can hear the
difference<00:01:58.960> so<00:01:59.960> it's<00:02:00.080> important<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.410> realize

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
difference so it's important to realize

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.950 
difference so it's important to realize
that<00:02:00.950> those<00:02:01.130> accents<00:02:01.820> are<00:02:02.060> creating<00:02:02.570> another

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
that those accents are creating another

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.720 
that those accents are creating another
layer<00:02:03.260> to<00:02:03.470> your<00:02:03.500> groove<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.130> in<00:02:04.370> this<00:02:04.490> case

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
layer to your groove and in this case

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.990 
layer to your groove and in this case
it's<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:05.060> quarter<00:02:05.390> note<00:02:05.510> pulse<00:02:05.710> two<00:02:06.710> three<00:02:06.970> four

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
it's a quarter note pulse two three four

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.759 
it's a quarter note pulse two three four
it<00:02:08.509> makes<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.840> groove<00:02:09.019> feel<00:02:09.259> different

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
it makes the groove feel different

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.890 
it makes the groove feel different
number<00:02:10.369> two<00:02:10.519> adds<00:02:10.789> an<00:02:10.940> accent<00:02:11.300> after<00:02:11.599> a<00:02:11.629> beats

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
number two adds an accent after a beats

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:24.310 
number two adds an accent after a beats
two<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.379> four<00:02:12.500> I'll<00:02:13.340> play<00:02:13.490> that<00:02:13.610> for<00:02:13.820> you<00:02:23.320> so

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
two and four I'll play that for you so

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.110 
two and four I'll play that for you so
in<00:02:24.470> this<00:02:24.590> case<00:02:24.830> we<00:02:25.010> don't<00:02:25.130> have<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.430> pulse<00:02:25.880> of

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
in this case we don't have that pulse of

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.760 
in this case we don't have that pulse of
the<00:02:26.210> one-two-three-four<00:02:27.200> but<00:02:27.410> we've<00:02:27.530> gotten

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
the one-two-three-four but we've gotten

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.120 
the one-two-three-four but we've gotten
an<00:02:27.860> additional<00:02:28.520> off<00:02:29.000> stroke<00:02:29.690> on<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.930> N<00:02:30.050> 1<00:02:30.440> &amp;<00:02:30.650> 2

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
an additional off stroke on the N 1 &amp; 2

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.490 
an additional off stroke on the N 1 &amp; 2
n<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.900> makes<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.170> groove<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.470> little

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
n so it makes the groove a little

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.950 
n so it makes the groove a little
lighter<00:02:36.920> number<00:02:37.460> 3<00:02:37.700> school<00:02:37.970> because<00:02:38.300> the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
lighter number 3 school because the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.390 
lighter number 3 school because the
rhythm<00:02:39.290> there<00:02:39.440> 1<00:02:39.590> &amp;<00:02:39.830> 2<00:02:40.130> &amp;<00:02:40.370> 3<00:02:40.400> &amp;<00:02:40.940> 4<00:02:41.030> &amp;<00:02:41.660> 1<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:43.310> you've

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
rhythm there 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 so you've

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.140 
rhythm there 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 so you've
got<00:02:43.580> this<00:02:43.760> rhythm<00:02:44.240> playing<00:02:44.720> over<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.940> main

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
got this rhythm playing over the main

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:58.960 
got this rhythm playing over the main
groove<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:58.160> there's<00:02:58.340> where<00:02:58.490> that<00:02:58.550> layering

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
groove so there's where that layering

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.790 
groove so there's where that layering
really<00:02:59.690> becomes<00:02:59.990> apparent<00:03:00.290> you've<00:03:00.590> got<00:03:00.680> these

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
really becomes apparent you've got these

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.830 
really becomes apparent you've got these
two<00:03:01.010> groups<00:03:01.250> going<00:03:01.670> on<00:03:01.790> now<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.330> sounds<00:03:02.480> cool

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
two groups going on now it sounds cool

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.690 
two groups going on now it sounds cool
but<00:03:03.020> obviously<00:03:03.350> it's<00:03:03.530> not<00:03:03.590> gonna<00:03:03.770> fit<00:03:04.100> every

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
but obviously it's not gonna fit every

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.400 
but obviously it's not gonna fit every
situation<00:03:05.360> so<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:05.780> want<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.110> do<00:03:06.200> these<00:03:06.350> things

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
situation so you want to do these things

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.470 
situation so you want to do these things
with<00:03:06.680> discretion<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.580> really<00:03:08.330> pay<00:03:08.450> attention

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
with discretion and really pay attention

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.210 
with discretion and really pay attention
to<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.050> feel<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.380> it<00:03:09.709> brings<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:10.100> your

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
to the feel that it brings to your

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.860 
to the feel that it brings to your
groove<00:03:10.430> number<00:03:10.910> four<00:03:11.060> we've<00:03:11.180> got<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.450> accents

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
groove number four we've got the accents

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:22.960 
groove number four we've got the accents
on<00:03:11.959> -<00:03:12.200> 2<00:03:12.890> +<00:03:13.130> +<00:03:13.430> 4<00:03:13.970> in

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.230 

I<00:03:26.530> never<00:03:27.530> liked<00:03:27.740> to<00:03:27.770> just<00:03:28.040> stick<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.000> sheet

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
I never liked to just stick to the sheet

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.080 
I never liked to just stick to the sheet
here<00:03:29.480> so<00:03:29.510> a<00:03:30.410> fun<00:03:31.280> thing<00:03:31.490> that<00:03:31.730> I<00:03:31.760> did<00:03:31.970> while

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
here so a fun thing that I did while

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.030 
here so a fun thing that I did while
practicing<00:03:32.630> this<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:33.050> a<00:03:33.110> repeated<00:03:33.860> beats

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
practicing this is a repeated beats

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.520 
practicing this is a repeated beats
three<00:03:34.460> and<00:03:34.490> four<00:03:35.150> as<00:03:35.390> a<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.780> measure<00:03:35.990> repeating

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
three and four as a to measure repeating

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.500 
three and four as a to measure repeating
pattern<00:03:37.100> so<00:03:37.550> you<00:03:37.580> end<00:03:37.760> up<00:03:37.820> with<00:03:37.880> this<00:03:38.180> so<00:03:38.390> it'll

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
pattern so you end up with this so it'll

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:50.740 
pattern so you end up with this so it'll
be<00:03:38.630> three<00:03:38.900> four<00:03:39.320> then<00:03:39.680> three<00:03:39.920> then<00:03:39.950> four<00:03:49.750> the

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
be three four then three then four the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.690 
be three four then three then four the
title<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.260> sheet<00:03:51.470> is<00:03:51.650> subtle<00:03:52.160> hi-hat

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
title of the sheet is subtle hi-hat

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.910 
title of the sheet is subtle hi-hat
dynamics<00:03:53.300> because<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.080> hi-hat<00:03:54.440> doesn't

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
dynamics because the the hi-hat doesn't

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.580 
dynamics because the the hi-hat doesn't
really<00:03:55.250> stand<00:03:55.610> out<00:03:55.790> that<00:03:55.850> much<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:57.170> can<00:03:57.350> hear

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
really stand out that much you can hear

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.800 
really stand out that much you can hear
it<00:03:57.740> so<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.040> adds<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.520> feel<00:03:58.760> if<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.510> really

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
it so it adds to the feel if you really

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.960 
it so it adds to the feel if you really
want<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.020> make<00:04:00.140> these<00:04:00.320> accents<00:04:00.920> a<00:04:01.130> dramatic

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
want to make these accents a dramatic

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.910 
want to make these accents a dramatic
difference<00:04:02.150> you<00:04:02.900> can<00:04:03.080> move<00:04:03.230> all<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.500> accents

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
difference you can move all the accents

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.890 
difference you can move all the accents
to<00:04:04.070> say<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.400> low<00:04:04.790> Tom<00:04:05.060> and<00:04:05.330> that<00:04:05.540> creates<00:04:05.840> a

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
to say the low Tom and that creates a

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.810 
to say the low Tom and that creates a
cool<00:04:06.080> groove<00:04:06.380> so<00:04:06.950> I'll<00:04:07.070> do<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.310> numbers<00:04:07.550> three

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
cool groove so I'll do the numbers three

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.050 
cool groove so I'll do the numbers three
and<00:04:08.030> four<00:04:08.450> both<00:04:09.200> repeating<00:04:09.670> using<00:04:10.670> all<00:04:10.880> the

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
and four both repeating using all the

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:23.110 
and four both repeating using all the
accents<00:04:11.630> using<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.410> low<00:04:12.620> Tom<00:04:21.669> now<00:04:22.669> that<00:04:22.880> keeps

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
accents using the low Tom now that keeps

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.850 
accents using the low Tom now that keeps
it<00:04:23.270> rhythmic<00:04:23.780> when<00:04:23.870> you<00:04:23.960> keep<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.200> on<00:04:24.290> one<00:04:24.530> Tom

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
it rhythmic when you keep it on one Tom

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.680 
it rhythmic when you keep it on one Tom
when<00:04:25.520> you<00:04:25.640> start<00:04:25.880> moving<00:04:25.970> things<00:04:26.360> to<00:04:26.510> other

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
when you start moving things to other

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.080 
when you start moving things to other
times<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:27.470> create<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:27.800> melodic<00:04:28.340> layer<00:04:28.550> so<00:04:28.970> I'll

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
times you create a melodic layer so I'll

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.210 
times you create a melodic layer so I'll
