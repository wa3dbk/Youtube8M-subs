00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
what you guys think what other sets are

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.429 
what you guys think what other sets are
they<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.060> make<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.450> feel<00:01:27.960> like<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.320> is

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
they going to make I feel like this is

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.990 
they going to make I feel like this is
not<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.829> be<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> only<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.909> of

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
not going to be the only one and of

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.880 
not going to be the only one and of
course<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.780> make<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.049> Batmobile<00:01:31.530> but

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
course I have to make the Batmobile but

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.859 
course I have to make the Batmobile but
are<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.820> guys<00:01:32.970> too<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.390> probably<00:01:33.720> gonna

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
are you guys too it's probably gonna

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.510 
are you guys too it's probably gonna
have<00:01:33.960> more<00:01:34.200> minifigures<00:01:34.799> i'm<00:01:35.009> guessing

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
have more minifigures i'm guessing

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.940 
have more minifigures i'm guessing
because<00:01:35.939> usually<00:01:36.240> $30<00:01:36.990> sets<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.590> more<00:01:37.829> than

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
because usually $30 sets have more than

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.630 
because usually $30 sets have more than
one<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.960> i'm<00:01:39.960> guessing<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.560> will<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.130> we'll

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
one so i'm guessing it will so we'll

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.700 
one so i'm guessing it will so we'll
have<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.119> wait<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.659> seed<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.380> what<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.649> you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
have to just wait in seed so what do you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.410 
have to just wait in seed so what do you
guys<00:01:43.799> think<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.189> first<00:01:44.520> look<00:01:44.850> make<00:01:45.390> sure

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
guys think of this first look make sure
