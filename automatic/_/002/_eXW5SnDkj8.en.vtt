00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 often criticized due to the similarity of design 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.720
 but the company releases huge 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.210
 number of models and make each of 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.670
 They are a uniquely difficult task 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.160
 maybe not quite necessary but what 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.199
 choice of model with two sim cards unpretentious 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.449
 devices are giant smartphones and 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.609
 unkillable protected device 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.310
 recently appeared and a new subspecies 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.609
 mini flagships firstborn of this category 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.000
 was released in 2012 and was called galaxy s3 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.400
 mini 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.349

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.050
 for the flagship four samsung 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.940
 released and named version s4 mini with 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.829
 support for two sim cards that 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.140
 inherited a miniature novelty from 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.140
 older model we will try to find out 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.210
 s4 mini design is familiar compact and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.820
 pretty body looks good 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.460
 Of course, very similar to galaxy s4 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.270
 but smaller body material 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.219
 plastic 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.649
 perimeter edging done under 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.780
 metal but also plastic everywhere 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.760
 gloss therefore smartphone brand and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.690
 slippery although in the hand while lying 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.210
 very comfortably 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.820
 the display is covered with protective glass but not 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.320
 as reliable as the gorilla's voice on the left 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.380
 faces placed rocker adjustment

 volume off lock button 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.229
 right on the bottom of the microusb connector and 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.509
 microphone and top standard port for 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.299
 headphone optional microphone for 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.020
 noise reduction and infrared port under 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.450
 battery 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.509
 there are slots for micro sim and card 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.490
 micro sd memory connector for 2 cards 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.740
 located close but closed 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.840
 battery so hot swap 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.840
 possible only for the first sim card 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.590
 naturally reduced dimensions 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.360
 affected and on the size of the display built 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.850
 it is typical for top models 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.560
 matrix super amoled but also diagonal 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.370
 is 43 inches 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.440
 and the resolution is 960 by 540 pixels that 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.930
 far from the flagship values 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.150
 less the display is clear a 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.280
 the color range is too saturated 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.170
 benefit mute color is easy 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.390
 provided in the screen settings 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.240
 corresponding item screen mode 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.520
 display brightness margin is good for 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.410
 the room is running low enough for 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.130
 bright sun picture almost 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.830
 fades away 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.900
 and at night reading from the smartphone will not be 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.780
 too tired to eat 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.430
 automatic and manual adjustment 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.770
 version name did not get many 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.810
 there are no flagship abilities 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.240
 Parts of smart functions and multi-window 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.850

 connections can now be arranged as 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.530
 tables which is much more convenient than searching

 the desired item in the settings set and 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.209

 each type of message call communication 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.170
 and data transfer, you can specify a SIM card by 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.870
 default or select each 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.780
 circulation with on 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.659
 but also fun and big galaxy s4 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.250
 Still inside s4 mini works based 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.730
 dual core qualcomm processor 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.580
 snapdragon 400 frequency 1 of 7 gigahertz 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.430
 the picture is complemented by one and a half gigabytes of RAM 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.500
 and 8 gigabytes of internal memory for 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.599
 dual-sim smartphone this configuration 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.730
 may well be optimal but 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.409
 compare with the flagship of course not worth it 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.239
 in a variety of tests 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.680
 smartphone performance got 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.409
 pretty good grades 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.140
 1900 milliampere battery 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:15.920
 lasts more than two days not too 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.920
 active work 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.780
 smartphone is equipped with two cameras 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.000
 frontal has permissions 1 and 9 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.949
 megapixel serves for video calling and 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.320
 nothing special stands out 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.330
 the main 8 megapixel camera is much 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.470
 more interesting it allows you to record 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.240
 full hd video 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:41.490
 and the maximum resolution of images 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.680
 is 3264 by 2448 pixels 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.080
 I liked a lot of shooting modes 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.190
 photo with sound recording 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.470
 effects 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.220
 as well as great shots at natural 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.250
 illuminated 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.690
 though the sensor didn't always work perfectly 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.599
 autofocus sometimes missed or 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.700
 thought nevertheless s4 mini with 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:02.000
 easily replace the owner amateur 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.000
 the camera 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.490
 samsung galaxy s4 mini in many ways 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.680
 different from the older model with a little 4 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.870
 weaker with a smaller diagonal but at the same 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.120
 time with the same excellent display at the base 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.220
 the matrix is ​​super amoled compact and 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.690
 productive modern machine for 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.880
 those who prefer 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.880
 huge flagship small smartphones
