kill<00:01:36.499> it<00:01:36.649> you<00:01:37.130> only<00:01:37.340> kill<00:01:37.670> mines<00:01:37.939> in<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.240> belt

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
kill it you only kill mines in the belt

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.249 
kill it you only kill mines in the belt
then<00:01:39.200> BAM<00:01:39.499> you<00:01:40.039> got<00:01:40.219> the<00:01:40.369> achievement

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
then BAM you got the achievement

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.629 
then BAM you got the achievement
obviously<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:42.529> is<00:01:42.679> a<00:01:42.709> little<00:01:42.919> easier<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.490> do

00:01:43.629 --> 00:01:43.639 
obviously this is a little easier to do

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:45.429 
obviously this is a little easier to do
on<00:01:43.819> flex<00:01:44.090> mode<00:01:44.329> than<00:01:44.539> heroic<00:01:44.689> when

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
on flex mode than heroic when

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.159 
on flex mode than heroic when
considering<00:01:45.859> your<00:01:45.979> strategy<00:01:46.520> but<00:01:47.329> just<00:01:48.020> have

considering your strategy but just have

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:49.749 
considering your strategy but just have
to<00:01:48.289> get<00:01:48.439> your<00:01:48.619> raid<00:01:48.829> used<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.279> seeing<00:01:49.520> some

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759

a<00:04:06.170> single<00:04:06.620> iron<00:04:06.860> star<00:04:07.190> I'll<00:04:08.180> explain<00:04:08.630> the

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
a single iron star I'll explain the

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.539 
a single iron star I'll explain the
method<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:09.290> this<00:04:09.410> achievement<00:04:09.590> in<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.100> second

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
method of this achievement in a second

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.319 
method of this achievement in a second
but<00:04:11.269> realize<00:04:11.690> is<00:04:12.070> extremely<00:04:13.070> bugged<00:04:13.340> it's

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
but realize is extremely bugged it's

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.090 
but realize is extremely bugged it's
possible<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:15.110> if<00:04:15.230> you've<00:04:15.380> killed<00:04:15.620> Garrosh

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
possible that if you've killed Garrosh

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.699 
possible that if you've killed Garrosh
from<00:04:16.310> any<00:04:16.549> difficulty<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:17.840> may<00:04:17.870> already<00:04:18.320> have

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
from any difficulty you may already have

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.699 
from any difficulty you may already have
this<00:04:18.919> one<00:04:18.979> it<00:04:19.940> was<00:04:20.120> even<00:04:20.479> possible<00:04:20.930> in<00:04:21.049> LFR<00:04:21.530> to

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
this one it was even possible in LFR to

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.580 
this one it was even possible in LFR to
get<00:04:21.890> this<00:04:22.099> until<00:04:22.490> they<00:04:22.640> hot<00:04:22.849> fixed<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:23.590> but

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
get this until they hot fixed that but

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.230 
get this until they hot fixed that but
anyway<00:04:24.919> let's<00:04:25.370> talk<00:04:25.550> about<00:04:25.700> what<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.120> are

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
anyway let's talk about what you are

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.610 
anyway let's talk about what you are
supposed<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.660> do<00:04:26.900> regard

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
supposed to do regard

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.400 
supposed to do regard
of<00:04:27.860> bugs<00:04:28.389> so<00:04:29.389> in<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.600> first<00:04:29.750> space<00:04:30.020> of<00:04:30.290> the

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
of bugs so in the first space of the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.020 
garage encounter to siege engineers pop
out<00:04:33.110> on<00:04:33.320> either<00:04:33.590> side<00:04:33.919> of<00:04:33.949> the<00:04:34.130> room<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:34.490> start

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
out on either side of the room and start

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.360 
out on either side of the room and start
energizing<00:04:35.690> iron<00:04:35.960> stars<00:04:36.260> if<00:04:36.530> they<00:04:37.280> are

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
energizing iron stars if they are

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.310 
energizing iron stars if they are
allowed<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.669> finish<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.540> iron<00:04:38.720> star<00:04:39.050> rolls

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
allowed to finish the iron star rolls

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.439 
allowed to finish the iron star rolls
across<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.710> room<00:04:40.070> destroying<00:04:40.910> everything<00:04:41.180> in

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
across the room destroying everything in

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:42.240 
across the room destroying everything in
its<00:04:41.600> path

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
its path

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.320 
its path
usually<00:04:43.250> groups<00:04:43.520> will<00:04:43.729> kill<00:04:43.910> one<00:04:44.120> of<00:04:44.180> the

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
usually groups will kill one of the

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.600 
usually groups will kill one of the
engineers<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:45.080> then<00:04:45.590> let<00:04:45.770> one<00:04:46.010> iron<00:04:46.250> star

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
engineers and then let one iron star

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.689 
engineers and then let one iron star
roll<00:04:47.000> across<00:04:47.300> half<00:04:47.660> the<00:04:47.690> room<00:04:48.310> now<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.370> trick

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
roll across half the room now the trick

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.490 
roll across half the room now the trick
is<00:04:49.729> to<00:04:49.910> get<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.389> packs<00:04:50.630> of<00:04:50.810> cork<00:04:51.080> on<00:04:51.199> warp

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
is to get the packs of cork on warp

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.890 
is to get the packs of cork on warp
ringers<00:04:51.830> that<00:04:52.040> spawn<00:04:52.310> into<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.300> path<00:04:53.510> of<00:04:53.780> the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
ringers that spawn into the path of the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.129 
ringers that spawn into the path of the
iron<00:04:54.080> star<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:54.680> have<00:04:55.220> them<00:04:55.430> die<00:04:55.639> to<00:04:55.699> it<00:04:56.139> first

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
iron star and have them die to it first

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.020 
iron star and have them die to it first
off<00:04:57.410> you'll<00:04:57.860> need<00:04:58.040> to<00:04:58.220> get<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.370> war<00:04:58.639> bringers

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
off you'll need to get the war bringers

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.180 
off you'll need to get the war bringers
to<00:04:59.240> about<00:04:59.510> half<00:04:59.840> health<00:05:00.169> for<00:05:00.620> them<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:00.919> die<00:05:01.130> to

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
to about half health for them to die to

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.640 
to about half health for them to die to
the<00:05:01.520> iron<00:05:01.699> star<00:05:02.060> so<00:05:02.900> make<00:05:03.080> sure<00:05:03.110> you<00:05:03.440> don't

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
the iron star so make sure you don't

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.010 
the iron star so make sure you don't
slaughter<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:04.190> ads<00:05:04.370> too<00:05:04.639> quickly<00:05:04.880> as<00:05:05.210> often

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
slaughter the ads too quickly as often

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.990 
slaughter the ads too quickly as often
happens<00:05:06.380> these<00:05:06.620> days<00:05:06.860> with<00:05:07.130> all<00:05:07.160> our<00:05:07.639> fancy

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
happens these days with all our fancy

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.960 
happens these days with all our fancy
gear<00:05:08.350> then<00:05:09.350> position<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:09.949> ads<00:05:10.160> close<00:05:10.699> to<00:05:10.880> the

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
gear then position the ads close to the
