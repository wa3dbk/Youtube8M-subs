00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.550 
then in second place and of course
they're<00:05:33.660> in<00:05:33.870> third<00:05:34.139> place

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
they're in third place

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.870 
they're in third place
it's<00:05:34.950> Jarvis<00:05:35.730> and<00:05:36.210> that<00:05:37.200> was<00:05:37.500> an<00:05:38.070> epic<00:05:38.430> race

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
it's Jarvis and that was an epic race

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.909 
it's Jarvis and that was an epic race
towards<00:05:39.450> the<00:05:39.570> end<00:05:39.720> very<00:05:39.960> close<00:05:40.290> between<00:05:40.560> those

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
towards the end very close between those

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.760 
towards the end very close between those
first<00:05:41.250> three<00:05:41.610> we<00:05:42.210> saw<00:05:42.480> the<00:05:42.540> lightning<00:05:42.870> we<00:05:43.650> was

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
first three we saw the lightning we was

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.680 
first three we saw the lightning we was
wondering<00:05:44.460> we<00:05:44.760> was<00:05:44.850> wondering<00:05:45.300> if<00:05:45.360> there's<00:05:45.570> an

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
wondering we was wondering if there's an

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.440 
wondering we was wondering if there's an
opportunity<00:05:45.930> for<00:05:46.620> my<00:05:47.100> later<00:05:47.310> close-up<00:05:47.850> but

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
opportunity for my later close-up but

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.330 
opportunity for my later close-up but
unfortunately<00:05:49.290> it<00:05:49.350> wasn't<00:05:49.530> possible<00:05:49.830> in<00:05:50.220> the

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
unfortunately it wasn't possible in the

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.370 
unfortunately it wasn't possible in the
end<00:05:50.490> for<00:05:51.150> their<00:05:51.300> close<00:05:51.540> between<00:05:51.750> those<00:05:52.080> first

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
end for their close between those first

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.970 
end for their close between those first
few<00:05:53.300> certainly<00:05:54.300> Jarvis<00:05:55.080> had<00:05:55.260> track<00:05:55.500> position

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
few certainly Jarvis had track position

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.020 
few certainly Jarvis had track position
for<00:05:56.130> much<00:05:56.280> of<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.520> race

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
for much of the race

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.450 
for much of the race
Ethan<00:05:57.540> was<00:05:57.690> always<00:05:57.990> close<00:05:58.260> behind<00:05:58.500> Ben<00:05:59.070> had<00:05:59.340> to

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
Ethan was always close behind Ben had to

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.610 
Ethan was always close behind Ben had to
come<00:05:59.639> from<00:05:59.790> a<00:05:59.910> way<00:06:00.060> back<00:06:00.330> but<00:06:00.900> ultimately<00:06:01.410> in

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
come from a way back but ultimately in

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.560 
come from a way back but ultimately in
the<00:06:01.740> end<00:06:01.770> it<00:06:02.280> all<00:06:02.490> came<00:06:02.730> together<00:06:02.910> for<00:06:03.270> Ethan

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
the end it all came together for Ethan

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.210 
the end it all came together for Ethan
on<00:06:03.660> those<00:06:03.810> final<00:06:04.080> few<00:06:04.200> corners<00:06:04.740> he<00:06:04.890> held<00:06:05.100> it

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
on those final few corners he held it

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.310 
on those final few corners he held it
together<00:06:05.370> and<00:06:05.850> Jarvis<00:06:06.419> wasn't<00:06:06.840> able<00:06:06.930> to<00:06:07.110> close

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
together and Jarvis wasn't able to close

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.880 
together and Jarvis wasn't able to close
that<00:06:07.560> gap<00:06:07.800> been<00:06:08.130> sneaking<00:06:08.700> in<00:06:08.850> there<00:06:09.090> to

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
that gap been sneaking in there to

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.230 
that gap been sneaking in there to
second<00:06:10.890> place<00:06:11.160> as<00:06:11.370> we<00:06:11.520> look<00:06:11.730> at<00:06:11.850> some<00:06:12.030> of<00:06:12.060> the

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
second place as we look at some of the

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.650 
second place as we look at some of the
replays<00:06:12.690> as<00:06:13.530> well<00:06:13.980> so<00:06:14.550> certainly<00:06:15.060> a<00:06:15.090> close

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
replays as well so certainly a close

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.450 
replays as well so certainly a close
battle<00:06:15.960> but<00:06:16.560> that's<00:06:16.680> it<00:06:16.830> from<00:06:17.010> me<00:06:17.190> for<00:06:17.220> now

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.130 
battle but that's it from me for now
