big<00:03:15.280> but<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.870> proportion<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.620> very<00:03:17.860> important

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
big but the proportion is very important

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.850 
big but the proportion is very important
and<00:03:18.579> I<00:03:18.670> think<00:03:18.940> it's<00:03:19.299> a<00:03:19.420> blessing<00:03:19.570> it's<00:03:20.320> genetic

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
and I think it's a blessing it's genetic

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.569 
and I think it's a blessing it's genetic
as<00:03:20.980> well<00:03:21.519> so<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.299> got<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.019> symmetry<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:23.950> I<00:03:24.220> carry

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
as well so I got the symmetry so I carry

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.509 
as well so I got the symmetry so I carry
it<00:03:24.760> pretty<00:03:25.329> well<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:26.380> girls<00:03:26.829> getting<00:03:27.070> bigger

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
it pretty well the girls getting bigger

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.949 
it pretty well the girls getting bigger
and<00:03:27.910> bigger<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.590> bigger<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.959> that's

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
and bigger and you and bigger and that's

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.620 
and bigger and you and bigger and that's
why<00:03:32.290> I<00:03:32.320> had<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.739> put<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.220> size<00:03:33.489> back<00:03:33.850> because

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
why I had to put the size back because

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.420 
why I had to put the size back because
that's<00:03:35.530> not<00:03:35.739> what<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:36.430> wanted<00:03:37.410> no<00:03:38.410> offend<00:03:38.920> with
