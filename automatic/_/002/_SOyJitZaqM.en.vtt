different this is a fun little thing put
in<00:00:20.550> by<00:00:20.670> Activision<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.539> basically<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.020> just

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
in by Activision so basically you just

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.779 
in by Activision so basically you just
have<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.410> shoot<00:00:22.619> up<00:00:22.769> all<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> heads<00:00:23.310> now<00:00:23.760> I

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
have to shoot up all the heads now I

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.310

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.349 
thought you had to shoot off these ones
outside<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> map<00:00:26.189> apparently<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.210> not

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
outside of the map apparently you do not

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.759 
outside of the map apparently you do not
need<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:27.750> those<00:00:27.930> kind<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.289> ones<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.650> are

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.650 
need to do those kind of ones that are
like<00:00:29.010> way<00:00:29.490> outside<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.029> map<00:00:30.150> I'll<00:00:30.420> show

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
like way outside of the map I'll show

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.060 
like way outside of the map I'll show
you<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.990> second<00:00:31.320> though<00:00:31.380> there<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.740> ones

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070
