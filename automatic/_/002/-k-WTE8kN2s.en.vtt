00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:15.629
 hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:18.019
 fitness blitz i'm alexey pisarevsky and our 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.160
 Good old friend Viktor Ilyin 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.550
 today we continue to talk about 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.660
 slopes and today we will show you 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.810
 analyze the slopes of anderson was such 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.410
 well-known weightlifter he is a lifter 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.380
 even the founder of powerlifting 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.290
 man legend field anderson at 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.240
 his own weight of 180 kilograms he 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.180
 squat 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.310
 if memory serves about 500 20 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.000
 kilogram and from doing without barefoot 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:56.370
 without any tempering squeezed 280 kilograms 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.330
 and about 380 kilograms of this 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.230
 information about what's already instead of those books 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.650
 just a wonderful person 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.460
 human legend believer who 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.640
 urged people of some kind of morality they are so 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.890
 how most bloggers swear and 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.770
 sypyat spheres of conditions and so come back 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.590
 to the slopes the slopes of anderson in what 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.120
 Unlike usual slopes from bullets 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.610
 Anderson was one such wonderful 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.460
 technique he raised huge weights 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.470
 but we do it gradually, that is, at the beginning 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.960
 did the same slopes either 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.390
 quarter squat squats 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.130
 then I reduced a little later 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.260
 slightly I reduced slightly reduced 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.970
 if you dig on the internet you will find 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.040
 many photos 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.610
 he has been digging a hole for himself 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.260
 how much he needs centimeters 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.260
 tied huge barrels 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.780
 the vulture here and squatted to touch these 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.880
 barrels but you will find it yourself 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.270
 it became interesting information about him just 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.070
 man of legend and inheritance left us 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.890
 these amazing exercise 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.960
 anderson traction anders squat and 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.899
 Anderson's slope but today it will go 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.440
 about them for this we need a power frame in 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.160
 ideally 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.160
 not like this, ideally like that 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:25.190
 Here we have the distance between 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.080
 the holes were smaller 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.910
 all the better 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.910
 so the slopes 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.060
 Anders tilts are best performed in the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.320
 the manner in which you perform 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.160
 squats if you squat 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.780
 classical manner that is, there you are 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.820
 high can mean tilt do 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.720
 this way if you crouch 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.940
 bookmarking means tilting in this way 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.580
 that is, the slope and this is your help in 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.780
 squats will depend on them 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:03.200
 how much can you sit down and so take 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:08.840
 barbell at the house for you grip as you 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:11.990
 doing squats away at the necessary 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.200
 distance by the way start exercise 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.900
 best exercise to start 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.720
 the best thing 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:25.070
 putting pins around 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.920
 the level of your solar plexus here 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.810
 and let's say this we will have a beginning 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.290
 first week of doing these slopes 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.580
 for 2 weeks we will lower below lower 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.310
 and lower again, the smaller the distance 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.940
 so much the better for you in this exercise 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:47.720
 use huge weights for this kraz 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:52.730
 safety 4 work from 3 to 6 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.620
 repetitions with this everything is clear so yourself 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.040
 the slopes of the original position took 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.200
 take a good breath this is the first phase 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.810
 our movement begins the second phase 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.470
 we take a good breath, take the pelvis back and 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:13.780
 do the tilt to touch the fingerboard 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:16.460
 safety pins well linger about 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.370
 as soon as we touched we speak the third 

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.650
 motion phase elbows slightly forward and 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:28.370
 starting to get up from the slope due 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:31.630
 backs good elbows forward and get up on 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.520
 watch back then return well 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.470
 and how would such elbows always 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:41.290
 it is we come again ceases all 3 phases 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:49.240
 and the fourth phase we return the barbell to 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:50.950
 racks and so friends weight is huge but 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.390
 again ask your partner to 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.850
 watched whether you bend it 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:58.150
 loin because if the loin bends 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.550
 in this exercise it is wrong it 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.410
 traumatic it is fatal in general 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.670
 loin should be arched and straight 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:09.730
 and so we will assume that you have 1 week 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:12.730
 over and the most basic on 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.240
 next week you have to do 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.470
 a little bit less height 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.770
 let's make some height a little bit 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.770
 less 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:37.960
 and do the same 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:40.360
 4 phase starting position good breath 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.360
 pelvic abduction 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.360
 learn 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.119
 [music] 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.119
 [applause] 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:06.600
 [music] 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.760
 gonna be 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.760
 after 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:23.850
 I will go. 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.850
 [music] 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.250
 so my friends 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.670
 safety 4 omitted until that moment 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.980
 and we reach this exercise until there 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.320
 out touch the safety pins 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.780
 in that position when your body becomes 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.930
 parallel to the floor then there is this 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:47.250
 put it up to about this position you 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:48.960
 must reach touch safety 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.390
 pins on this exercise with 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.600
 interest is over and come back again 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:59.270
 put a safety bar under your chest 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:02.670
 add weight and work and delight us 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.200
 trainers viewers and themselves new 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.210
 personal records in squats and 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.280
 deadbolt 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.260
 dear friends on this all you all 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.360
 kind 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.970
 eat well by the way remember that 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.250
 in the summer, muscle mass and strength grow poorly 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.900
 this is a delusion that we inspire ourselves 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.720
 yourself subscribe to our channel 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:26.510
 ask Victor about you great 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.510
 thank you for the meetings
