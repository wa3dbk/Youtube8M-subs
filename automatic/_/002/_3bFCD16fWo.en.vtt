00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
that you should be a little bit more

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.930 
that you should be a little bit more
responsible<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.410> knowing<00:03:53.160> what<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.550> like

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
responsible and knowing what it is like

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.910 
responsible and knowing what it is like
because<00:03:54.360> you<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:55.050> communicate<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.769> people

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
because you you communicate to people

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.500 
I would agree okay so now you look at
you<00:04:07.350> go<00:04:07.470> okay<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.769> departure<00:04:08.640> from<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:09.120> ideal

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
you go okay a departure from that ideal

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.130 
you go okay a departure from that ideal
scene<00:04:09.810> is<00:04:10.230> someone<00:04:10.800> taking<00:04:11.550> drugs<00:04:11.970> okay<00:04:12.900> and

scene is someone taking drugs okay and

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.810 
scene is someone taking drugs okay and

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
then you go okay what is the theory in

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.360 
then you go okay what is the theory in
the<00:04:14.910> science<00:04:15.300> behind<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.950> that<00:04:16.950> justifies

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370
