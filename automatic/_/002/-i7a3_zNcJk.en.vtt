address means that your ipv4 address

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.220 
address means that your ipv4 address
will<00:00:13.559> not<00:00:13.590> change<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.179> IP<00:00:15.480> address<00:00:16.020> that

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
will not change so the IP address that

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.310 
will not change so the IP address that
you<00:00:16.379> put<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.240> my<00:00:18.240> other<00:00:18.420> tutorial<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.170> how

you put in to my other tutorial on how
to<00:00:19.350> port<00:00:19.740> forward<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.820> will<00:00:21.119> keep<00:00:21.449> changing

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
to port forward it will keep changing

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.859 
to port forward it will keep changing
unless<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.500> make<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> static<00:00:23.070> IP<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.670> will<00:00:24.570> bTW

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
unless you make a static IP I will bTW

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.900 
unless you make a static IP I will bTW
this<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.230> very<00:00:25.619> useful<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:27.289> hosting<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.910> game
